We have recently synthesized a series of sulfur- and oxygen-substituted analogs of myristic acid that are similar in length to the 14:0 fatty acid yet have hydrophobicities equivalent to dodecanoate or decanoate. Previous in vitro enzyme assays and metabolic labeling studies indicate that some of these analogs are excellent substrates for NMT and are incorporated into subsets of cellular N-myristoyl proteins. Their sequence-specific incorporation probably arises from cooperative interactions between the acyl CoA and peptide binding sites of NMT. The human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) depend on myristoylation of gag polyprotein precursors for assembly. We have tested four analogs--12-methoxydodecanoic acid, 10-propoxydecanoic acid, 5-octyloxypentanoic acid, and 11-ethylthioundecanoic acid--for their ability to block replication of these retroviruses. All reduce HIV-1 replication when incubated with CD4+ H9 cells for 10 days at 10-100 microM. 12-Methoxydodecanoic acid is most effective, producing a concentration-dependent decrease in (i) reverse transcriptase activity (to levels that were 5-10% of control at 20-40 microM), (ii) p24 levels, and (iii) syncytia formation. This degree of inhibition of HIV-1 replication is equivalent to that seen with 5 microM 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine and is accomplished without apparent toxicity, as measured by cell viability, protein, and nucleic acid synthesis. 5-Octyloxypentanoic acid inhibits MoMLV assembly in a dose-dependent fashion without accompanying cellular toxicity, while 12-methoxydodecanoic acid has no effect. These data suggest that the use of cellular NMT activity to deliver analogs of myristate with altered physical-chemical properties to proteins that undergo this cotranslational modification may represent an effective anti-viral therapeutic strategy as well as a way to investigate the role of covalently bound fatty acid in viral assembly.","['Bryant, M L', 'Heuckeroth, R O', 'Kimata, J T', 'Ratner, L', 'Gordon, J I']","['Bryant ML', 'Heuckeroth RO', 'Kimata JT', 'Ratner L', 'Gordon JI']","['Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO 63110.']",['eng'],['AI27179/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['0 (Myristic Acids)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'HIV-1/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/drug effects/*physiology', 'Myristic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects']",PMC298346,1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.86.22.8655 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Nov;86(22):8655-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.86.22.8655.,,,,,,,,,,,,

PGs that did not affect K562 cell replication did not induce p74 synthesis. p74 was found to be localized mainly in the cytoplasm of PG-treated cells, but moderate amounts were found also in dense areas of the nucleus after PGJ2 treatment. p74 synthesis was not necessarily associated with cytotoxicity or with inhibition of cell protein synthesis. The results described support the hypothesis that synthesis of the 70-kDa heat shock proteins is associated with changes in cell proliferation.

Expression of the transgenes was determined by the presence of TL or H-2Kb products or transcripts. Both Tg.Tlaa-3 strains expressed high levels of TL antigen in thymus, indicating that (i) the 9.6-kilobase Tlaa-3 DNA fragment contains sufficient information for correct tissue-specific expression in thymocytes and (ii) TL- thymocytes of C3H provide conditions for the transcriptional activation of Tlaa-3. In contrast, neither the four Tg.T3b strains nor the Tg.Con.4 strain expressed transgenes, indicating that (i) T3b lacks elements necessary for TL expression in normal thymocytes and (ii) the corresponding endogenous TL genes of C3H mice also lack these elements. The pattern of TL expression in two of the three Tg.Con.3 strains was similar to that of H-2Kb expression, indicating that transcription of this H-2Kb/T3b chimeric gene was driven by the regulatory sequences of H-2Kb. The thymuses of mice derived from the Tg.Tlaa-3-1 strain were smaller than C3H thymuses, and the surface phenotype of Tg.Tlaa-3-1 thymocytes resembled thymocyte precursors (TL+L3T4-Lyt-2-Thy-1+H-2+). These mice developed a high incidence of lymphomas with the same thymocyte precursor phenotype. The study of TL transgenic strains should prove useful in defining the role of TL in normal and abnormal T-cell differentiation.","['Hamasima, N', 'Takahashi, T', 'Taguchi, O', 'Nishizuka, Y', 'Stockert, E', 'Old, L J', 'Obata, Y']","['Hamasima N', 'Takahashi T', 'Taguchi O', 'Nishizuka Y', 'Stockert E', 'Old LJ', 'Obata Y']","['Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],['CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chimera', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, MHC Class I', 'H-2 Antigens/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC298200,1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.86.20.7995 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Oct;86(20):7995-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.86.20.7995.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Efflux velocities of VCR were directly determined from the slope of the initial release of drug induced by resuspending the preloaded cells in VCR-free medium, representing unidirectional efflux from intracellular free or loosely bound drug pools. Further, the equilibrium binding of VCR to whole-cell homogenates was analyzed by ultrafiltration to estimate intracellular unbound drug concentrations. A two-site binding model was found to fit the data best for both cell lines, and depletion of ATP by the addition of apyrase decreased binding. The binding parameters were similar between the two cell lines. A Hofstee plot of efflux demonstrated the existence of both linear and saturable transport of VCR in both cell lines. The greater maximum velocity observed with VCR efflux in the resistant cells suggests that an increased number of transporters causes greater activity of this process in the resistant cells.","['Watanabe, T', 'Inaba, M', 'Sugiyama, Y']","['Watanabe T', 'Inaba M', 'Sugiyama Y']","['Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pharm Res,Pharmaceutical research,8406521,['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Ultrafiltration', 'Vincristine/metabolism/*pharmacology']",,1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1015986405834 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Res. 1989 Aug;6(8):690-6. doi: 10.1023/a:1015986405834.,,,,,,,,,,,,

To our knowledge, this is the first definitive report of a carcinoma primary to the oral cavity associated with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. In each case, the severity of hypercalcemia, leukocytosis, or both very closely correlated with tumor growth. Surgical excision of the tumors or regression of tumor mass due to aggressive anticancer drug administration resulted in decreases in leukocyte number, serum calcium level, or both.

The clonal origin of the preexisting chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and the subsequent NHL cells was investigated. Both cell populations were present in the peripheral blood and could be separated efficiently by counterflow centrifugal elutriation. In the lymph node biopsy mainly NHL centroblasts were found and only a minor population of small lymphocytes. The separated CLL and NHL cells from blood as well as the lymph node cells were found to express mu and kappa Ig chains. Since expression of identical light chains is not synonymous with common clonal origin, Southern blot analysis of the Ig heavy chain genes was also performed, which showed that the two cell populations had identical Ig heavy chain gene rearrangements. Therefore, it was concluded that the CLL cells and the NHL cells in the present case originate from the same precursor cell and that the NHL has to be regarded as a malignant progression of the CLL. These findings are different from our previous report on another patient with Richter's syndrome, in whom the CLL and the NHL represented two unrelated malignancies. Therefore, the occurrence of NHL in Richter's syndrome apparently may represent either a clonal progression of the CLL or a second lymphoid malignancy.","['Michiels, J J', 'van Dongen, J J', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'Sonneveld, P', 'Ploemacher, R E', 'Adriaansen, H J', 'van der Kwast, T H', 'Brederoo, P', 'Abels, J']","['Michiels JJ', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Sonneveld P', 'Ploemacher RE', 'Adriaansen HJ', 'van der Kwast TH', 'Brederoo P', 'Abels J']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Dijkzigt, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Syndrome']",,1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Nov;3(11):819-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,

RA has been used in treatment of some patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes. In previous experiments we had observed that RA may decrease the self-renewal of blast cells in established cell lines, and in our clinic RA has been tested as maintenance treatment in association with chemotherapeutic drugs. Accordingly, we asked if exposure of AML blast cells to RA affected their subsequent response to ara-C. We found that brief exposure to RA regularly increased the ara-C sensitivity of cells from two established AML cell lines. A similar, though less marked, effect was seen when the blast cells from one patient were tested directly; in a second instance, highly ara-C resistant blasts did not become sensitive when exposed to RA. Experiments using high specific activity tritiated thymidine did not disclose any changes in the proportion of AML cells in the DNA synthesis phase of the cycle at times when their responses to ara-C were changing. We interpret our findings as support for continuing efforts to integrate RA in the management of AML patients and suggest that the mechanism of ara-C sensitization may not depend on changes in the cell cycle.","['Lishner, M', 'Curtis, J E', 'Minkin, S', 'McCulloch, E A']","['Lishner M', 'Curtis JE', 'Minkin S', 'McCulloch EA']","['Ontario Cancer Institute, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Nov;3(11):784-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,

We obtained results as follows; the ratio of acid to alkaline Rnase activities (Ac/Al ratio) of chronic phase of CML was 1.64 +/- 0.47 (mean +/- SD) in the untreated cases, and was 1.32 +/- 0.16 in the treated cases. The Ac/Al ratio always indicated over 1.0 in the chronic phase of CML without any relationship to treatments. On the other hand, in the cases of acute crisis, the Ac/Al ratio was significantly lowered (0.94 +/- 0.22) as compared to the chronic phase of CML (p less than 0.001), and was similar to that of acute leukemia. The acid and alkaline RNase activities of the blast from the patients with acute crisis of CML showed remarkably lower value than those of leukemic cells from patients with chronic phase of CML. Therefore, it was Suggested that the return to normal range of Ac/Al ratio in acute crisis of CML depended on marked decrease of RNase activities of blasts. Thus, serial determinations of the enzyme activities are considered to be one of useful tools for prediction of acute crisis of CML.","['Maruoka, K', 'Yamanaka, M', 'Misago, M', 'Nakata, K', 'Tsukada, J', 'Nagata, K', 'Sato, T', 'Mori, N', 'Oda, S', 'Chiba, S']","['Maruoka K', 'Yamanaka M', 'Misago M', 'Nakata K', 'Tsukada J', 'Nagata K', 'Sato T', 'Mori N', 'Oda S', 'Chiba S', 'et al.']",,['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,['EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/*enzymology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Ribonucleases/*blood']",,1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1989 Jul;30(7):988-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relative risk of failure to treatment for the hyperdiploid group was one third that of the diploid group in low-risk ALL and one fifth that of the diploid group in high-risk ALL. In relapsed ALL, there was no significant correlation between the cellular DNA contents and their prognosis after relapse.

Interaction of a kappa B binding protein with cell-specific transcription factors.,3064-8,"The IL-2R alpha enhancer contains an 11 bp sequence that resembles kappa B, a regulatory element associated with several genes, including Ig kappa-L chain and human immunodeficiency virus. Although nuclear factor of the kappa-enhancer in B cells (NF-kappa B) binding is activated by PMA, TNF-alpha, and IL-1, activation of the IL-2R alpha enhancer does not consistently correlate with NF-kappa B induction. In this report, we show that TNF-alpha activates NF-kappa B and the human immunodeficiency virus enhancer in the Jurkat T leukemia but does not stimulate the IL-2R alpha enhancer. In contrast, this cytokine, and IL-1, increased IL-2R alpha gene expression in YT-1 cells. Comparing YT-1 and Jurkat T leukemias, we find that the IL-2R kappa B site is required for TNF-alpha and IL-1 stimulation in YT-1 cells, but that plasmids containing this site linked to a heterologous promoter do not respond to these cytokines. These data suggest that upstream regulatory elements in addition to IL-2R kappa B are needed to mediate this cytokine effect. TNF-alpha also synergized with PMA and other cytokines in the stimulation of the IL-2R alpha enhancer in YT-1. Because these effects are not observed in Jurkat cells, the function of the IL-2R kappa B site is cell-specific and likely mediated by different associated transcription factors present in each cell type.","['Freimuth, W W', 'Depper, J M', 'Nabel, G J']","['Freimuth WW', 'Depper JM', 'Nabel GJ']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor 48109.']",['eng'],"['AI26865/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM36928/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*genetics', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",,1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Nov 1;143(9):3064-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we examined the ability of P48 to stimulate cytokine release by human peripheral blood monocytes. P48 stimulated the secretion of TNF and IL-1 in a dose-dependent manner. Priming the monocytes with IFN-gamma enhanced P48-induced cytokine release but was not a requirement for secretion. Cytokine secretion was in response to P48 and was not caused by endotoxin contamination. The cytokine-inducing activity of P48 was extremely sensitive to heat treatment but could not be eliminated by using polymyxin B.

Role in cell differentiation.,19076-80,"Sphingolipid metabolism was examined in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Differentiation of HL-60 cells with 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (vitamin D3; 100 nM) was accompanied by sphingomyelin turnover. Maximum turnover of [3H]choline-labeled sphingomyelin occurred 2 h following vitamin D3 treatment, with sphingomyelin levels decreasing to 77 +/- 6% of control and returning to base-line levels by 4 h. Ceramide and phosphorylcholine were concomitantly generated. Ceramide mass levels increased by 55% at 2 h following vitamin D3 treatment and returned to base-line levels by 4 h. The amount of phosphorylcholine produced equaled the amount of sphingomyelin hydrolyzed, suggesting the involvement of a sphingomyelinase. Vitamin D3 treatment resulted in a 90% increase in the activity of a neutral sphingomyelinase from HL-60 cells. The inferred role of sphingomyelin hydrolysis in the induction of cell differentiation was investigated using an exogenous sphingomyelinase. When a bacterial sphingomyelinase was added at concentrations that caused a similar degree of sphingomyelin hydrolysis as 100 nM vitamin D3, it enhanced the ability of subthreshold levels of vitamin D3 to induce HL-60 cell differentiation. This study demonstrates the existence of a ""sphingomyelin cycle"" in human cells. Such sphingolipid cycles (Hannun, Y., and Bell, R. (1989) Science 243, 500-507) may function in a signal transduction pathway and in cellular differentiation.","['Okazaki, T', 'Bell, R M', 'Hannun, Y A']","['Okazaki T', 'Bell RM', 'Hannun YA']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710.']",['eng'],"['CA46738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK20205/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'EL00155/PHS HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Palmitic Acids)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '2V16EO95H1 (Palmitic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Palmitic Acid', 'Palmitic Acids/metabolism', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/metabolism', 'Sphingomyelins/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism']",,1989/11/15 00:00,1989/11/15 00:01,['1989/11/15 00:00'],"['1989/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)47268-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Nov 15;264(32):19076-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the mechanism of action of HMBA is not yet known, evidence has been obtained that protein kinase C (PKC) plays a role in this process. In this study we provide further evidence that establishes this relationship. MELC contain two principal PKC activities, PKC beta and PKC alpha. MELC variants, selected for resistance to vincristine (VC), which display acceleration of their rates of induced differentiation, are enriched in PKC beta activity. When MELC are exposed to HMBA there is a fall in PKC activity, largely accounted for by a decline in PKC beta. This decline in PKC activity is faster in the VC-resistant, rapidly differentiating MELC. We previously demonstrated that VC-resistant MELC are resistant to the inhibition of differentiation by the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). In both VC-sensitive and -resistant MELC, PMA causes rapid membrane translocation and then a decline in PKC activity, accompanied by a generation of a Ca2+- and phospholipid-independent protein kinase activity. In VC/PMA-resistant variants, this Ca2+/phospholipid-independent protein kinase activity persists considerably longer than in the VC-sensitive variants. This correlates with the resistance to PMA and provides additional evidence for a role for the Ca2+/phospholipid-independent protein kinase activity during induced differentiation.","['Melloni, E', 'Pontremoli, S', 'Viotti, P L', 'Patrone, M', 'Marks, P A', 'Rifkind, R A']","['Melloni E', 'Pontremoli S', 'Viotti PL', 'Patrone M', 'Marks PA', 'Rifkind RA']","['Institute of Biological Chemistry, University of Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31768/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Genetic Variation', 'Isoenzymes/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Phospholipids/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine']",,1989/11/05 00:00,1989/11/05 00:01,['1989/11/05 00:00'],"['1989/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)51481-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Nov 5;264(31):18414-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,

PVA in the media preserved the morphology of cells very well and prevented leakage of large molecules such as enzymes from the cells. Therefore, fixation or long periods of air-drying prior to incubation leading to substantial loss of enzyme activity could be avoided. A brief period of drying (2 min at 37 degrees C) of the cell preparations just before the incubation was sufficient for making the cells permeable. Localization of enzyme activities was very precise and precipitation of the final reaction product was confined to sites which are known to contain the enzyme under study (granules, mitochondria, lysosomes).

Inflammatory macrophages activated with recombinant murine interferon-gamma (rMuIFN-gamma) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) first specifically recognized and bound tumorigenic-undifferentiated MELC and then produced their lysis. MELC that were induced to differentiate by a 5-day treatment with 5 mM N,N'-hexamethylene-bis-acetamide (HMBA) accumulated hemoglobin (benzidine positive) and were not recognized by the macrophages. Qualitative examination by light and electron microscopy confirmed the specific nature of the macrophage-MELC interaction. Quantitative assessment showed that the binding was dependent on the temperature and divalent cations and independent of serum components. A 24-h treatment of MELC with HMBA resulted in decreased binding, prior to hemoglobin accumulation and commitment to differentiation. The lack of binding of nontumorigenic-differentiated cells by macrophages was not due to residual HMBA. It thus appears that macrophages can distinguish MELC at different stages of differentiation.","['Pak, C C', 'Fidler, I J']","['Pak CC', 'Fidler IJ']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35-CA42107/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CAO9598-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', '*Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages/metabolism/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C']",,1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-4681(11)60525-2 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1432-0436.1989.tb00731.x [doi]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 1989 Jul;41(1):49-55. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-0436.1989.tb00731.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies from this laboratory [Waldmann, R., Nieberding, M. and Walter, U. (1987) Eur. J. Biochem. 167, 441-448) established that in human platelets cyclic-nucleotide-elevating vasodilators stimulated a pattern of protein phosphorylation which was mediated by both cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases. Of particular interest was a membrane-bound 50-kDa protein whose phosphorylation was increased both by cAMP- and cGMP-elevating vasodilators in intact platelets and by endogenous cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase in platelet membranes. Since the molecular mechanism of action of cyclic-nucleotide-elevating vasodilators is unknown, this 50-kDa phosphoprotein from human platelets was purified to apparent homogeneity by salt extraction, anion, cation and dye-ligand chromatography. The purified protein migrated as a 46-kDa protein in SDS/PAGE, was an excellent substrate for both cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases and migrated in SDS/PAGE as a 50-kDa protein after phosphorylation by these protein kinases. Analysis by limited proteolysis, tryptic fingerprinting and of phosphoamino acids established that the purified protein is identical with the 50-kDa protein phosphorylated by both cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases in platelet membranes and in response to cAMP- and cGMP-elevating vasodilators with intact platelets. Evidence is presented that the purified protein contains at least two phosphorylation sites, each of which is preferentially phosphorylated by either cAMP- or cGMP-dependent protein kinase. The availability of this vasodilator-regulated phosphoprotein as a purified protein should now allow new approaches for investigating the function of this protein and its possible role in the mechanism of action of cyclic-nucleotide-elevating vasodilators.","['Halbrugge, M', 'Walter, U']","['Halbrugge M', 'Walter U']","['Labor fur Klinische Biochemie, Universitat Wurzburg, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Nucleotides, Cyclic)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Vasodilator Agents)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Blood Platelets/*analysis', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Chromatography', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nucleotides, Cyclic/*physiology', 'Phosphoproteins/*isolation & purification', 'Protein Kinases/physiology', 'Vasodilator Agents/*pharmacology']",,1989/10/20 00:00,1989/10/20 00:01,['1989/10/20 00:00'],"['1989/10/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/20 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb15079.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1989 Oct 20;185(1):41-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb15079.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In one case kappa gene expression and rearrangement occurred in the absence of mu H chain expression, and in another was not induced efficiently by introduction of a mu-expression vector. Although the vast majority of scid H and L chain coding sequence joins are grossly aberrant, scid A-MuLV transformants can form normal coding joints at a very low frequency. In contrast, these cells form generally normal signal sequence joins at an approximately normal efficiency. Thus, these findings mechanistically distinguish coding and signal join formation. Subcloning analyses suggest that scid A-MuLV transformants that do not attempt chromosomal coding sequence joining may have a relative survival advantage, and therefore that these events may often result in unrepaired chromosomal breakage and cell death.","['Blackwell, T K', 'Ferrier, P', 'Malynn, B A', 'Pollock, R R', 'Covey, L R', 'Suh, H Y', 'Heinke, L B', 'Fulop, G M', 'Phillips, R A', 'Yancopoulos, G D']","['Blackwell TK', 'Ferrier P', 'Malynn BA', 'Pollock RR', 'Covey LR', 'Suh HY', 'Heinke LB', 'Fulop GM', 'Phillips RA', 'Yancopoulos GD', 'et al.']",,['eng'],"['AI-20047/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-40427/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Current topics in microbiology and immunology,0110513,,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Light Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data']",,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-74974-2_12 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 1989;152:85-94. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-74974-2_12.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In conclusion, these data do not lend support to the hypothesis that a low selenium status enhances the risk of developing ANLL, but indicate that serum Se levels in patients with acute leukemia are mostly dependent on tumor activity.","['Beguin, Y', 'Bours, V', 'Delbrouck, J M', 'Robaye, G', 'Roelandts, I', 'Bury, J', 'Fillet, G', 'Weber, G']","['Beguin Y', 'Bours V', 'Delbrouck JM', 'Robaye G', 'Roelandts I', 'Bury J', 'Fillet G', 'Weber G']","['Department of Hematology, University of Liege, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,['H6241UJ22B (Selenium)'],IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Selenium/*blood']",,1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/10.11.2089 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1989 Nov;10(11):2089-91. doi: 10.1093/carcin/10.11.2089.,,,,,,,,,,,,

This enhanced drug resistance is associated with a greater than 40-fold increase in the level of expression of an alpha class (YcYc) glutathione S-transferase (GST) as compared to the parental, CHO-K1, cell line. Here, we have purified GST from CHO-Chlr cells and show that the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug indomethacin acts as an inhibitor of enzyme activity. Indomethacin at 500 microM causes no significant decrease in colony forming ability of either CHO-K1 or CHO-Chlr cells. However, the cytotoxicity of chlorambucil is potentiated 5.5-fold in CHO-Chlr cells, but only 2.5-fold in CHO-K1 cells following preexposure to 500 microM indomethacin. In contrast, the antiinflammatory agent acetylsalicylic acid failed to inhibit the activity of purified GST and caused no potentiation of chlorambucil toxicity, suggesting that the potentiation by indomethacin is not due to the effects of this drug on prostaglandin synthesis. These studies provide further evidence that GSTs may be involved in the development of resistance to bifunctional alkylating agents and suggest that indomethacin, or agents with similar activities, may be of value as an adjunct to chemotherapy in some patients with tumors resistant to treatment with alkylating agents.","['Hall, A', 'Robson, C N', 'Hickson, I D', 'Harris, A L', 'Proctor, S J', 'Cattan, A R']","['Hall A', 'Robson CN', 'Hickson ID', 'Harris AL', 'Proctor SJ', 'Cattan AR']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Laboratory, Medical School, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aspirin/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chlorambucil/*pharmacology', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Glutathione Transferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Immunoblotting', 'Indomethacin/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Ovary']",,1989/11/15 00:00,1989/11/15 00:01,['1989/11/15 00:00'],"['1989/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Nov 15;49(22):6265-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since certain of these analogues have recently been shown to potently increase spermidine/spermine-N1-acetyltransferase activity, we have investigated the relationship of this effect to growth inhibition and polyamine depletion. The cellular effects of N1,N12-bis(ethyl)spermine (BESPM) and two of its homologues, N1,N11-bis(ethyl)norspermine (BENSPM) and N1,N14-bis(ethyl)homospermine (BEHSPM), were compared in L1210 cells following treatments at equimolar concentrations (2 microM) and at concentrations (0.5 microM BEHSPM; 2 microM BESPM, and 20 microM BENSPM) producing comparable intracellular concentrations (2600-3000 pmol/10(6) cells) of the analogues. At 2 microM, BENSPM increased total polyamine N-acetyltransferase activity by 15-fold, BESPM, by 7-fold, and BEHSPM, by only 1.5-fold. These differences were much more exaggerated at comparable intracellular concentrations, where BENSPM increased enzyme activity 31-fold, BESPM, 7-fold, and BEHSPM had no effect. This rank order in effectiveness sharply contrasted effects on cell growth and interference with polyamine biosynthesis, which correlated more with intracellular accumulation of the analogues. At 2 microM, BEHSPM was most effective in suppressing ornithine and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylases, depleting polyamine pools, and inhibiting cell growth, followed by BESPM and then by BENSPM. Thus, the data indicate that, in L1210 cells, the large increases in spermidine/spermine-N1-acetyltransferase activity produced by the analogues do not appear to contribute significantly to polyamine depletion or to be causally related to inhibition of cell growth. These studies also identify BENSPM as the most potent modulator of spermidine/spermine-N1-acetyltransferase activity thus far studied in cell culture systems. To a large extent, its greater effectiveness over BESPM seems to be attributable to a major increase in prolongation of enzyme half-life (3.9 versus 1.3 h), presumably due to enzyme stabilization caused by differential binding of the analogues at the enzyme active site.","['Libby, P R', 'Henderson, M', 'Bergeron, R J', 'Porter, C W']","['Libby PR', 'Henderson M', 'Bergeron RJ', 'Porter CW']","['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],"['CA-22153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-24538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-37606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Polyamines)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.57 (diamine N-acetyltransferase)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dogs', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Polyamines/*metabolism', 'Spermidine', 'Spermine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/*enzymology']",,1989/11/15 00:00,1989/11/15 00:01,['1989/11/15 00:00'],"['1989/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Nov 15;49(22):6226-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the HL-60 human myeloid cell line is grown in a selenium-deficient medium, GPx enzymatic activity decreases 30-fold compared with selenium-replete cells. Upon return to a medium containing selenium in the form of selenite, GPx activity in the cells starts to increase within 48 hours and reaches maximal (selenium-replete) levels at 7 days. Steady-state immunoreactive protein levels correlate with enzymatic activity. Cycloheximide inhibits the rise in GPx activity that accompanies selenium replenishment, indicating that protein synthesis is required for the increase. However, GPx mRNA levels and the rate of transcription of the human GPx gene change very little and thus appear to be independent of the selenium supply. Thus the human GPx gene appears to be regulated post-transcriptionally, probably cotranslationally, in response to selenium availability.","['Chada, S', 'Whitney, C', 'Newburger, P E']","['Chada S', 'Whitney C', 'Newburger PE']","['Department of Pediatrics University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester 01655.']",['eng'],"['CA-38325/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-41625/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/pathology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Selenium/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1989/11/15 00:00,1989/11/15 00:01,['1989/11/15 00:00'],"['1989/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82864-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Nov 15;74(7):2535-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long-term cultures were maintained for 4 to 6 weeks by weekly addition of 500 U rIL-2 and autologous irradiated feeder cells. In the first week, the cells decreased considerably in the long-term cultures but thereafter cells proliferated (mainly T cells) on the average 300-fold (range 30- to 1,000-fold).

LAK cells killing NK-resistant lymphoma cell lines showed optimal activity after 2 to 3 weeks of culture. However, LAK cells killing greater than 10% of autologous malignant cells were obtained in only one third of the patients. The discrepancy between strong cytolytic activity against the NK-sensitive (K562) target cells obtained in all patients and the cytotoxic activity against NK-resistant cell lines contrasts with the poor development of LAK cells against autologous tumor cells. This discrepancy does not appear to be explained by soluble inhibitory factors released during the tumor cultures, as allogeneic LAK cells were not inhibited by supernatants from patients' cultures.

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) in vitro augments this cytotoxicity and used therapeutically might thereby promote the eradication of minimal residual disease. In order to assess whether these effects on cytotoxicity can be reproduced in vivo, we studied changes in number, phenotype, and MHC unrestricted cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from patients with hematologic malignancy receiving IL-2 infusions. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma were treated after cytotoxic chemotherapy or autologous BMT. IL-2 infusions produced an initial lymphopenia, followed by a progressive recovery in mononuclear cell numbers and a rebound lymphocytosis after the termination of treatment. This affected all lymphocyte subsets; in particular CD25 (IL-2 receptor) positive cell numbers rose sevenfold. Cells with the ability to kill a natural killer (NK)-resistant, lymphokine activated killer cell (LAK)-sensitive target appeared in the circulation during 16 of 19 infusions and mean LAK activity rose from 5.9% to 15.5% during infusion (E:T ratio, 50:1; P less than .001). During IL-2 infusion, cells present in the peripheral blood inhibited the growth of myeloid leukemia blasts in agar after overnight co-culture. Depletion experiments showed that LAK activity was mediated by cells of both CD3- CD16+ (NK derived) and CD3+ CD16- (T derived) subsets. LAK precursor activity in peripheral blood also significantly increased during IL-2 infusion. Increases in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) unrestricted cytotoxicity can be produced by IL-2 infusions in vivo and may result in improved relapse-free survival following chemotherapy or BMT.","['Gottlieb, D J', 'Prentice, H G', 'Heslop, H E', 'Bello-Fernandez, C', 'Bianchi, A C', 'Galazka, A R', 'Brenner, M K']","['Gottlieb DJ', 'Prentice HG', 'Heslop HE', 'Bello-Fernandez C', 'Bianchi AC', 'Galazka AR', 'Brenner MK']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, London, England.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins']",,1989/11/15 00:00,1989/11/15 00:01,['1989/11/15 00:00'],"['1989/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82838-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Nov 15;74(7):2335-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,

This assay is sensitive enough for studying plasma and urine. The range in normal volunteers was 0.6 to 2.3 micrograms/L for platelet-poor plasma and 1.4 to 3.3 micrograms/L for urine. We determined PDGF levels in the circulation (outside platelets) in patients with myeloproliferative diseases. Platelet-poor plasma and urine PDGF were significantly elevated in patients with myelofibrosis (6.2 +/- 2.0 micrograms/L for plasma; 7.8 +/- 2.4 micrograms/L for urine) and essential thrombocythemia (5.5 +/- 1.5 micrograms/L for plasma; 11.4 +/- 2.2 micrograms/L for urine), but not in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (2.1 +/- 0.4 micrograms/L for plasma; 2.8 +/- 1.2 micrograms/L for urine). Polycythemia vera produced an intermediate pattern: although plasma PDGF was within the normal range (2.1 +/- 0.2 micrograms/L), urine levels were increased (3.7 +/- 0.6 micrograms/L). These results show that PDGF is increased in the circulation in some but not all myeloproliferative diseases, and suggest that this is due to abnormal in vivo release from either megakaryocytes in the bone marrow or circulating platelets.","['Gersuk, G M', 'Carmel, R', 'Pattengale, P K']","['Gersuk GM', 'Carmel R', 'Pattengale PK']","[""Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, CA 90027.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)'],IM,"['Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/urine', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*blood/*urine', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*metabolism/*urine', 'Polycythemia Vera/blood/urine', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/blood/urine', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/blood/urine']",,1989/11/15 00:00,1989/11/15 00:01,['1989/11/15 00:00'],"['1989/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82837-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Nov 15;74(7):2330-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirteen (30%) of 44 patients receiving MTX alone and 10 (27%) of 37 patients receiving CSP alone developed grades II to IV acute GVHD. Multivariate life-table analysis indicated that the prophylaxis by MTX/CSP was the risk factor for the low incidence of grades II to IV acute GVHD.

No patient received immunosuppression prosttransplant for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Nineteen patients in this group experienced graft failure. The major factors associated with graft failure were transplants from male donors and the age of the patient (or donor). Among male recipients of male donor-derived grafts a low dose per kilogram of nucleated cells, progenitor cells (colony forming unit-GM) and T cells was also associated with graft failure. Additional irradiation to 1,500 cGy, high dose corticosteroids posttransplant, and additional peripheral blood donor T cells did not decrease the incidence of graft failure. In addition, type of leukemia, time from diagnosis to transplant, an intact spleen, or the presence of antidonor leukocyte antibodies did not correlate with graft failure. To ensure engraftment of secondary transplants, further immunosuppression was necessary but was poorly tolerated. However, engraftment and survival could be achieved with an immunosuppressive regimen in which antithymocyte globulin and high dose methylprednisolone were administered both before and after infusions of secondary partially T-cell-depleted marrow grafts.","['Kernan, N A', 'Bordignon, C', 'Heller, G', 'Cunningham, I', 'Castro-Malaspina, H', 'Shank, B', 'Flomenberg, N', 'Burns, J', 'Yang, S Y', 'Black, P']","['Kernan NA', 'Bordignon C', 'Heller G', 'Cunningham I', 'Castro-Malaspina H', 'Shank B', 'Flomenberg N', 'Burns J', 'Yang SY', 'Black P', 'et al.']","['Charles A.

These children were assigned to six mutually exclusive cytogenetic categories as follows: (1) hyperdiploid, with 50 or more chromosomes (n = 35); (2) hyperdiploid, with 47 to 49 chromosomes (n = 11); (3) diploid (n = 42); (4) pseudodiploid (n = 34); (5) hypodiploid (n = 9); and (6) insufficient data (n = 34). At a median follow-up of 5 years, there were no statistically significant differences between any of these cytogenetic categories in either event-free or overall survival. Those children with chromosomal translocations (n = 26) appeared to fare the same as those lacking translocations (n = 105). The absence of karyotypic prognostic significance was observed not only within the overall group, but also when the results were stratified by standard-risk and high-risk status. Of the specific structural chromosome changes that we studied, only the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) appeared to confer a poor prognosis, although there were too few such cases to achieve statistical significance. Although we did not detect the event-free survival differences that have been described previously in hyperdiploid, hypodiploid, and pseudodiploid childhood ALL, our findings must be viewed as preliminary given the small number of children in some of the cytogenetic categories. We think that the prognostic implications of these cytogenetic features might have been nullified by improvements in therapy.","['Fletcher, J A', 'Kimball, V M', 'Lynch, E', 'Donnelly, M', 'Pavelka, K', 'Gelber, R D', 'Tantravahi, R', 'Sallan, S E']","['Fletcher JA', 'Kimball VM', 'Lynch E', 'Donnelly M', 'Pavelka K', 'Gelber RD', 'Tantravahi R', 'Sallan SE']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['CA 19589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 22719/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CS 06516/PHS HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations/genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Ploidies', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84996-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Nov 1;74(6):2130-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cultured cells expressed HLA-DR, CD-9, CD-10, CD-20, and CD-34 antigens, indicating conservation of precursor B phenotype. Differentiation antigen expression on the clonogenic subpopulation giving rise to leukemic colonies was assessed by treating cells prior to culture with selected cytotoxic monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and complement or by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Lytic treatment with HLA-DR, CD-10, CD-9, and CD-20 antibodies produced median reductions in colony formation of 93%, 81%, 73%, and 58% respectively. Combined treatment with CD-9 and CD-10 antibodies produced complete inhibition in 11 of 13 cases. Cell-sorting experiments after CD-10 staining indicated a good correlation with complement lysis studies and also demonstrated that the CD-19 antigen is expressed on a high proportion of clonogenic cells. Colony formation was also significantly reduced in 13 of 17 cases by lytic treatment of cells with the CD-33 antibody MY-9, suggesting expression of this ""myeloid"" lineage antigen on ALL clonogenic cells. The substantial case-to-case variation in expression of individual differentiation antigens indicates that leukemic cellular heterogeneity is a major consideration in ex vivo bone marrow purging using MoAbs and emphasizes the need for more critical evaluation of purging techniques.","['Hudson, A M', 'Makrynikola, V', 'Kabral, A', 'Bradstock, K F']","['Hudson AM', 'Makrynikola V', 'Kabral A', 'Bradstock KF']","['Haematology Department, Westmead Hospital, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Child', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84994-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Nov 1;74(6):2112-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,

An interaction of DTSSP with the reduced folate/MTX is substantiated by findings that: (a) like MTX transport itself, the concentration of DTSSP required for half-maximal inhibition of [3H]methotrexate transport varied substantially with the anionic composition of the external medium. In a saline buffer and an anion-deficient buffer the I50 values were 7 and 1 microM, respectively; (b) saturation of the carrier with 1-5 microM methotrexate completely protected the transport system from interaction by DTSSP; (c) methotrexate transport activity in DTSSP-treated cells could be restored after cleavage of the disulfide bond in DTSSP under mild reducing conditions; and (d) pretreatment of cells with DTSSP reduced the incorporation of [3H]methotrexate after labeling with an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of [3H]methotrexate (NHS-MTX), another potent inhibitor of methotrexate transport. Comparison of DTSSP- and NHS-MTX-induced inhibition of methotrexate transport showed that DTSSP inhibition, in contrast to NHS-MTX inhibition, was (a) less potent, (b) dependent on buffer conditions, (c) reversible by reducing agents, and (d) required only a very low molar ratio of methotrexate over DTSSP to afford maximal protection.","['Jansen, G', 'Westerhof, G R', 'Rijksen, G', 'Schornagel, J H']","['Jansen G', 'Westerhof GR', 'Rijksen G', 'Schornagel JH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Succinimides)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EVY5D0U6SH (dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate))', 'T8ID5YZU6Y (Dithiothreitol)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Dithiothreitol/pharmacology', 'Folic Acid/*pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics', 'Succinimides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",,1989/11/03 00:00,1989/11/03 00:01,['1989/11/03 00:00'],"['1989/11/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/03 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2736(89)90411-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(89)90411-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1989 Nov 3;985(3):266-70. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(89)90411-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The binding is not related to the adenosine receptor since neither adenosine, ADP, nor ATP affect the ligand-receptor reaction. When HL-60 cells were incubated with physiological concentrations of [methyl-3H]AdoMet (20 microM) at 36 degrees C, AdoMet did not equilibrate with the intracellular pool, nor were any [3H]methyl groups incorporated into nucleic acids or proteins. In contrast, significant amounts of [3H]methyl groups were incorporated into membrane phospholipids. When cells were incubated with 20 microM [methyl-3H]AdoMet, [3H]methyl groups were transferred to phosphatidylethanolamine, -monomethylethanolamine, and -dimethylethanolamine yielding phosphatidylcholine. However, the rate of methyl transfer with AdoMet was only 22% of that observed when cells were incubated with a comparable amount of [methyl-3H]methionine.

These opposite effects were both attributed to the enzymatic activity of the subunit A that activates adenylate cyclase, increasing the intracellular level of cAMP. We observed that the B subunit of cholera toxin produced by itself an inhibition of the 'in vitro' growth of two murine leukemia cell lines (L1210 limphoid leukemia and WEHI-3B myelomonocytic leukemia). The sensitivity of WEHI-3B cells towards cholera toxin was about 5000-times higher than that of the L1210 cells, whereas the two leukemias showed an identical sensitivity to the B subunit (IC50 = 5.10(-10) M for L1210 and 10(-10) M for WEHI-3B). The inhibition produced by the B subunit was neutralized by GM1 and in a minor degree by type II gangliosides. The two leukemias showed a remarkable difference in their gangliosides contents (L1210 cells contained GM1 (80.6%) and GM2 (19.4%), while WEHI-3B cells contained GM1 (28.2%), Fuc-GM1 (44.9%) and a band (26.9%) with a chromatographic mobility between GD1a and GD1b). The inhibition could be explained by a competitive mechanism between the B subunit and some autocrine factor binding GM1-containing receptors.

Mean age was 50.3 (range 6-86) and the M/F ratio was 1.23. 214 patients were treated by intensive chemotherapy and 75.2% achieved complete remission. Patients with inv(16) and t(8;21) had very high CR rates whereas those with complex cytogenetic abnormalities (with or without involvement of chromosomes 5 and/or 7) had a poor response to therapy. Other karyotypic abnormalities and normal karyotypes were associated with intermediate CR rates. In a multivariate analysis, cytogenetics were the best prognostic factor of the achievement of CR, followed by age and platelet count. Median actuarial disease-free survival (DFS) of the patients who achieved CR was 19 months. No significant differences in actuarial DFS were found according to karyotype. However, no relapses were seen in patients with inv(16) and t(9;11) or its variants. Conversely, the median DFS was only 12.5 months in patients with t(15;17). Median actuarial DFS was 24 months in patients with t(8;21), but a high incidence of early relapses were seen, and the actuarial DFS was only 54% at 12 months. Patients with trisomy 8 also had a median actuarial DFS of 24 months. Our findings do not support the previously reported 'favourable' prognosis of t(15;17) translocations. They suggest that, although it is characterized by a high CR rate, t(8;21) might be associated with a high incidence of early relapses and that, finally, inv(16) might be the only 'favourable' cytogenetic rearrangement in AML. Furthermore, the prognosis associated with t(9;11) or its variants (at least in adults), and trisomy 8 might be less severe than suggested in other studies.","['Fenaux, P', 'Preudhomme, C', 'Lai, J L', 'Morel, P', 'Beuscart, R', 'Bauters, F']","['Fenaux P', 'Preudhomme C', 'Lai JL', 'Morel P', 'Beuscart R', 'Bauters F']","['Service des Maladies du Sang, C.H.U., 1 Place de Verdun, Lille, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",,1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1989.tb00221.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1989 Sep;73(1):61-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1989.tb00221.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is suggested that CI may play a role in the early stages of concomitant resistance.","['Sordelli, D O', 'Fontan, P A', 'Meiss, R P', 'Ruggiero, R A', 'Bustuoabad, O D']","['Sordelli DO', 'Fontan PA', 'Meiss RP', 'Ruggiero RA', 'Bustuoabad OD']","['Instituto de Investigaciones Hematologicas, Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Irritants)', '13T4O6VMAM (Piroxicam)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Indomethacin/*therapeutic use', '*Irritants', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Piroxicam/*therapeutic use']",PMC2247308,1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1989.349 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1989 Nov;60(5):734-8. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1989.349.,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined the ability of aclacinomycin A (ACM) associated with doxorubicin (DOX), to increase intranuclear DOX concentrations and, consequently, to enhance cytotoxic effects against drug resistant cells in vitro. A recently developed microspectrofluorometric technique is used to measure intranuclear DOX concentrations in sensitive and DOX-resistant K562 cells treated with DOX and ACM. Fluorescence emission spectra are collected from a microvolume of single living cell nuclei. From both DOX and ACM model fluorescence spectra (free, DNA-bound and metabolites), the intranuclear spectral profile is analysed according to the amount of each component. This quantitative analysis determines intranuclear DOX concentrations with an error of 10%. Non-cytotoxic doses of ACM, in combination with DOX, increase cytotoxic activity of DOX against K562 resistant cells. When DOX-resistant cells are exposed simultaneously to ACM and DOX, significant increases in intranuclear DOX concentrations are found compared with the case of exposure to DOX alone. The measure of the intranuclear retention of DOX shows that ACM partly blocks the DOX efflux in resistant cell nuclei, resulting in enhanced accumulation of DOX. These data lead us to conclude that ACM-DOX association partly reverses the DOX resistance at clinically achievable concentrations.","['Millot, J M', 'Rasoanaivo, T D', 'Morjani, H', 'Manfait, M']","['Millot JM', 'Rasoanaivo TD', 'Morjani H', 'Manfait M']","['Laboratoire de Spectroscopie Biomoleculaire, UFR de Pharmacie, Reims, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",PMC2247305,1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1989.339 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1989 Nov;60(5):678-84. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1989.339.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim was to assess the capacity of these patients to tolerate IL2 after intensive therapy and to determine whether regenerating lymphocytes were capable of responding to IL2 with the generation of anti-leukaemic effector cells. Toxicity was severe in two patients treated with escalating doses of IL2 and 19 subsequent infusions administered to 11 patients on a fixed dose schedule for periods of 3-5 days were well tolerated. Major toxicity was confined to hypotension (two courses) which responded rapidly to treatment cessation. No patients required intensive care unit support. IL2 infusions produced no significant adverse effects on marrow regeneration; while there were transient falls in platelet counts there were no episodes of clinical bleeding and neutrophil counts increased from a mean of 1.1 pre-infusion to 2.5 x 10(9)l-1 during the infusion (P = 0.004). A significant biochemical abnormality was hypokalaemia which responded rapidly to correction. Cells with activity against leukaemic progenitor cells appeared in peripheral blood within 48 h of beginning treatment.

With purified eIF-2 as substrate, haemin-controlled eIF-2 alpha kinases could be partially purified from cultured mouse erythroleukaemia cells (MEL cells), which can be induced in vivo to erythroid differentiation. The eIF-2 alpha kinases from both uninduced and induced MEL cells are clearly distinct from the double-stranded-RNA-activated eIF-2 alpha kinase described for many mammalian cell types. A rough quantitative estimation indicates that, on a per-cell basis, induced MEL cells contain the same amount of haemin-controlled eIF-2 alpha kinase activity as rabbit reticulocytes, whereas uninduced MEL cells contain about one-tenth as much. As to their chromatographic behavior on CM-Sephadex and DEAE-cellulose and their sensitivity towards physiological concentrations of haemin (5-10 microM), the eIF-2 alpha kinases from MEL cells are indistinguishable from HCI. They differ from HCI with respect to their response towards activating stimuli such as prolonged incubation at 37 degrees C or brief exposure to the thiol reagent N-ethylmaleimide.","['Sarre, T F']",['Sarre TF'],"['Institut fur Biologie III, Albert-Ludwigs-Universitat Freiburg, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Erythrocytes/cytology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinases/*blood', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology/pathology', 'eIF-2 Kinase']",PMC1133306,1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2620569 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1989 Sep 1;262(2):569-74. doi: 10.1042/bj2620569.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro screening of potential antidotes that act by blocking paraquat uptake requires a cell line that accumulates paraquat by an energy-dependent mechanism. We screened various lymphoblastoid cell lines until we found a line accumulating paraquat by an energy-dependent mechanism. During study of this cell line, a marked resistance to paraquat developed in a clone. The resistance was associated with a reduction in NADPH reductase activity, confirming the original report (using microsomal preparations) that intracellular reduction of paraquat occurs primarily by this enzyme. One-half of the NADPH-P450 reductase activity, as well as one-half of the NADPH-dependent paraquat-inducible superoxide production, was decreased. This suggests that the decrease is secondary to a genetic alteration in one of the genes encoding for the enzyme. Other antioxidant enzymes and proteins were not affected. Despite the loss of only 50% of the activity, the relative resistance to paraquat exceeded previous reports involving marked increases in antioxidant enzymes. Most exogenous enhancers or inhibitors alter the activity of more than one enzyme, thereby making selective changes in any one enzyme difficult. Thus, this cell line will be useful for studying other toxins where the involvement of NADPH reductase is suspected, but not proven.","['Kelner, M J', 'Bagnell, R']","['Kelner MJ', 'Bagnell R']","['Department of Pathology, UCSD Medical Center, San Diego, California 2103.']",['eng'],['NIEHS 00142-02/EH/NCEH CDC HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 1.6.2.- (Cytochrome Reductases)', 'EC 1.6.99.3 (NADH Dehydrogenase)', 'PLG39H7695 (Paraquat)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Cytochrome Reductases/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Energy Metabolism/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology', 'NADH Dehydrogenase/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Paraquat/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/enzymology']",,1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0003-9861(89)90450-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0003-9861(89)90450-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1989 Nov 1;274(2):366-74. doi: 10.1016/0003-9861(89)90450-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most frequent sites of prior carcinoma were the cervix (n = 8), colon-rectum (n = 7), and oropharynx (n = 5), whereas the more common locations of subsequent NMMN were the ovary (n = 11), colon-rectum (n = 10), lung (n = 9), stomach (n = 6), and lymphoma-leukemia (n = 5). There was not a statistically significant difference in the frequency of subsequent NMMN when patients who received adjuvant radiation were compared with those who received adjuvant thiotepa or no adjuvant therapy. There was no excess of lymphoma or of other NMMN in the treated region or of contralateral breast carcinoma among adjuvant radiation treated patients. The overall hazard rate for subsequent NMMN was 7/1.000 women at risk per year. The risk was fairly stable over the first 15 years of follow-up but rose to 12/1,000 in the 15-20-year period. The observed frequency and time distribution of NMMN were very similar to the expected frequency determined by comparison with a population of age-matched women. Most fatal NMMN arose in the ovaries, stomach, women. Most fatal NMMN arose in the ovaries, stomach, pancreas, and lungs. There were 35 deaths due to NMMN detected subsequent to the diagnosis of breast carcinoma (15% of all cancer deaths and 64% of 55 subsequent NMMN). In this series, subsequent NMMN were as frequent as contralateral breast carcinoma, and they were responsible for seven times more deaths. Hence, an important goal of any follow-up program for breast cancer patients should be the early detection and treatment of NMMN.","['Rosen, P P', 'Groshen, S', 'Kinne, D W', 'Hellman, S']","['Rosen PP', 'Groshen S', 'Kinne DW', 'Hellman S']","['Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Risk Factors']",,1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000421-198910000-00001 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 1989 Oct;12(5):369-74. doi: 10.1097/00000421-198910000-00001.,,,,,,,,,,,,

To clarify the interaction between nHuTNF-alpha and nHuIFN-alpha, we used novel experimental models of lung metastasis and intraabdominal carcinomatosis which we developed in nude mice using a human tumor line, RPMI 4788. While the intravenous administration of nHuTNF-alpha or nHuIFN-alpha alone inhibited lung metastasis, the two cytokines given in combination synergistically inhibited lung metastasis. In a comparative study, nHuTNF-alpha and recombinant human interferon-gamma (rHuIFN-gamma) in combination also synergistically inhibited lung metastasis. Treatment with nHuTNF-alpha and nHuIFN-alpha combined significantly prolonged the survival of nude mice with intraabdominal carcinomatosis. Complete regression of five different human tumor xenografts was achieved by the simultaneous intratumoral injection of nHuTNF-alpha and nHuIFN-alpha. Histological examination revealed that tumor cell lysis occurred 24 h after the intratumoral administration of the cytokines. No significant signs of toxicity to nude mice were observed at any dose tested. The synergism of nHuTNF-alpha and nHuIFN-alpha may allow treatment at a relatively low dose range, thus minimizing side effects. The wide range of anticancer activity of these agents may provide better therapeutic efficacy. The in vivo assay systems which we have developed are useful for the analysis of the biological activities and interactions of cytokines and chemotherapeutic drugs.","['Naomoto, Y', 'Tanaka, N', 'Orita, K']","['Naomoto Y', 'Tanaka N', 'Orita K']","['First Department of Surgery, Okayama University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Japan,Acta Med Okayama,Acta medica Okayama,0417611,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Abdominal Neoplasms/therapy', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma/therapy', 'Cell Division', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Lung Neoplasms/secondary/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology/*therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",,1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.18926/AMO/30855 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Med Okayama. 1989 Aug;43(4):211-21. doi: 10.18926/AMO/30855.,,,,,,,,,,,,

We randomized 83 febrile neutropenic cancer patients for a prospective evaluation of two regimens: IMP versus piperacillin plus amikacin (PA). Both patients groups were similarly distributed with regard to age, sex, primary diagnosis and degree of granulocytopenia. More than 20% of the 74 evaluable patients had bacteraemia. The overall response rate for clinically or microbiologically documented infections was 90% in the IMP regimen versus 76% in the PA regimen, but statistical difference was not achieved. All bacteraemias in the IMP group but only 60% in the PA group were cured, however statistical difference was not achieved. IMP had to be discontinued in only one patient and the most common side effects were nausea and vomiting; no seizures were noted. Nephro- and ototoxicity, skin rash and bleeding have been the major side effects requiring drug discontinuation in 6 patients treated by PA. In conclusion, these data suggest that IMP used alone is safe and as effective as the combination of P plus A for the management of febrile granulocytopenic patients with haematologic malignancies. Further studies on a larger number of patients are needed to confirm these findings.","['Vandercam, B', 'Ezzeddine, H', 'Agaliotis, D', 'Gala, J L', 'Gigi, J', 'Wauters, G', 'Michaux, J L']","['Vandercam B', 'Ezzeddine H', 'Agaliotis D', 'Gala JL', 'Gigi J', 'Wauters G', 'Michaux JL']",,['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Acta Clin Belg,Acta clinica Belgica,0370306,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '141A6AMN38 (Cilastatin)', '71OTZ9ZE0A (Imipenem)', '84319SGC3C (Amikacin)', 'X00B0D5O0E (Piperacillin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Agranulocytosis/*etiology', 'Amikacin/therapeutic use', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Cilastatin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imipenem/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Lymphoma/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*etiology', 'Piperacillin/therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Random Allocation']",,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17843286.1989.11717996 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Clin Belg. 1989;44(2):99-109. doi: 10.1080/17843286.1989.11717996.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cellular CF fluorescence (derived from intracellular hydrolysis of CFDA) increased as a function of alkyltin concentration below the critical concentration and decreased as viability decreased above the critical concentration.

Fluorescence and interference microscopy revealed increased quantities of residual cytoplasmic tags adherent to the nuclei as a function of organotin dose, apparently resulting from increased cytoplasmic resistance to detergent-mediated solubilization.

These observations indicate that the gene for a transcription factor is located at the breakpoint of a consistently recurring chromosomal translocation in many acute leukemias and suggest a direct role for alteration of such factors in the pathogenesis of some malignancies.","['Mellentin, J D', 'Murre, C', 'Donlon, T A', 'McCaw, P S', 'Smith, S D', 'Carroll, A J', 'McDonald, M E', 'Baltimore, D', 'Cleary, M L']","['Mellentin JD', 'Murre C', 'Donlon TA', 'McCaw PS', 'Smith SD', 'Carroll AJ', 'McDonald ME', 'Baltimore D', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94025.']",['eng'],"['CA30969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Child', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1989/10/20 00:00,1989/10/20 00:01,['1989/10/20 00:00'],"['1989/10/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/20 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1126/science.2799390 [doi]'],ppublish,Science. 1989 Oct 20;246(4928):379-82. doi: 10.1126/science.2799390.,,,,,,,,,,,,

These combined analyses provide no evidence of a correlation between radiation exposure and mortality from all cancer or from leukemia.

Estimates of the excess risk of all cancer and of leukemia, based on the combined data, were negative. Upper confidence limits based on the combined data were lower than for any single population, and were similar to estimates obtained from recent analyses of A-bomb survivor data.

Of particular importance is, whether the effects of a ""major gene"" are independent of the genetic background into which it is introduced. This aspect has been investigated in respect to ""major genes"" affecting disease resistance in poultry. One of these controls genetic resistance to Leukosis virus (ALV) infection. Such infections have a negative effect on egg production and can result in increased mortality from causes other than Leukosis. The other ""major gene"" concerns B blood groups - genetic markers of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of the fowl - which influence resistance to Marek's disease. The effects of these major genes on egg production and/or viability were studied in three Leghorn lines of different origin and in crossbred combinations of these lines. For either of the ""major genes"", significant interactions with genetic characteristics of lines have been found which might induce changes of their effects on performance traits in different purebred and crossbred populations. To ignore this, could lead to false decisions when evaluating the potential benefit of known ""major genes"" for genetic improvement of economic merit. From the point of view of practical poultry breeding, ""major genes"" need to be evaluated on the basis of the effects achieved in crossbreds of the particular breeding lines, before making decisions about their utilization.","['Hartmann, W']",['Hartmann W'],"['Institut fur Kleintierzucht der Bundesforschungsanstalt fur Landwirtschaft, Bundesrepublik Deutschland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,['0 (Blood Group Antigens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*genetics', 'Blood Group Antigens/genetics', 'Chickens/blood/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Marek Disease/*genetics']",,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1989;307:221-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adipsin expression is sharply down-regulated in several models of genetic and acquired obesity, representing the first example of an adipocyte gene whose expression is greatly altered in this disorder. In this study, we have asked whether a DNA fragment from the adipsin gene can direct tissue-specific expression of a heterologous gene and mediate the suppression of this expression in genetic and chemically induced obesity. Transgenic mice have been constructed with 950 bases of DNA from the 5' flanking region of the adipsin gene linked to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in a mouse strain bearing a recessive obesity gene (diabetes, db). By crossing db/+ transgenic mice with nontransgenic db/+ mice, we obtained progeny that allowed a direct comparison of CAT expression in the tissues of lean and obese littermates. The lean mice express CAT activity predominantly in adipose tissue, while the obese mice show a marked reduction in CAT expression relative to the lean controls. When similar experiments are performed with an adipsin-CAT fusion gene containing a heterologous AKV (AKR mouse leukemia virus) enhancer, the tissue specificity of CAT expression in lean mice is broadened to include the thymus, spleen, brain, and other tissues; down-regulation occurs in all of these tissues in mice homozygous for the obesity gene or in mice that have been injected with monosodium glutamate (MSG), which induces obesity. These results indicate that 950 bases of the 5' flanking region of the adipsin gene carry information that specifies both expression in adipose tissue and a response to a gene or chemical that induces obesity. These results also suggest that the trans-acting factors that are regulated aberrantly in these forms of obesity are not restricted to adipose tissue and could play a role in obesity-linked dysfunctions observed in other tissues as well.","['Platt, K A', 'Min, H Y', 'Ross, S R', 'Spiegelman, B M']","['Platt KA', 'Min HY', 'Ross SR', 'Spiegelman BM']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Illinois, Chicago 60612.']",['eng'],['DK31405/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.46 (Complement Factor D)', 'EC 3.4.21.46 (complement factor D, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'Complement Factor D', 'Diabetes Mellitus/genetics', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Genes', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Obesity/*genetics', 'Organ Specificity', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*genetics']",PMC298090,1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.86.19.7490 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Oct;86(19):7490-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.86.19.7490.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The distribution patterns in leukemia cells were found to be significantly different from those in the cells of normal individuals. Although genetic alteration of normal leukocytes was not disregarded, the changes of rDNA distribution in leukemia cells are demonstrated in this study. The Ph1 chromosome in CML carried a greater amount of rDNA. The rDNA distribution in Ph1-negative cells obtained from patients showed almost the same pattern as that of Ph1-positive cells. In AML, the t(8;21) carried a smaller amount of rDNA. Trisomic chromosome 21 in CMoL carried extra rDNA copies on its NOR.

The duration of chronic phase in these patients was significantly longer than that in historical controls who were treated conventionally with busulfan. This prolongation was not ascribable to the difference in such prognostic factors between the two therapy groups as splenomegaly, leukocyte count and percentage of peripheral blasts. There was a significant difference again in the duration of chronic phase between the two therapy group even when restricted to each 11 patients with intermediate relative risk (0.7-1.5) according to Sokal et al. Four patients showed thrombocytopenia less than 5 x 10(4)/microliters, but all these patients recovered within 4 months and there was no further critical side effect except subcutaneous bleeding. This study suggests that maintenance of leukocyte count within normal range and suppression of granuloid hyperplasia in bone marrow with busulfan may prolong chronic phase of CML. Probability of clonal evolution may be decreased by reducing the total leukemic cell mass and suppressing cellular turnover of primitive CML stem cells. Another possibility is that prolongation of chronic phase might be dependent on the appearance of normal karyotype clone after long-term bone marrow suppression just like after intensive chemotherapy or alpha-interferon therapy.","['Matsuo, T', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Kuriyama, K', 'Jinnai, I', 'Jubashi, T', 'Nonaka, H', 'Kohno, T', 'Tsukasaki, K', 'Atogami, S', 'Itoyama, T']","['Matsuo T', 'Tomonaga M', 'Kuriyama K', 'Jinnai I', 'Jubashi T', 'Nonaka H', 'Kohno T', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Atogami S', 'Itoyama T', 'et al.']",,['jpn'],,"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,['G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1989 May;30(5):625-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,

When preimplantation mouse embryos were infected with the vector, as expected, the provirus integrated into the embryos and the germ line with the same efficiency as that observed with wild-type Mo-MLV, leading to inactivation of the recombinant virus. In contrast, when postimplantation mouse embryos were microinjected with virus-producing cells, between 90 to 100% of the surviving animals proved to be infected with the virus. The recombinant virus spread as efficiently as wild-type Mo-MLV in the infected embryos, resulting in up to three to five proviral copies per genome in heart, thymus, and brain tissues. Substantial expression of mutant DHFR*-coding viral message was found in all somatic tissues analyzed, the amounts correlating with the proviral copy number in the respective organ. These results suggest that replication-competent vectors are useful for efficient transfer and expression of foreign genes into tissues or whole animals when virus spread is needed.","['Stuhlmann, H', 'Jaenisch, R', 'Mulligan, R C']","['Stuhlmann H', 'Jaenisch R', 'Mulligan RC']","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142.']",['eng'],"['CA38497/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD00635/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*enzymology', 'Female', '*Genes', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*genetics', '*Transfection']",PMC251124,1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.63.11.4857-4865.1989 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Nov;63(11):4857-65. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.11.4857-4865.1989.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analogues with alterations in the carbamate group were prepared by transformations at the carbamate of 8, by reductive cyclization of nitropyridine intermediates, and by hydride reduction of the ring of heteroaromatic compounds. In vitro and in vivo evaluations of analogues indicated that a carbamate group was required for activity. No significant change in activity was observed when ethyl was replaced by methyl. However, activity was reduced when ethyl was replaced with bulky aliphatic groups and when ethoxy was replaced with a methylamino group.

The largest proportion of specific diagnoses came from lavage (14/50) and the smallest from brushings (1/40). Biopsies were also useful for selected patients. The low overall yield for bronchoscopy was probably due to the routine use of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal therapy, as well as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonitis. Subsequent specific diagnoses were obtained by other procedures (open biopsy, needle aspiration, or autopsy) for 10 patients with negative bronchoscopy results and 3 patients with diagnostic bronchoscopies.

To determine whether all these changes serve as signals for secretion, studies were conducted with cells permeabilized with streptolysin O in which pHi and [Ca2+]i could be varied independently of each other and enzyme activities could be manipulated. At resting pHi (approximately 7.0) and [Ca2+]i (0.1 microM), the permeabilized cells showed little secretory response to Ag. At resting pHi, elevated levels of Ca2+ (0.33 microM) were required for maximal secretory response to Ag. At a pHi of 7.4, however, 0.1 microM [Ca2+]i was sufficient to sustain near maximal responses to Ag. Therefore, a small increase of [Ca2+]i to 0.33 microM was required to initiate secretion, but once the pHi was elevated secretion could be sustained at near basal levels of [Ca2+]i. Since elevating the [Ca2+]i and pHi, by themselves promoted little secretion, another potentiating signal must have been generated by antigen stimulation. This signal was possibly transduced via hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids and protein kinase C. Even with an elevated [Ca2+]i (0.33 microM) the hydrolysis of the phospholipids and secretion stimulated by Ag were inhibited by guanosine 5'(2-O-thio)diphosphate and neomycin. Furthermore, both protein-kinase C and the secretory response to Ag were lost after permeabilized cells were washed but both were retained if cells were exposed to PMA before permeabilization.","['Ali, H', 'Collado-Escobar, D M', 'Beaven, M A']","['Ali H', 'Collado-Escobar DM', 'Beaven MA']","['Laboratory of Chemical Pharmacology, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/*immunology', 'Basophils/enzymology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cell-Free System', 'Dinitrophenols/immunology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hydrolysis', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Leukemia/enzymology/immunology/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'Rats', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/immunology', '*Signal Transduction']",,1989/10/15 00:00,1989/10/15 00:01,['1989/10/15 00:00'],"['1989/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Oct 15;143(8):2626-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major differences between the healthy, FeLV-negative control cats and the leukaemic cats were the increased number of hyperdiploid cells and the presence of double minute or morphologically abnormal chromosomes in the leukaemic cats. Three leukaemic cats had cells with double minute chromosomes, while no normal cats had cells with double minute chromosomes. Tetrasomy or trisomy most frequently involved chromosomes C2 and B4. Monosomy was most common in chromosomes A3, C2, D4, E3 and F2. Chromosome abnormalities were also observed in bone marrow cells from two of three healthy, FeLV-positive cats and both cats with thymic lymphosarcoma. Increased numbers of hyperdiploid cells, double minute chromosomes and trisomy of C2 were the most important findings. No correlations between cytogenetic findings and diagnosis or prognosis were found. Additional research is necessary to determine the significance of chromosome aberrations in cells from healthy, FeLV-positive cats. If these changes prove to represent early neoplastic transformation, chromosome analysis could provide valuable diagnostic information and identify patients that might benefit from early chemotherapy. Results of this limited study indicate (1) chromosome aberrations are common in leukaemic cats, (2) chromosome changes are not completely random, (3) direct bone marrow technique for chromosome analysis is generally preferable in leukaemic cats and (4) the cat appears to be a good model in which to study chromosomal abnormalities in leukaemia, though more research is needed.","['Grindem, C B', 'Buoen, L C']","['Grindem CB', 'Buoen LC']","['Department of Microbiology, Pathology, and Parasitology, North Carolina State University, College of Veterinary Medicine, Raleigh 27606.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Comp Pathol,Journal of comparative pathology,0102444,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/*genetics/pathology', 'Cats', 'Chromosome Aberrations/genetics/pathology/*veterinary', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology/*veterinary', 'Ploidies']",,1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0021-9975(89)90073-X [pii]', '10.1016/0021-9975(89)90073-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Comp Pathol. 1989 Jul;101(1):21-30. doi: 10.1016/0021-9975(89)90073-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The membrane phenotype of the circulating cells showed strong immunoglobulin staining and reactivity with CD5 and FMC7 in all cases tested; CD10 was positive in six out of nine cases. The membrane phenotype of two of the five cases of small lymphocytic lymphoma was close to those of B-CLL and three resembled INT lymphoma.

The present study was performed to compare these three reagents in terms of their immunocytochemical reactions and target molecule(s). On Western blotting of white cell extracts the three antibodies reacted with antigens of the same molecular weight (range 110-160 kilodaltons). Furthermore, their immunocytochemical reactivity with normal human cells, as analysed by two-colour flow cytometry, was essentially identical (labelling of monocytes, most T lymphocytes, and weak reactions with some B cells), and the antibodies gave closely similar reactions on 54 white cell derived neoplasms. To identify the target antigen for these three reagents, antibodies from the Third International Workshop on Leucocyte Antigens were reviewed and it was shown that the Western blotting and immunocytochemical reactions of MT1, L60 (Leu-22), and DF-T1 were identical with those of the reagents which defined the CD43 antigen (also known as leucosialin or sialophorin).

A calcium-dependent lectin is the principle mediator of binding to the high endothelial venule of lymph nodes.,1196-205,"This study documents that a calcium-dependent phosphomanosyl-binding site on human lymphoid malignancies mediates attachment to the peripheral node high endothelial venule (PNHEV). The phorbol ester PMA coordinately upregulates lectin activity and binding to the PNHEV in the human T-lymphoblastic cell line Jurkat but not in the less phenotypically mature lines HSB2, Molt4, CEM, and HPB-ALL. In contrast, expression of CD18, CD2, and several common epitopes of the putative adhesion receptor gp90Hermes (CD44) did not correlate with attachment to PNHEV in this series of cell lines. Insensitivity to inhibition by the CD18 MAb TS 1.18, temperature and divalent cation requirements further distinguish the Jurkat-PNHEV adhesive interaction from CD11a/18- and CD2-mediated adhesion. The PMA-induced phenotypic changes in the Jurkat line parallel late thymocyte differentiation as well as lymphocyte activation, suggesting that expression of the endothelial-binding lectin may be linked to one or both of these processes. The lectin-like activity on Jurkat cells is functionally indistinguishable from those previously linked to PNHEV recognition in normal human lymphocytes, normal rat lymphocytes and both normal and malignant murine lymphoid cells. In the mouse, this activity is either contained in or functionally linked to a member of the LEC-CAM family gp90Mel14, suggesting that Jurkat cells express the human homologue of the murine nodal homing receptor. Thus cultured T lymphoblastic malignancies express a variety of potential endothelial adhesion molecules but use primarily a highly conserved surface lectin to interact with PNHEV.","['Stoolman, L M', 'Ebling, H']","['Stoolman LM', 'Ebling H']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan School of Medicine, Ann Arbor 48109-0602.']",['eng'],['K08-CA00959-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lectins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Humans', 'Lectins/*metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC329778,1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI114285 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1989 Oct;84(4):1196-205. doi: 10.1172/JCI114285.,,,,,,,,,,,,

BMY-28090 was evaluated for in vivo antitumor activity in a variety of experimental murine tumor and human tumor xenograft models. Initial testing against the murine tumor models was performed using BMY-28090 as the water insoluble free base whereas subsequent antitumor tests were performed using water soluble lactate or succinate salts. BMY-28090 administered ip demonstrated good, reproducible antitumor activity against ip implanted P388 leukemia, L1210 leukemia, B16 melanoma and M5076 sarcoma. The water soluble preparations of BMY-28090 were active iv against sc implanted B16 melanoma and M5076 sarcoma as well as subrenal capsule (src) M5076 sarcoma; activity against src implanted B16 was marginal. BMY-28090 lactate was also evaluated for activity against src implanted MX-1 human mammary tumor xenografts in nude mice and the HCT116 human colon tumor xenografts in immune-suppressed BDF1 mice. At maximum tolerated doses administered ip, BMY-28090 was active against the MX-1 xenograft in two of three tests, causing greater than 90% inhibition of tumor growth. BMY-28090 administered iv at maximally tolerated doses had marginal activity against the HCT116 xenografts, producing 61% and 68% inhibition of tumor growth in two tests. The results of these studies demonstrated that BMY-28090 has a broad spectrum of in vitro cytotoxicity against both murine and human tumor cell lines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Schurig, J E', 'Bradner, W T', 'Basler, G A', 'Rose, W C']","['Schurig JE', 'Bradner WT', 'Basler GA', 'Rose WC']","['Bristol-Myers Co., Inc., Pharmaceutical Research and Development Division, Wallingford, CT 06492.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', 'ZTV0FOB6NU (elsamicin A)']",IM,"['*Aminoglycosides', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",,1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00170854 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1989 Jul;7(2-3):173-8. doi: 10.1007/BF00170854.,,,,,,,,,,,,

P. Spiculifer, is reported to have broad spectrum antimicrobial activity in vitro as well as in vitro activity against L1210 murine leukemia. To more fully evaluate this compound as an anticancer agent, the in vitro cell growth inhibitory potencies of synthetic racemic ptilocaulin and ten clinical anticancer drugs were determined and compared in 16 different normal and transformed human and murine cell populations. Potency, expressed as the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50), was determined by a tetrazolium reduction (MTT) assay. Ptilocaulin showed a fairly broad spectrum of in vitro activity against colon and mammary adenocarcinomas, melanomas, leukemias, transformed fibroblasts and normal lymphoid cells (IC50s 0.05- greater than 10 micrograms/ml). This activity was comparable to that of many of the clinical drugs, including vinca alkyloids, antibiotics, alkylators and antimetabolites. Cell viability was affected only after a 72 hr exposure to the compound. In a clonogenic assay, cytocidal effects were observed after 24-72 hr exposures to 10 x IC50 concentrations of ptilocaulin, as evidenced by failure of cells to resume growth after removal of the compound. Cytostatic effects were observed at less than or equal to IC50 concentrations, as evidenced by resumption of growth to near-control levels after removal of the compound. Ptilocaulin was toxic at 50 and 25 mg/kg in an in vivo L1210 tumor model and was ineffective at lower concentrations (T/Cs 100-112%). In vivo studies in a more sensitive tumor system are recommended but are limited by the lack of availability of sufficient quantities of the compound.","['Ruben, R L', 'Snider, B B', 'Hobbs, F W Jr', 'Confalone, P N', 'Dusak, B A']","['Ruben RL', 'Snider BB', 'Hobbs FW Jr', 'Confalone PN', 'Dusak BA']","['E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, Inc., Medical Products Department, Glenolden, PA 19036.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', '78777-02-3 (ptilocaulin)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'Trypan Blue', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/pathology']",,1989/07/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00170851 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1989 Jul;7(2-3):147-54. doi: 10.1007/BF00170851.,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the reasons for remission failure differed among therapy groups. The number of responders was significantly higher among patients who received a remission induction therapy with an anthracycline and/or L-asparaginase. Maintenance therapy consisted in most cases of 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate with reinduction courses for 2-3 years. Median survival time was 13 months and median duration of first remission (MRD) 11 months.

In all patients the IFN treatment was interrupted to obtain an increase of the peripheral WBC necessary for its collection by means of leukapheresis. After a median time of 20.5 weeks from discontinuance of therapy, most patients are still under hematological disease control. Serially performed cell cultures have shown deeply and persistently reduced growth patterns; cytogenetic analyses have displayed Ph' mosaicism, but with a progressive increase in time of Ph' + cells. Such findings reveal that the effect of alpha-2-IFN in CML patients can be unexpectedly prolonged after discontinuance of treatment. A possible explanation might be found in the complexity of the biological mechanisms of action of IFN, thus giving this drug promising therapeutic prospects in the treatment of CML.","['Alimena, G', 'Montefusco, E', 'Mancini, M', 'De Fabritiis, P', 'Cedrone, M', 'Sandrelli, A', 'Mandelli, F']","['Alimena G', 'Montefusco E', 'Mancini M', 'De Fabritiis P', 'Cedrone M', 'Sandrelli A', 'Mandelli F']","['Department of Human Biopathology, University of Rome La Sapienza, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['0 (Interferon Type I)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1989.tb00265.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1989 Aug;43(2):108-11. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1989.tb00265.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of the established cell clones revealed a number of interesting features: (i) a limited fraction of the total cell population (less than 25% in each clone) was positive for IL-2R alpha; (ii) the IL-2R alpha expression was not permanent, as the IL-2R alpha positive and negative cells could convert either way. The experimental data suggest that the observed heterogeneity in IL-2R alpha expression in the transformants is due to a cell-cycle-regulated expression and function of tax-1.

The expected number of leukemia deaths was calculated and compared to the actual number of leukemia deaths that occurred. The overall standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for leukemia was 337. Person-years at risk within the cohort were stratified by increasing levels of cumulative benzene exposure. The resulting SMRs increased from 109 to 322 to 1186 and to 6637 with respective increases in cumulative benzene exposure from less than 40 ppm-years to 40-199, 200-399, and greater than 400. The shape of the exposure-response relation was examined with a case-control analysis. Another analysis was performed to take into account an induction period for leukemia. All of the analyses demonstrated that a strongly positive exposure-response relationship exists between benzene and leukemia. Previous attempts to quantify this cohort's risk of developing leukemia were based on surrogates of exposure, such as duration of employment. Using actual air sampling data to estimate individual exposures represents a marked improvement over these previous attempts and emphasizes the importance of conducting industrial hygiene surveys and maintaining historical exposure records.","['Rinsky, R A']",['Rinsky RA'],"['National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety, Cincinnati, OH 45226.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],IM,"['Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Male', 'Mathematics', 'National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, U.S.', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Risk', 'United States']",PMC1568103,1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.8982189 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1989 Jul;82:189-91. doi: 10.1289/ehp.8982189.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1978, on the basis of strong but incomplete data then available on the risk of benzene-induced leukemia, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) reduced the permissible occupational exposure standard for benzene from 10 ppm to 1 ppm. Shortly thereafter, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed this ruling, and in 1980, the Supreme Court overturned the regulation, citing insufficient evidence of benefit. Thus, from 1978 until the standard was again lowered to 1 ppm in 1987, American workers were exposed to benzene at levels in excess of 1 ppm. An estimated 9600 were exposed to levels between 1 and 10 ppm, and an additional 370 were exposed at levels above 10 ppm. To assess the risk resulting from this delay in regulation, we have conducted an epidemiologic risk analysis. We merged data on numbers of persons (238,000) exposed to benzene in seven occupational categories with dose-response data from three epidemiologic studies. The range of risk in these studies indicates that 44 to 152 excess leukemia deaths will ultimately result from exposure to benzene at 10 ppm over a working lifetime (45 years) and that lower or briefer exposures will result in proportionately fewer deaths. On this basis, we calculated that between 30 and 490 excess leukemia deaths will ultimately result from occupational exposures to benzene greater than 1 ppm that occurred between 1978 and 1987. Deaths from aplastic anemia and lymphoma will likely add to this toll. These data confirm the risk of regulatory delay. They suggest that the courts, in reviewing public health regulations, must beware of facile cost-benefit arguments and be willing to accept strong evidence of health risk even when such evidence is incomplete.","['Nicholson, W J', 'Landrigan, P J']","['Nicholson WJ', 'Landrigan PJ']","['Department of Community Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],IM,"['Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Maximum Allowable Concentration', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Risk', 'Time Factors', 'United States', 'United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration']",PMC1568134,1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.8982185 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1989 Jul;82:185-8. doi: 10.1289/ehp.8982185.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient noticed paresthesia in the soles at the age of 17, and gait disturbance and urinary retention at the age of 20. These symptoms progressed slowly. The patient showed indurations in both hypothenar regions and leukocytosis of 17,900/microliters in the peripheral blood at the age of 41. On admission to our hospital, she had spastic gait, muscle weakness of four extremities, increased deep tendon reflexes, pathologic reflexes, mild decreased of vibration sense and vesico-rectal disturbance. Anti-HTLV-I antibody (PA method) was increased to 1,024 fold in serum and 64 fold in spinal fluid. Thus, this patient was diagnosed as having HAM. In addition, leukocyte count in the peripheral blood was increased to 17,200/microliters including 33% atypical lymphocytes, and lymphocytes subset analysis showed 96.1% CD4+, 1.8% CD8+ and marked increase in CD4/CD8 ratio. Southern blot analysis of HTLV-I provirus DNA in the lymphocytes was of complete type with a monoclonal mode of integration. These findings indicated a diagnosis of ATL for this patient. HLA typing revealed A2, A11, Bw22, Bw46, Cw1, Cw3, being compatible with HAM type reported by Usuku et al. HAM and ATL were reported to be caused by an identical virus. However, there has been no case report of combination of the two diseases.

Expression of the beta-globin DNA sequences in K-562 cells can occur, however, under certain conditions. To readdress this issue and to examine the possibility of whether these cells produce immature and untranslatable beta-globin RNA transcripts, we prepared total cytoplasmic RNA from control and inducer-treated cells and performed Northern blot hybridization analysis using 5' end-labeled fragments of the human beta-globin DNA rather than 3' end fragments as probes. Although hybridization of both cytoplasmic and nuclear K-562 RNA with a 32P-labeled 3' end fragment (1.6kb Bam H1 cut) coding for a large part of the first exon of beta-globin failed to detect beta-globin RNA transcripts, hybridization with a 5' end 32P-Labeled 2.0kb Bam H1 fragment (coding for the third exon and part of the second) revealed the presence of relatively small (less than 7S) RNA molecules both in nuclear and cytoplasmic fraction. S1 nuclease mapping of both cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA with the use of 5' end-labeled 2.0 kb Bam H1 fragment of human beta-globin DNA indicated protection of a small portion located 64 bp 5' upstream from the Bam H1 site of the second exon.

Among 6,285 patients examined by X-ray fluoroscopy an average of 77 times during lung collapse therapy and followed for up to 50 yr (average = 25 yr), no increase in the total number of cancer deaths occurred [standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 1.05, n = 424]. In contrast, the 7,100 patients treated by other means were at significant risk of dying from cancer (SMR = 1.3), especially of sites linked to cigarette smoking and alcohol use. Among the irradiated patients, estimates of mean radiation doses to the breast, lung, esophagus, and active bone marrow were 0.75, 0.84, 0.80, and 0.09 Gy, respectively. Cancers of the breast (SMR = 1.4, n = 62) and esophagus (SMR = 2.1, n = 14) were significantly increased. The risk of esophageal cancer, however, decreased with time since exposure. Lung cancer (SMR = 0.8, n = 69) and leukemia (SMR = 1.2, n = 17) were not elevated. Despite a wide range of doses to the lung, reaching over 8 Gy, there was no evidence of a dose response. Lung cancer risk also did not vary by time since exposure or age at exposure. Adjustment for smoking and the amount of lung tissue at risk did not appreciably modify these findings. These data suggest that frequent exposures to low doses of radiation over a period of several years increase the occurrence of cancer of the breast. When compared with studies of atomic bomb survivors, however, the fractionated exposures experienced by this cohort appear less effective in causing lung cancer than single exposures of the same total dose.","['Davis, F G', 'Boice, J D Jr', 'Hrubec, Z', 'Monson, R R']","['Davis FG', 'Boice JD Jr', 'Hrubec Z', 'Monson RR']","['Epidemiology-Biometry Program, School of Public Health, University of Illinois, Chicago 60680.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Massachusetts', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology/*mortality', 'Radiography/adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Tuberculosis, Pulmonary/*diagnostic imaging']",,1989/11/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Nov 1;49(21):6130-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this procedure, vesicles exhibiting transmembrane pH gradients (acidic inside) were employed to achieve drug trapping efficiencies in excess of 98%. Drug-to-lipid ratios as high as 0.3:1 (wt:wt) could be obtained in a manner that is relatively independent of lipid composition and vesicle size. Egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC)/cholesterol (55:45; mol/mol) vesicles sized through filters with a 200-nm pore size and loaded employing transmembrane pH gradients to achieve a doxorubicin-to-lipid ratio of 0.3:1 (wt/wt) increased the LD50 of free drug by approximately twofold. Removing cholesterol or decreasing the drug-to-lipid ratio in EPC/cholesterol preparations led to significant decreases in the LD50 of liposomal doxorubicin whereas, the LD50 increased 4- to 6-fold when distearoylphosphatidylcholine was substituted for EPC. The results suggest that the stability of liposomally entrapped doxorubicin in the circulation is an important factor in the toxicity of this drug in liposomal form. In contrast, the antitumor activity of liposomal doxorubicin is not influenced dramatically by alterations in lipid composition. Liposomal doxorubicin preparations of EPC, EPC/cholesterol (55:45; mol:mol), EPC/egg phosphatidylglycerol (EPG)/cholesterol (27.5:27.5:45; mol:mol), and distearoylphosphatidylcholine/cholesterol (55:45; mol:mol) all demonstrated similar efficacy to that of free drug when given at doses of 20 mg/kg and below. Higher dose levels of the less toxic formulations could be administered, leading to enhanced increases in life span (ILS) values. Variations in vesicle size, however, strongly influenced the antitumor activity of liposomal doxorubicin. At a dose of 20 mg/kg, large EPC/cholesterol systems are significantly less effective than free drug (with ILS values of 65% and 145%, respectively). In contrast, small systems sized through filters with a 100-nm pore size are more effective than free drug, resulting in an ILS of 375% and a 30% long term (greater than 60 days) survival rate when administered at a dose of 20 mg/kg.

When DNA integrity was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, a nucleosomal ladder became evident 1.5-2 h after addition of etoposide to cells, increased in intensity over 6 h, and persisted at 24 h. Six h after addition of the drug, 94 +/- 4% of the cells excluded trypan blue even though as much as 90% of the DNA had been degraded to oligosomal fragments. Exposure of cells to 10 micrograms/ml (17 microM) etoposide for as little as 45 min was sufficient to induce this DNA damage 4 h later. Preincubation with dinitrophenol abolished the effect of etoposide, suggesting that an energy-requiring step occurred prior to or during the endonucleolytic cleavage. In contrast, the effect of etoposide was not prevented by preincubation of HL-60 cells with the RNA synthesis inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole or the protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide or puromycin. On the contrary, high concentrations of 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole, cycloheximide, or puromycin by themselves induced the same endonucleolytic cleavage, as did a variety of diverse cytotoxic agents, including camptothecin (0.1 microM), colcemid (0.1 microgram/ml), cis-platinum (20 microM), methotrexate (1 microM), and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (3 microM). These results suggest that endonucleolytic DNA damage by a preexisting cellular enzyme occurs soon after treatment of HL-60 cells with any of a variety of cytotoxic agents. The observation that a variety of nuclear proteins [including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, lamin B, topoisomerase I, topoisomerase II, and histone H1] are degraded concomitant with the DNA fragmentation calls into question the selectivity of the degradative process for DNA. The implications of these results for (a) current theories which focus upon endonucleolytic damage of DNA as a critical early event during cell death, and (b) use of topoisomerase-directed drugs to map topoisomerase-binding sites in active chromatin are discussed.","['Kaufmann, S H']",['Kaufmann SH'],"['Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']",['eng'],['CA 06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*drug effects/metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Dinitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",,1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Nov 1;49(21):5870-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work assessed verapamil sensitization of human multidrug-resistant lymphocytic and myeloid leukemic cell lines (CEM/VLB100, HL-60/AR) to vincristine during exposures of short duration (4 h). When cells were transferred to drug-free medium immediately after simultaneous 4-h exposures to vincristine and verapamil, the antiproliferative activity of vincristine was not altered in CEM/VLB100 cells and was only moderately increased in HL-60/AR cells. In contrast, when cells were transferred to verapamil-containing medium, vincristine activity was greatly increased against both CEM/VLB100 and HL-60/AR cells. Verapamil enhanced accumulation and inhibited release of [3H]vincristine by CEM/VLB100 and HL-60/AR cells, indicating that the sensitization was due to an increase in cell-associated vincristine after transfer of cells to vincristine-free medium. Slot blot analysis of cellular RNA with the pMDR1 probe revealed high levels of expression of the mdr1 gene in CEM/VLB100 cells but no detectable expression in HL-60/AR cells. Consistent with this finding, polypeptides (Mr 170,000 to 180,000) that were recognized by a monoclonal antibody (C219) against P-glycoprotein were greatly overexpressed in CEM/VLB100 cells, but were expressed at low levels, if at all, in HL-60/AR cells.

Since enhanced expression of the MDR1 gene in ADR-resistant cells may be the result of spontaneous genetic mutation or amplification, it is presumed to be relatively stable and unalterable. Yet, reducing ADR efflux could increase sensitivity, and has been attempted using calcium channel blockers and other drugs. However, since the tumor cell microenvironment varies with respect to pH because of differences in vascularization, oxygenation, and metabolite clearance, the possibility exists that these factors could influence drug transport and the critical biochemical pathways which determine cytotoxicity, even in resistant cells. Using flow cytometric analysis of ADR fluorescence, the influx and efflux of 10 microM ADR dissolved in MES buffer (pH 6.5) and 4-(2-hydroxyethylene)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid buffer (pH 7.5 and 8.5) was measured in sensitive P388 and resistant P388/R84 cells in vitro. Substantially enhanced uptake of ADR was detected at alkaline pH in both cell populations, while the proportion of ADR-positive cells and the level of ADR uptake was decreased at lower pH. Acidification reduced ADR efflux, whereas alkalinization increased efflux when the uptake pH was 6.5 or 7.5. At uptake pH 8.5, the pH of the external buffer had little effect, even in resistant cells. In resistant cells in an alkaline microenvironment, ADR transport and retention were superior to that observed in sensitive cells in an acidic microenvironment. No differences were observed in ADR transport when the transmembrane pH gradient was equilibrated. These observations are especially relevant to the effect of ADR on tumor cell subpopulations that are acidic, and in which drug diffusion is inefficient. Efforts to alkalinize tumor cells prior to ADR therapy might reduce ADR resistance, even of genetic origin.","['Alabaster, O', 'Woods, T', 'Ortiz-Sanchez, V', 'Jahangeer, S']","['Alabaster O', 'Woods T', 'Ortiz-Sanchez V', 'Jahangeer S']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, George Washington University, Washington, DC 20037.']",['eng'],['R01-CA32756/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism/*toxicity', '*Drug Resistance', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia P388', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mice']",,1989/10/15 00:00,1989/10/15 00:01,['1989/10/15 00:00'],"['1989/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Oct 15;49(20):5638-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 12-year study.,57-65,"Between 1979 and 1988, 86 patients with clinical and laboratory findings consistent with essential thrombocythemia (ET) were karyotyped at diagnosis. Four patients showed a Philadelphia chromosome and underwent myeloid blastic crisis 2.5-4.5 years later, strongly suggesting a diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia. A partial deletion of 13q was seen in another case evolving to leukemia a few months later. Five cases, with normal karyotypes at diagnosis, developed acute transformation after more than 5 years of chronic phase. Four of them showed unusual clonal karyotype abnormalities involving different chromosomal regions. The numerical abnormalities found were trisomy 22 in one case, and trisomy 8 and 19 in another, while structural changes included partial deletion of 5p, partial deletion of 6q, pericentric inversion of chromosome 12, and partial deletion of 20q. These abnormalities have not been previously reported in ET. This investigation confirms the absence of a specific cytogenetic marker for ET, and the infrequent transformation to acute leukemia, often with chromosomal clonal disorders.","['Sessarego, M', 'Defferrari, R', 'Dejana, A M', 'Rebuttato, A M', 'Fugazza, G', 'Salvidio, E', 'Ajmar, F']","['Sessarego M', 'Defferrari R', 'Dejana AM', 'Rebuttato AM', 'Fugazza G', 'Salvidio E', 'Ajmar F']","['Cattedra di Clinica Medica R, University of Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/etiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/complications/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Time Factors']",,1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(89)90127-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(89)90127-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1989 Nov;43(1):57-65. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(89)90127-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,

These differences in fragile sites between PBL and BM may be related to distinct functions of cells in different tissues. The total number of breaks in PBL and BM showed a significant difference among individuals, but the sites were generally common. The frequency of breaks in PBL from leukemia patients was higher than in controls when the leukemic cells had any karyotypic abnormalities. In leukemia without karyotypic abnormalities and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with (15:17), the frequency of breaks fell within normal or slightly above normal ranges. Breaks at 3p14 (22.0% of total breaks), 16q23 (7.3%), 7q32 (4.3%), Xp22 (3.7%), and 6q26 (2.9%) were frequent in PBL from seven AML patients. Breaks at 4q21-25 (2.1%), 7q22 (2.2%), 7q32, and Xp22 were more frequently induced than in controls, and 1p32 (0.1%), 3p14, 6q26, and 16q23 were less often expressed than in controls. On the other hand, PBL from acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients showed a higher frequency of breaks only at 1p22 (3.4%) and the frequency of breaks at 3p14 (30.2%) decreased (p less than 0.05). The PBL from AML patients with t(8;21) (q22;q22) showed breaks at 8q22 and 8q24, and the frequencies were significantly higher than those of other types of leukemia or in controls (p less than 0.001).

Based on this experience, we investigated whether at least some of the 17 AML cases with trisomy 22 reported so far might possibly have been misinterpreted.

This precise genomic mutation probably has a significant role in the development of leukemia in humans, but that leukemia may take several forms: chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and essential thrombocythemia; CML also transforms to a lymphoid or myeloid acute phase. Two models are considered with regard to determinants of this variable hematologic expression of BCR-ABL. The first is variation in the breakpoint site of BCR1. Two breakpoint sites, M-BCR and m-BCR, are known, and their occurrence shows a nonrandom association with the different forms of leukemia. The precise position of the breakpoint within M-BCR may also be important. The second model concerns the role of other genes in determining the leukemic form shown by BCR-ABL. Results are reviewed of a patient who entered blast crisis CML and whose leukemic clones involved ten genetic loci with known leukemic associations. Many of these were probably genetic variants that allowed leukemic proliferations following the initiation of blast crisis. The multiplicity of these genes may obscure the prime determinant of blast crisis, which is unknown at the present time.","['Fitzgerald, P H', 'Morris, C M']","['Fitzgerald PH', 'Morris CM']","['Cytogenetic and Molecular Oncology Unit, Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Oncogenes', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(89)90003-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(89)90003-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1989 Oct 1;42(1):9-25. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(89)90003-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chromosomes recurrently involved in numerical or structural anomalies are chromosomes 7, 5, 17, and 11, in decreasing order of frequency. The distribution of the anomalies detected in this sample of patients is similar to that observed in published cases with prior breast or other solid tumors, though anomalies of chromosome 11 were not pointed out, but it significantly differs from that of the S-ANLL with prior hematologic malignancies. This difference is principally due to a higher involvement of chromosome 7 in patients with prior hematologic malignancies and of chromosomes 11 and 17 in patients with prior solid tumors. A genetic determinism involving abnormal recessive alleles located on chromosomes 5, 7, 11, and 17 uncovered by deletions of the normal homologs may be a cause of S-ANLL. The difference between patients with prior hematologic malignancies or solid tumors may be explained by different constitutional mutations of recessive genes in the two groups of patients.","['Mamuris, Z', 'Dumont, J', 'Dutrillaux, B', 'Aurias, A']","['Mamuris Z', 'Dumont J', 'Dutrillaux B', 'Aurias A']","['C.

In most cases, treatment was started because of worsening peripheral cytopenia, increase in bone marrow blasts, or transition of MDS to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Of 51 patients (age range, 18-82 years) receiving low-dose Ara-C by subcutaneous bolus injection (10 mg/m2 every 12 hours) or continuous intravenous infusion (20 mg/m2/day), nine (18%) entered complete remission (CR) and four (8%) had a partial response (PR). Duration of CR varied from 4 to 25+ months. Overall survival of patients treated with Ara-C was not superior to that of a historical control receiving supportive care only. Hematologic toxicity of low-dose Ara-C was considerable, with 12 patients (24%) dying of hemorrhage or infection during the initial treatment course. Sixteen patients (age range, 17-65 years) who presented with a Karnofsky score of more than 80% were chosen for aggressive chemotherapy using standard AML protocols. In this group, nine CR and two PR were obtained. Early death from pneumonia occurred in two patients, and three patients had refractory disease. The factors most strongly associated with successful remission induction were (1) presence of Auer rods in granulocyte precursors, and (2) a comparatively low medullary blast count (less than 30%) at the start of treatment. Median duration of bone marrow aplasia for patients entering CR was 21 days (range, 6-51). Prolonged remissions (22+, 27+, and 29 months, respectively) could be achieved in three of four patients receiving consolidation and maintenance chemotherapy after induction of CR. From these data we conclude that aggressive chemotherapy should not generally be considered contraindicated in advanced MDS. In patients with a good Karnofsky score, this form of treatment may be more advantageous than the currently favored low-dose Ara-C, which is also myelotoxic, but induces remissions in only a minority of patients.","['Aul, C', 'Schneider, W']","['Aul C', 'Schneider W']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage']",,1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19891101)64:9<1812::aid-cncr2820640909>3.0.co;2-i [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1989 Nov 1;64(9):1812-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19891101)64:9<1812::aid-cncr2820640909>3.0.co;2-i.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such a program, devised at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), Boston, and incorporating high-dose L-asparaginase, was adopted in 1984 by the Children's Hospital at Chedoke-McMaster, Hamilton, Ont., and the Children's Hospital of Western Ontario, London. We describe the experience of these institutions in the treatment of 82 children with ALL, 19 of whom were switched to the DFCI protocols while in continuing first remission with other treatment programs to complete a minimum of 2 years of maintenance therapy; the remaining 63 children, who had recently diagnosed disease, were consecutively enrolled in the DFCI protocols. Each child was assigned at diagnosis to a category of risk for relapse and treated accordingly. There were no remission induction failures or deaths due to induction therapy among the patients with newly diagnosed disease. There were no differences in total or event-free survival rates between the patients in Hamilton and those in London or between those whose protocols were switched and those who were treated from the beginning with the DFCI protocols. With a median follow-up interval of 144 weeks the total survival rate was 95% and the event-free survival rate 88%. For patients at standard risk of relapse the event-free survival rate was 100%, for those at high risk the rate was 82%, and for those at very high risk the rate was 67%. If infants (all of whom suffered a relapse) are excluded from the last category the rate was 89%. These results were achieved with moderate toxic effects (except for two deaths, one of which was due to a therapeutic misadventure) and suggest that the prospect for cure in children with ALL. may now approximate 80%, a degree of success that demands that consideration be given to reducing total therapy, at least for children with standard-risk disease. Further follow-up will determine whether these high event-free survival rates will stabilize and meet the criteria for cure.","['Desai, S J', 'Barr, R D', 'Andrew, M', 'deVeber, L L', 'Pai, M K']","['Desai SJ', 'Barr RD', 'Andrew M', 'deVeber LL', 'Pai MK']","['Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ont.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Canada,CMAJ,CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,9711805,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'POMP protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Boston', 'Child', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Ontario', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",PMC1452761,1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,CMAJ. 1989 Oct 1;141(7):693-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

A lag of 7 days was found before circulating CFU-GM (colony forming unit-granulocyte, monocyte) reappeared, while BFU-E (burst forming unit-erythroid) were detectable in only two patients in the first 4 weeks.

This pattern of circulating progenitor cell recovery post-transplantation was consistently seen in all patients.

In spite of this anti-GVHD effect, TCD syngeneic marrow is ultimately eliminated by non-TCD allogeneic marrow, permitting complete allogeneic reconstitution. These observations suggested that allogeneic BM might also eliminate host-type leukemic cells in a model in which TCD syngeneic marrow is co-administered to provide protection from GVHD. In the present studies, we describe the establishment of a new model using the EL4 leukemia/lymphoma. Lethally irradiated B10 (H-2b) mice were given a lethal dose of EL4 cells (H-2b) along with syngeneic marrow or a mixture of TCD syngeneic plus non-TCD allogeneic (B10.D2, H-2d) marrow. Non-TCD allogeneic marrow, in contrast to TCD or unmanipulated syngeneic marrow, delayed or prevented mortality from the otherwise lethal EL4 inoculum, without producing clinically apparent GVHD. The anti-leukemic effect of allogeneic marrow alone was not attenuated by the co-administration of TCD syngeneic marrow, and such animals repopulated as completely allogeneic chimeras. Similar anti-leukemic effects of mixed marrow inocula in a haploidentical strain combination, and an anti-leukemic effect against established tumor were also demonstrated. This model may have the potential to increase the safety of clinical bone marrow transplantation across greater HLA disparities, while permitting utilization of the anti-leukemic and alloengraftment-promoting effects of T cells in allogeneic marrow inocula.","['Sykes, M', 'Bukhari, Z', 'Sachs, D H']","['Sykes M', 'Bukhari Z', 'Sachs DH']","['Transplantation Biology Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/immunology', 'Chimera', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*surgery', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",,1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1989 Sep;4(5):465-74.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Macrophage differentiation is accompanied by a gradual decrease in both the transcription rate (10x) and the steady-state level (6x) of SOD-1 mRNA. No decrease was observed after treatment with the diacylglycerol analog 1,2 dioctanol-rac-glycerol (di-C8), which like phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also activates protein kinase C but does not induce differentiation at the concentration used.

These data suggest that a decrease in SOD-1 mRNA to almost undetectable levels accompanies differentiation of macrophages and granulocytes.","['Auwerx, J H', 'Chait, A', 'Wolfbauer, G', 'Deeb, S S']","['Auwerx JH', 'Chait A', 'Wolfbauer G', 'Deeb SS']","['Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology, and Nutrition, University of Washington, Seattle.']",['eng'],"['DK 02456/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 15253/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 30086/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1069-87-0 (1,2-dioctanoylglycerol)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Diglycerides/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Macrophages/cytology/enzymology', 'Monocytes', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Superoxide Dismutase/*genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects']",,1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75700-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Oct;74(5):1807-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eleven cases were de novo ANLL-M7, of whom three presented with acute myelofibrosis. Four cases were megakaryoblastic transformations of chronic myelogenous leukemia (two cases), refractory anemia with excess of blasts (one case), and polycythemia vera (one case). Four patients showed a minority of granular blasts, with occasional Auer rods in one. Positive myeloperoxidase and/or sudan black-B stainings and CD13 positivity in these cases were consistent with the presence of a myeloid involvement. Morphologic evidence of associated myelodysplastic features was detected in all evaluable patients with de novo ANLL-M7. These cytologic findings indicate that ANLL-M7 may frequently represent a multilineage proliferation. Cytogenetic studies revealed -7/7q- and +8, alone or in combination with additional aberrations, in three cases each.

To analyze the molecular events associated with hematopoietic cell differentiation, we analyzed the configuration of the immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) delta, alpha, gamma, and beta genes in these patients. In parallel, transcription of the genes for MPO, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT), CD3-gamma, Ig-mu, TCR-gamma, and beta was also examined. Six patients showed rearrangements of both the Ig heavy (H) and TCR-delta genes, frequently accompanied with Ig-kappa, TCR-alpha, gamma, and beta gene rearrangements. These findings indicated that the leukemic cells from the six patients had been committed to the lymphoid lineage. This concept was supported by the presence of TdT transcripts in three analyzed specimens from these patients. In contrast, the remaining five patients did not display rearrangements of the Ig or TCR genes, and TdT transcripts were undetectable in two patients tested. MPO transcripts were not detected in four patients analyzed, thus providing no evidence of myeloid differentiation. After hybridization with the CD3-gamma gene, three of six patients showed transcription of the CD3-gamma gene. In addition to CD3-gamma transcripts, one patient with rearrangements of the Ig-H, TCR-delta, alpha, gamma, and beta genes also had full-length TCR-beta and gamma transcripts, indicating a T-precursor-cell origin of the leukemic cells from this patient. The Ig and TCR genes were in the germline configuration in the other two patients with CD3-gamma transcripts. One of them did not express the CD7 antigen but did express the CD33 antigen on the cell surface, suggesting that CD3-gamma transcription may not always be an event restricted to cells differentiating along the T-cell lineage.","['Hara, J', 'Yumura-Yagi, K', 'Tawa, A', 'Ishihara, S', 'Murata, M', 'Terada, N', 'Izumi, Y', 'Champagne, E', 'Takihara, Y', 'Mak, T W']","['Hara J', 'Yumura-Yagi K', 'Tawa A', 'Ishihara S', 'Murata M', 'Terada N', 'Izumi Y', 'Champagne E', 'Takihara Y', 'Mak TW', 'et al.']","['Department of Pediatrics, Osaka University Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/classification/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Monocytes/analysis', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/genetics/immunology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping']",,1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75690-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Oct;74(5):1738-46.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although not an essential amino acid, glutamine is important in the growth of normal and neoplastic cells. The glutamine analogue, alpha S,5S-alpha-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid (acivicin) inhibits several glutamine-utilizing enzymes and therefore depletes cells of certain metabolic end products. The current study was designed to examine in vitro the effects of acivicin on growth and differentiation of several established human myeloid leukemia cell lines, including the HL-60 cell line, and of freshly isolated cells from patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Four-day culture of HL-60 cells with acivicin at concentrations of 0.1 to 10.0 micrograms/mL (0.56 to 56 nmol/L) decreased cell growth by 33% to 88% as compared with untreated control cells. Viability of cells was greater than 92% for untreated cells and 93% to 41% for acivicin-treated cells. Cells treated with acivicin differentiated along a monocytic pathway as shown by increased H2O2 production and alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase (NSE) content. Differentiation was time and dose dependent, and was irreversible. Changes in H2O2 production and NSE content were partially abrogated by co-culture with 10 mmol/L exogenous cytidine and guanosine but not by co-culture with other nucleosides or glutamine. At these concentrations of acivicin, differentiation was associated with expression of the N-formyl-methyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-receptor (FMLP-R) on 8% to 29% of cells as compared with 8% for control cells. Acivicin potentiated the differentiating effects of interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor, dihydroxyvitamin D3, dimethylsulfoxide, and retinoic acid. Culture of cells from the U937 (monoblastic), K562 (erythroleukemia), and KG-1 (myeloblastic) cell lines resulted in decreased growth and viability, but not consistently in differentiation. Acivicin decreased survival of freshly isolated ANLL cells and increased their H2O2 production and NSE content. These results suggest that the glutamine analogue acivicin may be useful as a differentiating agent with antileukemia activity in patients with ANLL.","['Nichols, K E', 'Chitneni, S R', 'Moore, J O', 'Weinberg, J B']","['Nichols KE', 'Chitneni SR', 'Moore JO', 'Weinberg JB']","['VA Medical Center, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Durham, NC.']",['eng'],"['AI23308/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AR39162/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09307/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', '0 (Oxazoles)', 'O0X60K76I6 (acivicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Isoxazoles/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Leukocytes/*cytology/drug effects/pathology', 'Oxazoles/*pharmacology', 'Reference Values', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology/drug effects']",,1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75689-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Oct;74(5):1728-37.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The drug resistant mutant lines (CEM/V, a T-cell leukemia line resistant to vinblastine, and 8226/D, a multiple myeloma line resistant to doxorubicin), were markedly more sensitive to rTNF in clonogenic assay than were their drug-sensitive parental lines (CEM, 8226). As determined by radioreceptor assay, the number of cell surface receptors for rTNF did not differ on the parental and drug-resistant lines. During the first 24 hours after addition of rTNF, there was a decrease in intracellular ATP content in the CEM/V line but not in the CEM line. No differential effect of rTNF on ATP content was observed between 8226 and 8226/D. As determined by RNA dot-blot analysis, total cellular RNA for GP-170 was increased in the 8226/D cells. After rTNF exposure, expression of total cellular RNA for GP-170 was not altered. Accumulation of radiolabeled doxorubicin by 8226/D cells was not altered by previous or coincubation with rTNF. These findings suggest that the effects of rTNF on MDR cells is not related to TNF receptor number and is mediated at a step subsequent to rTNF binding and not by either inhibition of synthesis of GP-170 or by alteration in the function of the GP-170 efflux pump.","['Salmon, S E', 'Soehnlen, B', 'Dalton, W S', 'Meltzer, P', 'Scuderi, P']","['Salmon SE', 'Soehnlen B', 'Dalton WS', 'Meltzer P', 'Scuderi P']","['Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson.']",['eng'],"['CA-17094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Mutation', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",,1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75688-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Oct;74(5):1723-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Baseline NK cytolytic activity from AP was found to be depressed, whereas RP-derived cells had normal NK activity, as assayed against K562 targets. Culture in rIL-2 significantly enhanced the NK activity of both AP- and RP-derived cells and generated LAK activity, as assayed by 4-hour 51Cr release, against NK-resistant Raji cell line and against fresh, allogeneic, and autologous tumor cells. Lytic activity against fresh, cryopreserved leukemia blasts was of lower than that found against cell lines. In three patients higher lytic activity against autologous than against allogeneic blasts was demonstrated. Expansion in culture with rIL-2 varied from twofold to 120-fold. rIL-2 activation and expansion was better in RP than in AP. The predominant phenotype of activated cells, as determined by flow cytometry, was [mean % (SD)]: CD3- = 54 (12), CD8+ = 55 (17), and NKH1+ = 26 (7).

Kinetics of expression of cell surface markers during 2 to 3 weeks in culture showed that CD8+ and NKH1+ enrichment occurred during the first week and lasted for up to 4 weeks, whereas CD4+ expression decreased after the second week. A significant decrease in the expression of IL-2 receptors (CD25) was observed from the second week of culture.

The present study overcame this problem by directly detecting type-specific proviral sequences by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and liquid hybridization. Screening was performed on a cohort of primarily white intravenous drug abusers (IVDAs), and individuals of other behaviorally defined risk groups from the New York City area. Eleven percent (19 of 169) of the individuals in these high-risk groups were determined by PCR to have HTLV-II proviral infections. One of these patients displayed an exfoliative erythrodermatitis. Thirteen of the 19 subjects were positive in an HTLV-II enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The remaining six individuals, although negative in the HTLV-II ELISA, were confirmed as HTLV-II positive by analyzing their DNA with a second HTLV-II-specific primer detector system.

T-PLL cells expressed the phenotype CD1- CD3+ CD4+ CD8+. Incubation with the differentiating agent phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate markedly increased the percentage of cells with the CD4- CD8+ phenotype, suggesting that leukemic cells were already committed towards a differentiated element with the CD4- CD8+ phenotype. T-PLL cells were induced to proliferate by anti-CD2 MoAb 9-1 + 9.6 and by anti-CD3 MoAb OKT3. The two pathways exhibited normal functional interactions and were susceptible to modulation by anti-HLA class I MoAbs. These results indicate that regulation of cell proliferation was preserved to a significant extent in the T-PLL cells analyzed. At variance with normal resting T cells that require previous activation to proliferate when incubated with interleukin-1 (IL-1) or interleukin-2 (IL-2), T-PLL cells proliferated vigorously when incubated with either interleukin. Furthermore, T-PLL cells proliferated when incubated with immune interferon (IFN-gamma). The latter finding parallels the enhancement by IFN-gamma of the proliferative response of lectin-activated murine T lymphocytes. These results suggest that T-PLL cells, which express a high constitutive level of c-myc mRNA, may be in an activated state. The antigenic phenotype and the characteristics of the proliferative pathways of T-PLL cells from the patient TRT are compatible with the possibility that they may be derived from an intermediate thymocyte.","['Turco, M C', 'De Felice, M', 'Alfinito, F', 'Lamberti, A', 'Costanzo, F', 'Giordano, M', 'Martinelli, V', 'Rotoli, B', 'Ferrone, S', 'Venuta, S']","['Turco MC', 'De Felice M', 'Alfinito F', 'Lamberti A', 'Costanzo F', 'Giordano M', 'Martinelli V', 'Rotoli B', 'Ferrone S', 'Venuta S']","['Istituto di Oncologia Sperimentale e Clinica, Facolta di Medicina e Chirurgia, Universita degli Studi di Reggio Calabria, Catanzaro, Italy.']",['eng'],"['AI21384/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA39559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Reference Values', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",,1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75678-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Oct;74(5):1651-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the mechanism underlying these differential responses to TPA, experiments were performed to determine the relative numbers of TPA binding sites, protein kinase C (PKC) enzyme activity levels, PKC translocation responses and PKC gene expression in these cell lines. KG-1a cells exhibited 40% fewer high affinity binding sites for TPA than KG-1 cells. Although PKC translocation from cytosol to the membrane fraction was observed in both cell types, total PKC activity, measured in vitro using type III-S histone as substrate, was reduced by 70% in KG-1a cells. These biochemical differences between the parental line and the phorbol ester non-responsive variant were correlated with the depressed level of PKC-beta RNA abundance in KG-1a cells. Both lines expressed PKC-alpha RNA at comparable levels. Chronic exposure to TPA resulted in down-regulation of PKC enzyme activity in both cell lines, and a selective decrease in PKC-beta RNA transcripts in both cell types. In contrast, chronic TPA treatment had no effect on the levels of PKC-alpha RNA in KG-1 and KG-1a cells. Our results indicate a correlation between the level of PKC-beta expression and the responsiveness of myeloid lineage precursor cells to the differentiative effects of TPA.","['Hooper, W C', 'Abraham, R T', 'Ashendel, C L', 'Woloschak, G E']","['Hooper WC', 'Abraham RT', 'Ashendel CL', 'Woloschak GE']","['Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic/Foundation Rochester, MN.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '0 (phorbol ester binding protein)', '0 (phorbol ester receptor)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['*Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology', 'Protein Kinase C/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Receptors, Drug/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/*enzymology']",,1989/09/04 00:00,1989/09/04 00:01,['1989/09/04 00:00'],"['1989/09/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/04 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(89)90126-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(89)90126-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1989 Sep 4;1013(1):47-54. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(89)90126-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown with in vitro studies that in the case of tumor cells desferrioxamine is even more efficient in inhibiting cell proliferation when entrapped in liposomes consisting of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine. At the same time liposome-entrapped desferrioxamine retains only a slight effect on hexamethylenebisacetamide induction of erythroid differentiation and hemoglobin accumulation of murine erythroleukemic Friend cells. Based on these findings, we propose liposome-entrapped desferrioxamine as potential antineoplastic agent as well as a specific chemical for the study of both iron metabolism and distribution in normal and neoplastic cells. In addition, unlike free desferrioxamine, the liposome-entrapped drug could also be used in combination with inducers of differentiation. With respect to this issue, it is possible that liposome-entrapped desferrioxamine, might permit erythroid differentiation of both neoplastic cells as well as normal stem cells.","['Nastruzzi, C', 'Walde, P', 'Menegatti, E', 'Gambari, R']","['Nastruzzi C', 'Walde P', 'Menegatti E', 'Gambari R']","['Institut fur Polymere, Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Deferoxamine/*pharmacology', 'Freeze Fracturing', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', '*Liposomes', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', '*Phosphatidylcholines']",,1989/09/04 00:00,1989/09/04 00:01,['1989/09/04 00:00'],"['1989/09/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/04 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(89)90124-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(89)90124-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1989 Sep 4;1013(1):36-41. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(89)90124-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Total cellular RNAs were extracted from four HTLV-1 positive and ten HTLV-1-negative T cell lymphomas and cell lines, and investigated for homology with cloned DNA probes specific for interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-2 receptor (IL-2R), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R). Tumor cells associated with clinically high grade HTLV-1-positive adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and large cell morphology (T immunoblastic lymphomas) were found to have higher levels of expression of IL-2 and TGF-beta genes than low grade T cell neoplasms (mycosis fungoides and Sezary's syndrome). High expression of IL-2R gene was restricted to Ki-1-positive lymphomas and to one ATL. Cell lines corresponding to the advanced stage of a cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) showed enhanced expression of PDGF. Therefore, high grade T cell malignancies had consistently elevated expression of growth factor/receptor (GF/R) genes. Expression of EGF-R was negligible in all T cell malignancies. An inverse relationship was found between the expression of T cell antigen receptor (differentiation antigen) and GF/R (activation antigen) genes, accounting for the frequent aberrant expression of T cell antigens in high grade T cell lymphomas. The results suggest that post-thymic T cell malignancies derived from activated T cells produce and secrete GF, conferring a growth advantage on neoplastic T cells, and correlating well with their histologic subtype and clinical behavior.","['Su, I J', 'Kadin, M E']","['Su IJ', 'Kadin ME']","['Department of Pathology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Republic of China.']",['eng'],['1-F05-TW03962/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Growth Substances/*biosynthesis', 'HTLV-I Infections/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism/microbiology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism/microbiology', 'Receptors, Mitogen/*biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC1879862,1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1989 Sep;135(3):439-45.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Leukemia Cooperative Group.,1533-8,"Interferon-alpha (IFN-a) or 2'-deoxycoformycin (pentostatin; DCF) have each been shown to be highly active in hairy-cell leukemia (HCL). In this phase II study of the Leukemia Cooperative Group of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), the efficacy and toxicity of DCF were investigated in patients who were resistant to IFN-a treatment. Resistance was defined as: (1) progressive disease (PD) under IFN-a therapy for more than 2 months; (2) stable disease (SD) after more than 6 months of IFN-a treatment; (3) relapse within 3 months of discontinuing IFN-a; and (4) intolerance to IFN-a because of World Health Organization (WHO) grade 3 or 4 toxicity. DCF was applied at a dosage of 4 mg/m2 weekly x 3, then 4 mg/m2 every other week x 3. Responders were given a maintenance therapy once per month for a maximum of 6 months. At the time of report, 33 patients with resistant disease were evaluable for response and toxicity. Median duration of IFN-a therapy before DCF administration was 14.7 months (range, 1 to 41 months). Complete remissions (CRs) were achieved in 11 patients and partial remissions (PRs) in 15, resulting in a total response rate of 78.8%. Median interval between beginning of DCF therapy to best response was 3.9 months with a range from 2.0 to 7.0 months. Two patients who achieved PR have relapsed 7 and 14 months after cessation of DCF therapy. The median duration of response was over 11.5 months (range, over 3.0 to over 24.0 months). Three patients died within the first 6 weeks of DCF treatment: one of drug-unrelated cardiomyopathy and two of fungal pneumonia. The patients with early death (n = 3) and nonresponsive disease (n = 4) received IFN-a treatment for a longer period (median, 18.0 months) than did the 26 responsive patients (median, 10.0 months). Major side effects included nausea, skin rash, and infections and were otherwise mild. Thus, DCF is highly active in patients with HCL resistant to IFN-a.","['Ho, A D', 'Thaler, J', 'Mandelli, F', 'Lauria, F', 'Zittoun, R', 'Willemze, R', 'McVie, G', 'Marmont, A M', 'Prummer, O', 'Stryckmans, P']","['Ho AD', 'Thaler J', 'Mandelli F', 'Lauria F', 'Zittoun R', 'Willemze R', 'McVie G', 'Marmont AM', 'Prummer O', 'Stryckmans P', 'et al.']","['Department of Internal Medicine V.

The association of both chains forms high affinity IL-2R, whereas each chain alone binds IL-2 with a low (alpha-chain) or intermediate (beta-chain) affinity. So far, the p70 peptide has been found, in the absence of the Tac peptide, on the surface of lymphoid cells of T, B, or NK lineage. In this study, we investigated whether leukemic cells of various hemopoietic lineages expressed the p70 IL-2-binding protein. We found that both fresh leukemic cells obtained from patients, and cells from established leukemic lines of T cells, B cell, and myeloid origin constitutively expressed a p70 IL-2-binding protein on their surface, as detected by affinity cross-linking of radioiodinated IL-2. IL-2 binding and cross-linking to these cells was completely inhibited in the presence of an excess unlabeled rIL-2, but not with an anti-Tac mAb. Binding experiments on pre-B and myeloid cell lines revealed intermediate affinity IL-2R, whereas both high and intermediate affinity IL-2R were detected in T leukemic cells. The intermediate affinity binding of 125I-rIL-2 to the leukemic cell lines MOLT4 and Reh6 was inhibited by the TU27 mAb, which recognized the p75 chain of IL-2R. Moreover, the TU27 mAb could stain the K562, KM3, and MOLT4 (weakly) cell lines by indirect immunofluorescence. A high dose of rIL-2 (400 U/ml) enhanced the proliferation of cells from one out of three patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia, but it did not induce differentiation of the cells in any of three cases. Thus the finding of p70 IL-2-binding molecules on immature lymphoid and nonlymphoid hemopoietic cells should disclose new biologic functions for IL-2.","['Allouche, M', 'Sahraoui, Y', 'Augery-Bourget, Y', 'Ohashi, Y', 'Sugamura, K', 'Jasmin, C', 'Georgoulias, V']","['Allouche M', 'Sahraoui Y', 'Augery-Bourget Y', 'Ohashi Y', 'Sugamura K', 'Jasmin C', 'Georgoulias V']","[""Unite d'Oncogenese Appliquee, INSERM U 268, Villejuif, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptides/*analysis/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*analysis/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Oct 1;143(7):2223-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunoperoxidase studies showed that both lymphomatous components had a mu-kappa immunophenotype. Flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood and spleen lymphocyte surface markers confirmed monoclonality. The intensity of surface immunoglobulin expression and the results of other cell marker studies in the SLL component were consistent with a stage of differentiation beyond that typical of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The presence of abundant cytoplasmic immunoglobulin in the SLL and the association with monoclonal gammopathy were more consistent with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia or plasmacytoid lymphocytic lymphoma. The immunohistochemical and flow cytometric findings suggest that the SLL component evolved clonally or underwent Richter's transformation to LCL.

Immunoglobulin production was measured after the cells had been cultured with the B cell mitogens, pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain 1 (SAC). Autologous T cells that were found to function normally in our systems were added to cultures containing PWM. Non-leukaemic B cells from 15 B-CLL patients produced 539 ng/ml, immunoglobulin (mean value) with SAC and 162 ng/ml with PWM compared with 14,182 and 5513 ng/ml, respectively, from B cells from normal, age-matched control patients.

Taken together, these data suggest that most NHL's arise from an immature B-lymphocyte precursor at a stage of differentiation where lineage commitment is incomplete.","['Leber, B F', 'Amlot, P', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Norton, J D']","['Leber BF', 'Amlot P', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Norton JD']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, School of Medicine, Hampstead, London, U.K.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/immunology', 'Methylation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics']",,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(89)90169-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(6):473-81. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90169-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biopsy specimens obtained from small skin nodules containing a dense infiltration of lymphocytes were analyzed by Southern blotting with the use of probes for both the beta-chain of the T-cell receptor gene and the ATLV/HTLV-I genome. DNA samples from one patient with early, chronic adult T cell lymphoma or leukemia, revealed the monoclonal proliferation of lymphocytes. For another patient with early cutaneous T cell lymphoma analysis by Southern blotting with the beta-chain probe of DNA from three separate lesions revealed identical rearranged bands, indicating not only the monoclonal proliferation of T cells in each lesion but also the clonal origin of each lesion. In contrast, analysis by Southern blotting of DNA samples extracted from three nodules from a patient with lymphomatoid papulosis showed no rearranged band and therefore no clonal proliferation. DNA extracted from blood lymphocytes of these patients failed to hybridize with the probes described above as a rearranged band. These results indicate that analysis of DNA extracted from skin lesions may have diagnostic value in determining monoclonal proliferation of lymphocytes in patients with early stage cutaneous lymphomas.","['Tanaka, T', 'Takahashi, K', 'Ideyama, S', 'Imamura, S', 'Noma, T']","['Tanaka T', 'Takahashi K', 'Ideyama S', 'Imamura S', 'Noma T']","['Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology']",,1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0190-9622(89)70164-X [pii]'],ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 1989 Aug;21(2 Pt 1):218-23.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deoxyadenosine, which accumulates in both clinical conditions, provoked a dose-dependent accumulation of dATP, depletion of ATP, and increases in the production of inosine plus hypoxanthine. Concomitantly, there was an increase of AMP and IMP, but not of adenosine, indicating that catabolism proceeded by way of AMP deaminase. A series of nucleoside analogues (9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine, N6-methyladenosine, 6-methylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside, tubercidin, ribavirin, and N-1-ribosyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside) also stimulated adenine nucleotide catabolism and increased AMP and IMP to various extents. The effects of deoxyadenosine and of the nucleoside analogues were prevented by 5'-iodotubercidin, an inhibitor of adenosine kinase. Strikingly, they were reversed if the inhibitor was added after the accumulation of nucleotide analogues and initiation of adenine nucleotide catabolism. Further analyses revealed linear relationships between the rate of phosphorylation of deoxyadenosine and nucleoside analogues and the increase in AMP and between the elevation of the latter above a threshold concentration of 10 microM and the rate of adenine nucleotide catabolism. Kinetic studies with purified erythrocytic AMP deaminase, at physiological concentrations of its effectors, showed that the enzyme is nearly inactive up to 10 microM AMP and increases in activity above this threshold. We conclude that the main mechanism whereby deoxyadenosine and nucleoside analogues stimulate catabolism of adenine nucleotides by way of AMP deaminase in erythrocytes is elevation of AMP, secondary to the phosphorylation of the nucleosides.","['Bontemps, F', 'Van den Berghe, G']","['Bontemps F', 'Van den Berghe G']","['Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry, International Institute of Cellular and Molecular Pathology, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '11033-22-0 (Coformycin)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenine/blood', 'Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', '*Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/*blood', 'Coformycin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Deoxyadenosines/*pharmacology', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pentostatin', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,1989/09/15 00:00,1989/09/15 00:01,['1989/09/15 00:00'],"['1989/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Sep 15;49(18):4983-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,

LMW-BCGF plus rIL-2 induced significant expansion of CD3+ cells from CD3- precursors, and these cells were activated to kill autologous leukemic cells in addition to Raji and K562 cell lines. LMW-BCGF or rIL-2 alone did not induce significant expansion or activation of cytotoxic CD3- cells.

This T lymphocyte requires the delivery of two signals; the first can be provided by specific monoclonal antibodies or by mitogenic lectins, and the second by a phorbol ester, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). In other cells such as macrophages, the rise of intracellular calcium via the generation of IP3 and stimulation of protein kinase C can activate the phospholipase A2, a calcium-dependent enzyme. This enzyme initiates the release of reactive oxygen intermediates and metabolites of arachidonic acid. In order to know whether this other metabolic pathway can be generated in T cells, we tested the capacity of different T-cell lines and clones to produce superoxide anion after stimulation by the above-mentioned activating agents. In this paper, we demonstrate that treatment of the Jurkat human cell line with Con A, PHA, and PMA results in a significant release of reactive oxygen metabolites. Of the various T-cell lines and clones tested, only Jurkat exhibited an oxidative burst. Moreover, none of the antibodies tested (anti-CD3, anti-CD2, and anti-CD28) and known to activate T cells, and none of the immune complexes was able to mediate such an effect. The existence of an oxidative metabolism in at least one T-cell line suggests that T-cell activation may in some instances use another metabolic pathway.","['Benichou, G', 'Kanellopoulos, J M', 'Mitenne, F', 'Galanaud, P', 'Leca, G']","['Benichou G', 'Kanellopoulos JM', 'Mitenne F', 'Galanaud P', 'Leca G']","['Claude Bernard Research Centre, Pasteur Institute, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Lectins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Free Radicals', 'Humans', 'Lectins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Luminescent Measurements', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1989.tb01210.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1989 Aug;30(2):265-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1989.tb01210.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Linkage of the gene coding for the KN6 ligand to the major histocompatibility complex genes could be demonstrated by testing KN6 hybridoma reactivity to cells from congenic strains that differ only at H-2. In addition, analysis of recombinant strains indicates that the gene controlling the KN6 ligand is located in or distal to the TL region. Involvement of the KN6 gammadelta T-cell receptor in this recognition process could be directly demonstrated by transferring the KN6 TL specificity after introduction of the productively rearranged KN6 gamma and delta genes into an alphabeta T-cell clone or into the germ line in transgenic mice.

It has recently been shown that PKC activity resides in a family of homologous proteins. Inasmuch as T cells are phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous, we examined the possibility that this heterogeneity may be reflected in differential expression of message for PKC isoenzyme genes. RNA from six leukemic T cell lines was probed for PKC-alpha, -beta, and -gamma message before and after activation. These studies revealed significant differences among these lines. None expressed mRNA for PKC-gamma. Whereas all cells possessed message for PKC-alpha, there was consistent variability in the level expressed. The greatest heterogeneity was seen with PKC-beta. Two cell lines, HUT 78 and HPB-ALL, did not hybridize with the beta probe under any conditions tested. We subsequently used these PKC-beta negative cells to study the role of this isoenzyme in mediating some of the effects seen with phorbol esters that directly bind to and activate PKC. Our results indicate that PKC-beta, which is expressed in some T cells, is not necessary for PMA-induced CD3 or CD4 internalization, IL-2 production, or acquisition of the p55 chain of the IL-2 receptor.","['Koretzky, G A', 'Wahi, M', 'Newton, M E', 'Weiss, A']","['Koretzky GA', 'Wahi M', 'Newton ME', 'Weiss A']","['Department of Medicine, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, San Francisco, CA 94143.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/enzymology/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Kinase C/*genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/*enzymology/immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",,1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Sep 1;143(5):1692-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although anti-IgM mAb directed to various domains of the mIgM molecule suppressed spontaneous or T cell factor-induced leukemic DNA synthesis at concentrations as low as 0.01 to 0.1 microgram/ml, anti-IgD antibodies of both monoclonal and polyclonal origin failed to inhibit at doses as high as 100 micrograms/ml. Several possibilities for the differential capacity of mIgM and mIgD molecules to signal inhibition in these leukemic clonal populations were evaluated. Differences in the intrinsic membrane expression of the two isotypes before in vitro clonal activation were not responsible because the above distinctions were noted in cells of a chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which expressed slightly more mIgD than mIgM. The ineffective inhibitory signaling capacity of mIgD-specific ligands was also not caused by a selective decrease in the membrane expression of mIgD during cell culture, because the density of each isotype remained relatively constant during the first 44 h of in vitro activation by T cell factors, and following capping, mIgM and mIgD were resynthesized with similar kinetics. Because anti-IgM and anti-IgD mAb with comparable affinities for their respective membrane molecules differed significantly in inhibitory potential, it was considered improbable that the IgD-specific ligands tested bound to mIgD with a suboptimal affinity for inducing tolerance. Inhibition of leukemic DNA synthesis was observed after incubation with either anti-kappa antibody or a mixture of IgM- and IgD-isotype-specific antibodies, indicating that cross-linking of mIgD does not make B cell clones refractory to tolerogenic signal transduction through mIgM. These studies provide strong clonal support for the concept that coexpressed mIgM and mIgD molecules play distinct roles in human B cell immunoregulation.","['Mongini, P K', 'Blessinger, C', 'Posnett, D N', 'Rudich, S M']","['Mongini PK', 'Blessinger C', 'Posnett DN', 'Rudich SM']","['Institute of Molecular Immunology, Hospital for Joint Diseases, New York 10003.']",['eng'],['GM35174/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin D)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (immunoglobulin D receptor)', '0 (immunoglobulin M receptor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Specificity', 'B-Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology/metabolism', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Clone Cells/classification/immunology/metabolism', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immunoglobulin D/metabolism/*physiology', 'Immunoglobulin M/metabolism/*physiology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis', 'Receptors, Immunologic/analysis', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology']",,1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Sep 1;143(5):1565-74.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples, however, fail to synthesize CSF despite growing autonomously in agar, and are therefore believed to bypass CSF requirements. Cytokines such as IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and IL-1, products of cells of the myeloid lineage, are known to be involved in growth control of myeloid progenitor cells. Since these molecules may also contribute to autocrine and paracrine growth regulation of myeloid leukemias, we screened a series of AML for cytokine production. In addition, possible roles of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 in growth control of AML were investigated in vitro. We show that a substantial proportion of AML cells produce IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-1-beta and use these mediators to stimulate their growth by disparate mechanisms: IL-6 acts as a costimulator to enhance CSF-induced clonogenicity of AML blasts. TNF-alpha induces CSF production by endothelial cells and may therefore provide a paracrine loop to support leukemia growth.","['Oster, W', 'Cicco, N A', 'Klein, H', 'Hirano, T', 'Kishimoto, T', 'Lindemann, A', 'Mertelsmann, R H', 'Herrmann, F']","['Oster W', 'Cicco NA', 'Klein H', 'Hirano T', 'Kishimoto T', 'Lindemann A', 'Mertelsmann RH', 'Herrmann F']","['Department of Hematology, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Colony-Stimulating Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/genetics/*physiology', 'Interleukin-6', 'Interleukins/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/*physiology']",PMC548903,1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI114186 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1989 Aug;84(2):451-7. doi: 10.1172/JCI114186.,,,,,,,,,,,,['J Clin Invest. 2003 Oct;112(8):1265.

We examined the role of the target antigen and type of antibody-liposome linkage in determining endocytosis of liposomes by three human T-cell leukemias, Jurkat, CEM, and Molt-4. Liposome-cell binding and internalization over time were studied using two independent assays for intracellular delivery of liposome contents: a new fluorescence assay using a pH-sensitive fluorescent dye; and a growth inhibition assay for delivery of cytotoxic drug, methotrexate-gamma-aspartate. Liposomes targeted against the transferrin receptor showed greater surface binding, internalization, and growth inhibition than liposomes targeted against the T-cell surface antigens, CD2, CD3, or CD5. Furthermore, liposomes made by conjugating the targeting antibody directly to the liposome surface were more efficiently internalized and retained than were liposomes linked to antibody-coated cells via Protein A. Selection of the type of antibody-liposome conjugate as well as the appropriate surface receptor to facilitate endocytosis is essential in antibody-directed drug treatment of cancer.","['Matthay, K K', 'Abai, A M', 'Cobb, S', 'Hong, K', 'Papahadjopoulos, D', 'Straubinger, R M']","['Matthay KK', 'Abai AM', 'Cobb S', 'Hong K', 'Papahadjopoulos D', 'Straubinger RM']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco 94143.']",['eng'],"['CA35340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA39448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR01271/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Staphylococcal Protein A)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Carriers', '*Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Liposomes/immunology/*pharmacokinetics', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Receptors, Transferrin/immunology', 'Staphylococcal Protein A/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Sep 1;49(17):4879-86.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) accounted for 81% of cases, acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL) for 13%, chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML) for 2.5%, and acute unclassifiable leukaemia (AUL) for 3%. The peak incidence of ALL was at age 3, common-ALL and pre B-ALL comprising about 95% of the immunophenotypes at this age. Incidence rates for ALL remained stable between 1973 and 1978 at 2.85 cases per 10(5) children per year, exhibited a temporary increase between 1979 and 1984 to 3.60 and dropped back to the lower, previous level in 1985 and 1986. This rise was seen mainly among children in the 1-4 year age group, especially at age 3, and those with common-ALL and an initial WBC less than 5.0 x 10(9) l-1. Cumulative incidence rates per year of birth were fairly homogeneous up to age 6, except for the 1978 birth cohort which exhibited higher rates. Incidence rates for ANLL, CML and AUL remained stable over time. Changes in ascertainment, declining birth rates and a 50% decrease in childhood mortality, e.g. from infectious diseases, could not explain this temporary variation. Moreover, incidence rates in this survey appeared to be similar to those reported in various developed countries for the same period. As far as the aetiology of childhood common-ALL is concerned, therefore, the Dutch data appear to support the hypothesis of 'random mutation' as well as that of a limited role of environmental factors.","['Coebergh, J W', 'van der Does-van den Berg, A', 'van Wering, E R', 'van Steensel-Moll, H A', 'Valkenburg, H A', ""van't Veer, M B"", 'Schmitz, P I', 'van Zanen, G E']","['Coebergh JW', 'van der Does-van den Berg A', 'van Wering ER', 'van Steensel-Moll HA', 'Valkenburg HA', ""van't Veer MB"", 'Schmitz PI', 'van Zanen GE']","['Dutch Childhood Leukaemia Study Group, The Hague, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphocytes/classification', 'Male', 'Netherlands', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/immunology/mortality']",PMC2246965,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1989.20 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1989 Jan;59(1):100-5. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1989.20.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The protective immune response is directed toward the minor histocompatibility (H) antigen, H-40, which can be detected by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and is expressed on surface (s) immunoglobulin positive tumor cells including BCL1 as well as sIg+ lymphoblasts activated by lipopolysaccharide. The fact that only sIg+ tumor cells and lymphoblasts express H-40 suggests that sIg itself may be a component involved in CTL recognition of this antigen. However, this possibility was ruled out by demonstrating that removal of sIg from target cells did not prevent H-40-specific CTL recognition. To determine whether H-40 expression was coordinately regulated with that of membrane Ig, we determined whether H-40- sIg- cells acquire H-40 when induced to express sIg. We also transfected a functional mu c and nu region gene into a sIg- lymphoma so that it acquired a sIg+ phenotype. In neither case did such sIg+ cells acquire H-40. Together, these data indicate that H-40 is expressed on B cells representing a particular stage of differentiation that is coincidental with sIg. We previously showed that H-40 and Igh loci are linked on the 12th murine chromosome. In this study we further localized H-40 to a point beyond Aat (formerly Pre-1) near Lm-1, a locus previously described to encode minor H-antigens expressed on lymphomyeloid cells.

To evaluate the extent of residual chromosome damage in circulating T-cell lymphocytes in this population, approximately 200 metaphases were examined from each of 96 irradiated and 26 nonirradiated cervical cancer patients treated more than 17 years ago (average 23 years). Radiation dose averaged over the total red bone marrow was estimated to be 8.1 Gy. The type and frequency of stable and unstable chromosome aberrations were quantified in 24,117 metaphases. Unstable aberrations did not differ significantly between irradiated and nonirradiated patients (P greater than 0.5). Stable aberrations (i.e., translocations, inversions, or chromosomes with deleted segments), however, were significantly higher among irradiated (2.8 per 100 cells) compared to nonirradiated (0.7 per 100 cells) women (P less than 10(4). The frequency of these stable aberrations was found to increase significantly with increasing dose to the bone marrow. These data indicate that a direct relationship between radiation dose and extent of damage to somatic cells persists in populations and can be detected many years after partial-body radiation exposure. The stable aberration rate in irradiated cervical cancer patients was 50 to 75% lower than those observed 25 years or more after radiation exposure in atomic bomb survivors and in ankylosing spondylitis patients treated with radiotherapy. The average marrow dose was only 1 Gy in the examined atomic bomb survivors and 3.5 Gy in the ankylosing spondylitis patients. It appears, then, that a very high dose delivered to the pelvic cavity in fractionated doses resulted in far fewer persistent stable aberrations than lower doses delivered either in acute whole-body exposure or in fractionated doses to the spinal column and sacroiliac joints. The higher radiation dose and the concentration of that dose in a smaller area of the body appear to be responsible for the lower rate of persistent aberrations observed in cervical cancer patients.","['Kleinerman, R A', 'Littlefield, L G', 'Tarone, R E', 'Machado, S G', 'Blettner, M', 'Peters, L J', 'Boice, J D Jr']","['Kleinerman RA', 'Littlefield LG', 'Tarone RE', 'Machado SG', 'Blettner M', 'Peters LJ', 'Boice JD Jr']","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['N01-CP3-1035/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Y01-CP1-0504/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Radiation Dosage', 'T-Lymphocytes/*radiation effects', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/blood/*radiotherapy']",,1989/07/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1989 Jul;119(1):176-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The putative oncogene BCL-1 located at the chromosomal band 11q13 has been cloned previously from a B-cell CLL with t(11;14). We studied the molecular structure of the BCL-1 gene in eight B-cell NHL tumors that exhibited a break at 11q13. The cytogenetic changes in these tumors were t(11;14) in three, t(1;11;14)(q32;q13;q32) in two and dup(11)(pter----q23::11q13----ter) in three. The BCL-1 gene was found to have rearranged in two tumors. By Southern blot analysis of single and double digested DNA from placenta and from the tumors, we mapped the breakpoint in BCL-1 to a 0.5 kb Pst-I-HindIII restriction fragment which was approximately 2kb away from the sites of previously mapped breakpoints. Sequential hybridization of Southern blots of these tumors with different immunoglobulin probes (for J region, Cu, Su) and BCL-1 probe identified co-migrating fragments with Su probe after BamHI restriction digestion. These results demonstrate that translocation breaks in the BCL-1 gene are not clustered in a short stretch of DNA at 11q13, and that the translocation related breaks in the immunoglobulin heavy chain can occur outside the joining region. The implications of these observations to the genesis of chromosomal translocations during B cell development are discussed.","['Koduru, P R', 'Offit, K', 'Filippa, D A']","['Koduru PR', 'Offit K', 'Filippa DA']","['Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York.']",['eng'],['CA34775/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1989 Jul;4(7):929-34.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients' B cells were analyzed by dual color-flow cytometry and found to have an abnormal surface-molecule display characterized by depressed Leu 8 and CD21 expression. Membrane immunoglobulin (mu, delta, and light chain) were normally displayed. The lack of Leu 8 and CD21 expression did not represent the normal loss of these antigens from B cells with activation because the cells did not demonstrate enhanced display of activation markers, nor did they demonstrate enhanced display of early B cell molecules, such as common acute lymphocytic leukemia antigen or CD5. Small resting B cells from the patients were isolated and tested for their ability to respond functionally to a series of activation, proliferation, and differentiation signals. B cells from 14 of 17 patients failed to transit from proliferation to differentiation with increased immunoglobulin production when B cells were stimulated with T cell replacing factor +/- phorbol myristate acetate. Cells of one patient failed to proliferate, whereas B cells from the remaining two patients with CVI did not undergo activation (size change and RNA synthesis) when they were exposed to antimu antibody or low-dose phorbol myristate acetate. These studies demonstrate that most patients with CVI have B cells displaying an altered-surface phenotype that is associated with a specific functional defect in transiting from cell proliferation to differentiation and immunoglobulin production.","['Saxon, A', 'Giorgi, J V', 'Sherr, E H', 'Kagan, J M']","['Saxon A', 'Giorgi JV', 'Sherr EH', 'Kagan JM']","['Department of Medicine, University of California-Los Angeles School of Medicine 90024.']",['eng'],"['AI 15251/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 15332/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 12800/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Separation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/metabolism', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0091-6749(89)90177-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0091-6749(89)90177-2 [doi]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 1989 Jul;84(1):44-55. doi: 10.1016/0091-6749(89)90177-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,

All sera were positive for HTLV-I antigens by immunofluorescence assay using cells expressing HTLV-I antigens; sera from five ATL patients, however, did not react or hardly reacted with p19 or p24 gag proteins of HTLV-I upon immunoprecipitation assay. Therefore, the relationships among antibody specificities against HTLV-I, the proviral structures of HTLV-I genomes in leukemic cells, and the expression of viral antigens by leukemic cells after cultivation in vitro for a few days were examined. Analyses of the genomic structures of the proviruses revealed deletions in at least seven cases. However, we could not detect deletions in the proviral genomes of four out of the five ATL patients who lacked antibodies against gag proteins. Furthermore, expression of p19 and p24 was detected in these patients' peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) cultured in vitro for a few days. Thus, some ATL patients could not or could hardly raise antibodies against gag proteins, although they harbored complete HTLV-I genomes and their PBL expressed gag proteins in vitro. All patients harboring deleted proviruses, so far tested, raised antibodies not only against viral proteins that should be encoded by the integrated proviruses, but also against viral proteins that should be encoded by the deleted regions. Antibodies against viral proteins were detected also in sera of ATL patients whose PBL did not express viral proteins after in vitro cultivation. Specificities of antibodies against viral proteins in ATL patients could not be predicted by the structures of proviruses in leukemic cells or by expression of viral proteins in vitro.

Flow cytofluorometric analysis performed by dual immunofluorescence in three cases demonstrated coexpression of Tac antigen with myeloid (CD13, CD14, or CD33) or lymphoid (CD10) antigen on significant proportions of peripheral blood leukemic cells. Radiolabeled IL-2-binding assay demonstrated the specific IL-2 binding sites in three cases examined. The exogenous IL-2, however, failed to induce proliferative response. A myeloid cell line, Yut-K3, established from peripheral blood leukemic cells from a CML patient with blastic crisis, also expressed cell-surface Tac antigen and CD13 concurrently. SIL-2R assay showed that Yut-K3 released a detectable amount of sIL-2R in its culture supernatant. The serum sIL-2R levels were significantly elevated (range: 2,580 to 172,000 U/mL) in 12 CML patients with blastic crisis and were slightly elevated in ten patients in chronic phase (range: 250 to 820 U/mL) and in three in accelerated phase (range: 790 to 1,305 U/mL) compared with those in 24 normal controls (range: 70 to 695 U/mL, P less than .01). These results indicated that the leukemic cells from CML patients with blastic crisis expressed and released IL-2 receptor (Tac antigen). Longitudinal studies performed in three cases of CML with blastic crisis showed that the change of serum sIL-2R level was closely associated with that of the number of peripheral blood leukocytes and blasts, the percentage of blasts and serum LDH levels, also suggesting that the serum sIL-2R level is a useful clinical indicator of the leukemic cell burden in vivo.","['Motoi, T', 'Uchiyama, T', 'Hori, T', 'Itoh, K', 'Uchino, H', 'Ueda, R']","['Motoi T', 'Uchiyama T', 'Hori T', 'Itoh K', 'Uchino H', 'Ueda R']","['First Division of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Blast Crisis/*blood', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*blood', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/analysis']",,1989/08/15 00:00,1989/08/15 00:01,['1989/08/15 00:00'],"['1989/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75428-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Aug 15;74(3):1052-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

As compared with controls, B-CLL patients had increased absolute numbers of phenotypically activated, HLA-DR+ CD4+ and CD8+ cells and T suppressor/effector (CD11b+CD8+) cells. When patients in Rai stages II through IV (n = 11) were compared with cases in Rai stages O through I (n = 12), the former group of patients had higher numbers of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and decreased levels of suppressor/effector T cells. The absolute numbers of T suppressor/inducer (CD45R+CD4+) cells were elevated in patients with stage O through I disease but within normal range in stage II through IV leukemia. We further showed that the absolute numbers of NK-like (CD16+) cells and their activated counterparts (DR+CD16+) are elevated in B-CLL patients as compared with healthy subjects. The comparison of relative T and NK subsets in the blood of patients and controls showed that the proportions of CD4+, CD8+, and CD16+ cells expressing the activation marker HLA-DR were increased in B-CLL. Furthermore, the percentage of T-suppressor/inducer (CD45R+) cells within the CD4+ population was decreased in the patients. The proportion of T-suppressor/effector (CD11b+) cells within the CD8+ subset was reduced in subjects with stage II-IV disease only. When stimulated in vitro with the T-cell-dependent inducer TPA, B-CLL cells from patients in Rai stages II through IV secreted larger amounts of IgM as compared with cells from stage O through I patients. A positive correlation was observed between the degree of phenotypic activation of CD4+ T-helper cells and their functional capacity to augment IgM secretion by autologous B-CLL cells. Our findings indicate a tumor cell-directed regulatory role of T cells (and possibly NK cells as well) in B-CLL. Furthermore, monitoring of phenotypically activated and functional T-cell subsets may be helpful in the prediction of disease progression and timing of therapy in B-CLL.","['Totterman, T H', 'Carlsson, M', 'Simonsson, B', 'Bengtsson, M', 'Nilsson, K']","['Totterman TH', 'Carlsson M', 'Simonsson B', 'Bengtsson M', 'Nilsson K']","['Department of Clinical Immunology & Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Immunoglobulin M)'],IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', 'Killer Cells, Natural/classification', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology/pathology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology']",,1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85372-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Aug 1;74(2):786-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the cytolytic activity and growth inhibitory effects of LAK cells on normal bone marrow progenitor cells and the ability of LAK cells to eliminate neoplastic hematopoietic cells from populations of bone marrow cells in vitro was studied. The results of these experiments show the following: (1) LAK cells have little cytolytic activity against normal bone marrow cells; (2) normal bone marrow cells fail to cold target compete for the killing of the hematopoietic tumor cell lines K562 and HL60 or freshly frozen acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) blast cells by LAK cells; (3) LAK cells inhibit the growth of K562 and HL60 to more than 90% in clonogenic assays; (4) LAK cells have no inhibitory effect on hematopoietic progenitor growth in CFU-GM (colony-forming unit-granulocytes, macrophages), CFU-E (colony-forming unit-erythrocytes), BFU-E (burst-forming units-erythrocytes), or CFU-GEMM (colony-forming unit-granulocytes, erythrocytes, macrophages, megakaryocytes) assays. These results indicate that LAK cells have low toxicity for normal bone marrow and that LAK activity against tumor cells is not adversely affected by the presence of normal bone marrow cells. The differences in cytolysis and growth inhibition of neoplastic hematopoietic cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells by LAK cells in vitro could create a therapeutic index that might allow the use of LAK cells for cleansing of the autologous bone marrow graft and for adjuvant therapy in combination with autologous bone marrow transplantation without compromising the reconstitution of the bone marrow in the host.","['van den Brink, M R', 'Voogt, P J', 'Marijt, W A', 'van Luxemburg-Heys, S A', 'van Rood, J J', 'Brand, A']","['van den Brink MR', 'Voogt PJ', 'Marijt WA', 'van Luxemburg-Heys SA', 'van Rood JJ', 'Brand A']","['Department of Immunohematology, University Medical Center of Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology']",,1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77362-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Jul;74(1):354-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,

One monoclonal antibody, anti-APO-1, reacted with a 52-kilodalton antigen (APO-1) on a set of activated human lymphocytes, on malignant human lymphocyte lines, and on some patient-derived leukemic cells. Nanogram quantities of anti-APO-1 completely blocked proliferation of cells bearing APO-1 in vitro in a manner characteristic of a process called programmed cell death or apoptosis. Cell death was preceded by changes in cell morphology and fragmentation of DNA. This process was distinct from antibody- and complement-dependent cell lysis and was mediated by the antibody alone. A single intravenous injection of anti-APO-1 into nu/nu mice carrying a xenotransplant of a human B cell tumor induced regression of this tumor within a few days. Histological thin sections of the regressing tumor showed that anti-APO-1 was able to induce apoptosis in vivo. Thus, induction of apoptosis as a consequence of a signal mediated through cell surface molecules like APO-1 may be a useful therapeutic approach in treatment of malignancy.","['Trauth, B C', 'Klas, C', 'Peters, A M', 'Matzku, S', 'Moller, P', 'Falk, W', 'Debatin, K M', 'Krammer, P H']","['Trauth BC', 'Klas C', 'Peters AM', 'Matzku S', 'Moller P', 'Falk W', 'Debatin KM', 'Krammer PH']","['Institute for Immunology and Genetics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Autoradiography', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology/therapy', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1989/07/21 00:00,1989/07/21 00:01,['1989/07/21 00:00'],"['1989/07/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/21 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1126/science.2787530 [doi]'],ppublish,Science. 1989 Jul 21;245(4915):301-5. doi: 10.1126/science.2787530.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The value of immunophenotyping in detecting or excluding leukemic testicular infiltration is demonstrated in six children with acute lymphocytic leukemia. A panel of monoclonal antibodies was employed on snap-frozen testicular biopsies, allowing both detection and immunologic characterization of four neoplastic lymphocytic infiltrates. Two samples were proven both histologically and phenotypically negative for leukemic infiltration. One of the four leukemic cases was clinically silent and might have escaped detection except for phenotyping. One leukemic infiltrate was also suspected to possess a multidrug-resistant phenotype (p-glycoprotein +); the latter possibility was excluded by an absence of reactivity with anti-p-glycoprotein monoclonal antibody. Thus, three clinically useful applications are demonstrated: (1) confirmation of testicular leukemic relapse, gaining assertion in histologically uncertain cases; (2) exclusion of clinically suspected disease relevant to cessation of therapy, and (3) detection/exclusion of drug-resistant phenotypes.

At three years of follow-up, the cumulative risk of secondary AML during the first bone marrow remission was 1.6 percent (95 percent confidence limits, 0.7 and 3.5 percent); at six years, it was 4.7 percent (2 and 10 percent). The development of secondary AML was much more likely among patients with a T-cell than a non-T-cell immunophenotype (cumulative risk, 19.1 percent [6 and 47 percent] at six years). Sequential cytogenetic studies in 10 patients revealed entirely different karyotypes in 9, suggesting the induction of a second neoplasm. In eight of these patients, the blast cells had abnormalities of the 11q23 chromosomal region, which has been associated with malignant transformation of a pluripotential stem cell. There was no evidence of loss of DNA from chromosome 5 or 7, a karyotypic change commonly observed in cases of AML secondary to treatment with alkylating agents, irradiation, or both. We conclude that there is a substantial risk of AML in patients who receive intensive treatment for ALL, especially in those with a T-cell immunophenotype, and that 11q23 chromosomal abnormalities may be important in the pathogenesis of this complication.","['Pui, C H', 'Behm, F G', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Dodge, R K', 'George, S L', 'Rivera, G K', 'Mirro, J Jr', 'Kalwinsky, D K', 'Dahl, G V', 'Murphy, S B']","['Pui CH', 'Behm FG', 'Raimondi SC', 'Dodge RK', 'George SL', 'Rivera GK', 'Mirro J Jr', 'Kalwinsky DK', 'Dahl GV', 'Murphy SB']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Time Factors']",,1989/07/20 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1989/07/20 00:00'],"['1989/07/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1989/07/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM198907203210302 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1989 Jul 20;321(3):136-42. doi: 10.1056/NEJM198907203210302.,,,,,,,,,,['N Engl J Med. 1989 Jul 20;321(3):185-7.

No apparent sequence similarity was observed between the 5'-flanking regions of the two promoters. The expression of lck in human T-cell leukemia and carcinoma cell lines and in human peripheral blood T lymphocytes was examined by S1 nuclease and primer extension mapping and by Northern (RNA) blot analysis of total cellular RNA. The following results were obtained. (i) Two RNA start sites in the downstream promoter were used to generate type I transcripts. (ii) The major human type I start site has not been described for the mouse. (iii) At least five RNA start sites in the upstream promoter were used to generate type II transcripts. (iv) In T cells and in two colon carcinoma cell lines, type II transcripts were present in higher amounts than type I transcripts. (v) In T cells treated with phytohemagglutinin, tetradecanoylphorbol acetate, and cyclosporin A, the modulation of lck expression was associated primarily with changes in levels of type II transcripts.

It was only about 10% as rapid as that of other purine nucleosides that are known substrates for the nucleoside transporters of these cells. ddAdo entry was nonsaturable up to a concentration of 1 mM and was not inhibited by other nucleosides or two nucleoside transport inhibitors, dipyridamole and nitrobenzylthioinosine. Thus, ddAdo permeation was mainly nonmediated. It was relatively rapid because of the high lipid solubility of ddAdo. ddAdo entered the cells at least 100 times more rapidly than dideoxycytidine but less rapidly than trideoxythymidine, with an even greater lipophilicity than ddAdo. ddAdo was not phosphorylated in human erythrocytes, but there was some phosphorylation in deoxycoformycin-treated P388 and L1210 cells. In situ conversion of 10 microM ddAdo to ddATP, however, was slow and ceased after 5-10 min at 25 degrees or 37 degrees. Cessation of net uptake was not due to turnover of dideoxy-ATP or deamination of dideoxy-AMP. The results suggest that ddAdo salvage in the absence of deamination is limited by feedback inhibition of its phosphorylation, perhaps by deoxycytidine kinase. Permeation into the cells was not rate limiting to ddAdo salvage. In P388 and L1210 cells that had not been treated with deoxycoformycin, ddAdo was salvaged at least 100 times more efficiently than in deoxycoformycin-treated cells and converted to nucleoside triphosphates, but the end-products and pathways of salvage have not been resolved entirely.

Pharmacologic agents such as phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate (PDBu) and ionomycin selectively stimulate PKC and elevate intracellular calcium to directly stimulate downstream mechanisms critical to cell growth and function. This study examines the effects of PDBu, ionomycin, and rIL-2 on childhood ALL blasts of early B lineage with respect to various aspects of cell activation, including DNA synthesis, induction of non-MHC restricted tumoricidal activity, and changes in morphology and phenotype. Five childhood ALL samples were tested. A marked heterogeneity was seen among the ALL samples with respect to in vitro growth following manipulation with PDBu, ionomycin, and/or rIL-2, whereas normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were consistently stimulated to grow with the combination of PDBu and ionomycin. Growth responsiveness did not appear to correlate with morphologic or phenotypic classification of the leukemia samples. Four of the five leukemia samples developed substantial non-MHC restricted cytotoxicity to K562 (natural killer cell (NK) sensitive) and Daudi (NK resistant) targets in response to rIL-2. This functional cytotoxic response correlated with morphologic changes in the cells and the appearance of granules. Phenotypic analyses of the ALL samples at the time of their peak cytotoxic function were consistent with the fresh ALL phenotype and showed no major change in cell populations. Three of the five ALL samples also retained rIL-2 induced cytotoxic capabilities when exposed simultaneously to the combination of PDBu and ionomycin, whereas rIL-2 induced tumoricidal activity in normal PBL and bone marrow cultures was inhibited by these reagents. These data show that morphologically and phenotypically similar ALL blasts have heterogeneous proliferative responses to the PKC and calcium modulators PDBu and ionomycin, as well as to rIL-2. Cytotoxic responses are also different from those of normal PBL and bone marrow cells with respect to kinetics and responsiveness to inducing agents. Thus current morphologic and phenotypic classifications of ALL may not adequately reflect the heterogeneity of this disorder as described here.","['Massey, G V', 'McCrady, C W', 'Dunn, N L', 'Russell, E C', 'Carchman, R A']","['Massey GV', 'McCrady CW', 'Dunn NL', 'Russell EC', 'Carchman RA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond 23298-0001.']",['eng'],"['CA-15525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28530/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DA-04502/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Ethers)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Ethers/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Ionomycin', 'Male', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/*analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",,1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Aug;3(8):602-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The SAC activation was followed by an increase in IL-2 receptor (IL-2R; CD25) expression, and the proliferation induced by BSF-MP6 + rIL-2 could be blocked in a dose-dependent manner by alpha-CD25 antibody. Furthermore, flow cytometric cell cycle studies showed that SAC and BSF-MP6 + rIL-2 stimulated cells underwent a complete transition through the cell cycle to become arrested in G1. The induced proliferation by BSF-MP6 + rIL-2 was dependent on serum but independent of the 2.8% of CD4, CD8, CD14, and CD16 positive cells contaminating the I83 cell population. Previously, we reported that I83 cells activated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) were induced to differentiation only but that the addition of BSF-MP6 induced DNA synthesis concomitantly with the differentiation. This paper demonstrates that physiological stimuli can induce both high-rate proliferation and differentiation in a B-CLL clone in vitro. It also suggests that the low proliferation and the differentiation block in vivo, characteristic of most B-CLLs, may reflect a subnormal response of B-CLL cells to growth and differentiation factors, or a dysfunction in the factor production by the patients' T cells.","['Carlsson, M', 'Totterman, T H', 'Rosen, A', 'Nilsson, K']","['Carlsson M', 'Totterman TH', 'Rosen A', 'Nilsson K']","['Department of Pathology, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",,1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Aug;3(8):593-601.,,,,,,,,,,['Leukemia. 1990 Mar;4(3):238-9.

STS 25 cells express the idiotypic (Id+) immunoglobulin (Ig) specific for the neoplastic B cells of the B-NHL patient. STS 25 cells are weakly positive for surface mu delta kappa and in addition express the surface markers CD19, CD20, CD23, HLA class I and II, and the 4F2 activation antigen. STS 25 cells are also Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen positive but do not secrete viral particles. Serum-free culture supernatant from STS 25 cells (STS 25 SUP) does not show activity in assays for interleukin-2 (IL-2), -4 (IL-4), -6 (IL-6), interferon or tumor necrosis factor, but is active in the thymocyte costimulation assay and the D10.G4.1 T helper clone proliferation assay for interleukin-1 (IL-1). The IL-1 character of the STS 25 SUP activity was confirmed in inhibition studies with three different poly- or monoclonal anti-IL-1 antibodies (31, 88, and 94% inhibition in thymocyte costimulation assay, respectively). Furthermore, complete blocking of D10.G4.1 cell proliferation mediated by STS 25 SUP was observed by including anti-IL-1 alpha specific antibody in the assay, whereas anti-IL-1 beta antibody had no effect. These results indicate that this STS 25 SUP activity can be attributed to the presence of IL-1 alpha in the supernatant. Northern blot analysis of total STS 25 cellular RNA using IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta specific probes revealed the constitutive expression of IL-1 alpha messenger RNA by STS 25 cells. In contrast, no IL-1 beta message was detectable, not even after treatment of the cells with phorbol ester or cycloheximide, which resulted in approximately 5-fold enhancement of IL-1 alpha mRNA expression. Binding studies with radiolabeled recombinant (r) IL-1 alpha indicated the presence of high numbers of IL-1 receptors on STS 25 cells (1,170 per cell, Kd = 392 pM).

The finding of abundant IL-2 receptors on malignant T cells in adult T cell leukemia suggested a deregulation of the IL-2/IL-2 receptor system and was assumed to account for aberrant growth in malignant disorders of T cells. In this study we use malignant T cells from nine patients with the clinical diagnosis of T-ALL or T-NHL and did not detect IL-2 dependent growth under conditions in which normal T cells responded to IL-2. IL-2 receptors comparable in numbers to activated T cells were found on T-ALL/T-NHL cells stimulated with PHA and PMA. However, binding studies using radiolabeled IL-2 indicated that the receptors present on malignant T cells were not able to bind to IL-2 with high affinity. Therefore, if IL-2 is involved in the proliferation of malignant T cells, its mechanism of growth regulation may be different from the one for normal T cells. Alternatively, IL-2 may not play a role in the regulation of growth of malignant T cells in vitro.","['Debatin, K M', 'Woodroofe, C', 'Lahm, H', 'Fischer, J', 'Falk, W', 'Brandeis, W E', 'Krammer, P H']","['Debatin KM', 'Woodroofe C', 'Lahm H', 'Fischer J', 'Falk W', 'Brandeis WE', 'Krammer PH']","[""Oncology-Immunology Section, University Children's Hospital, Heidelberg, F.R.G.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*physiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*analysis']",,1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Aug;3(8):566-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The activity of these cells is regulated by several cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN. In the present study we provide first evidence that IL-6 significantly augments the cytotoxic activity of human NK cells. IL-6 is produced by many different cells and is also known as IFN-beta 2, B cell stimulatory factor 2, hybridoma growth factor, hepatocyte-stimulating factor, and 26 kDa protein. IL-6 stimulates the activity of human CD3- NK cells but not that of CD3+ non-MHC-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes. As is the case with IL-2, the IL-6-mediated augmented cytotoxicity was a result of a more efficient lysis, but was not caused by an increased effector to target cell binding. Moreover, the effect of IL-6 on NK cell activity was blocked by a mAb directed against IL-2, and IL-6 itself was found to be a potent inducer of IL-2 production in cultured human PBMC. Thus it may be concluded that IL-6 enhances the cytotoxic activity of NK cells via IL-2. This newly recognized property of IL-6, which is produced by almost any cell, may be of importance in host defense against microbes and malignancies and therefore could contribute to improve the adoptive immunotherapy by using lymphokine-activated killer cells.","['Luger, T A', 'Krutmann, J', 'Kirnbauer, R', 'Urbanski, A', 'Schwarz, T', 'Klappacher, G', 'Kock, A', 'Micksche, M', 'Malejczyk, J', 'Schauer, E']","['Luger TA', 'Krutmann J', 'Kirnbauer R', 'Urbanski A', 'Schwarz T', 'Klappacher G', 'Kock A', 'Micksche M', 'Malejczyk J', 'Schauer E', 'et al.']","['Department of Dermatology II, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['CA-44365/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Fibroblasts/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/immunology/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology']",,1989/08/15 00:00,1989/08/15 00:01,['1989/08/15 00:00'],"['1989/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Aug 15;143(4):1206-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a prelude to investigating the dynamic interactions of these receptors, we have characterized binding of the mAb OKT3 specific for CD3 on Jurkat cells. The association of both OKT3 and its Fab' fragment is rapid at 4 degrees C, and dissociation of Fab' is also rapid, but dissociation of OKT3 is slow, indicating bivalent binding in this case. Dissociation of OKT3 is substantially accelerated at 37 degrees C if internalization is prevented. From the concentration dependence, the binding of OKT3 at 4 degrees C appears to be very tight whereas binding of the Fab' fragment is weaker and biphasic. Scatchard analysis of the Fab' equilibrium binding data indicates two binding sites with KD values of 5.1 x 10(-9) M and 2.7 x 10(-8) M. The very tight binding of the bivalent antibody may be caused by inter- or intramolecular cross-linking between these sites. If Jurkat cells are warmed to 37 degrees C, there is an energy-dependent increase by about one-third of sites bound by OKT3 or its Fab' fragment over that seen at 4 degrees C. This increase may be related to a receptor recycling process because internalization of a similar number of the bound ligands occurs at similar rates. Other experiments have revealed that OKT3, but not its Fab' fragment, causes the receptor complex to become associated with the detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton, and there are also insoluble intracellular OKT3-binding sites. These cross-linking-induced receptor-cytoskeletal interactions are sensitive to moderate changes in salt concentration that should allow their molecular basis to be investigated.","['Marano, N', 'Holowka, D', 'Baird, B']","['Marano N', 'Holowka D', 'Baird B']","['Department of Chemistry, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853.']",['eng'],"['AI 07622/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 18306/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 22449/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/immunology/*metabolism', '*Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoskeleton/immunology/*metabolism/physiology', 'Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism/physiology', 'Temperature']",,1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Aug 1;143(3):931-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similarities with the anti-tumor effects of tumor necrosis factor alpha or beta.,116-23,"Peri-tumoral injection of recombinant human interleukin-1 beta in mice transplanted s.c. with Friend erythroleukemia cells (FLC) resulted in marked inhibition of tumor growth and increased survival. However, in vitro treatment of FLC (745 or 3Cl-8) with IL-1 beta barely inhibited cell multiplication. IL-1 beta, injected into established solid tumors, induced marked morphologic changes. Vascular congestion and focal extravasation of erythrocytes were observed as early as 6 hr after injection with IL-1 beta of FLC and L1210 tumors and HeJ16 fibrosarcomas. Focal areas of disaggregation of tumor cells and tumor necrosis were observed 6 and 24 hr after IL-1 injection. These morphologic changes were similar to those observed in FLC tumors or HeJ16 fibrosarcomas treated with TNF-alpha or beta. These cytokines determined morphological changes in tumor blood vessels of FLC tumors within 1 hr of injection. Freshly dissected FLC tumors and their tissue extracts were studied by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, shortly after peri-tumoral injection of IL-1 beta or TNF-beta. After 6 hr, both cytokines induced a 3-fold reduction in the levels of two catabolites, glycerophosphorylcholine and glycerophosphorylethanolamine, an accumulation of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate and a more than 10-fold increase in the choline/phosphorylcholine ratio. These results are similar to those reported for TNF-alpha, and can be interpreted on the basis of an activation of glycerophosphorylcholine phosphodiesterase (EC 3.1.4.2) and partial inhibition of choline kinase (EC 2.7.1.32). IL-1 beta and TNF-beta (like TNF-alpha) also induced alkaline shifts (0.10-0.25 units) in the average intratumoral pH value. We suggest that alterations of tumor blood vessels may be the primary events in solid tumors treated with IL-1 beta or TNF. Such alterations lead to early changes in tumor metabolism and subsequent tumor cell degeneration.","['Belardelli, F', 'Proietti, E', 'Ciolli, V', 'Sestili, P', 'Carpinelli, G', 'Di Vito, M', 'Ferretti, A', 'Woodrow, D', 'Boraschi, D', 'Podo, F']","['Belardelli F', 'Proietti E', 'Ciolli V', 'Sestili P', 'Carpinelli G', 'Di Vito M', 'Ferretti A', 'Woodrow D', 'Boraschi D', 'Podo F']","['Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Female', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",,1989/07/15 00:00,1989/07/15 00:01,['1989/07/15 00:00'],"['1989/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910440121 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1989 Jul 15;44(1):116-23. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910440121.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty patients (23.2%) were positive for retroviral infection (22 for HIV-1 alone, four for HTLV-I alone, and four for both HIV-1 and HTLV-I). The most important risk factor was intravenous drug use, followed by blood transfusion. Patients with HIV-1 had lower T4-T8 ratios and higher mortality than those with HTLV-I infection alone. It was concluded that HTLV-I, as well as HIV-1, infection is endemic in chronic dialysis centers in Miami.

In these lymphomas the MuLV DNA is frequently integrated into the mouse chromosomal DNA in the vicinity of the pim-1 oncogene. Transgenic mice overexpressing the pim-1 oncogene are predisposed to develop T-cell lymphomas, but only to the extent that approximately 10% of the mice develop a lymphoma within 240 days. When these mice are infected with MuLV, lymphomas develop in all mice in only 50-60 days. In these lymphomas MuLV DNA is integrated near either the c-myc or N-myc gene, suggesting that pim-1 and myc synergize in lymphomagenesis. To determine whether this system has a more general application, we have now tested the susceptibility of pim-1 transgenic mice to N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), a chemical carcinogen. With a single low dose of ENU, nearly all pim-1 transgenic mice, but only 15% of non-transgenic mice, develop T-cell lymphomas within 200 days. All ENU-induced lymphomas in both pim-1 transgenic and non-transgenic mice express high levels of c-myc messenger RNA, supporting the notion that pim-1 and c-myc synergize in lymphoma induction. We propose that pim-1 transgenic mice could be used to test the oncogenic potential of other chemical compounds.","['Breuer, M', 'Slebos, R', 'Verbeek, S', 'van Lohuizen, M', 'Wientjens, E', 'Berns, A']","['Breuer M', 'Slebos R', 'Verbeek S', 'van Lohuizen M', 'Wientjens E', 'Berns A']","['Division of Molecular Genetics, the Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'P8M1T4190R (Ethylnitrosourea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Ethylnitrosourea', 'Lymphoma/*chemically induced', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', '*T-Lymphocytes']",,1989/07/06 00:00,1989/07/06 00:01,['1989/07/06 00:00'],"['1989/07/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/06 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/340061a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1989 Jul 6;340(6228):61-3. doi: 10.1038/340061a0.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we purified guinea pig (G.P.) TNF secreted from peritoneal macrophages and compared the antiproliferative and differentiative effects of the G.P. TNF with those of recombinant human TNF (rHuTNF). The purification scheme consisted of ultrafiltration, gel filtration-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), DEAE-HPLC, and reverse-phase HPLC. The cytotoxic activity of the purified substance was approximately 1.5 x 10(8) U/mg. The isoelectric point was 5.2. The molecular weight was 40 to 45 kDa as estimated by gel filtration and 18 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence was determined to be Ser-Ala-Ser-Gln-Asn-Asp . . . . Approximately 76 or 71% homology between G.P. TNF and mouse or human TNF exists in the NH2-terminal 21 residues. The purified G.P. TNF and rHuTNF demonstrated D-factor activity only in the presence of recombinant human IL-1 alpha in M1 cells. We also determined the effect of TNF on two human myeloid leukemic cell lines (THP-1 and U937). The purified G.P. TNF and rHuTNF inhibited the growth of U937 cells, but did not induce their differentiation. In THP-1 cells, TNF slightly inhibited the growth and induced differentiation. In mouse cell lines G.P.

For feline leukemia virus, the immunosuppression has been ascribed to the transmembrane envelope protein, p15E, which suppresses the proliferative responses of cat, mouse, and human lymphocytes. A similar suppressive effect has been shown for a lysate of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), strain HTLV-IIIB. Here we determined that detergent-disrupted HTLV-IIIB lystate exerted a strong suppressive effect on PHA-stimulated lymphocytes. Preparations of whole virions, a lysate of a local HIV isolate grown on MP-6 cells, and a commercially obtained UV and psoralene-inactivated lysate were examined and demonstrated to have a similar suppressive effect. The HIV lysate was not directly cytotoxic to lymphocytes and did not contain tumor necrosis factor or lymphotoxin. The HIV lysate specifically suppressed the proliferation of a range of hemopoietic cell lines from man and mouse including three EBV transformed CD4- and IL-2 receptor-negative B-cell lines. The lysate also suppressed the formation of human bone marrow colonies, whereas the lysate had only a slight or no effect on fibroblasts. The suppression of lymphocyte proliferation was not abrogated by addition of IL-2 or IL-1 and the HIV lysate inhibited the expression of IL-2 receptors on suboptimal PHA-stimulated mononuclear cells. The suppressive factor(s) has not been characterized in molecular terms, but suppressive activity was recovered in fractions with a molecular weight of about 67,000 and in both the glycoprotein fraction and in the glycoprotein-depleted fraction of the HIV lysate.

At a concentration of 10(-8) M, IL-2-toxin inhibited protein synthesis by 60 to 98% in lymph node ATL cells, whereas protein synthesis in peripheral blood ATL cells was inhibited from 20 to 57% in acute type, and from 3 to 13% in chronic type. In contrast, IL-2-toxin had no measurable effect on T-cells from either patients with smoldering type ATL or normal controls. The cytopathic effects of IL-2-toxin were blocked by the addition of anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody, suggesting that the inhibition of protein synthesis in target cells was mediated by the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R). The degree of inhibition of protein synthesis, however, was not closely correlated with expression of CD25 antigen (low-affinity Mr 55,000 glycoprotein, IL-2R, Tac antigen) on ATL cells.

Higher glutathione peroxidase (GP) activity was found in CLL lymphocytes. This activity in CLL B lymphocytes was 2-fold higher than that of normal B lymphocytes, and 3-fold higher than that of T lymphocytes from either source. Several disease processes have been associated with decreased glutathione peroxidase activity. Our finding with CLL B lymphocytes is believed to be the first example of an increased GP activity in a disease.

Maturation inducer has now been purified from a human T cell line and determined to be a single chain protein with an approximate molecular weight of 53,500. It induces the differentiation and proliferation of human leukemic HL-60 promyelocytes in a dosage-dependent fashion. Initial interaction with cells at G1 phase induced the cells to enter proliferating S phase. Subsequent differentiation from S phase was dependent on an optimal inducer quantity (18.7 pM - 18.7 nM) which mediated growth cessation and termination differentiation to monocytes-macrophages. When inducer quantity was more or less than this optimal range, the cells did not undergo differentiation but were continuously stimulated to proliferate.

Furthermore, it is not known whether cells from any given B cell leukemia are characterized by the same population during the differentiation process. Differentiation of various B cell leukemic cells was induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and the resulting changes in their morphology, cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (clg), and cytochemistry were evaluated. With respect to peculiar morphological change, i.e. extending long thin processes (spreading) and the appearance of clg, each sample showed different responses. According to these two indices samples were classified into three groups; spread+ clg- samples (one case of CLL-PLT, all HCL), spread+ clg+ samples (one of CLL, one of CLL-PLT), and spread- clg+ samples (a majority of CLL, one of CLL-PLT, and all PLL). Unexpectedly, both CLL and CLL-PLT consisted of heterogenous populations as to the reactivity to TPA. In the process of TPA-induced differentiation in CLL cells, features similar to those of HCL cells were not found. Since three different TPA-induced response patterns were observed in each chronic B cell leukemia type, it was not possible to sequentially assign each of these leukemias along a single B cell differentiation pathway. In order to explain this result, we introduced the hypothesis that these groups might be divided into different lineages in B cell differentiation. Since TPA-induced spreading cells were present in the B cell fraction of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, this morphological change should not be associated with malignant transformation.","['Tokumine, Y', 'Waki, K', 'Nishimori, Y', 'Kuratsune, H', 'Inoue, R', 'Nakamura, Y', 'Ueda, E', 'Machii, T', 'Kitani, T']","['Tokumine Y', 'Waki K', 'Nishimori Y', 'Kuratsune H', 'Inoue R', 'Nakamura Y', 'Ueda E', 'Machii T', 'Kitani T']","['Department of Clinical Research, Osaka University, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/analysis/drug effects/*pathology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/pathology', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",,1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Jul;3(7):516-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In patients with stage III or IV disease, the median receptor level was significantly higher than in patients with lower stages (3195 vs. 1087 U/ml, p = 0.0001). Similarly, the median level for children with stage B disease was 3262 U/ml, compared with 999 U/ml for those lacking constitutional symptoms (p = 0.0001).

When entered in the Cox-proportional hazards model with other potentially useful prognostic factors, soluble IL2R level was found to be an independent predictor of treatment outcome. The relationship of high serum IL2R levels to an adverse clinical outcome in Hodgkin's disease may be explained by a model in which the soluble receptor competes for the ligand with the cellular receptor on normal lymphocytes, thus blocking antitumor immunity dependent on interleukin-2. Alternatively, high serum levels of IL2R may simply reflect increased release of the receptor from activated malignant cells in patients with advanced disease or an otherwise poor prognosis.","['Pui, C H', 'Ip, S H', 'Thompson, E', 'Wilimas, J', 'Brown, M', 'Dodge, R K', 'de Hoyos, R A', 'Berard, C W', 'Crist, W M']","['Pui CH', 'Ip SH', 'Thompson E', 'Wilimas J', 'Brown M', 'Dodge RK', 'de Hoyos RA', 'Berard CW', 'Crist WM']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*blood/pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction']",,1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Jul;3(7):481-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, the alloantiserum injected shortly before inoculation of tumor barely enhanced the tumor growth. The passively administered alloantiserum inhibited the sensitization for allospecific cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in vitro. Further study revealed that the allo-sensitization could be blocked with antiserum specific against only one of the expressed H-2 antigens on stimulator cells.

The leukemic clonogenic capacity of 11 AML cases, selected on the basis of their ability to grow in vitro, was highly reduced following overnight preincubation with LAK effectors. The degree of colony inhibition, which ranged between 66% and 98% (mean 83.8% +/- 11.4 SD), was quantitatively greater than by 51Cr release, which gave rise to lytic values between 5% and 65% (mean 43.2% +/- 19.2 SD). The demonstration that the clonogenic inhibition was still induced following a shorter pre-incubation period (4 hours) suggests that the effect is unlikely to be due only to the generation of cytotoxic activity during the incubation time. The possibility that LAK cells may be employed in the management of residual disease is strengthened by the evidence that the clonogenic potential of samples containing as few as 20% and 14.3% leukemic cells could be almost completely abolished by LAK effectors. These findings further point the possible role of adoptive immunotherapy with interleukin 2/LAK cells in the treatment of patients with acute leukemia.","['Lista, P', 'Fierro, M T', 'Liao, X S', 'Bonferroni, M', 'Brizzi, M F', 'Porcu, P', 'Pegoraro, L', 'Foa, R']","['Lista P', 'Fierro MT', 'Liao XS', 'Bonferroni M', 'Brizzi MF', 'Porcu P', 'Pegoraro L', 'Foa R']","['Istituto di Medicina Interna, University of Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology', '*Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1989.tb01465.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1989 May;42(5):425-30. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1989.tb01465.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-6 and IL-1 inhibited the growth of U937, M1, and M1-3b-N in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of these cells with both IL-6 and IL-1 resulted in either an additive or a synergistic growth inhibition. IL-6 alone induced moderate differentiation of U937 and M1-3b-N, but the combination of IL-6 and IL-1 synergistically augmented this differentiation. In M1, only the combination of IL-1 and IL-6 resulted in differentiation. These two cytokines, whether alone or in combination, did not influence the growth and differentiation of HL-60. Therefore IL-6 in conjunction with IL-1 can induce differentiation in several human and mouse myeloid leukemic cell lines, although this effect varies with cell type. IL-6 did not stimulate the expression of IL-1 mRNA or IL-1 activity in U937 cells. IL-1 also failed to stimulate IL-6 production. Furthermore, the differentiation of U937 cells induced by IL-6 was not neutralized by antibody against either IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta. The minimal differentiative effect of IL-1 was not affected by anti-IL-6 antibody.

This prescription has long been used traditionally against anemia, anorexia, extreme exhaustion and fatigue. TJ-48 may now provide new advantages with little toxicity in combination with chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and promising results have actually been obtained in terms of preventing leukemia in cancer patients who have taken antitumor agents. The combination of TJ-48 and mitomycin C (MMC) produced significantly longer survival in p-388 tumor-bearing mice than MMC alone, and TJ-48 decreased the diverse effects of MMC such as leukopenia, thrombopenia and weight loss. However, mechanisms of the pharmacological action are still unclear. One of the possible mechanisms of the action of TJ-48 may be some effects on immune responses. Therefore we studied the effects of TJ-48 on immune response in mice and characterization of immunologically active substances. TJ-48 augmented antibody production and activated macrophage by oral administration of TJ-48, but reduced the MMC-induced immunosuppression in mice. TJ-48 showed a mitogenic activity in splenocytes but not in thymocytes, and an anti-complementary activity was also observed. Anti-complementary activity and mitogenic activity were both observed in high-molecular polysaccharide fraction but not in low-molecular weight fraction. Of several polysaccharide fractions in TJ-48, only pectic polysaccharide fraction (F-5-2) showed potent mitogenic activity. F-5-2 was also shown to have the highest anti-complementary activity. However, the polygalacturonan region is essential for the expression of the mitogenic activity, but that the contribution of poly-galacturonan region to the anti-complementary activity is less. F-5-2 activates complement via alternative complement pathway and induces the proliferation of B cells but does not differentiate those cells from antibody producing cells.","['Yamada, H']",['Yamada H'],['Kitasato Institute (Oriental Medicine Research Center).'],['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Irrespective of which types of lymphokines and cell-cell interactions among various T cell subsets are involved in the implementation of host immune responses against tumor, the feasible and practical approach is to use both molecular and cellular mechanisms for the augmented induction of effector T cell activity against tumor-resistant antigens (TRA). We have demonstrated previously that the in vivo effector T cells comprise 2 subsets of TRA-specific non-cytolytic CD4- and CD8-positive helper T cells, both of which release lymphokines and activate macrophages as an ultimate anti-tumor cytocidal effector. We have also defined conditions under which enhanced anti-tumor immunity can be obtained by pre-inducing potent helper T cell activity reactive to a certain antigenic determinant such as trinitrophenyl (TNP) residue of muramyl dipeptide (MDP)-derivatives as hapten, and immunized with tumor cells coupled with the corresponding haptenic determinant. This system induced most efficient and physiological cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the generation of tumor-specific effector T cell activity in vivo by virtue of the close linkage of hapten-reactive helper T cells and TRA-specific effector-precursor T cells in the microenvironment of hapten-coupled tumor cells. We have subsequently demonstrated that this protocol resulted in enhanced in vivo tumor protective immunity but also was applicable to the immunotherapy whereby a growing solid tumor as well as disseminated leukemia cells could be effectively eradicated in mice. Thus, these results emphasize the role of hapten-reactive helper T cell in augmenting tumor-specific immunity, and this protocol provides an effective maneuver for tumor-specific immunotherapy in human in future.","['Hamaoka, T']",['Hamaoka T'],['Osaka University Medical School.'],['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

It can be divided into 5 types (acute type, chronic type, smoldering type, crisis type, and lymphoma type). ATL cells originate from the CD4-positive subset of peripheral T cells; they show a characteristic notch in the nucleus and a lobulation tendency. ATL resists chemotherapy, and patients with acute and lymphoma types have quite a poor prognosis. A definite diagnosis of ATL is made by documenting the presence of HTLV-I proviral DNA in the DNA of tumor cells. HTLV-I infection is caused by transmission of live lymphocytes via three routes (from mother to children, from males to females, and by transfusion). Familial occurrence of ATL is frequently seen. HTLV-I infection is also seen in other countries, but its incidence is highest in Japan.

HTLV-II tax (tax II)-positive mouse cells (15S-5a) infected with Mo+HTLV-II+ M-MuLV or delta Mo+HTLV-II+ M-MuLV showed higher rates of viral transcription in nuclear run-on assays than did infected tax-negative NIH 3T3 cells. The chromatin structure of these viruses was investigated by high-resolution mapping of DNase I-hypersensitive (HS) sites. Three prominent HS sites were associated with HTLV-II sequences in proviral chromatin both in tax-positive and in tax-negative cells. The spacing resembled that of the 21-base-pair (bp) repeats, but the HS sites were displaced approximately 50 bp upstream of the 21-bp repeats. This suggested that cellular proteins bound to the HTLV-II sequences in the presence or absence of tax. No direct effect of tax on chromatin structure was found.

In the T-cell lineage, its expression is higher in proliferative immature thymocytes than in pre- and post-thymic T lymphocytes.

We found no increase in expression when cells were activated with anti-immunoglobulin together with interleukin-4, or induced to proliferate by low-molecular weight B cell growth factor (LMW-BCGF). Culture of activated B cells with B cell differentiation factor was associated with an increased mean expression of p24. In cells from a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), culture with LMW-BCGF up-regulated p24 expression. Resting T cells (p24-negative) were induced to express p24 strongly when activated with antibody against CD3. CD9 antibody did not modulate B or T cell responses to activation stimuli.

Recombinant ADF produced by COS-7 monkey kidney cells showed IL-2R/Tac inducing activity on YT cells, which are sensitive for ADF. ADF mRNA was strongly expressed in HTLV-I(+) T cells lines, but not in inactivated cells (THP-1, unstimulated PBMC). Furthermore, in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the expression of ADF mRNA was enhanced by mitogens or phorbol myristate acetate, suggesting a possible involvement of ADF in the lymphocyte activation. Homology analysis revealed an unexpected relationship between ADF and dithiol-reducing enzyme, thioredoxin, involved in many important biological reactions such as the conversion of ribonucleotides into deoxyribonucleotides, or the stabilization of glucocorticoid receptors.

However, we have identified several scid A-MuLV transformants that transcribe the germline Ig kappa light chain constant region and actively rearrange the kappa variable region gene locus. In one case progression to the stage of kappa light chain gene rearrangement did not require expression of Ig mu heavy chains; furthermore, this progression could not be efficiently induced following expression of mu heavy chains from an introduced vector. As observed in pre-B cell lines from normal mice, attempted V kappa-to-J kappa rearrangements in scid transformants occur by inversion at least as frequently as by deletion. The inverted rearrangements result in retention of both products of the recombination event in the chromosome, thus allowing their examination. scid kappa coding sequence joins are aberrant and analogous in structure to previously described scid heavy chain coding joins. In contrast, the recognition signals that flank involved coding segments frequently are joined precisely back-to-back in normal fashion. The scid VDJ recombinase defect therefore does not significantly impair recognition of, site-specific cutting at, or juxtaposition and appropriate ligation of signal sequences. Our finding that the scid defect prevents formation of correct coding but not signal joins distinguishes these events mechanistically.","['Blackwell, T K', 'Malynn, B A', 'Pollock, R R', 'Ferrier, P', 'Covey, L R', 'Fulop, G M', 'Phillips, R A', 'Yancopoulos, G D', 'Alt, F W']","['Blackwell TK', 'Malynn BA', 'Pollock RR', 'Ferrier P', 'Covey LR', 'Fulop GM', 'Phillips RA', 'Yancopoulos GD', 'Alt FW']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032.']",['eng'],"['AI-20047/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-40427/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Light Chain', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'VDJ Recombinases']",PMC400869,1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1989 Mar;8(3):735-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Skin was the initial site of relapse in 11 patients, without marrow relapse, occurring as late as 5.5 years after diagnosis. Most patients in this retrospective series were treated with radiation therapy and/or palliative chemotherapy, and did poorly, with prompt bone marrow relapses and serial skin relapses. Long-term disease-free survival was achieved in the one patient whose skin relapse was treated with whole-body electron-beam radiation therapy in conjunction with reinduction and consolidation chemotherapy. Severe skin toxicity was caused by administration of Adriamycin (doxorubicin) 12 days after electron-beam irradiation in one patient, but was not seen when cytosine arabinoside was administered in doses up to 3 g/m2 in conjunction with radiation therapy. This retrospective review suggests that optimal management of AML involving skin might include whole-body electron-beam irradiation in conjunction with induction or reinduction chemotherapy without anthracyclines, followed by consolidation chemotherapy.

The tax protein, purified to apparent homogeneity binds to double-stranded DNA irrespective of its origin from either a nuclear or cytoplasmic fraction of the HTLV-I immortalized cell-line - both of which harbor similar quantities of tax protein. The tax protein binds less to single-stranded DNA and not to single-stranded RNA in vitro. It also binds to DNA-cellulose and heparin-Sepharose.

Peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from normal donors showed a significant increase in NK activity against K562 leukemia cells after preincubation for 18 h with the IL-1 peptide. A similar augmentation was not observed after culturing the cells in the presence of hu IL-1 beta. The increase in tumor cell lysis could not be ascribed to a cytolytic activity of the synthetic fragment on target cells, since the peptide caused no direct lysis of various tumor cell lines. Although the peptide enhanced NK cytotoxicity of PBMC, highly purified large granular lymphocytes were not susceptible to its stimulatory effect. The addition to the cultures of antibodies to human interleukin-2 (hu IL-2) completely blocked the peptide-induced boost of NK cytotoxicity, suggesting that IL-2 is mainly involved in the activation process. The ability of the IL-1 peptide to increase NK activity was further confirmed in vivo in the mouse. Cytotoxicity against YAC-1 lymphoma cells, which was very low in the spleen of untreated BALB/c mice, was in fact significantly increased after a single inoculation of the peptide.

These cells are stimulated in vitro to DNA synthesis and multiplication in the presence of the lymphokine LMW-BCGF. We have tested the level of expression on these cells of the newly described B8.7 activation marker which has been reported to be associated with the capacity of various B cells to respond to LMW-BCGF. The presence of this marker has been readily detected on the hairy cells of 10 of the 12 patients tested in this study; interestingly, for one of the negative cases, the tumor cells were unable to proliferate in response to LMW-BCGF. As on normal B cells, a marked inhibition of the LMW-BCGF dependent response could be achieved in the presence of a monoclonal anti-B8.7 antibody, sustaining the proposal that the B8.7 molecule is involved in the signaling pathway of this growth factor. IFN-alpha is highly efficient in the therapy of hairy cell leukemia (HCL), and we confirm in the present study that IFN-alpha also inhibits the LMW-BCGF dependent proliferation of hairy cells in vitro.

Cytotoxicity is thought to be mediated by the accumulation of deoxyadenosine (AdR) and deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) which inhibits ribonucleotide reductase and DNA synthesis in rapidly proliferating cells. Others suggested mechanisms leading to cell death particularly in non-dividing cells include depletion of ATP and NAD pools, inhibition of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase and induction of DNA strand breaks. In patients with high leukemic counts who were subsequently treated with DCF, we have studied (a) the levels of ADA, ecto-5'-nucleotidase (5NT), deoxyadenosine kinase (AdR-kinase) and SAH-hydrolase in the leukemic cells; [b) the in-vitro effects of DCF on dATP, ATP, NAD, SAH-hydrolase levels and on DNA strand breaks; and (c) the correlation between these parameters with clinical response to DCF. No significant difference in ADA, 5NT, AdR-kinase and SAH-hydrolase activities could be found between responders and non-responders. Incubation of the leukemic cells in vitro with DCF caused an inhibition of ADA, an accumulation of dATP, a moderate reduction in ATP and NAD levels, a suppression of SAH-hydrolase activity and an increase in DNA strand breaks in practically all the leukemic samples, irrespective of clinical response. Our results show that neither measurement of these enzymes nor studies of these biochemical sequelae of ADA inhibition in vitro predicts clinical responsiveness to DCF therapy.","['Ho, A D', 'Ganeshaguru, K', 'Knauf, W', 'Dietz, G', 'Trede, I', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Hunstein, W']","['Ho AD', 'Ganeshaguru K', 'Knauf W', 'Dietz G', 'Trede I', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Hunstein W']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Deoxyadenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '11033-22-0 (Coformycin)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.- (Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.3.1.1 (Adenosylhomocysteinase)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', ""K8KCC8SH6N (2'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate)""]",IM,"['*Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/blood', 'Adenosylhomocysteinase', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Coformycin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'Deoxyadenine Nucleotides/blood', 'Humans', 'Hydrolases/blood', 'Leukemia/blood/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/blood/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/blood/drug therapy/enzymology', 'NAD/blood', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pentostatin', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology']",,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(89)90063-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(4):269-78. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90063-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sequence analysis of TCR-gamma cDNA clones indicates that form 1 utilizes the C gamma 1 gene segment, whereas forms 2bc and 2abc appear to use allelic C gamma 2 gene segments containing either two copies (b and c) or three copies (a, b, and c) of the CII exon, respectively. We transfected TCR-gamma cDNA encoding form 1 or form 2abc into the MOLT-13 cell line that expresses form 2bc. The transfected TCR gamma-chains associate with the resident MOLT-13 TCR-delta, normally part of form 2bc, to yield CD3-associated TCR-gamma delta heterodimers identical to those seen on the donor cell lines (form 1 or 2abc). These transfection experiments show directly that, 1) when a single TCR-delta subunit is available, the presence or absence of disulfide linkage between TCR gamma- and TCR delta-chains is controlled by the TCR gamma-chain, and 2) the difference in the amount of N-linked carbohydrate attached to the transfected TCR-gamma proteins of form 2bc vs form 2abc is influenced by the presence or absence of CII exon copy ""a"" which appears to alter the secondary and/or tertiary structure of these TCR gamma-chain constant regions, thereby affecting the attachment of N-linked glycans. In contrast to the similar structure and usage of C beta 1 and C beta 2, TCR-gamma delta forms show striking differences in structure and are not equally represented in peripheral blood.

Sandwich enzyme immunoassay for IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta revealed that IL-1 beta was responsible for IL-1 activity of these culture supernatants. Furthermore, the bone resorbing activities of these culture supernatants were completely neutralized by pretreatment of anti-IL-1 beta, but not anti-IL-1 alpha antibody.

We have used a limiting dilution (LD) culture approach to quantitatively assess frequencies of proliferating lymphocyte precursors (PLP), cytotoxic lymphocyte precursors (CLP), and interleukin-2 (IL-2)-producing helper lymphocyte precursors (HLP). Unseparated mononuclear cells (MNC) or purified T cells (E+) and leukemic B cells (E-) were cocultured under LD conditions with irradiated OKT3 hybridoma cells in the absence (determination of HLP) or presence of recombinant IL-2 (determination of PLP and CLP). Under these conditions, low frequencies of PLP, HLP, and CLP (f = 1/65 to 1/4600) were measured in unseparated MNC of CLL patients. In contrast, purified T cells (50% to 92% CD3+) contained precursors of proliferating, IL-2-producing and cytotoxic T cells in similar frequency as did T cells from healthy control donors (f = 1/4 to 1/24). Leukemic B cells rigorously depleted of T cells did not give rise to measurable frequencies of PLP, HLP, or CLP (f less than 1/50.000) except in one CLL patient where a significant frequency (f = 1/1700) of HLP was consistently present in E- cells, despite the absence of growth-inducible PLP and CLP. Taken together, these results indicate that comparable numbers of IL-2-producing helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells are present in B-CLL patients and healthy controls, respectively. The data are discussed with respect to reported T cell abnormalities in B-CLL.","['Janssen, O', 'Nerl, C', 'Kabelitz, D']","['Janssen O', 'Nerl C', 'Kabelitz D']","['Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Ulm, West-Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/pathology', 'Male', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",,1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78967-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 May 1;73(6):1622-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Short-term concanavalin A (Con A)-activated, purified T lymphocytes from patients on, as well as patients off, therapy had a significantly decreased proliferative responsiveness to a saturating amount of exogenous, recombinant IL-2 as compared to control subjects (P less than 0.005 and less than 0.05, respectively). Phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated IL-2 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was also substantially decreased in both patient groups with the median values of IL-2 produced being 2.2, 2.1, and 8.1 U/mL in the on therapy, off therapy, and control groups, respectively. In addition, PHA-induced expression of cell-surface receptors for IL-2 on PBMC was significantly decreased in both patient groups as compared to control subjects (P less than 0.01). Lymphocyte proliferation to mitogens (PHA, Con A, and pokeweed mitogen) was similar in all three groups studied. These results demonstrate that substantial quantitative and qualitative abnormalities of the IL-2-T lymphocyte system are present in the majority of treated patients with ALL, not only during maintenance therapy, but also for a prolonged period after the cessation of all chemotherapy.

FA was eliminated in plasma more slowly than 5-MTHF. Between the two doses, there was no evidence of modification in pharmacokinetic parameters (terminal half-life, clearance) for either FA or 5-MTHF in plasma and CSF; 5-MTHF was the only product detectable in CSF. Considering FA plus 5-MTHF together, the AUC (area under the curve) ratios between CSF and plasma were close to 1%. 5-MTHF was cleared very slowly from CSF (t 1/2 = 85 h). This finding suggested possible accumulation of 5-MTHF in CSF during repeated administration of FA combined with medium or high dose MTX. In the second part of the study, dealing with a group of eight children treated by such protocols, an increase in CSF 5-MTHF was detected from cycle to cycle in five (r = 0.91, P less than 0.01) with a maximum at 5 x 10(-8) M.

ADCC using K562 target-directed monoclonal antibody (MAb) 4.6E10 was also modulated by treating the effectors with IFN or IL-2.

Combined use of IFN and IL-2 potentiated further the lymphocytotoxicity to 25% in healthy donors, 135% in normal NK responder CML patients and 283% in low NK responder CML patients. This treatment resulted in restoration of cytotoxicity of the latter group of patients to a normal level. The augmentation was seen in 80-100% CML patients. Although ADCC with chicken red blood cells as targets was within normal range, ADCC mediated with MAb to K562 cells was significantly lower in CML low NK responders (24.5%) than CML normal NK responders (42.4%) and healthy donors (65.9%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Dabholkar, M', 'Tatake, R', 'Amin, K', 'Advani, S', 'Gangal, S']","['Dabholkar M', 'Tatake R', 'Amin K', 'Advani S', 'Gangal S']","['Immunology Division, Tata Memorial Hospital, Tata Memorial Centre, Bombay, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins']",,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000226698 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncology. 1989;46(2):123-7. doi: 10.1159/000226698.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report studies that were concerned with defining growth factor responses of RAEB progenitors (RAEB-CFU) in colony culture using pure hematopoietic growth factors. Marrow cells of 10 RAEB patients were cultured with recombinant IL3, GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF and EPO. Factor dependent colony growth of four patients was examined in detail cytologically. The analysis revealed notable deficiencies in the colony forming spectrum as compared with normal marrow: although granulocytic colonies were formed in all of these four RAEB cases, macrophage colonies could not be induced in 1/4 cases and eosinophilic and erythroid colony formation could not be propagated in 2/4 cases with the proper stimuli. These findings are indicative of the intrinsic incapabilities of RAEB-CFU to mature along certain differentiation pathways in response to the growth factors. We then determined the surface phenotypes of RAEB-CFU using MoAbs Vim-2 (myelomonocytic) and B13C5 (CD34) following dual labeling and fluorescence activated cell sorting and subsequent culture of the separately sorted BI3C5+/Vim-2+, BIC5+/Vim-2-, BI3C5-/Vim-2+ and BIC5-/Vim-2- cells. In normal marrow most clonogenic cells were recovered from the BI3C5+/Vim-2- fraction. In contrast, in RAEB marrow increased proportions of the colony forming cells were BI3C5+/Vim-2+, BI3C5-/Vim-2+, or BI3C5-. The altered distribution of surface immunophenotypes of RAEB-CFU provides further evidence for the imbalance of maturation in the progenitor cell compartment. The results are discussed in view of the concept that the inabilities of the RAEB hematopoietic precursors to mature in response to the hematopoietic growth factors are partial and variable, but may culminate in a progressive loss of the differentiation competence of the progenitors when leukemia evolves.","['Schouten, H C', 'Delwel, R', 'Bot, F J', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'Touw, I P', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Schouten HC', 'Delwel R', 'Bot FJ', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Touw IP', 'Lowenberg B']","['Dr Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cells/*cytology']",,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(89)90019-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(3):245-51. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90019-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,

DM105 CTL failed to lyse allogeneic melanomas that shared HLA-A1, or that shared B or C region Ag, but they did lyse allogeneic melanoma DM49, which expressed an A region Ag that either was A10 or was serologically cross-reactive with A10. A T cell leukemia line, three EBV transformed B cell lines, and a pancreatic cancer line, all of which expressed HLA-A2, were not lysed by DM6 or DM179 CTL. Furthermore, HLA-matched nonmelanomas failed to inhibit autologous tumor lysis in cold target inhibition assays, whereas an HLA-A2+ allogeneic melanoma, DM93, inhibited autologous tumor lysis as effectively as the autologous tumor itself. HLA-A2, and possibly other HLA-A-region Ag, appear to function in HLA-restricted recognition of shared melanoma associated Ag by CTL.","['Darrow, T L', 'Slingluff, C L Jr', 'Seigler, H F']","['Darrow TL', 'Slingluff CL Jr', 'Seigler HF']","['Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710.']",['eng'],['2-PO1-CA-32672-05A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A10 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/physiology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'HLA-A Antigens/immunology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",,1989/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 May 1;142(9):3329-35.,,,,,,,,,,,,

This monoclonal antibody, 1A6 was tested on normal human peripheral blood cells, leukemia patients' cells and leukemia-lymphoma cell lines. The results demonstrated that this antibody reacts with normal human T and B cells, but not with erythrocytes, granulocytes or platelets. Further examinations showed 10/11 leukemic patient cell types were positive with 1A6. In contrast, many leukemia-lymphoma cell lines were negative (14/17), i.e. T and B leukemia lymphoma cell lines, non-T and non-B leukemia cell lines as examined by complement mediated cytotoxicity test and immunofluorescence test. Other prominent characteristics of 1A6 MAB have been demonstrated, which include inhibition of myeloid colony formation (CFU-C) and suppression of human natural killer cell cytotoxicity (NKCC). These results suggest that 1A6 is a common marker for normal T, B, NK cells and leukemic patients cells having T and B cell origin, but 1A6 antigen is not expressed on many leukemia lymphoma cell lines. Therefore, it could be useful for studying malignant transformation of lymphoid cells.","['Togashi, H', 'Ghoneum, M', 'Takasugi, M', 'Kasai, K', 'Mugishima, H', 'Billing, R', 'Terasaki, P I']","['Togashi H', 'Ghoneum M', 'Takasugi M', 'Kasai K', 'Mugishima H', 'Billing R', 'Terasaki PI']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90024.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/physiology', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', '*Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tissue Distribution']",,1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2900070306 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1989 May-Jun;7(3):233-42. doi: 10.1002/hon.2900070306.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Attempts to enhance LAK cell generation in these patients are reported here. Combining the lymphokines interleukins-2, with -4 and -5 (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5), was not successful; in fact, IL-4 depressed LAK cell induction in both normal donors and CML patients. The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate also failed to enhance cytotoxicity of normal donors or patients, and indomethacin was similarly without effect. The only agent found to enhance LAK cell induction by IL-2 in normal donors was interferon-gamma (but not IFN-alpha) and even this modest effect was not seen with the cells of CML patients. Increasing concentrations of IL-2 and/or culture duration also failed to improve LAK cell generation by patients. The only improvement in LAK cell generation was observed in CML patients treated for one or more months with IFN-alpha, where a steady increase of LAK activity with time after initiation of therapy was noted. These results show that the blockade of LAK cell induction in chronic-phase myelogenous leukemia patients is difficult to lift pharmacologically in vitro but possibly susceptible to biological response modifiers in vivo.","['Pawelec, G', 'Schneider, E', 'Ehninger, G', 'Rehbein, A', 'Schmidt, H']","['Pawelec G', 'Schneider E', 'Ehninger G', 'Rehbein A', 'Schmidt H']","['Immunology Laboratory, Medizinische Klinik, Tubingen, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*administration & dosage', '*Interleukin-2', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects']",,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00199918 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1989;29(1):63-6. doi: 10.1007/BF00199918.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors have measured B cell growth factor (BCGF)-induced proliferation in B lymphocytes isolated from 28 patients with malignancies representing different stages of B cell differentiation. The phorbol ester TPA (12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate), a potent mitogen and inducer of BCGF receptor expression in normal B cells, was added in combination with BCGF to enhance the proliferative response. These results show that many neoplastic B cells are able to respond to BCGF (32%), particularly when combined with TPA (63%). The response was variable in frequency and magnitude within clinicopathologic groups; cells from patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) were more refractory to stimulation than those from acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). An attenuated response to BCGF plus TPA was observed in neoplastic cells with high rates of spontaneous DNA synthesis from all histologic categories. These observations suggest that some maximally stimulated cells appear incapable of responding to additional exogenous growth stimuli. Within apparently homogeneous clinicopathologic groups, distinct subgroups of B cell neoplasms can be defined by cellular responses to BCGF.

Western blotting studies indicate that the 114/A10 antigen has a mean relative molecular mass of 150,000 but varies greatly in size range between different cell types. cDNA clones encoding this protein were isolated from a plasmid-based expression vector library prepared from B6SUtA RNA. Three clones corresponding in size to the two major mRNA species detected in IL-3-dependent cell lines (3.0 and 2.2 kilobase pairs) and differing in their utilization of alternative polyadenylation signals were obtained. These clones contain a single long open reading frame of 573 amino acids possessing the typical characteristics of an integral membrane protein. A particularly striking feature of this sequence is the presence at the extracellular amino terminus of a series of eight highly conserved 27-amino acid, serine/threonine-rich (55%) tandem repeats that may serve as sites of extensive glycosylation. The extracellular domain also contains three epidermal growth factor-like cysteine-rich repeats.

Sixteen of 28 patients (57%) showed a normal number of circulating B-lymphocytes, as demonstrated by the low percentage of mouse rosette-forming cells (M-RFC), surface immunoglobulins (SIg), and CD24-positive cells. Clinically, a lower number of relapses occurred in this group of patients compared to those with a persistent expansion of peripheral B-cells (P less than 0.05). In order to assess monoclonality of the residual peripheral B-cell population, the distribution of SIg light chains was investigated on the B-cell-enriched fraction of 15 of these 16 cases. Only six of them had a kappa/lambda ratio which ranged between 1.7:1 and 3:1, whereas the remaining patients still displayed a clearly imbalanced kappa/lambda Ig light chain distribution. On the other hand, the analysis of the configuration of the Ig heavy chain gene region, performed in nine cases (including five of the above six cases), showed the persistence of a rearranged pattern in all cases tested but one. Therefore, residual monoclonal B-cells were found also in the majority of cases which displayed the lowest kappa/lambda ratio, a normal bone marrow lymphocytosis and a long-lasting clinical remission. Studies at the DNA level confirm that a remission is rarely achieved in this disease in spite of intensive and prolonged chemotherapy. Nonetheless, the follow-up of B-CLL patients by conventional immunologic markers may be helpful to better define response to therapy and to predict the occurrence of clinical relapse.","['Brugiatelli, M', 'Callea, V', 'Morabito, F', 'Oliva, B', 'Francia Di Celle, P', 'Fierro, M T', 'Neri, A', 'Foa, R']","['Brugiatelli M', 'Callea V', 'Morabito F', 'Oliva B', 'Francia Di Celle P', 'Fierro MT', 'Neri A', 'Foa R']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedali Riuniti di Reggio Calabria Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/classification/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/blood/genetics/*pathology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Humans', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",,1989/05/15 00:00,1989/05/15 00:01,['1989/05/15 00:00'],"['1989/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19890515)63:10<1979::aid-cncr2820631018>3.0.co;2-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1989 May 15;63(10):1979-84. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19890515)63:10<1979::aid-cncr2820631018>3.0.co;2-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The balance between self-renewal and differentiation in blast stem cells may be an important attribute contributing to treatment outcome. Cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) is included in most chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of AML. When ara-C survival curves are constructed, the drug appears to be more toxic when an assay is used that detects principally self-renewing divisions, compared with a procedure that depends on terminal divisions. AML blasts usually respond in culture to myelopoietic growth factors; their response often includes a change in self-renewal, differentiation, or both. These features of the model for AML blasts led to the prediction that growth factors would alter ara-C survival curves in a way that depended on the effects of the culture conditions on self-renewal and differentiation. Four AML blast populations were chosen to test this prediction on the basis of our ability to manipulate them by adding or withholding one or more growth factors. Highly significant changes were seen in the ara-C survival curves, depending on the growth factors present in the cultures as was predicted by the observed effects of the factors on renewal and differentiation.","['Miyauchi, J', 'Kelleher, C A', 'Wang, C', 'Minkin, S', 'McCulloch, E A']","['Miyauchi J', 'Kelleher CA', 'Wang C', 'Minkin S', 'McCulloch EA']","['Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/pathology', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*toxicity', 'Doxorubicin/toxicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/pathology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75553-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Apr;73(5):1272-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrated previously that there are two classes (high and low affinity) of IL-5 receptors on murine chronic B-cell leukemic cells (BCL1-B20). Treatment of surface-bound radiolabeled IL-5 with bivalent crosslinkers identified a polypeptide of Mr 92,500. In this study, we analyzed characteristics of high-affinity IL-5 receptors on IL-5-dependent early B-cell lines (T-88 and T88-M), mouse myeloma cells (MOPC-104E), and BCL1-B20 cells. All cell lines had two classes of IL-5 binding sites, but T88-M cells bore the highest number of high-affinity receptors. The number of high-affinity IL-5 receptors on BCL1-B20 cells could be up-regulated 3-fold by lipopolysaccharide and down-regulated by IL-5. Disuccinimidyl tartarate crosslinking of 35S-labeled IL-5 to the receptors on the T88-M and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BCL1-B20 cells revealed two major 35S-labeled components of Mr 92,500 and Mr 160,000, even when the binding of 35S-labeled IL-5 was carried out under high-affinity conditions (100 pM 35S-labeled IL-5). The Mr 92,500 component, but not the Mr 160,000 component, was detected in the lysates of MOPC-104E and T-88 cells, both of which bore a large number of low-affinity receptors and a limited number of high-affinity receptors.

Co-cultivation of CCRF-SB-T1 and BS B-LCLs also resulted in a significant reduction in SCE level, from 70 to 35, in BS cells, lowered the BrdU concentrations necessary for sister-chromatid differential staining (SCD) from 15 micrograms/ml (0.05 mM) to 2.0 micrograms/ml (0.01 mM) and resulted in a completely normal level of SCE in CCRF-SB-T1 cells. This strongly suggests that the defects in the 2 cell types are different. In the assay of cell extracts, the 4 BS cell lines appear to have lost thymidylate (TMP) synthetase activity (about 50% reduction from that of normal cells), whereas CCRF-SB-T1 cells show a 20% increase of TMP synthetase activity compared to normal cells.","['Shiraishi, Y', 'Taguchi, T', 'Ozawa, M', 'Bamezai, R']","['Shiraishi Y', 'Taguchi T', 'Ozawa M', 'Bamezai R']","['Department of Anatomy, Kochi Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,['EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/enzymology/*radiation effects', 'Bloom Syndrome/enzymology/*genetics', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', '*Mutation', '*Sister Chromatid Exchange/radiation effects', 'Thymidylate Synthase/blood/radiation effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*radiation effects', 'X-Rays']",,1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0027-5107(89)90010-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0027-5107(89)90010-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1989 Apr;211(2):273-8. doi: 10.1016/0027-5107(89)90010-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The B cell clone was strictly dependent on stromal cells for in vitro growth and did not generate leukemia when injected into syngenic mice. After up to a year of maintenance of the clone, the leukemic cells developed spontaneously. The leukemic cell line isolated in vivo retained the stromal cell-dependency, and further in vitro selection process was required to establish the stromal cell-independent leukemic cell line. These leukemic cell lines highly expressed c-myc and Ha-ras genes regardless of stromal cell-dependency.

Both cell lines displayed B cell characteristics by immunophenotypic and Ig gene rearrangement studies.

The transition to a productive retroviral infection results in T-cell death and clinically may lead to the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Accelerated production of infectious HIV-1 virions appears to be closely linked to a heightened state of T-cell activation. The transactivator (Tax) protein of the type I human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I) can produce such an activated T-cell phenotype and augments activity of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat. One Tax-responsive region within the HIV-1 long terminal repeat has been mapped to a locus composed of two 10-base-pair direct repeats sharing homology with the binding site for the eucaryotic transcription factor NF-kappaB (GGGACTTTCC). Tax-expressing Jurkat T cells contain one or more inducible cellular proteins that specifically associate with the HIV-1 enhancer at these binding sites. Microscale DNA affinity precipitation assays identified a Tax-inducible 86-kilodalton protein, HIVEN86A, as one of these HIV-1 enhancer-binding factors. The interaction of HIVEN86A, and presumably other cellular proteins, with the HIV-1 enhancer appears functionally important as oligonucleotides corresponding to this enhancer were sufficient to impart Tax inducibility to an unresponsive heterologous promoter. These findings suggest that the Tax-inducible cellular protein HIVEN86A plays an important role in the transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 enhancer. These specific protein-DNA interactions may also be important for the transition of HIV-1 from a latent to a productive mode of infection. Furthermore, these findings highlight an intriguing biological interplay between HTLV-1 and HIV-1 through a cellular transcriptional pathway that is normally involved in T-cell activation and growth.","['Bohnlein, E', 'Siekevitz, M', 'Ballard, D W', 'Lowenthal, J W', 'Rimsky, L', 'Bogerd, H', 'Hoffman, J', 'Wano, Y', 'Franza, B R', 'Greene, W C']","['Bohnlein E', 'Siekevitz M', 'Ballard DW', 'Lowenthal JW', 'Rimsky L', 'Bogerd H', 'Hoffman J', 'Wano Y', 'Franza BR', 'Greene WC']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HIV/*genetics', 'HTLV-I Antigens/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Weight', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology']",PMC248395,1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.63.4.1578-1586.1989 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Apr;63(4):1578-86. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.4.1578-1586.1989.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytotoxic efficacy of IT was based on the extent of protein synthesis inhibition. Cytotoxicity of IT to malignant T cells showed a dependency on antigen density comparable to the T cell lines GH1, CEM, Jurkat, HSB-2 and HPB-ALL and was enhanced considerably in the presence of 6 mM ammonium chloride. The ultimate proof of cell kill can only be obtained from clonogenic assays; however, culturing of malignant T cells was not feasible. Therefore these assays were performed with the cell line CEM that expresses comparable amounts of CD7 antigen as malignant T cells of most patients. More than 6-logs of CEM appeared to be eliminated after incubation with 10(-8) M WT1-ricin A. Immunotoxins are only effective after entering the target cell. The pattern of internalization of the IT was determined by means of 125I-WT1. After internalization the CD7 antigen was re-expressed on the cell membrane. This enables a long incubation period resulting in an increased elimination of malignant T cells. Even after 16 h the IT was still accumulated intracellularly. This pattern of continuous uptake of IT was reflected in a gradually increasing cytotoxicity with incubation time. Effective bone marrow purging can be carried out without adverse effects on progenitor cells with 10(-8) M WT1-ricin A. At that concentration the antibody binding capacity was saturated. We showed that the protein synthesis inhibition in malignant T cells by WT1-ricin A is comparable to the inhibition in T cell lines and that high amounts of CEM cells can be killed. These data suggest that cell lines can be used to test the efficacy of IT to malignant T cells. WT1-ricin A appears to be very potent for the purging of autologous bone marrow from patients with T cell malignancies.","['Preijers, F W', 'De Witte, T', 'Wessels, J M', 'Meyerink, J P', 'Haanen, C', 'Capel, P J']","['Preijers FW', 'De Witte T', 'Wessels JM', 'Meyerink JP', 'Haanen C', 'Capel PJ']","['Department of Haematology, University Hospital Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '01Q9PC255D (Ammonium Chloride)']",IM,"['Ammonium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1989.tb04254.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1989 Feb;71(2):195-201. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1989.tb04254.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the course of remission induction therapy, levels of E-alpha 1 PI complex decreased in parallel with decline of leukocyte counts in the patients with leukemia other than APL, however the E-alpha 1 PI complex was persistently elevated regardless of leukopenia in some patients with APL. In APL, concentrations of fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) markedly increased even when levels of plasmin-alpha 2-antiplasmin complex were within normal limits.

Target cells like Raji or Jok-1, which form conjugates with NK cells but are insensitive to NK lysis, did not elicit IP1 formation. Treatment of NK cells with interleukin 2 increased the basal turnover of inositol phosphates and enhanced the phosphatidyl inositol breakdown upon confrontation with sensitive targets.

For an evaluation of the ability of lymphocytes from leukemic children to produce this cytokine, the production of IL-2 by mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells was determined in children with acute leukemia at the time of diagnosis, during clinical remission, and at the time of relapse. Of 16 patients, 11 (69%) with either acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia at the time of diagnosis had IL-2 production levels above the highest level observed in control subjects, and all but one had values above the control mean. Three of five treated patients had elevated IL-2 production at the time of bone marrow relapse. In addition, of 37 patients examined during clinical remission (both during chemotherapy and after the completion of maintenance chemotherapy), five had IL-2 production values above the control range and four of these five patients subsequently had relapses, compared with only one relapse in the remaining 32 patients with normal or below-normal levels of IL-2 production. These results demonstrate an increased ability to produce IL-2 by many patients with acute leukemia, both at the time of diagnosis and at relapse.

In this study, we have investigated whether IL-1 can provide protection for human bone marrow colony-forming cells treated with high doses of 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC), a potent derivative of cyclophosphamide. We have established an in vitro model system which demonstrates that prior incubation with IL-1 protects early human hematopoietic progenitor cells from the lethal effects of high doses of 4-HC. These early progenitors give rise to blast cell colonies which appear late in the culture and are characterized by their ability to give rise to different types of secondary colonies when replated. Furthermore, prior incubation with IL-1 was shown not to protect HL-60 or K562 leukemic cells from the lethal effects of 4-HC.

We reported previously the isolation and functional expression of a mouse IL-6 (mIL-6) cDNA clone derived from bone marrow stromal cells. In this paper, we show that mIL-6 is a potent inducer of terminal macrophage differentiation for a mouse myeloid leukemic cell line, M1. Addition of mIL-6 to cultures of M1 cells rapidly inhibits their proliferation and induces phagocytic activity and morphologic changes characteristic of mature macrophages. These phenotypic changes are accompanied at the molecular level by a decrease in proto-oncogene c-myc mRNA accumulation and increases in Fc gamma R, proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-fms (CSF-1R) mRNA expression. Furthermore, IL-6 enhances the expression of Fc gamma R and c-fms in differentiation-responsive D+, but not unresponsive D- sublines of mouse myelomonocytic leukemic WEHI-3B cells.

These precursors recolonized alymphoid thymus lobes in vitro, as do T cell precursors.

This complication is a serious cause of morbidity and mortality in this disorder. There is recent evidence that natural killer (NK) cells modulate B-cell immunoglobin (Ig) synthesis/secretion. The authors therefore evaluated the circulating NK cells from B-CLL patients on their ability to regulate mitogen-induced B-cell Ig synthesis. Blood, NK cells (CD16+, CD3-) from three B-CLL patients with hypogammaglobulinemia were able to clearly down-regulate the pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-induced-B-cell Ig secretion. In contrast, CD16+, CD3- cells from age-sex-matched controls or B-CLL patients with normal Ig were either nonregulatory or enhanced mitogen-induced B-cell Ig secretion. An alternative explanation for hypogammaglobulinemia in B-CLL patients is the immunomodulation of B-cell Ig production/secretion by CD16+, CD3- blood cells.","['Kay, N E', 'Perri, R T']","['Kay NE', 'Perri RT']","['Department of Medicine, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN 55417.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Immunoglobulins)'],IM,"['Agammaglobulinemia/complications/*immunology', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*biosynthesis', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75599-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Mar;73(4):1016-9.,,,,,,,,,,,['Blood 1989 Jun;73(8):2232'],

Five ALL cases were biphenotypic since they coexpressed CD2 (Tp50) and CD19 (Bp95) antigens at the single-cell level. The composite immunophenotype of these biphenotypic ALL cases was [TdT+HLA-ABC+CD2+CD3-CD10+CD13-CD14-CD16-CD19+CD20+ ++-CD21-CD33-CD34+Bgp95-C mu- slg-]. Low-molecular-weight B-cell growth factor (LMW-BCGF), recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2), and rIL-3 stimulated the proliferative activity of biphenotypic leukemic lymphocyte precursors without inducing differentiation. In the presence of the phorbol ester TPA, leukemic blasts from two cases differentiated along the B precursor pathway to the [CD2-CD10+CD19+CD20+C mu+slg-] pre-B cell stage. Biphenotypic ALL cases did not share a common configuration and gene rearrangement pattern of the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes or T-cell receptor (TCR) genes. Three cases had rearranged C mu genes but germline TCR genes, one case showed rearrangement of both C mu and TCR genes, and the remaining case had rearranged TCR genes but germline C mu genes. All five patients attained prompt remission after standard induction chemotherapy. Three to four years after initial diagnosis, four patients are now off chemotherapy and remain alive in their first remission. One patient relapsed at 3 years, 7 months, but promptly achieved complete remission after reinduction chemotherapy and remains in second remission off chemotherapy greater than 3 years after her reinduction therapy. With two-color immunofluorescence staining techniques and multiparameter flow cytometric analyses, we identified a small population of CD2+CD19+ lymphoid cells in fetal livers (FLs) and fetal bone marrows (FBMs), which may represent the putative normal counterparts of biphenotypic ALL blasts. A CD2+CD19+ normal biphenotypic lymphoid precursor cell line, designated FL 8.2 CD2+, was established from an FL of 8-weeks of gestational age by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced blastoid transformation.

FL 8.2 CD2+ cells showed germline patterns of immunoglobulin heavy-chain joining region, heavy-chain constant region, kappa light-chain constant region genes, and TCR beta-chain genes.

Treatment of lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines with phorbol diester tumor promoters decreases proliferation and induces differentiation. Among changes induced by phorbol diesters is decreased cell surface expression of TFR. To elucidate effects of phorbols on lymphocyte growth and differentiation, we examined TFR expression by measuring 125I-transferrin binding, levels of TFR mRNA by Northern analysis and dot-blot hybridization, and rates of TFR gene transcription by nuclear run-on experiments in CCRF-CEM lymphoblastoid T cells treated with PMA or phorbol dibutyrate. Cell surface expression of TFR was decreased 60 to 85% within 2 min of exposing cells to phorbols and remained decreased for 96 h. Steady state levels of TFR mRNA decreased to less than 30% of control after 48 h. After treating cells with actinomycin D, estimated TFR mRNA t 1/2 was 2.7 h and was unaltered in phorbol-treated cells. Levels of TFR mRNA were not affected by treatment of cells with cycloheximide in either control or phorbol-treated cells. Therefore, post transcriptional mRNA processing by protein factors did not account for decreased TFR mRNA in phorbol-treated cells. Compared to baseline levels, rates of TFR gene transcription in PMA-treated cells increased up to two-fold during the initial 6 h of culture, then decreased over the ensuing 12 h to less than 10% of baseline values. This pattern was not seen in control cultures. Therefore, regulation of TFR gene transcription is a consequence of treating CEM cells with phorbol diesters. Cell surface expression of TFR in phorbol-treated lymphoblastoid T cells may be mediated in part at the level of gene transcription.","['Alcantara, O', 'Denham, C A', 'Phillips, J L', 'Boldt, D H']","['Alcantara O', 'Denham CA', 'Phillips JL', 'Boldt DH']","['Audie L.

In bone marrow-derived long term lymphoid cultures initiated in presence of IL-4, the majority of cells exhibited a more immature phenotype than is usually seen in lymphoid cells grown in Whitlock-Witte type cultures. This immature cell population, lacking the B220 Ag, was purified by cell sorting. When transferred to mixed stromal layers used in conventional lymphoid long term cultures, these cells differentiated into B lineage cells that could be identified by expression of the B220 Ag and surface IgM. Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed cell lines resulting from this immature cell population express a DJH rearrangement and contained RNA that hybridized with a VJ558 probe, suggesting transcription of germ-line V genes. A culture modification allowed selective proliferation of a non-transformed cell population with characteristics of very immature B lineage cells. The proliferation of these cells was supported by a homogeneous stromal cell line that was propagated with horse serum in presence of IL-4. The lymphoid cells proliferating under those culture conditions expressed the Ag detected by the BP-1 and 6C3 mAb and were Fc gamma RII and Ia-positive. However, more mature B cell markers were lacking. DNA analysis of these cell lines revealed JH rearrangement without evidence for deletion of any member of the DSP-2 family.

In few cases (4/15) leukemic progenitors respond to TGF-beta 1 as normal cells. TGF-beta 1 always inhibits the growth of day-14 bone marrow CFU-GM from CML patients.","['Aglietta, M', 'Stacchini, A', 'Severino, A', 'Sanavio, F', 'Ferrando, M L', 'Piacibello, W']","['Aglietta M', 'Stacchini A', 'Severino A', 'Sanavio F', 'Ferrando ML', 'Piacibello W']","[""Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche ed Oncologia Umana dell'Universita, Torino, Italy.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '76057-06-2 (Transforming Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Transforming Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1989 Mar;17(3):296-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,

As model a Rauscher-virus-induced myeloid leukemic cell line of BALB/c origin (RMB-1) was used, which forms disseminated tumors, when inoculated intravenously in BALB/c mice. As previously reported, prolonged survival was obtained when tumor-bearing mice were treated in vivo with a single high dose of a tumor-specific IgG2a monoclonal antibody. This study shows that antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity is an important mechanism involved in tumor cell destruction. Since in vitro studies showed that peritoneal macrophages were capable of killing RMB-1 cells in the presence of tumor-specific monoclonal antibody and since in the tumors of mice treated with monoclonal antibody a high influx of macrophages was observed histologically, it is likely that macrophages play an important effector role in elimination of tumor cells. Successful therapy in C5-complement-deficient tumor-bearing mice suggests that complement-dependent cytotoxicity does not play a major role. In nude (T-cell-deficient) mice the therapeutic effect of tumor-specific IgG2a antibody was significantly less than in immunocompetent mice. Although infiltration analysis of tumors of treated and untreated mice showed equally low numbers of helper-T and suppressor/cytotoxic T-cells, the mortality studies of T-cell-deficient and immunocompetent mice indicate that T-cells play a substantial, auxiliary role during antibody-mediated, tumor destruction in our model.","['Berends, D', 'van der Kwast, T H', 'de Both, N J', 'Mulder, P G']","['Berends D', 'van der Kwast TH', 'de Both NJ', 'Mulder PG']","['Department of Pathology, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Cell Movement', 'Complement System Proteins', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Rauscher Virus/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00199112 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1989;28(2):123-30. doi: 10.1007/BF00199112.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this communication, we studied the effect of IL1 on the growth of ATL cells in vitro. When ATL cells freshly obtained from patients were cultured with recombinant (r) human IL1 alpha, IL1 beta, or IL1-like factors produced by ATL cell lines, the growth of ATL cells was stimulated in a concentration-dependent manner. Maximum stimulation was observed at a concentration of 50-100 units/ml of IL1. The expression of IL2R on ATL cells was also enhanced by IL1, but the production of IL2 was not induced. These effects of rIL1 alpha or beta were specifically inhibited by anti-IL1 alpha or anti-IL1 beta antibody. Furthermore, the spontaneous growth of ATL cells was also inhibited by anti-IL1 alpha antibody, but not by anti-IL1 beta antibody. ATL cells exhibited enhanced expression of IL1 receptors on their surface as detected by the binding of 125I-labeled rIL1 alpha. These results suggest that IL1 alpha produced by ATL cells stimulates the growth of ATL cells by an autocrine mechanism.","['Shirakawa, F', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Oda, S', 'Eto, S', 'Yamashita, U']","['Shirakawa F', 'Tanaka Y', 'Oda S', 'Eto S', 'Yamashita U']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Medicine, Kitakyushu, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Immune Sera/immunology', 'Interleukin-1/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",,1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Mar 1;49(5):1143-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a lineage-specific hematopoietic growth factor that stimulates the production of eosinophils and eosinophil colonies from normal human bone marrow cells. By using somatic cell hybrids and in situ chromosomal hybridization, we localized the IL-4 and IL-5 genes to human chromosome 5 at bands q23-31, a chromosomal region that is frequently deleted [del(5q)] in patients with myeloid disorders. By in situ hybridization, the IL-4 and IL-5 genes were found to be deleted in the 5q- chromosome of four patients with refractory anemia (RA) or therapy-related acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (t-ANLL), who had a del(5q). Thus a small segment of chromosome 5 contains IL-4, IL-5, IL-3, and GM-CSF as well as other genes such as CD14 and EGR1.

The cytologic features of the neoplastic monocytoid B lymphocytes are virtually identical to those of hairy cell leukemia (HCL). As with HCL, progression of MBCL to a higher histologic grade is very unusual. However, whereas circulating leukemic cells are a characteristic feature of HCL, peripheral blood involvement has not been reported in MBCL. We recently studied a patient with MBCL of the spleen and axillary lymph nodes who developed peripheral blood involvement by MBCL cells. Unlike the cells of HCL, the circulating MBCL cells exhibited strong acid phosphatase activity that was tartrate sensitive. The leukemic cells had the antigenic phenotype IgM lambda, CD20+, CD11c+, CD5-, CD25(TAC)-, and PCA-1-. Immunogenetic studies of both lymph node and peripheral blood cells revealed identical immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangements. When compared with a series of HCL, the immunophenotype was similar except for the absence of PCA-1 and TAC. Progression of the MBCL to a large cell lymphoma, also expressing IgM lambda, was documented in an abdominal lymph node of this patient. Therefore, although rare, peripheral blood involvement by lymphoma cells may occur during the course of MBCL and should be distinguished from HCL with cytochemical and immunophenotypic studies. In addition, comparison of the clinical, pathologic, and immunologic features of MBCL with those of other low-grade B-cell neoplasms suggests that a close lineage relationship exists between MBCL and HCL.","['Traweek, S T', 'Sheibani, K', 'Winberg, C D', 'Mena, R R', 'Wu, A M', 'Rappaport, H']","['Traweek ST', 'Sheibani K', 'Winberg CD', 'Mena RR', 'Wu AM', 'Rappaport H']","['James Irvine Center, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010.']",['eng'],"['CA-26422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma/blood/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Phenotype']",,1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76309-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Feb;73(2):573-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, malignancies corresponding to terminal stages of B-cell differentiation (immunocytoma and myeloma) generally showed low CD1c expression as did lymphoid cells from 10 cases of post-thymic malignancy. Although there was some correlation between the expression of membrane CD1c and immunoglobulin (SIg) light chain densities (P less than 0.001), it is relevant in diagnostic terms that seven cases of B-NHL with low SIg staining intensities more typically associated with CLL were CD1c+. CD1c expression was not, however, correlated with the presence of CD23 or FMC7 determinants but did show a similar pattern of expression to that previously reported for beta-2 microglobulin. Determination of cellular CD1c by APAAP immunocytochemistry confirmed the presence of higher antigen densities in malignant B-cells at intermediate/late stages of differentiation and this interpretation was further supported by the finding that the majority of phenotypically mature tonsil B-cells were also CD1c+.

Monoclonal antibody B2D may be useful for the subclassification of T-ALL cells and has therapeutic potential for a certain type of T-ALL.","['Minegishi, M', 'Tsuchiya, S', 'Minegishi, N', 'Yoshie, O', 'Konno, T']","['Minegishi M', 'Tsuchiya S', 'Minegishi N', 'Yoshie O', 'Konno T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology', 'Molecular Weight', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(89)90030-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(1):43-51. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90030-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now extend these findings to another human T acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, SUP-T13, and to two fresh human chronic lymphocytic leukemias, JE and EF. In the two cell lines, two types of Ag receptor variants could be found: those that retained a receptor molecule but lost reactivity with an anti-idiotype mAb (idiotype variants), and those which had lost surface receptor expression completely (receptor-negative variants). The idiotype variants, at least in HPB-ALL, have differentially glycosylated receptor alpha-chains from the parent. The receptor-negative cells, in HPB-ALL as well as in SUP-T13, produce cytoplasmic receptor and CD3 proteins but do not transport them to the surface. Neither idiotype nor receptor-negative variants could be detected in either of the fresh tumors of chronic lymphocytic leukemias. The limit of sensitivity in these analyses was about 0.05%. We conclude that antigen receptor variants can spontaneously occur in cell lines derived from acute lymphoblastic leukemias, but are infrequent in chronic lymphocytic leukemias in vivo, and that therapy with anti-idiotype mAb may be a viable strategy for these malignancies.","['Maecker, H T', 'Levy, R']","['Maecker HT', 'Levy R']","['Stanford University Medical School, CA 94305.']",['eng'],['CA 34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Antigen/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism']",,1989/02/15 00:00,1989/02/15 00:01,['1989/02/15 00:00'],"['1989/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Feb 15;142(4):1395-404.,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-1 and TNF were identified by appropriate bioassays inhibitable by specific antibodies. The capacity to produce IL-1 was expressed by most ANLL cases investigated irrespective of the FAB (French, American, British) subtype. However, the M4 and M5 cases tended to be better producers of IL-1 than M1-M3 cases. In contrast, TNF release was only restricted to M5 leukemias (3 out of 4 cases examined). Cytokine production may therefore provide additional criteria for a functional classification of ANLL. A considerable proportion of ANLL cases (7/18 bone marrow samples and 12/20 blood samples) released appreciable quantities of IL-1 in culture in the absence of deliberate stimulation. ""Spontaneous"" TNF production was also detected in 1 out of 3 M5 cases. Cells were cultured under LPS-negative conditions and polymixin B did not affect spontaneous cytokine release. Moreover, Northern blot analysis showed that freshly isolated, non-cultured ANLL cells expressed IL-1 beta transcripts. Inasmuch as IL-1 is responsible for hemopoietin-1 activity and IL-1 induces colony stimulating factor production in various cell types, the observation of IL-1 production in ANLL suggests that this mediator may be involved in regulatory amplifying circuits of leukemic cell proliferation.","['Erroi, A', 'Specchia, G', 'Liso, V', 'Colotta, F', 'Bersani, L', 'Polentarutti, N', 'Chen, Z G', 'Allavena, P', 'Mantovani, A']","['Erroi A', 'Specchia G', 'Liso V', 'Colotta F', 'Bersani L', 'Polentarutti N', 'Chen ZG', 'Allavena P', 'Mantovani A']","['Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis/genetics']",,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1989.tb00241.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1989 Jan;42(1):16-23. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1989.tb00241.x.,,,,,,,,,,['Eur J Haematol. 1989 Oct;43(4):359-60.

In addition, B-CLL supernatants diminished control NK activity. Purified control B cells and other malignant cell lines produced little or no inhibitory activity toward these T cell or NK functions. The sera from these same B-CLL patients diminished PHA-induced interleukin-2 production by control T cells. Initial molecular characterization of the inhibitory factor(s) revealed it to be of low molecular weight (less than 5000 daltons) with loss of functional activity after treatment with neuraminidase. This suggested that this substance might be either a ganglioside or glycoprotein whose inhibitory activity depends on the presence of a sialic acid moiety.

One molecular rearrangement of the T-cell receptor alpha locus corresponded to a functional variable-joining region (V-J) joining, whereas the other derived from the breakpoint of the t(14;14)(q11;q32) translocation. Chromosomal in situ hybridization of the probe derived from the t(14;14) breakpoint localized the breakpoint region to 14q32.1, apparently the same region that is involved in another ataxia telangiectasia characteristic chromosome translocation, t(7;14)(q35;q32). The 14q32.1 breakpoint is at least 10,000 kilobase pairs (kbp) centromeric to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus. Sequence analysis of the breakpoint indicates the involvement of a J alpha sequence during the translocation.

Since this compound can block DNA replication and since this effect is mediated by the intracellular ATP/dATP balance, its possible effect on DNA ligase was investigated. dCF at relatively low concentrations (1 microM), in association with dATP (100 microM), is a strong inhibitor of DNA ligase in T blasts, whereas it has no significant effect in B blasts at this concentration. The AMP-ligase complex is the target of the observed inhibition because the combined presence of the inhibitor and dATP results in a more stable dAMP-ligase complex. Because of this observation and of the greater adenosine deaminase activity observed in T cells, the dATP mediated dCF inhibition of ligase might be the crucial replication target of T cell toxicity. These observations are discussed in terms of T immunodeficiencies including Graft Versus Host Disease and related syndromes.","['Lamballe, F', 'Le Prise, P Y', 'Le Gall, E', 'David, J C']","['Lamballe F', 'Le Prise PY', 'Le Gall E', 'David JC']","['Laboratoire de Biochimie du Developpement, UA CNRS No. 256, Universite de Rennes, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Deoxyadenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '11033-22-0 (Coformycin)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Ligases)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (Polynucleotide Ligases)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Coformycin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'DNA Ligases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Deoxyadenine Nucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*enzymology', 'Pentostatin', 'Polynucleotide Ligases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Feb;3(2):97-103.,,,,,,,,,,,,

More than 70% of the progressively leukemic mice experienced permanent leukemia regressions (disease-free for greater than 100 days) following LAK cell plus rIL-2 therapy. Regressions were characterized by return of spleen and liver weights to normal and elimination of virus-infected erythroid (CFU-E) and macrophage (CFU-C) progenitor cells from spleen and marrow. Leukemic animals treated with either LAK cells alone or IL-2 alone experienced only transient leukemia regressions.

Analysis of the T-cell lymphoma-inducing potential of the hybrid viruses that were obtained localized the primary determinant critical to efficient T-cell lymphoma induction to the MoMuLV ClaI-XbaI fragment which comprises 48 nucleotides (nt) of p15E, p2E, the 3'-noncoding sequence, and 298 nt of U3. The 438-base-pair ClaI-XbaI fragments of MoMuLV and MoMuLV-TB differed in only 11 nt. Nine mutations were found within the enhancer. These mutations occurred within the two CORE, the two GRE-LVa, and two of the four NF1 nuclear factor-binding motifs. MoMuLV-TB replicated better than MoMuLV in thymus-bone marrow (TB) cells, a cultured cell line of lymphoid origin. In addition, MoMuLV-TB and NwtTB-2, a recombinant virus with the ClaI-SmaI fragment of MoMuLV-TB in a MoMuLV background, replicated in thymocytes as efficiently as did MoMuLV or TBNwt-2, the reciprocal recombinant virus, with the ClaI-SmaI fragment of MoMuLV in a MoMuLV-TB background. Like NwtTB-4, a recombinant virus with the ClaI-XbaI fragment of MoMuLV-TB in a MoMuLV background, NwtTB-2 induced lymphoma after a long latent period. The finding given above suggests that thymotropism is not the only factor that determines the T-cell lymphoma-inducing potential of MoMuLV. It appears likely that mutations in one or more of the MoMuLV-TB nuclear factor-binding motifs may have altered the interaction of the enhancer with specific nuclear factors; this, in turn, may affect the T-cell lymphoma-inducing potential of MoMuLV-TB.","['Yuen, P H', 'Szurek, P F']","['Yuen PH', 'Szurek PF']","['Science Park-Research Division, M.

However, no definitive biochemical data in support of the membrane IL-1 alpha concept has been reported. The purpose of the present study was to determine if the biologic activity associated with treated cells is due to a membrane form of IL-1 alpha or alternatively, to the leakage of IL-1 alpha. If the former case was true, then the exposed membrane IL-1 alpha should bind anti-IL-1 alpha antibodies or be cleaved by mild trypsin treatment. In both instances, IL-1 alpha activity should be lost when measured in a subsequent IL-1 bioassay. Our results indicate that pulsing paraformaldehyde-treated normal or cell line macrophages with anti-IL-1 alpha antibodies or treating the cells with trypsin did not affect the ability of the treated cells to function in a murine thymocyte proliferation assay. Furthermore, the standard short term treatment of cells with paraformaldehyde (15 min) did not prevent the leakage of IL-1 alpha from the cells or the processing of the precursor forms of the protein. When cells were treated with paraformaldehyde for 2 h, they no longer released IL-1 alpha or possessed thymocyte stimulatory activity. We also found that short term glutaraldehyde treatment of macrophages completely blocked the release of IL-1 alpha from cells as well as the appearance of cell-associated IL-1 alpha activity. Our results support the conclusion that the stimulatory activity of paraformaldehyde-treated macrophages is not due to a membrane form of IL-1 alpha but is, in fact, due to the continuous release of IL-1 alpha from the cells.","['Minnich-Carruth, L L', 'Suttles, J', 'Mizel, S B']","['Minnich-Carruth LL', 'Suttles J', 'Mizel SB']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Wake Forest University Medical Center, Winston-Salem, NC 27103.']",['eng'],"['CA 12197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI-25836-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Fixatives)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Polymers)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'Y19UC83H8E (paraform)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/physiology', 'Fixatives', 'Formaldehyde', 'Interleukin-1/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Macrophages/*analysis/drug effects', 'Membrane Proteins/*isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Polymers', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Time Factors', 'Trypsin']",,1989/01/15 00:00,1989/01/15 00:01,['1989/01/15 00:00'],"['1989/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Jan 15;142(2):526-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hierarchy of inhibition of lysis shown by these compounds resembled that of their inhibition of Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme (protein kinase C). H7 has the highest affinity for protein kinase C (Hidaka, H., Inagaki, M., Kawamoto, S., and Sasaki, Y. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 5036-5041) and gave the greatest inhibition of lysis by CTL. HA1004 has the weakest affinity for protein kinase C and gave very little inhibition of lysis, whereas H8 and H9 showed intermediate inhibition of lysis. In addition, the effect of the isoquinoline sulfonamides on cellular proliferation was examined. Interestingly, the pattern of inhibition observed for both lymphocytes and tumor cells closely mimicked the effects of these compounds on protein kinase C activity. These results demonstrate that modulation of an early biochemical signal affects both short-term (e.g. CTL-mediated lysis) and long-term (e.g. cellular proliferation) events. These data provide further evidence for the integral role of protein kinase C in the activation of the lytic signal in CTL. In addition, suggestive evidence is provided that protein kinase C, or some other enzyme with similar sensitivity to the isoquinoline sulfonamides, plays an important role in cellular proliferation.","['Juszczak, R J', 'Russell, J H']","['Juszczak RJ', 'Russell JH']","['Department of Pharmacology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110.']",['eng'],"['CA 000926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 34817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Animals', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/enzymology/*immunology']",,1989/01/15 00:00,1989/01/15 00:01,['1989/01/15 00:00'],"['1989/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)85014-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Jan 15;264(2):810-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,

We find that the other product of phosphoinositide turnover, 1,2-diacylglycerol, elicits an increase in intracellular free calcium in HL60 cells which is due, at least in part, to release of calcium from intracellular stores. This effect is specific for calcium, since intracellular sodium and potassium levels and cellular volume were unaffected. Concomitant with the intracellular calcium increase, we find an increase in cellular inositol trisphosphate levels, suggesting that the effect of diacylglycerol on calcium may be mediated by inositol trisphosphate. Diacylglycerols also stimulate calcium efflux. This stimulation is not simply due to the increase in intracellular calcium. These effects appear not to be mediated through stimulation of a phorbol ester-activatable protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) since phorbol esters do not elicit an increase in cytoplasmic free calcium or an increase in calcium efflux.","['Restrepo, D', 'Kozody, D J', 'Knauf, P A']","['Restrepo D', 'Kozody DJ', 'Knauf PA']","['Department of Biophysics, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, New York 14642.']",['eng'],"['CA07924/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 27495/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 18208/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Glycerides)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '1069-87-0 (1,2-dioctanoylglycerol)', '4L6452S749 (Inositol)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)']",IM,"['Benzofurans', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Diglycerides/*pharmacology', 'Fura-2', 'Glycerides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inositol/metabolism', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Potassium/metabolism', 'Sodium/metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",,1989/01/15 00:00,1989/01/15 00:01,['1989/01/15 00:00'],"['1989/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)85009-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Jan 15;264(2):776-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ascitic tumor was also established in X-irradiated mice. Under various conditions, the tumor transplantability was 100%. NALM-6 cells were initially inoculated i.p. into 8-day-old nude mice after being admixed with X-irradiated HT-1080, a human fibrosarcoma cell line. Then, the in vivo grown (for 10 wk) tumor cells were serially transplanted i.p. into X-irradiated adult (10 to 12 wk old) nude mice. After the serial passages, we succeeded in establishing a highly transplantable NALM-6 ascitic tumor in nonpreconditioned as well as X-irradiated nude mice without the addition of HT-1080 cells. The ascitic tumor cells do not lose transplantability after in vitro culture for 20 days. Cellular radioimmunoassay and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis indicated that the in vivo established NALM-6 tumor cells retained the antigenic phenotype of the parental NALM-6 cells. Titration experiments revealed a reciprocal relationship between survival time of the mice and the number of tumor cells inoculated. When appropriate numbers of tumor cells (e.g., 4 x 10(6) cells) were used for the inoculation, survival times of individual mice fell within a relatively narrow range; this narrow range will facilitate the experiments where the present tumor model is used for evaluating the in vivo efficacy of antitumor agents. The present ascitic tumor models, particularly the one established in nonpreconditioned nude mice, will be useful for evaluating the in vivo efficacy of anti-human leukemia agents as well as for studying the in vivo biological behavior of the transplanted leukemia cells.","['Luo, Y', 'Hara, H', 'Haruta, Y', 'Seon, B K']","['Luo Y', 'Hara H', 'Haruta Y', 'Seon BK']","['Department of Molecular Immunology, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],"['CA19304/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Ascites/pathology', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology']",,1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Feb 1;49(3):706-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three types of immunotoxins were prepared; in two of them the antibody was linked to recombinant ricin A chain by a disulfide bond and in the third, a nonreducible thioether bond was used. Immunotoxins containing a nonreducible linkage may have some advantage over conjugates containing a reducible linkage because of improved stability in vivo. Conjugation of recombinant ricin A chain through either the endogenous thiol group or through a derivatized amino group produced immunotoxins with comparable cytotoxicity. The thioether conjugate was 1000-fold less cytotoxic to target tumor cells than the respective disulfide-linked immunotoxin. However, addition of monensin, a monocarboxylic ionophore, greatly enhanced the cytotoxicity of the thioether-linked immunotoxin. Monensin increased the immunotoxin activity better than other lysosomotropic reagents that were tested. The increase in activity of recombinant ricin A chain-containing immunotoxins mediated by monensin argues against a role for contaminating ricin B chain in potentiation.","['Ramakrishnan, S', 'Bjorn, M J', 'Houston, L L']","['Ramakrishnan S', 'Bjorn MJ', 'Houston LL']","['Cetus Corporation, Emeryville, California 94608.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Breast Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Immunotoxins/*therapeutic use', 'Lysosomes/*drug effects', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Ricin/*administration & dosage/pharmacology']",,1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Feb 1;49(3):613-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased immunoglobulin synthesis with autoantibody formation was documented: polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia (six patients), neutrophil autoantibody (one patient), antinuclear antibody (one patient), and rheumatoid factor (five patients). In addition, serum beta 2-microglobulin level was raised in seven patients, a benign monoclonal gammopathy was detected in one, and concurrent B-type hairy cell leukemia in another. Most patients experienced the complications of hemocytopenia, polyarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, and immediate allergic reactions to drugs or environmental substances, rather than from symptoms of progressive LGL/NK-PD. A review of the literature confirms that an increased immunoglobulin production is common in LGL/NK-PD, and that patients are likely to develop multiple autoantibodies. The incapacity of proliferating, abnormal LGL/NK cells to suppress B-cell activation and immunoglobulin synthesis, documented by several in vitro studies, offers a pathogenetic explanation for these phenomena. This study shows that an anomalous B-cell function contributes greatly to the morbidity of disease in LGL/NK-PD, and points out the utility of investigating the LGL/NK cell system in patients with autoimmune pathologic characteristics of unclear origin.","['Bassan, R', 'Pronesti, M', 'Buzzetti, M', 'Allavena, P', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Mantovani, A', 'Barbui, T']","['Bassan R', 'Pronesti M', 'Buzzetti M', 'Allavena P', 'Rambaldi A', 'Mantovani A', 'Barbui T']","['Division of Haematology, Ospedali Riuniti, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '9009-79-4 (Rheumatoid Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Autoantibodies/analysis', 'Autoimmune Diseases/epidemiology/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Lymphocytosis/epidemiology/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Rheumatoid Factor/analysis']",,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19890101)63:1<90::aid-cncr2820630115>3.0.co;2-f [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1989 Jan 1;63(1):90-5. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19890101)63:1<90::aid-cncr2820630115>3.0.co;2-f.,,,,,,,,,,,,

At presentation, most patients had normal numbers of T lymphocytes and their cells had normal proliferative responses to mitogens [phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin A (Con A)] and alloantigens. Patients had severe monocytopenia, decreased delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions, and decreased peripheral blood natural killer (NK) activity. Treatment caused a profound decrease in all lymphocyte subpopulations. T cells were more affected than B cells or NK cells. Numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes decreased to levels less than 200 cells/microliters in all patients during treatment. This decrease in T cell number was associated with a marked decrease in proliferative responsiveness to PHA, Con A, and alloantigens. These abnormalities persisted throughout the 14 months of treatment and have continued for up to 6 months beyond discontinuation of treatment. NK cell activity increased during treatment, but cycled depending on the phase of treatment; highest activities were observed after interferon (IFN)-alpha and lower levels of activity were observed after dCF. DTH responses generally did not improve during therapy. Levels of IgM, IgG, IgA, and IgD did not change during treatment, but IgE levels rose in most patients. All immunosuppressive effects were attributable to dCF since patients receiving IFN-alpha 2a alone did not exhibit these same immunosuppressive effects, and patients receiving dCF alone after IFN failure exhibited similar abnormalities. Despite this severe immunosuppression from dCF, life-threatening opportunistic infections have not been observed in our patient population. Six patients developed localized Herpes zoster infection among 21 patients who had received dCF. Pending the results of long-term follow-up, we recommend that dCF be reserved for patients who have failed splenectomy and IFN therapy.","['Urba, W J', 'Baseler, M W', 'Kopp, W C', 'Steis, R G', 'Clark, J W', 'Smith, J W 2nd', 'Coggin, D L', 'Longo, D L']","['Urba WJ', 'Baseler MW', 'Kopp WC', 'Steis RG', 'Clark JW', 'Smith JW 2nd', 'Coggin DL', 'Longo DL']","['Program Resources, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Researh Facility, MD 21701.']",['eng'],['N01-CO-74102/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '11033-22-0 (Coformycin)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)']",IM,"['Coformycin/analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Herpes Zoster/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon Type I/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/complications/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Count/drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Pentostatin', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Ribonucleosides/*therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects']",,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)80421-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Jan;73(1):38-46.,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that nine of nine HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines, established by in vitro infection with HTLV-I, including those with CD4+ or CD8+ as well as CD4-/CD8- phenotypes, constitutively produce high levels of TNF alpha and -beta mRNA and secrete biologically active TNF beta into the culture medium. Similar patterns of expression are seen in six of six HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines directly established from ATL patients. In contrast, several T-cell lines, either uninfected or infected with human immunodeficiency virus I, did not produce comparable levels of the TNF beta. Comparisons of a normal functional T-cell clone before and after infection with HTLV-I show that expression of TNF beta mRNA is induced in the infected cells. The high level expression in HTLV-I-infected cell lines dose not seem to involve perturbation of the TNF alpha/beta genetic loci by proviral integration. A cell line (81-66/45) nonproductively transformed with HTLV-I that produces tat-1 in the absence of viral structural proteins, produces both TNF alpha and -beta mRNA.

Our objective was to determine whether protein kinase C has a role in signal transduction related to proliferation of these committed progenitor cells. The presence of H-7 or staurosporine led to an inhibition of colony formation stimulated by crude colony-stimulating factor (CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), granulocyte CSF (G-CSF), or macrophage CSF (M-CSF) in a dose-dependent manner. N-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (HA-1004), a weaker analog of H-7, did not inhibit proliferation of CFU-C. Neither H-7 nor staurosporine had any effect on CFU-E formation. H-7 and staurosporine dose-dependently inhibited the protein kinase C from K562 cells. The potential of these compounds to inhibit proliferation of CFU-C correlated well with the magnitude of their inhibition of protein kinase C from K562 cells. The inhibition of proliferation of CFU-C appears to relate to the potential of these compounds to inhibit protein kinase C. Thus, activation of protein kinase C is presumably involved in the proliferation of CFU-C, and the regulatory system of CFU-E appears to differ from that of CFU-C.","['Katayama, N', 'Nishikawa, M', 'Minami, N', 'Shirakawa, S']","['Katayama N', 'Nishikawa M', 'Minami N', 'Shirakawa S']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', '91742-10-8 (N-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Adult', 'Alkaloids', 'Bone Marrow/*physiology', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology', 'Piperazines', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Staurosporine', '*Sulfonamides']",,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)80435-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Jan;73(1):123-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The difference between the efficiencies of transmission of HBeAg and HBc/eAg expression by recombinant retroviral-mediated infection was not predicted as the expression vector coding for HBc/eAg synthesis differs only by the deletion of approximately 90 nucleotides of HBV DNA sequence from the vector coding for HBeAg synthesis.","['Raney, A K', 'Milich, D R', 'Hughes, J L', 'Sorge, J', 'Chisari, F V', 'Mondelli, M U', 'McLachlan, A']","['Raney AK', 'Milich DR', 'Hughes JL', 'Sorge J', 'Chisari FV', 'Mondelli MU', 'McLachlan A']","['Department of Basic and Clinical Research, Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, La Jolla, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['AI00585/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI20001/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'FO TWO3662-01/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Hepatitis B Core Antigens)', '0 (Hepatitis B e Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/*immunology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hepatitis B Core Antigens/genetics', 'Hepatitis B e Antigens/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Skin/cytology', 'Transfection']",,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(89)90400-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1989 Jan;168(1):31-9. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(89)90400-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this trial was to determine the antineoplastic effect and toxicity of IL-2 administered at a lower dose in an outpatient setting. Eligibility criteria included measurable disease, Karnofsky performance greater than or equal to 70%, age greater than 18 years, and adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function. The median age of 35 patients was 56 years (range, 20 to 75). Diagnoses included malignant lymphoma (ML), (nine patients), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (eight), melanoma (eight), colorectal cancer (six), renal cancer (two), and breast cancer (two). The initial 18 patients were treated with 1 mg/m2 (3 x 10(6) U/m2 intravenous [IV] bolus) for five days every other week for a total of 4 treatment weeks (8 weeks total). The subsequent 17 patients were treated with 0.5 mg/m2 (1.5 x 10(6) U/m2). All patients were evaluable for toxicity, and 26 for tumor response. Toxicities included fatigue (71%), nausea (69%), hypotension (54%), fever (51%), chills (40%), weight gain (37%), pruritus or rash (31%), dyspnea (14%), azotemia (6%), confusion (6%), thrombocytopenia (6%), and myocardial infarction (3%). Four patients died from apparently unrelated causes within the first 2 weeks of treatment. Treatment was discontinued before the completion of 8 weeks of treatment because of progressive disease (12 patients), severe hypotension (three), azotemia (one), myocardial infarction (one), early death (four), and miscellaneous causes (two). IL-2 at 1 mg/m2 IV for five days is associated with moderate toxicity, but a dose of 0.5 mg/m2 is tolerable for outpatient administration. Three partial responses (PR) and one minor response (MR) lasting 1 to 17+ months have been observed in 12 patients with ML and CLL evaluable for response.

In vivo infusion of antibody to NK-1.1 attenuates toxicity without compromising efficacy against murine leukemia.,161-73,"In the current study we used the therapy of established murine leukemia to identify the lymphocyte subsets responsible for toxicity and for therapeutic efficacy of high-dose IL-2. Initial results confirmed that high-dose IL-2 induces marked proliferation of a variety of host cells, including NK cells, Lyt-2+ T cells, L3T4+ T cells, and B cells. Infusion of antibody to NK-1.1 depleted NK-1.1+ cells in vivo and greatly reduced the toxicity of IL-2, but did not decrease therapeutic efficacy. By marked contrast, depletion of host T cells, either Lyt-2+ or L3T4+, had no effect on toxicity but greatly reduced therapeutic efficacy. The requirement for host T cells for the curative effect of IL-2 gives credence to the possibility that substantial efficacy of high-dose IL-2 against established malignancy may require existent host antitumor immunity. Since the human tumors that have been shown to have the most substantial responses to IL-2 (i.e., malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma) are those long considered to be immunogenic in the autochthonous host, the current study predicts that for these, as well as other immunogenic human tumors, it should be possible to decrease the toxicity and thus increase the therapeutic index of IL-2 by selectively depleting NK cells in vivo.","['Peace, D J', 'Cheever, M A']","['Peace DJ', 'Cheever MA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['CA-30558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-43081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Antigens, Ly/analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-2/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology']",PMC2189181,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.169.1.161 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1989 Jan 1;169(1):161-73. doi: 10.1084/jem.169.1.161.,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the immunomodulating effects of CT at the cellular level we have examined interactions of CT with APC and with B and T lymphocytes in vitro. CT markedly stimulated the production of IL-1 from APC (mouse peritoneal macrophages or macrophage cell line P388D1) but did not induce Ia-Ag and had marginal, if any, effect in potentiating Ia Ag expression stimulated by rIFN-gamma on these cells. CT had differential effect on T cell proliferation in vitro, usually strongly inhibitory but on Con A-stimulated spleen cells during prolonged (greater than or equal to 5 days) culture or when added on day 4 or later to these cultures up to a two- to three-fold enhancement of proliferation was seen. CT-induced inhibition of T cell proliferation was associated with decreased production of IL-2 and anergy to exogenously added IL-2 despite apparently normal expression of IL-2R. Similar to what was found with T cells LPS-stimulated spleen B cells demonstrated both inhibition and enhancement of proliferation in the presence of CT: in high concentrations (greater than or equal to 10(-8) M) and early in culture (day 3) CT had a strong inhibitory effect on the proliferation of B cells, whereas later (day 6) and/or at lower CT concentrations (10(-9) to 10(-11) M) the proliferation was increased up to 10-fold. The net effect of CT treatment on Ig-production by LPS-stimulated spleen B cells was seen as an enhanced level of IgA and IgG but not IgM in culture supernatants.

Peak CSF immunotoxin concentrations exceeded the ID50 for CEM cells by more than 2 log units and a concentration exceeding the ID50 was maintained for as long as 24 h. All eight monkeys receiving repeated doses of immunotoxin developed serum antibodies against both WT1 and ricin A chain. In six of these monkeys antibodies were also present in the CSF.

In previous studies, we showed that the distinct disease specificities of the two viruses could be switched by exchanging a small segment, about 200 nucleotides in length, encompassing their enhancer regions. This segment included the direct repeat sequence and an adjacent GC-rich region of about 20 nucleotides defined in studies of Moloney murine sarcoma virus enhancer-promoter function (L. A. Laimins, P. Gruss, R. Pozzatti, and G. Khoury, J. Virol. 49:183-189, 1984). The direct repeats of Friend and Moloney viruses are identical in a central core sequence of 32 nucleotides but have sequence differences on either side of this core as well as in their GC-rich segments. To determine whether disease specificity resides in part or in all of the direct repeat and GC-rich region, we constructed recombinants between Friend and Moloney viruses within this segment and tested them for their disease-inducing phenotypes. We found that disease specificity, in particular the ability of Friend virus sequence to confer erythroleukemogenicity on Moloney virus, is encoded throughout the region in at least three separable segments: the 5' and 3' halves of the direct repeat and the GC-rich segment. When just one of these segments (either both 5' halves of the direct repeat, both 3' halves, or just the GC-rich segment) from Friend virus was substituted into a Moloney virus genome, it conferred only a negligible or low incidence of erythroleukemia (less than or equal to 5% to between 10 and 15%). Any two segments together were considerably more potent (35 to 95% erythroleukemia), with the most effective pair being the two halves of the direct repeat. Individual segments and pairs of segments were considerably more potent determinants when they were matched with a genome of the same origin. Thus, although sequences outside the enhancer region are minor determinants of disease specificity when the enhancer is derived entirely from either Friend or Moloney virus, they can play a significant role when the enhancer is of mixed origin. Some recombinant enhancers conferred a long latent period of disease induction. This was particularly striking when the 5' halves of each copy of the direct repeat sequence were derived from Moloney virus and the 3' halves were derived from Friend virus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Golemis, E', 'Li, Y', 'Fredrickson, T N', 'Hartley, J W', 'Hopkins, N']","['Golemis E', 'Li Y', 'Fredrickson TN', 'Hartley JW', 'Hopkins N']","['Biology Department, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge 02139.']",['eng'],"['N01-AI-22673/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA42063/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA19308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*microbiology', 'Lymphoma/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/physiology', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes']",PMC247688,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.63.1.328-337.1989 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Jan;63(1):328-37. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.1.328-337.1989.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten-liter pools of human urine were concentrated by ultrafiltration and applied sequentially to the normal IgG and antiserum columns. Cross-reactive proteins were removed by the IgG column, whereas CSF was bound by the anti-CSF column. After extensive rinsing of the antibody column, the CSF was eluted with 4 M sodium thiocyanate.

Recombinant GM-CSF stimulated blast colonies in 13 out of 20 cases examined (1 case not done). The magnitude of stimulation by rGM-CSF varied significantly according to the type of AML, but in general was lower than that of PHA-LCM. Blast cells of type M1 did not form any colonies with rGM-CSF, although numerous colonies were produced with PHA-LCM. Type M4 blasts formed fairly large numbers of colonies, though slightly less than those stimulated by PHA-LCM. Blasts of type M2 and M5 formed colonies with the stimulation of rGM-CSF, but the numbers were considerably smaller than type M4 and those stimulated with PHA-LCM. Recombinant G-CSF stimulated blast colonies in only 5 out of 21 cases, 3 of them being type M2. The number of cases responding to rG-CSF was significantly smaller than that responding to rGM-CSF, and even in cases in which colonies were formed, the magnitude of stimulation was minimal. From these results it seems likely that blast cells of different types of AML require a different kind of CSF for their optimal growth; type M4 blasts responded to the stimulation of rGM-CSF well, but blasts of other types of AML responded poorly. Thus, except for type M4, CSF(s) other than rGM-CSF seems to be required for the sufficient growth of L-CFU. Recombinant G-CSF is not likely to play an essential role in the proliferation of leukemic blasts of most types. Previous exposure to rGM-CSF and rG-CSF did not alter the self-renewal capacity, cellular phenotype, and morphology of colony cells, indicating that the direction and degree of differentiation of L-CFU stimulated by rGM-CSF or rG-CSF were not different from those stimulated with PHA-LCM.","['Motoji, T', 'Takanashi, M', 'Fuchinoue, M', 'Masuda, M', 'Oshimi, K', 'Mizoguchi, H']","['Motoji T', 'Takanashi M', 'Fuchinoue M', 'Masuda M', 'Oshimi K', 'Mizoguchi H']","[""Department of Medicine, Tokyo Women's Medical College, Japan.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Granulocytes', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Macrophages', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1989 Jan;17(1):56-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MTT test represents a simple colorimetric method to determine cytotoxicity. The present paper describes a new method for solubilisation of the formazan crystals, which makes the assay simpler, more rapid and more reproducible. Different cell lines show different kinetics of formazan formation stressing the need for individual calibration curves. The clear-cut discrimination between cells resistant and non-resistant against oxazaphosphorines indicates that the assay has predictive value for in vivo drug sensitivities.

At the time of this follow-up study they had been off therapy for 1-9 years and they were all in complete remission. Relative renal length was measured from X-ray films of intravenous pyelograms. Median relative renal length prior to the start of chemotherapy was +1.0 SD (range -1.5 to +4.0, n = 35), at discontinuation of therapy +0.5 SD (range -1.5 to +2.2, n = 22), and at follow-up -0.3 SD (range -3.9 to +2.6, n = 61). The mean calculated decrease in relative kidney size was 0.1 SD unit per year during the follow-up time. The median glomerular filtration rate was 110 ml/min/1.73 m2 (range 70 to 164). Six of 60 patients had glomerular filtration rates below 85 ml/min/1.73 m2. Three patients had some evidence of tubular dysfunction documented by increased excretion of urinary amino acids and/or beta-2-microglobulin or by reduced concentrating capacity. In spite of these abnormalities, we conclude that in most long-term survivors of childhood leukemia renal size and function are relatively well preserved. However, slightly reduced glomerular filtration rates in some patients indicated renal damage. A longer follow-up time is needed to find out whether the decrease in relative renal length is still continuing.","['Hovi, L', 'Koskimies, O', 'Holmberg, C', 'Rajantie, J', 'Rautonen, J', 'Siimes, M A']","['Hovi L', 'Koskimies O', 'Holmberg C', 'Rajantie J', 'Rautonen J', 'Siimes MA']","[""Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki, Finland.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Sweden,Acta Paediatr Scand,Acta paediatrica Scandinavica,0000211,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Blood Pressure', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Humans', 'Kidney/growth & development/radiation effects', 'Kidney Diseases/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Risk Factors']",,1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1651-2227.1989.tb17945.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Paediatr Scand. 1989 Jul;78(4):608-14. doi: 10.1111/j.1651-2227.1989.tb17945.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of multicell tumor spheroids of both HeLa and EMT6/Ro cells in suspension with 500 SW resulted either in loss of peripheral cells and serious cellular damage in the outer regions or in a fragmentation of the spheroids. Many of the geometrically intact cells exhibited the same histopathological alterations as the suspended L1210 cells. Immobilization of the spheroids in agar or gelatine, however, prevented spheroids from being agitated and accelerated during SW-exposure. After treatment with 500 SW, spheroids immobilized in gelatine were not different from control cultures, as investigated with light- and electronmicroscopy.

The phosphorescence of Ga-DP in tumor-bearing golden hamsters are measured both in tumor tissue and in liver. They show bi-exponential decay with the lifetimes of about 5 and 20 ms. From the values, the generation rate, kct[3O2], of singlet molecular oxygen in living animal tissue may be estimated to be an order of 10(2) s-1. The PDT effects have been quantitatively investigated for in vitro experiments; upon irradiation the growth inhibitions of mouse p388 leukemia cells are obtained as a function of concentration of Ga-DP, Zn-DP, Mn-DP and PII.

By using the drug brefeldin A to block intracellular transport of proteins from the ER to the Golgi complex, the translocated precursors were shown to accumulate in the ER, while the untranslocated forms were rapidly degraded with an intracellular half-life of approximately 20 min. Brefeldin A did not inhibit the synthesis of fatty acylation of the precursors but substantially delayed their acquisition of O-linked oligosaccharides, which indicates that murine glycophorins are fatty acylated in the ER and O-glycosylated in the Golgi complex. Even after 6 hr in brefeldin A, glycophorins were only partially glycosylated, resulting in the accumulation of glycoproteins apparently sialylated but lower in apparent molecular mass than mature glycophorins. Complete glycophorin processing resumed only after removal of the drug. In murine erythroleukemia cells, brefeldin A caused a rapid and extensive disorganization of the entire Golgi complex accompanied by the accumulation of membranes in a part of the ER closely associated with ER transitional elements. These findings extend recently published results [Lippincott-Schwartz, J., Yuan, L. C., Bonifacino, J. S. & Klausner, R. D.

A histochemical and morphometric study on trephine biopsies in 165 patients.,591-9,"In 165 patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD) a morphometric and histochemical study was performed on trephine biopsies of the bone marrow to elucidate osseous remodeling by assessment of trabecular bone area (planimetry) and number of osteoclasts. Osteoclastic elements were identified by the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase method. In addition to control specimens (n = 20) subtypes of CMPD included chronic myeloid leukemia (CML, n = 65), primary (essential) thrombocythemia (PTH, n = 25), polycythemia vera rubra (P. vera, n = 25) and agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM, n = 50). AMM was discriminated into a so-called early hyperplastic stage without gross myelofibrosis (n = 19) and an overt or advanced stage showing fibro-osteosclerotic changes (n = 31). Total area of trabecular bone and counts for osteoclasts (uni- and multi-nucleated cells as well as a-nuclear cytoplasmic fragments) were not significantly increased in CML, PTH, P. vera and in the initial hypercellular stages of AMM. In contrast to these results, in advanced stages of AMM there was a significant increase in total bone area associated with a high count for all osteoclastic elements and apparently also an increased number of osteoblasts. It is speculated that the marked increase in osteoclastic-osteoblastic elements in late stages of AMM possibly reflects an imbalance of calcitriol (1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3) on skeletal homeostasis. This abnormal osseous remodeling may be mediated by the atypical megakaryocytic proliferation in this disorder, which is always a conspicuous feature of bone marrow biopsies.","['Thiele, J', 'Hoeppner, B', 'Wienhold, S', 'Schneider, G', 'Fischer, R', 'Zankovich, R']","['Thiele J', 'Hoeppner B', 'Wienhold S', 'Schneider G', 'Fischer R', 'Zankovich R']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, FRG.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Pathol Res Pract,"Pathology, research and practice",7806109,,IM,"['Biopsy/methods', '*Bone Development', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/classification/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Osteoblasts/pathology', 'Osteoclasts/*pathology']",,1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0344-0338(89)80164-5 [pii]', '10.1016/S0344-0338(89)80164-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Res Pract. 1989 Jun;184(6):591-9. doi: 10.1016/S0344-0338(89)80164-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mRNA capsite was mapped by primer extension and defines a promoter that contains no apparent TATA element. S1 nuclease analysis detects the presence at low levels of a 45 bp-deleted form of the ALA-S mRNA created by the use of an alternative splice site at the intron 2/exon 3 junction.

No significant differences were observed in the patterns or intensity of the hypersensitive sites in the uninduced and induced MEL cells, however, no sites in ALA-S were observed in NIH 3T3 cells or in deproteinized DNA.

This phenomenon was also observed when cells were treated with phorbol myristate (TPA) and a calcium ionophor, A23187. The phosphorylated 18,000 mol. wt protein was mainly located in the membrane fraction. It was identified as one of the myosin light chains as follows: (1) the mol. wt of one of the major myosin light chains of RBL-2H3 cells was 18,000; (2) more than half of the phosphorylated 18,000 mol. wt protein was recovered in an actomyosin fraction; (3) this phosphorylated 18,000 mol. wt protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-myosin antibody. Since the presence of Ca2+ in the cell culture medium was essential for the phosphorylation of the 18,000 mol. wt protein and, since trifluoperazine (a potent inhibitor of calmodulin as well as of the degranulation process of RBL-2H3 cells) inhibited the reaction, the phosphorylation may be catalyzed by a Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent process, most likely by myosin light chain kinase. These results, together with our previous observation [Teshima et al. Molec Immun. 23, 279-284 (1986)], suggest that simultaneous phosphorylation of the 18,000 mol. wt myosin light chain and a 36,000 mol. wt membranous protein is a prerequisite for the degranulation of RBL-2H3 cells.","['Teshima, R', 'Suzuki, K', 'Ikebuchi, H', 'Terao, T']","['Teshima R', 'Suzuki K', 'Ikebuchi H', 'Terao T']","['Division of Radiochemistry, National Institute of Hygienic Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Myosin Subfragments)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/*immunology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*immunology/metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Myosin Subfragments', 'Myosins/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats']",,1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0161-5890(89)90046-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1989 Jul;26(7):641-8. doi: 10.1016/0161-5890(89)90046-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The less than 30 group are younger and predominantly female when compared with the 30-39 group, who are generally older than 40 years and mainly male. In addition, the two groups show different characteristic patterns of chromosome loss. Morphologically, both groups have populations of large and small lymphoblasts containing numerous small vacuoles, and both have common ALL antigen phenotypes.

Sixty-four percent of cases (16/25) showed a myeloid or myelomonocytic differentiation pattern and 10 of these were classified as FAB M5 (7 M5a, 3 M5b). Only seven of the latter cases expressed the CD14 antigen. Acute megakaryocytic leukemia with a high number of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa or IIIa positive blasts were identified in five patients. Erythroleukemia with a high percentage of rather mature glycophorin A positive erythroblasts were diagnosed in two infants. Cytogenetic studies were successfully performed in all 20 cases investigated. Abnormalities involving chromosome 11 were present in 10 of 17 patients with an abnormal karyotype including five cases with a t(9;11)(p21;q23). Immunoglobulin (Ig) and T cell receptor (TCR) gene analyses were performed in 20 patients. A rearrangement of Ig heavy chain sequences was detected in five cases (20%), one of whom exhibited multiple rearranged fragments. Three of these patients showed additional TCR delta-chain gene rearrangements, while Ig kappa, TCR beta- as well as TCR gamma-chain genes showed a germline configuration in all cases analyzed. Our study confirms the high incidence of myelomonocytic and monoblastic subtypes in infants with ANLL, which are particularly closely associated with chromosome 11 abnormalities. However, we also observed an unexpected high frequency of megakaryoblastic leukemias as well as erythroleukemias.

Exchange of the Friend virus enhancer region, a sequence of about 180 nucleotides including the direct repeat and a short 3'-adjacent segment, for the corresponding region in Moloney MuLV confers the ability to cause erythroid disease on Moloney MuLV. We have used the electrophoretic mobility shift assay and methylation interference analysis to identify cellular factors which bind to the Friend virus enhancer region and compared these with factors, previously identified, that bind to the Moloney virus direct repeat (N. A. Speck and D. Baltimore, Mol. Cell. Biol. 7:1101-1110, 1987). We identified five binding sites for sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins in the Friend virus enhancer region. While some binding sites are present in both the Moloney and Friend virus enhancers, both viruses contain unique sites not present in the other. Although none of the factors identified in this report which bind to these unique sites are present exclusively in T cells or erythroid cells, they bind to three regions of the enhancer shown by genetic analysis to encode disease specificity and thus are candidates to mediate the tissue-specific expression and distinct disease specificities encoded by these virus enhancer elements.","['Manley, N R', ""O'Connell, M A"", 'Sharp, P A', 'Hopkins, N']","['Manley NR', ""O'Connell MA"", 'Sharp PA', 'Hopkins N']","['Center for Cancer Research, Massachusetts, Institute of Technology, Cambridge 02139.']",['eng'],"['P01-CA2063/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA19308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*analysis', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Tissue Distribution']",PMC251035,1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.63.10.4210-4223.1989 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Oct;63(10):4210-23. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.10.4210-4223.1989.,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were adequate records on 101 patients who received 147 courses of HDAC. Twenty-six treatment courses (18%) were complicated by NT. The median time of NT onset was 5 days (range, 1 to 10 days), and NT was reversible in 16 of 21 survivors (76%). Patients with severe NT (grades 3 to 4) were less likely to have complete reversal of their neurological deficit than those with mild NT (P less than .1). In our patients, there was no significant association between previously described risk factors (age over 49 years, male gender, CNS disorder, and cumulative HDAC dose greater than 48 g/m2) and incidence of NT. However, treatment courses involving HDAC given during renal insufficiency (serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL or an increase in serum creatinine greater than 0.5 mg/dL) were much more likely to be complicated by any degree of NT during administration of HDAC (62%) and severe NT (42%) than those given during normal renal function (8% and 3%, respectively; P less than .001). Of the treatment courses involving patients with estimated creatinine clearances less than 60 mL/min, 76% were complicated by NT compared with 8% of treatment courses involving patients with clearances greater than 60 mL/min (P less than .001). HDAC courses with neurotoxic patients had higher serum creatinines (2.1 +/- 1.4 v 1.1 +/- 0.6 mg/dL), greater increases in serum creatinine (+ 0.5 +/- 0.8 v + 0.07 +/- 0.3 mg/dL), and lower estimated creatinine clearances (61 +/- 35 v 91 +/- 29 mL/min) than those courses with nonneurotoxic patients (P less than .001, all parameters). Patients receiving HDAC during renal insufficiency are at high risk for developing NT. Dose reduction of HDAC should be considered for patients with renal insufficiency.","['Damon, L E', 'Mass, R', 'Linker, C A']","['Damon LE', 'Mass R', 'Linker CA']","['Cancer Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco 94143.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/*complications', 'Alcoholism/complications', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperbilirubinemia/complications', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nervous System Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Risk Factors']",,1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1989.7.10.1563 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1989 Oct;7(10):1563-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1989.7.10.1563.,,,,,,,,,,,,

These drugs are stored in tissues as active metabolites. Relapse in ALL might reflect failure to achieve adequate intracellular drug levels. Assured (parenteral) delivery of higher doses of MTX and MP should maximize tissue levels of these drugs by overcoming individual variations in absorption, metabolism, clearance, and compliance. Fifty-nine children with ALL at lower risk of relapse received 12 intensive MTX/MP courses immediately after 4 weeks of standard vincristine, prednisone, and asparaginase induction. Each 2-week intensive course included: MTX, 200 mg/m2 intravenous (IV) push then 800 mg/m2 IV over 24 hours on day 1; MP, 200 mg/m2 IV push then 800 mg/m2 IV over 8 hours on day 2; MTX, 20 mg/m2 intramuscularly on day 8; and MP, 50 mg/m2 orally daily on days 8 to 14.

The following differences were found: (1) the two major MEL cell glycophorins (apparent Mr values 29-30 and 43(x10(3] have greater mobility on polyacrylamide gels than their normal gp-3 and gp-2 counterparts, due at least in part to differences in their oligosaccharide sidechains; (2) MEL cell gp-3 consists of two discrete proteins; and (3) there are more potential glycophorin precursors in MEL cells than in normal mouse erythroblasts. Four proteins, with apparent Mr values of 21, 23, 26 and 27(x10(3], have tentatively been identified as glycophorin precursors, based on the following findings: (1) they are immunologically related to the glycophorins; and (2) their synthesis was induced by dimethyl sulphoxide coincidentally with that of gp-3 and gp-2. They do not appear to be glycoproteins, as evidenced by their lack of incorporation of [3H]galactose, [3H]glucosamine or [3H]mannose. In contrast, gp-3 and gp-2 incorporated [3H]galactose and [3H]glucosamine but not [3H]mannose. Partial characterization of the glycan moieties of MEL cell glycophorins indicates that they consist mostly of tri- and tetrasaccharides, with no indication of any N-linked chains. Hence, the glycans of MEL cell glycophorins are mostly (if not all) O-linked. Furthermore, treatment with N-glycanase did not change their electrophoretic mobility on polyacrylamide gels.

Most is easily extracted from isolated nuclei in 0.35 M NaCl, while 20 percent resists such treatment. Compared to undigested nuclei, both the amount of myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA) released from nuclei after DNase I treatment and the amount resisting further extraction in 0.35 M NaCl increased after DNA was digested with DNase I. Under these conditions, there was a concomitant decrease in the amount of MNDA that was extractable with 0.35 M NaCl. Mixing nuclear protein extracts that contain MNDA with nuclei from cells that do not express this protein demonstrated that the MNDA redistributes from the freely soluble form to the nuclear residual fraction as a consequence of DNase I digestion. These data are consistent with a model in which the amount of MNDA that is tightly bound to salt-washed nuclei is held constant in the presence of an excess of unassociated MNDA in the nucleus, and that the level of MNDA binding to this nuclear fraction increases in proportion to the extent of DNA damage resulting from DNase I digestion.","['Duhl, D M', 'Gaczynski, M', 'Olinski, R', 'Briggs, R C']","['Duhl DM', 'Gaczynski M', 'Olinski R', 'Briggs RC']","['Department of Biochemistry, A.B.

This clonal line, MTXrA, made 100-fold resistant to MTX, was derived in a single step and exhibited stable resistance over 120 generations in the absence of drug. The transport defect was associated with a 10-fold decrease in influx Vmax without a change in influx Km. There was no difference between the MTXrA and parent lines in the levels or affinities of specific cell surface binders for MTX nor in the labeling of the 44-kDa membrane protein upon treatment with the specific affinity label, N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of tritiated MTX. Consistent with impaired carrier function was the observation that trans-stimulation of MTX influx by intracellular 5-formyltetrahydrofolate observed in the parent line was not demonstrated in the MTXrA line. The transport defect was highly specific for the MTX-tetrahydrofolate cofactor transport carrier. Initial uptake rates for 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine and 2-deoxyglucose were unchanged and influx and net transport of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid were, in fact, increased. There was no cross-resistance of this line to phenylalanine mustard or cytosine arabinoside, agents that utilize specific amino acid and nucleoside transport carriers, respectively. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified plasma membrane preparations stained with Coomassie Blue revealed several protein differences between the parental and MTXrA lines. Most prominent is a band at approximately 190 kDa which ran with slightly greater mobility than a lesser staining band in the parent line. [3H]Borohydride labeling of cells also identified a distinct protein peak in the MTXrA line at approximately 190 kDa eliminated by prior treatment of cells with neuraminidase. Absence of expression of protein or mRNA related to the multidrug resistance gene as well as lack of cross-resistance to daunorubicin or trimetrexate indicate that this mechanism of resistance to MTX is completely unrelated to the multidrug resistance phenomenon observed with high molecular weight heterocyclic compounds. These data represent the first demonstration of membrane protein differences in a highly resistant L1210 murine leukemia cell line with a marked unique defect in MTX transport which appears to be related to impaired mobility of the tetrahydrofolate-cofactor carrier. Further studies are now required to elucidate the possible role of one or more of these proteins in the transport defect.","['Schuetz, J D', 'Westin, E H', 'Matherly, L H', 'Pincus, R', 'Swerdlow, P S', 'Goldman, I D']","['Schuetz JD', 'Westin EH', 'Matherly LH', 'Pincus R', 'Swerdlow PS', 'Goldman ID']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298.']",['eng'],"['CA-09564/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NHLBI-07110/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (methotrexate transporter protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', '*ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mice', '*Mutation', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Thymidylate Synthase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/metabolism']",,1989/09/25 00:00,1989/09/25 00:01,['1989/09/25 00:00'],"['1989/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)71616-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Sep 25;264(27):16261-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Partial amino acid sequences of human R protein were obtained from tryptic digestion fragments. Using the polymerase chain reaction, a partial TCI cDNA probe was isolated by selective amplification of a region of cDNA located between two oligonucleotides deduced from the available partial amino acid sequences. The amplified probe was then used to obtain full length clones from a granulocyte cDNA library. Identity of the clones was confirmed by matching DNA sequence to known peptide amino acid sequence. TCI is transcribed to a single 1.5-kilobase mRNA species. The predicted protein sequence is 433 amino acids long. We have compared the sequence of TCI to that of rat intrinsic factor. The two proteins have areas of extensive homology which implicate regions potentially important for vitamin B12 binding.

Most current treatment protocols require rotation of the cranial fields to compensate for the divergence of the spinal field such that the adjacent field edges abut along the match line in the mid-saggital plane. Some departments introduce gaps up to 1-2 cm wide between the matched fields out of concern for overdosing the spinal cord. The behavior of the dose distribution was studied in the junction region of divergence-compensated fields as the separation of their edges varied from 0.5 cm overlap to a gap 1 cm wide. Composite dose profiles and isodose maps were calculated for 60Co and 4 MV photon beams using static and moving junction (feathering) techniques. When the fields are appropriately matched there is no gap between them in the mid-saggital plane and the dose varies smoothly across the junction. Gapping of divergence-compensated fields is detrimental to dose uniformity, producing underdosage in a volume that extends to all depths in the body. With proper localization, there is no way that the commonly accepted critical dose for myelopathy can be exceeded in typical treatments of leukemia patients. It can occur in the treatment of medulloblastoma patients only in the unlikely situation where there is gross overlapping of the adjacent fields. Feathering may be considered as a safety margin against spinal cord damage in medulloblastoma but it is superfluous in leukemia.

This study presents a model for evaluating the isolated contribution of ionizing radiation to the induction of second malignancies in cancer patients, and presents estimates of the expected number of second malignancies induced in selected sensitive sites by scatter radiation during radiotherapy for cancer. The study focused on the year 1987, during which it was estimated that 192,761 new cancer patients received radiotherapy as part of their initial treatment plan. The model predicted that radiation may induce 63-84 secondary breast cancers, 64-72 secondary thyroid cancers, 94-157 secondary lung cancers, and 489-707 secondary leukemias over the remaining lifetime of this patient population. This represents a lifetime incidence of 0.7% for leukemia, and 0.3% for the solid tumors. This incidence must be placed in perspective with the current concepts of cancer management, such as combined modality therapy that may carry a risk of carcinogenesis greater than either modality alone, and when the alternatives to radiotherapy may be nonexistent or may be cosmetically or functionally undesirable.

Although intensively studied, the mechanism of this process remains ill-defined. We have now developed a new, rapid and quantitative method of measuring uptake of doxorubicin by these cells, in which the fluorescence of accumulated drug is rapidly quenched by DNA in the cell nucleus. Pre-treatment of cells with deoxyribonuclease eliminates DNA from non-viable, permeable cells, and this obviates the spurious fluorescence quenching that made previous application of this technique useless. Our data strongly suggest that the drug passively diffuses into cells. The rate of this diffusion into drug-resistant cells is considerably lower than that found in drug-sensitive cells. The ratio of the rates of drug entry in these cell types could fully account for the differences between the cell lines in doxorubicin growth-inhibitory activity. In these experiments no evidence for the previously proposed active efflux mechanism was found in either cell line.","['Ramu, A', 'Pollard, H B', 'Rosario, L M']","['Ramu A', 'Pollard HB', 'Rosario LM']","['Department of Radiation and Clinical Oncology, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Diffusion', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance', 'Fluorescence', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Temperature']",,1989/09/15 00:00,1989/09/15 00:01,['1989/09/15 00:00'],"['1989/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910440328 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1989 Sep 15;44(3):539-47. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910440328.,,,,,,,,,,,,

By attaching radionuclides to monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) targeted at myeloid-associated antigenic determinants, a more effective and directed delivery of therapy may be possible without increasing toxicity. We investigated the biodistribution over time of an anti-myeloid antibody (DM-5) labeled with trace amounts of 131I in normal dogs. This study demonstrates the ability to target marrow with a high degree of selectivity, achieving marrow/blood ratios of 25-30:1 with the greatest concentration in any other organ being a tissue/blood ratio of 1.4:1 for stomach at 48 h. A pretreatment dose of unlabeled antibody effectively reduced early hepatic uptake by 80%, resulting in improved marrow localization with an estimated 58.6% of the injected dose localized in marrow within 2 h following infusion, compared to 32.8% without pretreatment. The marrow concentration clearance curve for the radioimmunoconjugate revealed an initial short half-life (4.75 h), suggesting rapid internalization, digestion, and release of free iodine (dehalogenation). This view was supported by a corresponding rise in trichloroacetic acid-non-precipitable activity during this period. Methods aimed at decreasing dehalogenation may result in longer residence time of the radionuclide within the marrow space, resulting in more effective tumor cell kill. This approach may provide a way to improve upon the current results obtained with marrow transplantation as treatment for patients with leukemia and other hematologic malignancies.","['Bianco, J A', 'Sandmaier, B', 'Brown, P A', 'Badger, C', 'Bernstein, I', 'Eary, J', 'Durack, L', 'Schuening, F', 'Storb, R', 'Appelbaum, F']","['Bianco JA', 'Sandmaier B', 'Brown PA', 'Badger C', 'Bernstein I', 'Eary J', 'Durack L', 'Schuening F', 'Storb R', 'Appelbaum F']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98104.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*pharmacokinetics', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Dogs', 'Granulocytes/immunology', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Lung/metabolism', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Tissue Distribution']",,1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1989 Oct;17(9):929-34.,,,,,,,,,,,,

All had a progressive spastic paraparesis developing many years after immigration and all 19 tested had antibodies to the human T cell lymphotropic retrovirus type 1 (HTLV1). The clinical and laboratory features and visual, auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials are described. Details of magnetic resonance scanning of the brain and, in a few cases, the spinal cord are compared with those found in multiple sclerosis. The antibody titres to HTLV1 assessed by particle agglutination, Western blot, antibody-directed cell mediated cytotoxicity and pseudotype neutralization were higher than in asymptomatic infected relatives and in patients with adult T cell leukaemia. Some, but not all, of the IgG oligoclonal bands in the CSF were directed against HTLV1. IgM oligoclonal bands directed against HTLV1 were found in 2 patients. Sixty of the 64 first degree relatives of 11 Jamaican patients with TSP were traced in the UK and the Caribbean; 20-30% of those born in the Caribbean had antibodies to HTLV1, irrespective of their present place of residence, whilst none of those born in the UK, who were the children of the patients, had antibodies. The original pathological material obtained from the Caribbean by Montgomery et al. (1964) is reviewed. These results are discussed in relation to animal retroviral neurological diseases, particularly visna in sheep which has clinical and pathological features closely similar to TSP. It is proposed that TSP is due to a HTLV1 infected lymphocyte/macrophage immune-mediated inflammatory response in the spinal cord.","['Cruickshank, J K', 'Rudge, P', 'Dalgleish, A G', 'Newton, M', 'McLean, B N', 'Barnard, R O', 'Kendall, B E', 'Miller, D H']","['Cruickshank JK', 'Rudge P', 'Dalgleish AG', 'Newton M', 'McLean BN', 'Barnard RO', 'Kendall BE', 'Miller DH']","['Northwick Park Hospital, Harrow, Middlesex, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Brain,Brain : a journal of neurology,0372537,['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Central Nervous System/pathology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/analysis/cytology', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leg', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscular Diseases/physiopathology', 'Nervous System/physiopathology', 'Nervous System Diseases/physiopathology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/immunology/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Sensation']",,1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/brain/112.4.1057 [doi]'],ppublish,Brain. 1989 Aug;112 ( Pt 4):1057-90. doi: 10.1093/brain/112.4.1057.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability of marrow maintained in culture for 10 days to serve as an autograft has now been tested in three patients treated with intensive chemoradiotherapy. Two weeks after transplantation, marrow samples from all patients showed trilineage haematopoiesis. Neutrophil counts greater than 1.0 x 10(9)/l were achieved in all patients within 4 weeks, and platelet counts greater than 20 x 10(9)/l were achieved in two patients within 5 weeks. During this period of haematopoietic recovery, marrow cells were exclusively Ph1-negative in two patients and predominantly so in the third. These results suggest that engraftment can occur from Ph1-negative haematopoietic stem cells selected by maintenance of autologous CML marrow in culture for 10 days. Thus, the feasibility of using this approach to allow intensive and potentially curative therapy for CML has been established.","['Barnett, M J', 'Eaves, C J', 'Phillips, G L', 'Kalousek, D K', 'Klingemann, H G', 'Lansdorp, P M', 'Reece, D E', 'Shepherd, J D', 'Shaw, G J', 'Eaves, A C']","['Barnett MJ', 'Eaves CJ', 'Phillips GL', 'Kalousek DK', 'Klingemann HG', 'Lansdorp PM', 'Reece DE', 'Shepherd JD', 'Shaw GJ', 'Eaves AC']","['Department of Medicine, Vancouver General Hospital, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1989 Jul;4(4):345-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we have evaluated the regulatory effect of serum, collected before and after 3 and 12 months of alpha-IFN treatment, from 10 patients with untreated HCL, on the in vitro growth of normal bone marrow CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-MK. The effect of conditioned media, prepared from enriched hairy cells (HC) cultured in synthetic medium, on the growth of normal haemopoietic progenitors was also investigated. The results obtained confirm that sera from untreated HCL patients display a variable degree of inhibitory activity in the progenitor cell compartments analysed. Disappearance of the inhibitory activity, particularly evident for the erythroid compartment, was found only in patients who displayed a disappearance of circulating HC and a good haematological response after prolonged (12 months) treatment with alpha-IFN.

Compared to the highly purified lectin a 140-fold higher protein concentration of an aqueous mistletoe drug was required to obtain similar cytotoxic effects on MOLT-4 cells. Cytotoxicity of the highly purified lectin was preferentially inhibited by D-galactose and lactose, cytotoxicity of the mistletoe drug and the partially purified lectin were preferentially inhibited by lactose and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc). Two lectin fractions with almost the same cytotoxic activity on MOLT-4 cells but with different carbohydrate affinities were isolated by affinity chromatography from the mistletoe drug: mistletoe lectin I with an affinity to D-galactose and GalNAc and mistletoe lectin II with an affinity to GalNAc. The lectin fractions and the mistletoe drug inhibited protein synthesis of MOLT-4 cells stronger than DNA synthesis. Furthermore a subpopulation of MOLT-4, resistant to cytotoxic doses of both the mistletoe drug and the mistletoe lectins, was shown to exhibit a reduced amount of GalNAc and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine in their cellular glycoproteins which are probably responsible for the binding of the cytotoxic lectins.

Lesions can predate leukemia or occur late in an established chronic granulocytic leukemia or acute granulocytic leukemia. The most common presentation occurs late in the course of acute granulocytic leukemia or in chronic granulocytic leukemia as a herald to blastic transformation. Therapy for localized lesions is radiotherapy, which produces prompt shrinkage of the lesions but relapse occurs subsequently. Systemic chemotherapy also produces satisfactory clinical results.

Cycloheximide treatment increased the liver and lung levels of virus Mo-MuLV, IAP, ET related transcripts in a strain dependent way, whereas VL30 mRNA levels increased in both tissues of all strains examined. These results suggested the existence of labile proteins that regulate the abundance of specific retroviral mRNAs in murine liver and lung in a strain specific fashion. No clear relationships between pattern of retrovirus expression and genetical susceptibility to hepatocarcinogenesis was found. The strains genetically resistant to lung carcinogenesis (C3Hf, C57BL/6J) showed higher lung basal levels and higher cycloheximide inducibility of mRNAs homologous to Mo-MuLV than the susceptible strains (A/J, BALB/c).","['Manenti, G', 'Dragani, T A', 'Della Porta, G']","['Manenti G', 'Dragani TA', 'Della Porta G']","['Division of Experimental Oncology A, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milan.

Cells treated with NaCl and Triton X-100 were exposed to increasing concentrations of the fluorescent, DNA-intercalating dye, propidium iodide (PI), and the diameter of the resulting fluorescent halo of DNA was measured. As the PI concentration was increased from 0.5 to 5 micrograms/ml, halo diameter increased from 20-25 to 45-55 microns due to the unwinding of the DNA supercoils. This process was similar for both cell lines under all conditions studied. As the PI concentration was increased to 50 micrograms/ml, the halo rewound to a diameter of 25-30 microns in unirradiated cells from both lines. However, following exposure to 3-12 Gy of 137Cs gamma rays, the ability of the DNA to be rewound was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. Rewinding inhibition was greater in LY-S cells than in LY-R cells. Since the induction of DNA damage (e.g., single-strand DNA breaks) appears to be the same for both cell lines, this result implies that a similar extent of damage results in a greater loss of topological constraints on the DNA loops in LY-S. Such a change might be related to the protein composition of the nucleoid cores. One-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that nucleoids from LY-S cells were missing a 55-kDa protein present in LY-R.","['Kapiszewska, M', 'Wright, W D', 'Lange, C S', 'Roti Roti, J L']","['Kapiszewska M', 'Wright WD', 'Lange CS', 'Roti Roti JL']","['Section of Cancer Biology, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri 63108.']",['eng'],['CA 41102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Superhelical)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*radiation effects', 'DNA, Superhelical/*radiation effects', 'Leukemia L5178/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Propidium', 'Radiation Tolerance']",,1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1989 Sep;119(3):569-75.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence data can be interpreted by radiobiological models of the induction process coupled with cell inactivation. In particular, for malignant lymphoma the dose-response curve after X rays can be described assuming a quadratic model corrected for cell inactivation, while the incidence data after fission neutrons are best fitted by a linear model which also allows for cell inactivation. Myeloid leukemia has also been induced in BC3F1 mice. The bell-shaped dose-response curves observed after irradiation with either X rays or neutrons are explained by assuming simultaneous initial transforming events and cell inactivation with the data for cell inactivation at higher doses being in agreement with data reported for other strains of mice. A value for relative biological effectiveness of 4 is obtained at the lowest neutron dose used.

The second region, located at -160, binds the erythroid-specific factor NF-E2 and the ubiquitous factor AP1. Using UV cross-linking, we show that NF-E2 has a higher molecular weight than AP1, demonstrating that NF-E2 is not an erythroid-specific degradation product of AP1. By point mutagenesis of the NF-E2/AP1 binding site, we define mutations that abolish binding of either NF-E2 alone or AP1 and NF-E2 together. Regulation of transcription of the PBGD erythroid promoter is abolished by those mutations, suggesting that NF-E2 but not AP1 is necessary for correct regulation of this promoter in erythroid cells.","['Mignotte, V', 'Eleouet, J F', 'Raich, N', 'Romeo, P H']","['Mignotte V', 'Eleouet JF', 'Raich N', 'Romeo PH']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U.91, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', 'EC 2.5.1.61 (Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase)', 'EC 4.3.1.- (Ammonia-Lyases)']",IM,"['Ammonia-Lyases/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes', '*Genes, Regulator', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC297881,1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.86.17.6548 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Sep;86(17):6548-52. doi: 10.1073/pnas.86.17.6548.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were divided into two groups according to their tumor burden at diagnosis (i.e. white cell count, presence or absence of mediastinal mass, or massive organomegaly). The patients with a greater tumor burden had increased energy expenditure. Their resting energy expenditure returned to normal in response to chemotherapy. These results must be interpreted with caution due to the small patients numbers (high tumor burden n = 3; low tumor burden n = 6). Substrate utilization was altered by chemotherapy with an increase in carbohydrate utilization and a decrease in fat oxidation (p less than 0.009). The magnitude of the thermic effect of food tended to increase on treatment (p less than 0.016).

A clinicopathologic study of 113 cases.,296-328,"This large series of cases demonstrates that the breast of the child or adolescent is the potential site for a number of interesting lesions exclusive of fibroadenoma and gynecomastia. Adenoma of the nipple, juvenile papillomatosis, and juvenile or cellular fibroadenoma should be correctly diagnosed to insure conservative surgical management and appropriate clinical follow-up. The results of the Juvenile Papillomatosis Registry suggest that this lesion is a morphological marker of potentially more serious breast disease in the future. Recognition of a cellular fibroepithelial neoplasm, especially in young black females, as a cellular fibroadenoma will hopefully eliminate the need for the diagnosis of ""benign"" cytosarcoma phyllodes. On occasion, the equivocal case may be labeled a ""phyllodes tumor fo indeterminate biologic behavior."" Those neoplasms with stromal atypia and mitotic activity, overgrowth of stroma with epithelial dissociation, and sarcomatous elements are appropriately designated as cytosarcoma phyllodes. In contrast to vascular tumors of the breast in adults, the majority of vascular lesions in the child's breast are bening and represent either a capillary or a histiocytoid hemangioma.

Regulation of bcl-2 gene expression was investigated in neoplastic lymphoid cell lines containing normal #18 chromosomes or a t(14;18) translocation with regard to steady-state mRNA levels, RNA stability, transcription rates, and DNA methylation. High steady-state levels of bcl-2 mRNA, and proportionally high rates of bcl-2 transcription (measured in isolated nuclei), were found in B cell lines containing t(14;18) translocations. The half-life of bcl-2 mRNA (approximately 2-3 hr) was similar in all cell lines examined, including a t(14;18)-containing follicular lymphoma cell line, which has a translocated and rearranged bcl-2 gene that produces bcl-2/Ig fusion transcripts. However, in the presence of cycloheximide (inhibitor of protein synthesis), the half-life of some of the bcl-2/Ig mRNAs produced by these cells was prolonged, indicating that in some circumstances mRNA stability may contribute to deregulated bcl-2 expression. Despite stabilizing some bcl-2 mRNAs, the overall effect of treating cell lines with cycloheximide was a reduction in the levels of accumulated bcl-2 mRNAs through inhibition of bcl-2 gene transcription. These latter data provide indirect evidence that short-lived transacting factor(s) regulate transcription of the human bcl-2 gene in lymphoid cells with or without a t(14;18) translocation. No clear correlation was discovered between bcl-2 gene methylation and transcription.","['Reed, J C', 'Tsujimoto, Y', 'Epstein, S F', 'Cuddy, M', 'Slabiak, T', 'Nowell, P C', 'Croce, C M']","['Reed JC', 'Tsujimoto Y', 'Epstein SF', 'Cuddy M', 'Slabiak T', 'Nowell PC', 'Croce CM']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104-6082.']",['eng'],"['CA39860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42232/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Oncogene Res,Oncogene research,8801457,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'Cycloheximide/toxicity', 'DNA/isolation & purification', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Plasmids', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/drug effects/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene Res. 1989;4(4):271-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the antileukemic effect of ambazone disappeared more or less in congenitally athymic nude mice, in neonatally thymectomized or silica-pretreated animals, it has been concluded that the action of the compound seems to be limited to young adult immunocompetent tumor-bearing hosts. Therefore immunosenescence, primarily of T cell functions of old tumor-bearers, may represent a decisive factor influencing the antileukemic, especially curative effect of ambazone in aged animals.

A whole blood NK (WB-NK) assay was employed in order to measure the NK activity per unit blood. The pretreatment WB-NK activity was consistently low, indicating that the patients' total NK activity in PB is decreased. Striking differences in WB-NK activity were observed between splenectomized and non-splenectomized patients, whereas no consistent patterns were found when using the conventional NK assay. Thus the WB-NK activity of splenectomized patients showed an immediate increase after initiation of treatment, while the activity in non-splenectomized patients decreased and remained low during the first 3-6 months. Subsequently, after reduction in spleen size, the WB-NK activity began to increase. In splenectomized patients, a second rise in WB-NK was observed after 3-6 months of therapy, coinciding with the normalisation of the peripheral blood counts. In both groups of patients incubation with IFN in vitro induced a rise in NK activity before start of treatment, which was abrogated promptly after initiation of therapy, indicating a maximal in vivo boosting of the NK cells. These differences observed indicate that the response of splenectomized and non-splenectomized HCL patients to IFN treatment should be evaluated separately.","['Nielsen, B', 'Hokland, P', 'Ellegaard, J', 'Hasselbalch, H', 'Hokland, M']","['Nielsen B', 'Hokland P', 'Ellegaard J', 'Hasselbalch H', 'Hokland M']","['University Department of Medicine and Haematology, Aarhus Amtssygehus, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Interferon Type I/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Recombinant Proteins', '*Splenectomy', 'Time Factors']",,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(89)90165-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(6):451-6. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90165-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,

A chest roentgenogram also showed a nodular area of increased density in the left upper lobe. Since his clinical state deteriorated progressively despite the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, amphotericin B was administered intravenously (with an initial dose of 5 mg/day, increased up to 25 mg/day). Concomitant with bone marrow recovery and continued antifungal therapy, he became soon afebrile and improved over the next 2 months. The infiltrates also began to resolve. Then he abruptly coughed up about 800 ml of blood and suffered from acute respiratory failure. Bronchial arteriographic studies demonstrated active extravasation of contrast medium in the region of the cavity. After therapeutic embolization with Gelfoam, the extravasation was no longer observed. Active bleeding abruptly ceased and had not recurred until the left upper lobectomy which was performed 10 days after the embolization. This case typically demonstrates the value of bronchial arterial embolization in treating massive hemoptysis.","['Kamesaki, H', 'Kawano, S', 'Ohno, Y', 'Amano, H', 'Imanaka, T', 'Takahashi, Y', 'Sadatoh, N', 'Takahashi, M', 'Kuroda, Y', 'Kitano, M']","['Kamesaki H', 'Kawano S', 'Ohno Y', 'Amano H', 'Imanaka T', 'Takahashi Y', 'Sadatoh N', 'Takahashi M', 'Kuroda Y', 'Kitano M']",,['jpn'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bronchial Arteries', '*Embolization, Therapeutic', 'Hemoptysis/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/*complications', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications']",,1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1989 Apr;30(4):563-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was diagnosed as chronic phase of Ph1-chromosome positive CML at 14 years old. Three years after the diagnosis of the disease, she was admitted to the hospital because of low grade fever, lethargy and marked splenomegaly. Small dose of Ara-C relieved her symptoms and splenomegaly. Six months later, however, a marked leukocytosis over 70,000/microliters were observed, and the peripheral blood smear disclosed that about 80% of the leukocytes were relatively mature monocytoid cells. Chromosomal analysis revealed additional abnormalities (double Ph1, +8, +9, +19). Lysozyme levels in serum and urine were high and NAP score was elevated. These monocytoid cells expressed receptors for IgG-Fc and C3, phagocytic activity, and monocytoid antigens which were determined by monoclonal antibodies (MY4, Mo2, OKM5).

Eighty-seven patients, with a median age of 38 years (range, 7 to 71), received consolidation therapy after first complete remission was obtained with standard induction chemotherapy that included conventional doses of Ara-C. Consolidation therapy consisted of from one to three cycles of high-dose Ara-C (3 g/m2 intravenously [IV] over 1 hour every 12 hours for 12 doses) followed by daunorubicin (30 mg/m2/d IV bolus for 3 days). After completion of the high-dose Ara-C and daunorubicin, no further therapy was administered. Myelosuppression encountered with consolidation resulted in a median duration of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia of 3 weeks. Four patients (5%) died during consolidation due to infection and/or hemorrhage; 59% of patients experienced severe but nonfatal infectious or extramedullary organ toxicity. With a median follow-up of more than 3.5 years from diagnosis, the proportion of patients, by Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimate, remaining in CCR is 49% (95% confidence limits, 37% to 61%). In a Cox multivariate analysis, only age significantly (P less than .001) influenced the probability of remaining in CCR. The probability of remaining in CCR was 83%, 50%, and 23% for age groups of 25 or less, 26 to 45, and more than 45 years, respectively. These survival curves all have stable long-term plateaus, suggesting cure. In this study, the administration of brief, intensive nonmarrow ablative chemotherapy resulted in a large proportion of patients with AML remaining in CCR, results similar to those reported with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Relapse of acute leukemia was still the major reason for therapy failure, suggesting that more effective or additional postremission therapy will be required to further improve the likelihood of cure especially for older patients.","['Wolff, S N', 'Herzig, R H', 'Fay, J W', 'Phillips, G L', 'Lazarus, H M', 'Flexner, J M', 'Stein, R S', 'Greer, J P', 'Cooper, B', 'Herzig, G P']","['Wolff SN', 'Herzig RH', 'Fay JW', 'Phillips GL', 'Lazarus HM', 'Flexner JM', 'Stein RS', 'Greer JP', 'Cooper B', 'Herzig GP']","['Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.']",['eng'],['P30CA43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Statistics as Topic']",,1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1989.7.9.1260 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1989 Sep;7(9):1260-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1989.7.9.1260.,,,,,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 1990 Apr;8(4):753-5.

This observation is consistent with the view that secondary colonies are more likely to arise from dormant clonogenic progenitors, rather than through cells that have formed primary colonies through a self-renewal process.","['Wandl, U', 'Messner, H A']","['Wandl U', 'Messner HA']","['Universitatsklinikum Essen, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cell Cloning,International journal of cell cloning,8308172,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*physiopathology']",,1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530070506 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cell Cloning. 1989 Sep;7(5):314-21. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530070506.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differentiation was assessed by cell growth, morphology, adhesiveness, nitro blue tetrazolium reduction, and nonspecific esterase activity. The extent of differentiation induced by the reductase and measured at 4 days by nitro blue tetrazolium reduction is dose-dependent with an ED50 (dose required for half-maximal effect) of 71 nM. In the presence of 10 nM retinoic acid the ED50 for reductase is reduced to 18 nM and an isobologram analysis of this effect indicates that the combination is synergistic. Inactivation of the enzymatic activity is not associated with a decrease in differentiation-induced activity. These results suggest that the structure of the enzyme protein and not its enzymatic activity is involved with induction of differentiation. This view is supported by the demonstration that aldehyde reductase binds specifically to HL60 cells with a KD of 70 nM and that there are 13,000 binding sites/cell. Thus, the extent of differentiation induced by various concentrations of aldehyde reductase are directly related to the expected level of receptor occupancy.","['Takahashi, N', 'Breitman, T R', 'Saito, T', 'Ichikawa, A']","['Takahashi N', 'Breitman TR', 'Saito T', 'Ichikawa A']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Kidney/enzymology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Weight', 'Rats', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/enzymology']",,1989/09/15 00:00,1989/09/15 00:01,['1989/09/15 00:00'],"['1989/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)84877-9 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Sep 15;264(26):15624-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 3' end of HTLV-I proviral DNA encodes the synthesis of two regulatory proteins, tax and rex. The 40-kDa tax protein is a nuclear protein which positively stimulates transcription from the U3 region of the viral long terminal repeat sequence. Three 21-base pair sequences in the U3 region have been found to serve as the cis-element for tax-mediated trans-activation. We now report that the tax protein can trans-activate HTLV-I LTR in the absence of de novo cellular protein synthesis. Saturated mutagenesis of the 21-base pair repeat sequence showed that specific mutations clustered in sequences homologous to the cAMP responsive element (TGACGTCA) abolish trans-activation by tax. Furthermore, although the TGACGTCN element is nearly palindromic, the mutations that abolish trans-activation are localized exclusively in the 5' 6 bases, suggesting the orientation of this element may play a role in transcription. That the purified tax protein does not bind the 21-base pair repeats or nonspecific DNA lends further support to the notion that tax protein does not directly interact with the 21-base pair repeats to activate transcription. Instead, tax most likely acts via cellular transcriptional factor(s) to bring about trans-activation.","['Giam, C Z', 'Xu, Y L']","['Giam CZ', 'Xu YL']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Nebraska Medical Center, College of Medicine, Omaha 68105.']",['eng'],['CA36727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', '*Genes, Viral', 'HeLa Cells/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/physiology', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Plasmids', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",,1989/09/15 00:00,1989/09/15 00:01,['1989/09/15 00:00'],"['1989/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)84815-9 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Sep 15;264(26):15236-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The five myeloma cell lines are stably growing at present in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. They can also grow in a defined culture medium without serum. That these cell lines were human myeloma cells was confirmed by the following findings. Ultrastructurally, all five cell lines showed features characteristic of plasma cells.

The basins were grouped into three categories (low, intermediate and high exposure) based upon the amount of pesticide sold. The study of highly exposed basins shows an excessive incidence of leukemia (SMR = 1.69, p less than or equal to 0.05) for men in rural farm areas in the Yamaska river basin. This specific group's relative risk (RR) of incidence as compared to the urban male population is 2.27 (p less than or equal to 0.05). The RR is also high and statistically significant among the men in municipalities that draw their drinking water from wells (RR = 2.07, p less than or equal to 0.05) as compared to those where water is drawn from rivers. Most municipalities using wells are in the rural farm areas. These results suggest that there may be a relationship between leukemia and the use of pesticides in this drainage basin, and this hypothesis could be verified at the individual level in epidemiological studies.","['Godon, D', 'Thouez, J P', 'Lajoie, P', 'Nadeau, D']","['Godon D', 'Thouez JP', 'Lajoie P', 'Nadeau D']","['Departement de Geographie, Universite de Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Hungary,Geogr Med,Geographia medica,0356650,['0 (Pesticides)'],IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Pesticides/*adverse effects', 'Quebec', 'Rural Population']",,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Geogr Med. 1989;19:213-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we have analysed the effects of cell-cycle on GSH and GSH-dependent enzymes in an attempt to explain cell-cycle specificity of these antileukaemic drugs which were shown to be involved in free-radical-type reactions. Determination of GSH, GST, GPX and superoxide dismutase in cell-cycle-enriched fractions of five different human myeloid leukaemia cell lines (KG1, K562, U937, ML-1 and ML-2) yielded results identical to those obtained in random cultures, which implies that neither GSH nor GSH-related enzymes are cell-cycle regulated. These findings argue against the presumption that cell-cycle specificity of cytotoxic drugs like Adr could be due to the glutathione-dependent metabolism in myeloid leukaemia cell lines.","['Tihan, T', 'Chiba, P', 'Eher, R', 'Goebl, R', 'Pernerstorfer, T', 'Kraupp, M', 'Kaiser, E']","['Tihan T', 'Chiba P', 'Eher R', 'Goebl R', 'Pernerstorfer T', 'Kraupp M', 'Kaiser E']","['Department of Medical Chemistry, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)']",IM,"['*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/*metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Selenium/*pharmacology', 'Superoxide Dismutase/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/10.9.1709 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1989 Sep;10(9):1709-12. doi: 10.1093/carcin/10.9.1709.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, busulfan was inactive against this model tumor system. In the present study, we have compared the in vitro cytotoxicity of hepsulfam with that of busulfan and we also examined the ability of these compounds to induce DNA damage in the L1210 leukemia cell line. Our results show that L1210 leukemia cells were 7-fold more sensitive to hepsulfam than busulfan. Only hepsulfam produced an appreciable quantity of DNA interstrand cross-linking in L1210 cells, with the peak of cross-link formation being delayed 12 h following a 2-h drug treatment. In contrast, both compounds also produced DNA-protein cross-linking, again with the formation of peak levels being delayed 6-12 h after drug treatment. At equimolar concentrations, hepsulfam produced a greater quantity of DNA interstrand cross-links and DNA-protein cross-links than busulfan. In contrast, busulfan produced a greater quantity of DNA-protein cross-links, when compared to hepsulfam at equitoxic concentrations.","['Pacheco, D Y', 'Stratton, N K', 'Gibson, N W']","['Pacheco DY', 'Stratton NK', 'Gibson NW']","['Laboratory of Pharmacology, AMC Cancer Research Center, Denver, Colorado 80214.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Sulfonic Acids)', '971DU2GQ51 (hepsulfam)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Busulfan/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Sulfonic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,1989/09/15 00:00,1989/09/15 00:01,['1989/09/15 00:00'],"['1989/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Sep 15;49(18):5108-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the initial 24 h of treatment the cytostatic effects of the drugs predominated, manifesting as suppression of cell progression through S (especially through the early portion of S phase) and G2. After 24 h, the cytotoxic effects became apparent, and there was also the appearance of cells with doubled DNA content suggestive of either endoreduplication or impairment of cytokinesis; these cells at higher ploidy level were progressing through S and G2. The observed effects were time- and dose-dependent, occurring at 0.1-0.4 micrograms/ml concentration of 31.662 and 2.0-10.0 micrograms/ml of its methylated analog, either during continuous- or after a 4-h pulse-treatment. Modulation of the cell cycle by the studied drugs is similar to that generally caused by intercalators as well as alkylating agents. However, because no positive evidence of intercalation of the studied drugs to nucleic acids was found, it is possible that alkylation of DNA or other cell constituents may be the primary lesion(s) leading to perturbation of the cell cycle.","['Darzynkiewicz, Z', 'Carter, S P', 'Kapuscinski, J', 'Watanabe, K A']","['Darzynkiewicz Z', 'Carter SP', 'Kapuscinski J', 'Watanabe KA']","['Laboratory of Experimental Cell Research, Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, Walker Laboratories, Rye, NY 10580.']",['eng'],"['CA 23296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'KA46RNI6HN (Emodin)', 'N1ST8V8RR2 (chrysophanic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthraquinones/*pharmacology', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA/analysis', 'Emodin/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304-3835(89)90128-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(89)90128-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1989 Aug;46(3):181-7. doi: 10.1016/0304-3835(89)90128-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Changes considered to be typically secondary in nature involving 5q, 7q, and 12p were seen in only seven cases. Twenty-one patients who had an apparently normal karyotype at diagnosis remained normal in relapse, indicating that absence of clonal chromosome abnormality is a real observation in AML rather than a failure of detection.","['Garson, O M', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'Sakurai, M', 'Reeves, B R', 'Swansbury, G J', 'Williams, G J', 'Alimena, G', 'Arthur, D C', 'Berger, R', 'de la Chapelle, A']","['Garson OM', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Sakurai M', 'Reeves BR', 'Swansbury GJ', 'Williams GJ', 'Alimena G', 'Arthur DC', 'Berger R', 'de la Chapelle A', 'et al.']","[""Department of Cytogenetics, St. Vincent's Hospital, Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence']",,1989/07/15 00:00,1989/07/15 00:01,['1989/07/15 00:00'],"['1989/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(89)90024-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(89)90024-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1989 Jul 15;40(2):187-202. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(89)90024-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Living patients have now been followed a minimum of 6 years. Patients were divided into ten groups according to pretreatment karyotype: no abnormalities, one of the following structural abnormalities [the Philadelphia chromosome, rearrangements involving 8q24, t(4;11), 14q+, 6q-] or, in the remaining cases, modal number (less than 46, 46, 47-50, greater than 50). As previously reported for achievement and duration of complete remission, and overall survival, disease-free survival differed significantly (p less than 0.001) among chromosome groups for both adults and children. Among children, karyotype was an independent prognostic factor for predicting disease-free survival. Because of the long follow-up, we now have been able to utilize statistical models to estimate the percentage of patients cured, according to karyotype alone and combined with other risk factors. Adults with the highest likelihood of cure (21-33%) were those patients with FAB-L1, a leukocyte count of 50,000/microliters or less, and one of the following chromosome groups: greater than 50, 47-50, 6q-, or normal. In children these same characteristics were associated with the highest percentage of cure (58-71% cured). In addition, we identified several groups of children with less than 15% chance of cure who clearly need to be treated as high-risk patients at diagnosis. Future studies of patients who have received risk-adapted therapy based on these chromosome data are needed to determine if more intensive treatment will improve the outlook of patients with cytogenetically unfavorable types of ALL.","['Bloomfield, C D', 'Secker-Walker, L M', 'Goldman, A I', 'Van Den Berghe, H', 'de la Chapelle, A', 'Ruutu, T', 'Alimena, G', 'Garson, O M', 'Golomb, H M', 'Rowley, J D']","['Bloomfield CD', 'Secker-Walker LM', 'Goldman AI', 'Van Den Berghe H', 'de la Chapelle A', 'Ruutu T', 'Alimena G', 'Garson OM', 'Golomb HM', 'Rowley JD', 'et al.']","['Coleman Leukemia Research and Treatment Center, Division of Medical Oncology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis']",,1989/07/15 00:00,1989/07/15 00:01,['1989/07/15 00:00'],"['1989/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(89)90023-X [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(89)90023-x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1989 Jul 15;40(2):171-85. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(89)90023-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In healthy residents, including blood donors, the prevalence of anti-HTLV-I was 11.9% (562/4741 persons). The prevalence increased with age, and was significantly higher in in females than in males (P less than 0.01). The prevalence of anti-HTLV-I in blood donors was 8.5%. In In hematologic diseases, the prevalence of anti-HTLV-I was 98.3% in ATL, 28.9% in lymphoproliferative disorders except ATL, and 10.6% in myeloproliferative disorders. In nonhematologic diseases, the prevalence of anti-HTLV-I was shown to be 29.5% in pulmonary tuberculosis, 25.8% in leprosy, 33.8% in chronic renal failure (CRF), 21.9% in autoimmune diseases, and 47.8% in strongyloidiasis. The various diseases except myeloproliferative disorders had significantly higher prevalence of anti-HTLV-I than healthy residents (P less than 0.01 or 0.05). For autoimmune diseases, the prevalence of anti-HTLV-I in patients with blood transfusion (55.6%) was higher than in those without blood transfusion (8.7%), and healthy residents. In hemodialysis patients with CRF who had received blood transfusions the prevalence of anti-HTLV-I increased with the number of blood transfusions. Therefore, HTLV-I transmission via blood transfusion would partially explain these high prevalence of anti-HTLV-I. However, the prevalence of anti-HTLV-I in hemodialysis patients with CRF was statistically higher than that in healthy residents, regardless of blood transfusion (P less than 0.01). Furthermore, hemodialysis patients showed significantly higher prevalence of anti-HTLV-I than healthy residents, even at a younger age. Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and leprosy showed the same results as hemodialysis patients. These results suggest that possibility that HTLV-I infection has some relation not only to ATL but also to other diseases. Therefore, it seems very important to halt the spread of HTLV-I transmission as soon as possible.","['Hanada, S', 'Uematsu, T', 'Iwahashi, M', 'Nomura, K', 'Utsunomiya, A', 'Kodama, M', 'Ishibashi, K', 'Terada, A', 'Saito, T', 'Makino, T']","['Hanada S', 'Uematsu T', 'Iwahashi M', 'Nomura K', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Kodama M', 'Ishibashi K', 'Terada A', 'Saito T', 'Makino T', 'et al.']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Donors', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/complications/*epidemiology', 'Hematologic Diseases/complications', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Renal Dialysis', 'Serologic Tests']",,1989/09/15 00:00,1989/09/15 00:01,['1989/09/15 00:00'],"['1989/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19890915)64:6<1290::aid-cncr2820640620>3.0.co;2-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1989 Sep 15;64(6):1290-5. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19890915)64:6<1290::aid-cncr2820640620>3.0.co;2-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In some of the transformants, expression of the endogenous beta-globin gene was only weakly induced with the addition of DMSO, while expression of the introduced beta-globin/TK chimeric gene was well induced. Suppression of the endogenous beta-globin gene is selective for beta-globin gene, since expression of alpha-globin gene was only weakly affected in its induction in the transformants. Analysis of nine individual transformants indicated that suppression of the endogenous gene correlates more closely with the transcriptional activity than the copy number of the exogenous gene.

After 5 days of exposure to 40 mM DMO, greater than 60% of HL-60 cells displayed phenotypic and functional changes characteristic of mature granulocytes. As with other inducers of HL-60 cell differentiation, commitment to differentiation required culture in the presence of DMO for more than 24 h, indicating that if transient effects on pH or ion-fluxes occurred, they were not sufficient to trigger this process. DMO was either weak or inactive as an inducer of murine erythroleukemia cell (FLC) differentiation. Although other weak acids and bases triggered differentiation of both HL-60 cells and FLC, the spectrum of response differed markedly between the two lines.

Human hematopoietic cell lines offer an excellent model for the study of the expression of endogenous receptors for the carbohydrate part of glycoconjugates with respect to cell lineage and modulation by differentiation. Initially, a panel of fluorescent (neo)glycoproteins was successfully employed to demonstrate cytologically the actual presence of such receptors on different cell lines: the B lymphoblast line, Daudi; the T cell lymphoblastic leukemia line, P12; the multipotent leukemic line, K562 and the promyelocytic line, HL060. Biochemical analyses were performed using affinity chromatography on supports with immobilized lactose and asialofetuin (simple or complex beta-galactosides), melibiose (alpha-galactoside), fucose, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, maltose (alpha-glucoside), the mannose-rich yeast glycoprotein, mannan, glycopeptides containing sialic acid residues and heparin. Subsequently, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis was used to detect cell lineage-dependent changes in theses parameters. Differentiation-dependent changes in the expression of receptors with specificity to galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, maltose and heparin were similarly uncovered upon dimethyl sulfoxide-induced differentiation of HL60 cells. Differences in this type of cellular characteristic were also apparent for lymphoma cells from patients with various histological subtypes of lowgrade lymphomas. This initial description of lineage- and differentiation-dependent differences in various human hematopoietic cell lines and in cells from patients with lowgrade lymphomas suggests that advances in the knowledge of the composition of endogenous sugar receptors (lectins) may aid in understanding aspects of the biological behavior of hematopoietic cells and their related malignancies via participation of sugar-protein (lectin) interactions.","['Gabius, S', 'Hellmann, K P', 'Ciesiolka, T', 'Nagel, G A', 'Gabius, H J']","['Gabius S', 'Hellmann KP', 'Ciesiolka T', 'Nagel GA', 'Gabius HJ']","['Medizinische Universitatsklinik, Abteilung Hamatologie-Onkologie, Gottingen, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,"['0 (Glycoconjugates)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (glycoprotein receptor GPIb-IX)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Glycoconjugates/analysis', '*Hematopoietic System', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis', '*Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex', '*Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",,1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00320062 [doi]'],ppublish,Blut. 1989 Aug;59(2):165-70. doi: 10.1007/BF00320062.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression, with or without gene amplification, is seen in the development of drug resistance in culture and it has been postulated that genetic modulation of mdr-1/P-170 and DHFR may also be involved in the development of clinical drug resistance. We screened lymphoblasts from 28 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) for evidence of overexpression of mdr-1/P-170 using RNAse protection, RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Overexpression of mdr-1/P-170 without gene amplification was detected in samples from four patients (three after multiple relapses, one at presentation). Overexpression of mdr-1/P-170 was heterogeneous within the population of malignant lymphoblasts as demonstrated by RNA in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and drug uptake using daunomycin autofluorescence analysis. There was no evidence of overexpression of DHFR in any of the eight patient samples tested by RNAse protection nor was there any evidence of gene amplification in 11 patient samples on Southern blot analysis.

Each drug, however, has significant toxicity against normal marrow progenitor cells that frequently proves dose-limiting in patients. In this study, AZT and recombinant IFN-alpha 2a (rIFN-alpha 2a) were tested as single agents and in combination against normal myeloid (CFU-GM) and erythroid (BFU-E) colony forming cells in a standard methylcellulose culture assay. The data were analyzed using a quantitative computerized analysis based on the median-effect principle and the isobologram equation as described by Chou and Talalay (Adv Enz Regul 22:27, 1984). The ED90 for BFU-E and CFU-GM inhibition was then compared with previously measured in vivo plasma levels of each drug and the ED90 for the anti-HIV-1 effect in vitro. We demonstrate that (a) the drugs are strongly synergistic in inhibiting marrow progenitor cell growth and that this synergism occurs at drug levels that are within the range of measured plasma levels in phase I clinical trials, (b) BFU-E are more sensitive than CFU-GM to the inhibiting effects of AZT, rIFN-alpha 2a or both drugs in combination, (c) the drug concentrations in combination that synergistically inhibit bone marrow progenitors are much higher than those required to inhibit HIV-1 replication in vitro, and (d) the anti-HIV-1 effect for the combination of AZT and rIFN-alpha 2a was clearly superior to the effect of AZT or rIFN-alpha 2a alone as indicated by the combination index and the dose-reduction index.

In inoculated cultures, diffuse bursts with many clusters contained large amounts of DEN4 RNA. In contrast to dengue infection of macrophages, virus propagation in semisolid culture was sustained and not enhanced by subneutralizing amounts of antibody. DEN4 also was efficiently propagated in human hematopoietic cell lines, especially those with erythroid properties. In K562 cells, DEN4 infection persisted for months; greatly slowed cell growth, again without cytotoxicity; and resulted in cytopathic changes in cell appearance.

Induction of LPL in THP-1 cells appears to be mediated by PKC since it was affected by both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and a diacylglycerol analogue. This induction was blocked by the specific PKC inhibitor H-7. Although Ca2+ mobilization by the ionophore A23187 also induced LPL mRNA, the mechanism is most likely independent of activation of the Ca2+/calmodulin protein kinase. Depletion of cells of PKC made them refractory to induction by A23187, suggesting that Ca2+ mobilization acts by activating PKC. Addition of cycloheximide (CHX) to undifferentiated THP-1 cells resulted in a transient increase in steady-state mRNA levels (3-fold). Sustained superinduction of LPL mRNA occurred when PMA and CHX were added simultaneously. These results suggest that the level of LPL mRNA is regulated either by a labile regulatory protein, which represses transcription of the LPL gene, or by a protein affecting mRNA stability.","['Auwerx, J H', 'Deeb, S', 'Brunzell, J D', 'Wolfbauer, G', 'Chait, A']","['Auwerx JH', 'Deeb S', 'Brunzell JD', 'Wolfbauer G', 'Chait A']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['DK02456/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM15253/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL30086/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Diglycerides/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Type C Phospholipases/pharmacology']",,1989/05/30 00:00,1989/05/30 00:01,['1989/05/30 00:00'],"['1989/05/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/30 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00437a009 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1989 May 30;28(11):4563-7. doi: 10.1021/bi00437a009.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Group 3 patients colony formation and DNA synthesis were significantly (P less than 0.01) augmented by CSFs but at high cell concentrations became CSF-independent. Blast cell-conditioned medium (BCCM) from these patients exhibited potent autostimulatory activity, increasing DNA synthesis by less than or equal to 5-fold, and also stimulated CSF-dependent homologous blasts by less than or equal to 20-fold. In 5/5 this activity was neutralized by anti-GM-CSF, which also inhibited autonomous proliferation of their blast cells. Group 4 blasts also secreted GM-CSF but their BCCM possessed no autostimulatory activity, and anti GM-CSF failed to inhibit their autonomous growth. No membrane-associated CSF activity was found, however purified cytosolic fractions stimulated proliferation of CSF-dependent homologous blasts, consistent with production and secretion of CSF which is present in active form in the cytosol but does not autostimulate via membrane receptors.

We conclude that enhanced efflux of DNR in blast progenitors may be related to remission induction failure in at least some of resistant AML patients.","['Maruyama, Y', 'Murohashi, I', 'Nara, N', 'Aoki, N']","['Maruyama Y', 'Murohashi I', 'Nara N', 'Aoki N']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1989.tb07716.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1989 Jul;72(3):357-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1989.tb07716.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was a linear relationship between the number of leukaemic cells and the optical density of the formazan produced. The assay demonstrated a variation in drug sensitivity between patients. The technique was reproducible and there was no significant difference in response between blast cells obtained from bone marrow or from peripheral blood.

In vitro, the DOX-resistant P388 cells used are about 300-fold more resistant than the sensitive cells. Resistant cells were characterized by lower DOX accumulation, rapid drug efflux, significant decrease of DNA single and double strand breaks and rapid repair of the induced single strand breaks. DMDP, a calcium channel blocker, is an effective modulator of DOX resistance in P388 cells. This modulation was found to be highly dependent of the concentration of the modulators, optimal at the maximally moncytotoxic concentrations of 1-4 microM, and the duration of exposure to the modulator, optimal under conditions of continuous exposure to the modulator. Under the optimal conditions in the presence of the modulator, DMDP, both intracellular concentration and retention of DOX were restored in the resistant P388 cells to the value comparable to those found in DOX sensitive P388 cells. Even though DOX accumulation and retention were at a comparable level in both the sensitive and resistant cells in the presence of DMDP, the amount of DNA single strand breaks achieved in the resistant cells was only about 30% of the amount of damage observed in the sensitive cells. The data indicate that if P388/R cells were only exposed to DOX for about 2 h, the induced DNA single strand breaks were repaired rapidly within 8 h thereafter, while no significant repair was seen in the resistant cells exposed to DOX in combination with DMDP.

Using a 2-dimensional technique combining electrophoresis and IEF, its relation to the LDH 5 isoenzyme was demonstrated. From its heat-stability it is concluded that band B is composed of 4 M subunits. The activity of the basic band correlated with the number of CML blast cells and was absent in juvenile, band and segmented neutrophils. Our observations are compatible with a gradual loss of activity during myeloid differentiation.

Moreover, the decrease in ATP in cardiac myocytes was followed by release of the cytoplasmic enzyme lactic acid dehydrogenase and of adenine nucleotides after anthracycline treatment. At very low concentrations of anthracyclines, at which ATP and glutathione were not affected, the drugs induced complete cessation of the growth of L-1210 cells. Some structural alterations in the anthracycline molecule resulted in parallel changes in antitumor activity and in cardiotoxicity. But other structural alterations resulted in dissimilar changes in antitumor activity and cardiotoxicity.

Clinical trials have shown that HMBA can cause positive therapeutic responses in some cancer patients, but clinical efficacy may be limited, in part, by dose-related toxicity. Potential improvements in efficacy may be accomplished by changes in the chemical structure of inducing agents and by increasing the sensitivity of tumor cells to inducers of differentiation. We have previously described an approach to improving tumor cell responsiveness to inducing agents. Transformed cell lines that have acquired low levels of resistance to vincristine display a markedly increased sensitivity to HMBA. We now report on a series of hybrid polar/apolar compounds--some of which are as active as HMBA and several of which are significantly more active than HMBA in vitro--whose chemical structures make it likely that they have different pharmacokinetics. Vincristine-resistant murine erythroleukemia cells also are shown to have marked increased sensitivity to these hybrid polar/apolar compounds. Thus these findings suggest potentially useful strategies for the application of polar/apolar inducers of differentiation to the treatment of cancers. These studies also provide approaches to further understanding of the biological process of terminal differentiation.","['Marks, P A', 'Breslow, R', 'Rifkind, R A', 'Ngo, L', 'Singh, R']","['Marks PA', 'Breslow R', 'Rifkind RA', 'Ngo L', 'Singh R']","['DeWitt Wallace Research Laboratories, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31768/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Acetamides)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",PMC297838,1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.86.16.6358 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Aug;86(16):6358-62. doi: 10.1073/pnas.86.16.6358.,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, BH4 has been shown to be synthesized by cells that do not contain any hydroxylase activity, suggesting that it may have still undiscovered functions. Our finding of much higher levels of BH4 and GTP cyclohydrolase, the first enzyme of de novo BH4 biosynthesis, in rat reticulocytes compared to mature erythrocytes raised the possibility that BH4 might play a role in erythrocyte maturation. We have now demonstrated, by using murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells as a model for erythrogenesis, that BH4 synthesis is required for proliferation of these cells. Inhibition of BH4 biosynthesis in rapidly dividing MEL cells with N-acetylserotonin, a potent inhibitor of sepiapterin reductase, the terminal enzyme in the BH4 biosynthetic pathway, results in inhibition of DNA synthesis and mitogenesis without induction of hemoglobin synthesis. The inhibition of DNA synthesis is reversed by repletion of cellular BH4 levels with sepiapterin, a pterin that is readily taken up by the cells and converted to BH4 by the sequential reductions of sepiapterin reductase and dihydrofolate reductase. Treatment of MEL cells with hexamethylene bisacetamide, an inducer of differentiation, results in a decrease in BH4 synthesis accompanied by a cessation of growth and concomitant hemoglobin synthesis. The inhibition of proliferation induced by hexamethylene bisacetamide can be reversed by maintaining high intracellular levels of BH4, which also decreases the amount of hemoglobin. The mechanism of the BH4 effect has not yet been elucidated, but it appears as though BH4 synthesis is more intimately linked with cell proliferation than with the differentiation process.","['Tanaka, K', 'Kaufman, S', 'Milstien, S']","['Tanaka K', 'Kaufman S', 'Milstien S']","['Laboratory of Neurochemistry, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Acetamides)', '22150-76-1 (Biopterin)', 'EC 3.5.4.16 (GTP Cyclohydrolase)', 'EGX657432I (sapropterin)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Biopterin/*analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis/blood/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Cell Division', 'Cell Line', '*DNA Replication', 'GTP Cyclohydrolase/blood', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",PMC297731,1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.86.15.5864 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Aug;86(15):5864-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.86.15.5864.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Granulocytic fragments were not identified on the blood smears of several patients with leukemoid reactions without erythroblastosis. Although the precise etiology of these fragments is unclear, we believe their recognition is important because all patients died within 32 hours after granulocytic fragments were identified. Furthermore, these fragments can falsely elevate the platelet count. Although myeloid fragments have previously been noted in leukemia and lymphoma, this is the first report of their association with conditions unrelated to hematologic neoplasms. These fragments can easily be recognized by careful examination of the blood smear and represent a newly recognized aspect of the septic shock syndrome.","['Krauss, J S', 'Dover, R K', 'Khankhanian, N K', 'Tom, G D']","['Krauss JS', 'Dover RK', 'Khankhanian NK', 'Tom GD']","['Department of Pathology, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta 30912.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,,IM,"['Anemia, Myelophthisic/complications/*pathology', 'Bacterial Infections/complications/*pathology', 'Child', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*ultrastructure', 'Erythrocytes, Abnormal/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Junctions/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/*ultrastructure']",,1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mod Pathol. 1989 Jul;2(4):301-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was determined by the cells' ability to lyse both the NK-sensitive YAC-1 lymphoma and the NC-sensitive WEHI-164 fibrosarcoma cell lines in a 4- and 18-hour 51Cr release assay, respectively. Cell-free supernatant from NKB61A2 cells grown in culture for 48 h had substantial lytic activity against WEHI-164. The mouse mast cell line PT18-A17 and the rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3, which both express NC activity, also produced a soluble factor during culture which lysed WEHI-164 cells. This activity was increased in the basophilic/mast cells by crossbridging the surface IgE receptors. Similar results were obtained by triggering the basophilic NC cells with the calcium ionophore ionomycin and the tumor promoter phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). Such triggering of NKB61A2 cells, however, did not significantly increase their NC activity. Interestingly, both ionomycin and PMA had an inhibitory effect on the NK activity of NKB61A2. Recently it has been found that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a major mediator of NC activity. To determine if the soluble factor responsible for the NC activity of the NK clone was related to TNF, a rabbit polyclonal antiserum to mouse TNF was tested against the cell-free culture medium of NKB61A2, PT18-A17, RBL-2H3 and murine recombinant TNF (Mu-rTNF).

A significant increase in mutant frequency for both markers was observed at the higher (10(-4) and 10(-3) M) thymidine treatments. Measurements of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pool sizes in the cells revealed a dramatic elevation of the deoxythymidine triphosphate and deoxyguanosine triphosphate pools, an increase in the deoxyadenosine triphosphate pool and an almost complete disappearance of the deoxycytidine triphosphate pool at the higher thymidine treatments. This complemented the mutagenesis data. These results support the view that increases in mutant frequency may take place following perturbations in DNA precursor pools through a resultant decrease in the fidelity of DNA synthesis. Measurements of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools were also carried out on clone 707 Friend cells and a thymidine kinase-deficient subclone, 707 BUF. The thymidine kinase-deficient subclone had significantly reduced deoxythymidine triphosphate and deoxyguanosine triphosphate pools relative to those observed in-clone 707 cells. The previously observed mutagen hypersensitivity in thymidine kinase-deficient Friend cells may result through pool imbalance rendering DNA excision repair error prone.","['Wilkinson, Y A', 'McKenna, P G']","['Wilkinson YA', 'McKenna PG']","['Biomedical Sciences Research Centre, University of Ulster, Coleraine, Northern Ireland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Mutagens)', '452-06-2 (2-Aminopurine)', '49P95BAU4Z (2,6-diaminopurine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['2-Aminopurine/analogs & derivatives', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', '*Mutagens', '*Mutation', 'Thioguanine', 'Thymidine/*toxicity']",,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(89)90130-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(89)90130-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(7):615-20. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90130-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Time course studies showed that these changes of actin levels were nearly coincident with the development of macrophage characteristics, including adhesiveness, positive reactivity against OKM-1 antibody and elevated lysozyme activity. When exposed to 5 nM TPA, these different properties of differentiation were detectable as early as 12 h after TPA treatment and reached a maximum by 24 h. Phosphorylation of 17 K and 27 K proteins, induced by TPA, occurred early (within 30 min) during TPA-induced differentiation. On the other hand, HL-60R cells, which are resistant to TPA in terms of the development of adhesiveness and differentiation, showed no change in both G- and F-actin levels, after the TPA treatment. TPA did not induce phosphorylation of these proteins in the HL-60R cells. In the presence of the protein kinase inhibitors, 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (H-7, 20 microM) and staurosporine (10 nM), the increase in actin levels induced by TPA was inhibited as well as other later evidence of differentiation.

A statistically significant sex difference in 4-year survival among cases diagnosed in 1979-80 was related to an unusually high survival rate (i.e. 100%) in females and the occurrence of two male DS cases.

Cells from normal bone marrow, from an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line or from a neuroblastoma cell line, were labeled with the fluorochrome Hoechst 33342 and incubated with microbeads by rotation at 4 degrees C. Following this incubation, the microbeads with all attached cells were collected using an externally applied magnetic field and visualized by microscopic examination under ultraviolet illumination. The incubation variables included the protein content of the medium, and the period of rotation. Normal bone marrow was found to adhere sparingly to the microbeads; less than 1.0% of the total nucleated cell population was recovered with the beads, whereas greater than 5% of the ALL cells and greater than 30% of the neuroblastoma cells were found to bind non-specifically to the microspheres. Neither changes in the protein concentration of the medium or in the incubation period significantly altered the non-specific binding of the cell types examined. It is thus apparent that the use of these microspheres for positive selection of cells, such as the collection of hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation, would be compromised by a sizeable non-specific interaction. Modification of the surface of the microspheres to substantially reduce this interaction will be necessary before efforts at positive selection using the magnetic microspheres can be fruitful.","['Janssen, W E', 'Rios, A M']","['Janssen WE', 'Rios AM']","['University of Florida, Department of Pediatrics, Gainesville 32610.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Polystyrenes)']",IM,"['Antibodies/immunology', 'Blood Proteins/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Magnetics', '*Microspheres', 'Polystyrenes', 'Time Factors']",,1989/07/26 00:00,1989/07/26 00:01,['1989/07/26 00:00'],"['1989/07/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/26 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-1759(89)90173-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(89)90173-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1989 Jul 26;121(2):289-94. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(89)90173-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of measles virions produced by LL2 cells showed a polypeptide pattern typical of measles virus. As well, measles virus-infected LL2 cells, like infected Vero cells, were found to secrete large amounts of virus hemagglutinin, but not other virus proteins.

Analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence and the corresponding amino acid sequence did not reveal significant homology to any previously described sequences.

However, the BCNU-resistant strain showed slightly lower sensitivity against DAG, which could be overcome by an increase in drug dose of ca. 20%. The somewhat lower sensitivity was proportional to a slightly reduced DNA cross-linking formation induced by DAG in BCNU-resistant cells. The amount of DNA cross-links was determined by measurement of the 1,6-di(guaninyl)-galactitol content of DNA. The slight reduction in cross-links is not attributable to DNA repair but rather to other factors that seem to prevent the formation of DNA-drug adducts.

DDATHF has been shown to inhibit glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase, a folate-requiring enzyme that catalyzes the first of two one-carbon transfer reactions in the de novo purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway. Incubation of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells with 5 x 10(-8) to 10(-5) M DDATHF resulted in a marked inhibition of growth after 48 h, with a complete cessation of cellular replication by day 4. Cell cycle analyses of DDATHF-treated HL-60 cells demonstrated an initial block in early S phase by day 3 followed by an accumulation of cells in the G1 and G2 + M phases of the cell cycle. Inhibition of growth was accompanied by a concentration-dependent increase in the percentage of mature myeloid cells that expressed nitroblue tetrazolium positivity, and a small increase in nonspecific esterase activity. Induction of differentiation and inhibition of growth by DDATHF were completely prevented by hypoxanthine and 5(4)-amino-4(5)-imidazole carboxamide, suggesting that depletion of intracellular purine nucleotide pools has an important role in the biological effects of this inhibitor. This possibility was confirmed by the finding that DDATHF caused a pronounced reduction in intracellular GTP and ATP levels within 2 h, with maximum decreases being observed by 24 h, a time interval which preceded the inhibition of cellular proliferation by this agent. Pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphate levels were markedly increased under these conditions. The findings indicate the importance of purine nucleotides to both the inhibition of growth and the induction of differentiation of HL-60 leukemia cells by DDATHF.","['Sokoloski, J A', 'Beardsley, G P', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Sokoloski JA', 'Beardsley GP', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Purine Nucleotides)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '6P3AVY8A7Q (lometrexol)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.1.2.- (Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases)', 'EC 2.1.2.2 (Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)']",IM,"['Acyltransferases/metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases', 'Interphase/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase', 'Purine Nucleotides/biosynthesis', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Sep 1;49(17):4824-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes of both patients, however, yielded a negligible frequency of chromosome aberrations. Because of no notable history of clastogen exposure in these patients, the observed chromosome fragility is most probably spontaneous, which might be correlated with the patients' physiologic condition at examination, i.e., an unusually low level of folic acid or vitamin B12, both being involved in DNA synthesis.

CD15 was mainly expressed in M2 and M3 subtypes, and NHL-30.5 and CD34 antigens in AUL and M1 leukaemias. All patients were treated with the same intensive induction treatment. Staining by three antibodies had a prognostic value.

In multivariate analysis, expression of NHL-30.5 antigen, absence of CD15, and high LDH level were associated with poor survival.

From a large multicentre series of phenotyped ALL, we have identified a group of 23 non-T non-B ALL where blast cells were CD10 negative and CD19 positive. Class II antigens were present in 80% and C19 in 70%. Eight patients had successful karyotype analysis at diagnosis, and an additional patient at first relapse. Seven of these karyotypes showed a (4;11) (q21;q23) translocation. Most of the patients (70%) were young females, and they often presented with organomegaly. Six patients were less than 1 year old. The white cell count was over 100 x 10(9)/l in 48% of the cases. The FAB type was L2 in 56% of the patients. The most striking features were the poor response to therapy and survival. Six patients never attained complete remission and nine patients relapsed, most of them during the first year after diagnosis. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation was performed in three children, of whom two are still alive 2 years after diagnosis.

A report from the MRC CLL 1 trial. MRC Working Party on Leukaemia in Adults.",141-9,"We report the analysis of prognostic factors in a cohort of 660 patients entered in the first Medical Research Council trial in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) between 1978 and 1984. The majority (94%) of patients were aged 50 or over and the number of men (M) was almost twice that of women (F) with an M:F ratio of 1.8:1. The M:F ratio was lower, 1.5:1, in patients aged 70 or over. Stage A CLL was the most common, and stage C the least common, among women of all ages, in contrast to men for whom stage A only predominated in the older age group. As the majority of CLL patients are elderly we have examined the causes of death in great detail. 29% of deaths were unrelated to CLL, mainly other cancers (12%) and cardiovascular complications (16%). The majority of deaths in patients presenting with stages B and C were from CLL-related causes, whilst almost half of the deaths in patients presenting with stage A were not obviously related to CLL. Univariate analysis disclosed that the A, B, C staging system was the most important factor considered; stratified and multivariate analysis showed that age and response to treatment were the main prognostic factors after stage. Women always fared better than men and this was independent of stage and age. This and other features documented in the trial suggest a major biological difference between the sexes which has not been widely recognized. The significant influence of treatment response on patients' survival suggests that the search for better treatments in CLL may be rewarding. The improved median survival of stage C patients recorded in this trial, 41 months, compares favourably with previous reports and may have resulted from better treatment.","['Catovsky, D', 'Fooks, J', 'Richards, S']","['Catovsky D', 'Fooks J', 'Richards S']","['Academic Department of Haematology, Royal Marsden Hospital.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Sex Factors']",,1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1989.tb07674.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1989 Jun;72(2):141-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1989.tb07674.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In situ dihydrofolate reductase activity varied linearly with cell number. A comparison of the in situ activity revealed that a squamous cell carcinoma selected for methotrexate (MTX) resistant (SCC-15R) had 100 times greater dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) activity than L1210 leukemia. In agreement with this finding, the in situ DHFR activity in SCC-15R cells was 50-fold less sensitive to the inhibitory effects of MTX than the L1210 in situ DHFR activity (IC50 = 1.1 x 10(-5) M and 2.4 x 10.7(-7) M respectively).

A group of previously untreated cases of lymphoma with evaluable metaphases was examined for the association between cytogenetic abnormalities and clinical outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study consisted of 104 patients, from whom fresh tumor samples were obtained for cytogenetic tests. Because of the complexity of lymphoma karyotypes, the cases were divided into four patterns according to the type of abnormality of chromosome 17 or 7 present. Treatment of patients was given based on histologic grade and stage of disease. Response to treatment was evaluated according to previously described methods. RESULTS: Patients with true abnormalities of chromosome 17 or 7 (defined as those with either structural abnormalities of the short arm of these chromosomes or monosomy of these chromosomes with no associated unidentified markers) were observed to have an adverse prognosis. The overall response rate and tumor-related mortality were less favorable for patients with these cytogenetic abnormalities. By applying multivariate analysis, we found that this observation was independent of the effect of serum lactic dehydrogenase level, histologic grade, or tumor burden. CONCLUSION: True abnormalities of chromosome 17 or 7 in patients with lymphoma are associated with a poor response to chemotherapy, short time to treatment failure, and high tumor-related mortality rate. These findings raise the question of the potential involvement of some gene or oncogene, perhaps the p53 oncogene, which might impart a survival advantage to the malignant cells.","['Cabanillas, F', 'Pathak, S', 'Grant, G', 'Hagemeister, F B', 'McLaughlin, P', 'Swan, F', 'Rodriguez, M A', 'Trujillo, J', 'Cork, A', 'Butler, J J']","['Cabanillas F', 'Pathak S', 'Grant G', 'Hagemeister FB', 'McLaughlin P', 'Swan F', 'Rodriguez MA', 'Trujillo J', 'Cork A', 'Butler JJ', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*complications/mortality', 'Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",,1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9343(89)80692-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9343(89)80692-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1989 Aug;87(2):167-72. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9343(89)80692-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,

These 129 studies were carried out in 108 patients, including 40 with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), 24 with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM), 18 with polycythemia vera (PV), six with a myelodysplastic syndrome, five with acute leukemia, three with prostate or breast carcinoma, two each with aplastic anemia or Hodgkin's disease, and one each with idiopathic thrombocythemia, multiple myeloma, chronic renal failure, or treated hypopituitarism. Splenomegaly was present in 83% of the studies and hepatomegaly in 72%. Grade II-III myelofibrosis was demonstrated in 62% of the cases. Hepatic erythropoiesis was present in 77% of the studies (only 38% in PV), and marrow erythropoiesis was undetectable in 33%.

The aberrant cells in the CSF contained nuclei with simple indentations and responded well to the initial chemotherapy, while leukemic cells in the blood showed lobulated or convoluted nuclei and were resistant to treatment.

Flow cytometric (FCM) examination of surface common ALL antigen (CALLA) and DNA content of the lymphoblasts led to the identification of the primary hypodiploid DNA stemline (DI = 0.72), which corresponds to the small-sized blasts, and the secondary hyperdiploid DNA stemline (DI = 1.44), which corresponds to the large-sized blasts. Sequential bone marrow examinations with FCM and cytogenetics revealed the persistence of the primary hypodiploid clone during remission and their proliferation with chromosomal evolution at full relapse.

Six of them were prepared following a novel synthetic route starting from the L-amino acid alanine. Some physicochemical properties, viz. lipophilicity and water solubility, of selected derivatives were measured. The biological activity was tested in vitro in cell-free protein synthesis inhibition assays, in bacterial and tumor cell growth inhibition assays, and in the L1210 leukemia in vivo model in mice. Also for selected drugs the acute toxicity in mice was determined. Ribosomes from both an eukaryotic and a prokaryotic organism were used in the protein synthesis inhibition systems. A linear correlation between the lipophilicity parameters measured was observed. Water solubility and drug toxicity in mice were found to be linearly correlated with lipophilicity. All the derivatives studied are more lipophilic than 1. The deshydroxysparsomycin analogues (30-33) showed an interesting phenomenon: increase in hydrophobicity was accompanied by a considerable increase in water solubility. We found that an increase in hydrophobicity of the drug as a result of replacing the SMe group of 1 with larger alkylthio groups causes an increase in the biological activity of the drug. However, not only the hydrophobicity but also shape and size of the substituent are important; in the homologous series 1-9-10-11-12, 21-22-23-24, and 30-31-32-33, highest protein synthesis inhibitory and in vitro cytostatic activity is found with compounds 11, 23, and 32, respectively, and in comparison with the highly active n-butyl compound 10, the isomeric tert-butyl compound 13 is rather inactive. Polar substituents replacing the SMe group, i.e. Cl in 17 and 35, also render the molecule inactive. Substituting the bivalent sulfur atom for a methylene group decreases the drug's activity. This effect can be compensated for by increasing the length of the alkylsulfinyl side chain. The agreement between the results derived from cell-free and ""in vivo"" tests is good. The assays using ribosomes of bacterial and eukaryotic organisms give similar results although the latter seem to be more sensitive to changes in hydrophobicity of the drug. Our results confirm the presence of a hydrophobic region at the peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome; the interaction of sparsomycin with this region is more pronounced in the eukaryotic particles. The sparsomycin analogues 11, 23, and 30 show the highest antitumor activity against L1210 leukemia in mice, their median T/C values are 386, 330, and 216%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['van den Broek, L A', 'Lazaro, E', 'Zylicz, Z', 'Fennis, P J', 'Missler, F A', 'Lelieveld, P', 'Garzotto, M', 'Wagener, D J', 'Ballesta, J P', 'Ottenheijm, H C']","['van den Broek LA', 'Lazaro E', 'Zylicz Z', 'Fennis PJ', 'Missler FA', 'Lelieveld P', 'Garzotto M', 'Wagener DJ', 'Ballesta JP', 'Ottenheijm HC']","['Department of Organic Chemistry, University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '6C940P63E7 (Sparsomycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*analogs & derivatives/*chemical synthesis/toxicity', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/*chemical synthesis', 'Sparsomycin/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/toxicity', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00128a051 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1989 Aug;32(8):2002-15. doi: 10.1021/jm00128a051.,,,,,,,,,,,,

A splenectomy was performed 2 to 4 weeks after the onset of symptoms in each child, and the cut surface of the spleens showed multiple small abscesses. All operative cultures were negative. A histological examination confirmed Candida infection in two patients and Aspergillus in one. Necrotizing granulomas strongly suggestive of fungus were seen in the fourth child. The patients defervesced and appeared well within three days. Antifungal therapy was continued. One child remains in remission from acute lymphocytic leukemia; one continues on chemotherapy; and one has recurrent widespread tumor. The patient with Aspergillus died following a bone marrow transplantation 6 months after the splenectomy. He had disseminated aspergillosis. An immune-compromised patient with persistent unexplained fever should have a CT scan of the abdomen. The presence of multiple splenic lesions strongly suggests fungal disease.

The results obtained from these two techniques were generally compatible in terms of clonality and cell lineage. Only one case of B-cell lymphoma was not diagnosed by PT but showed gene rearrangement. For T-cell lymphoma, GT offers a more definitive diagnosis than does PT. Biclonality was demonstrated in one case of hairy cell leukemia by GT only. The rearranged band also offers a definitive clonal identification based on electrophoretic mobility. GT can detect a monoclonal population as small as 5% and can be performed on old or fresh specimens. PT requires 20% abnormal cells and a fresh specimen.

Increased lung cancer risk following HD has not frequently been clearly demonstrated before; that we were able to demonstrate such risk may be due to the completeness of follow-up over long periods that could be achieved in this study. Excess lung cancer risk was only noted in treatment regimens with radiotherapy (RT); also, all lung cancers arose in irradiation fields. Excess risk of leukemia was only found in treatment regimens involving chemotherapy (CT). For NHL, combined modality treatment was shown to be the most important risk factor.

DL812 cells were so invasive as to produce enlargement of spleens and lymph nodes but not local tumors when injected s.c., markedly sensitive to in vitro ACNU exposure and moderately immunogenic. The invasion process of DL812 cells differed with the status of host immunity. Advanced DL812 leukemias were macroscopically completely cured with normalization of spleen and lymph node sizes 3-7 days after an i.p. injection of 0.5 mg ACNU, but more ACNU-resistant leukemias with splenomegaly and enlarged lymph nodes recurred thereafter. Recurring DL812 cells were approximately four times more resistant to in vitro ACNU exposure but maintained similar immunogenicity as compared to the original ones. Permanent cures of advanced leukemias were achieved by ACNU treatment plus subsequent adoptive transfer of immune splenocytes in 15% of diseased mice.

Purification, amino acid sequence, and biological properties.",13289-97,"The venoms of the Naja species are known to be cytotoxic. This toxicity has been attributed to the presence of small nonenzymatic polypeptides of 60 amino acid residues, designated as cardiotoxins or cytotoxins. We investigated the cytotoxic potency of Naja nigricollis venom fractions and isolated another type of cytotoxic component which is even more potent than cardiotoxins. This cytotoxic compound, which was designated as nigexine, was purified to homogeneity and its amino acid sequence was determined. Nigexine is a basic phospholipase A2 consisting of a single chain of 118 amino acids. A detailed investigation of the cytotoxic effects on epithelial FL cells, C-13T neuroblastoma cells, and promyelocytic leukemia HL 60 cells revealed that nigexine not only altered cell viability but also prevented cell proliferation. This is a property that was specific to nigexine since other phospholipases A2 from various sources had no detectable cytotoxic activity. The cytotoxic activity of nigexine was not dependent on the presence of divalent cations, unlike its enzymatic activity. In particular, the cytotoxic activity of nigexine was identical in the presence or absence of either 2 mM Ca2+ or Sr2+, or 6 mM EDTA. We also present evidence based on chemical modifications that cytotoxic activity was not correlated with enzymatic activity. Thus, modification with parabromophenacyl bromide totally abolished the enzymatic activity of nigexine, which nevertheless retained 6-20% of the cytotoxicity of native nigexine. Conversely, treatment with cyanogen bromide gave a compound that retained 7% of the enzymatic activity of the parent molecule but was devoid of detectable cytotoxicity.","['Chwetzoff, S', 'Tsunasawa, S', 'Sakiyama, F', 'Menez, A']","['Chwetzoff S', 'Tsunasawa S', 'Sakiyama F', 'Menez A']","[""Service de Biochimie, Centre d'Etudes Nucleares de Saclay, Gif/Yvette, France.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Elapid Venoms)', '122933-26-0 (nigexine)', 'EC 3.1.- (Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytotoxins/*isolation & purification/toxicity', 'Elapid Venoms/*isolation & purification/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phospholipases/*isolation & purification', 'Phospholipases A/genetics/*isolation & purification/toxicity', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Snakes', 'Swine', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",,1989/08/05 00:00,1989/08/05 00:01,['1989/08/05 00:00'],"['1989/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)51627-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Aug 5;264(22):13289-97.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nuclei isolated from potentially active noninduced cells and transcriptionally active induced MEL cells were treated with DNase I at concentrations which did not digest the beta-globin gene, followed by repair using a typical nick translation reaction during which a cleavable biotinylated nucleotide analog, 5-[N-biotinamido)hexanoamido-ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionyl -3-aminoallyl]-2'- deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate (Bio-19-SS-dUTP), was inserted into DNA sequences. Following purification and digestion with EcoRI restriction endonuclease, biotinylated sequences were affinity isolated by sequential binding to streptavidin and biotincellulose. The streptavidin/biotin-cellulose complex bound up to 80% of the nick-translated DNA, which comprised a small percentage of the total nuclear DNA. Cleavage of the disulfide bond in the linker arm of the biotinylated nucleotide resulted in elution of virtually all of the affinity isolated sequences. Hybridization analysis of this fraction of DNA revealed up to a 16-fold enrichment for the active beta-globin gene, as compared with DNA which did not bind to the biotincellulose.

This differentiation process is marked by the onset of globin mRNA and hemoglobin synthesis. In rabbit reticulocytes, globin synthesis is regulated by a hemin-controlled translational inhibitor (HCI) which acts via phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2). From both uninduced and induced MEL cells, hemin-controlled eIF-2 alpha kinases have been partially purified. They resemble HCI with respect to their chromatographic behaviour and their sensitivity towards physiological concentrations of hemin (5-10 microM). Further purification on phosphocellulose, however, reveals that the eIF-2 alpha kinase from uninduced MEL cells is chromatographically distinct from HCI, whilst the eIF-2 alpha kinase activity from induced MEL cells represents a mixture of the former and the HCI-type eIF-2 alpha kinase. The latter inhibits protein synthesis in a fractionated system from rabbit reticulocytes which is free of, but sensitive to, HCI, whereas the eIF-2 alpha kinase from uninduced MEL cells does not show any inhibitory activity. This observation is supported by the finding that induced MEL cells respond in vivo to iron depletion with a shut-off of protein synthesis (as do rabbit reticulocytes), whilst uninduced MEL cells do not.","['Sarre, T F', 'Hermann, M', 'Bader, M']","['Sarre TF', 'Hermann M', 'Bader M']","['Institut fur Biologie III, Universitat Freiburg im Breisgau, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Globins/biosynthesis', 'Heme/*analogs & derivatives', 'Hemin/*pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Protein Kinases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rabbits', 'Reticulocytes/metabolism', 'eIF-2 Kinase']",,1989/07/15 00:00,1989/07/15 00:01,['1989/07/15 00:00'],"['1989/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb14905.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1989 Jul 15;183(1):137-43. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb14905.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was hypothesized that UV dimers and cis-DDP adducts, when present simultaneously, might compete for a common repair system. Colony survival assays were performed in HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells exposed either to cis-DDP alone or to cis-DDP immediately followed by UV exposure. Progressively greater cytotoxic synergy with both increasing UV dose and cis-DDP dose was observed, to a point of saturation beyond which further toxicity was purely additive. Alkaline elution analyses for DNA interstrand crosslinking were performed 6 h after exposure. An approximate doubling in crosslink frequency, relative to cis-DDP alone, was found in cells exposed to cis-DDP plus UV (P = 0.002). Since cis-DDP produces both inter- and intrastrand DNA crosslinks similar studies were performed with trans-DDP, which is incapable of producing intrastrand crosslinks, but does produce interstrand crosslinks. Cytotoxic synergy and increased interstrand crosslinking again resulted from the addition of UV exposure, but not to the same extent as seen with cis-DDP.

The level of intracellular Ara-C accumulation and Ara-CTP formation was far more important in Reh cells than in myeloid cell lines but was not closely related to deoxycytidine kinase activity or to deoxycytidine triphosphate pool size. The level of Ara-C incorporated into DNA was similar in the three cell lines. Ara-CTP formation correlated better with the cytotoxicity to clonogenic cells than did Ara-C incorporation into DNA. DNA polymerase alpha was moderately inhibited to various degrees, depending on the cell line; this moderate inhibition does not seem sufficient to explain the inhibition of DNA synthesis. The activity of DNA ligase, the enzyme joining the Okazaki fragments, which was not detected in Reh cells, was strongly inhibited by Ara-C in HL60 and to a lesser degree, in K562 cells. The inhibition of DNA ligase probably also contributes to the inhibition of DNA synthesis and, thus, to the cytotoxic effect of Ara-C and may explain the smaller size of DNA fragments observed following Ara-C treatment.

The presence of amino sugars such as D-mannosamine, D-galactosamine, and D-glucosamine [6-25 mM (in the case of D-mannosamine, 1.5-12.5 mM)] in a 4-hr chromium-51 (Cr) release assay significantly inhibited NK activity of large granular lymphocytes (LGL) without affecting effector cell viability or spontaneous release from target cells. Sugars with acetylated amino residues (N-acetyl-D-mannosamine, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) showed much smaller NK inhibition. Among the amino sugars tested, D-mannosamine was the strongest suppressor. When either LGL or K562 cells were pretreated with amino sugars and used in the 4-hr 51Cr release assay, only the pretreatment of effector cells resulted in the reduction of NK activity. The binding capacity of LGL to K562 cells, determined by a conjugate assay, was not reduced by the amino sugars enough to explain the strong inhibition of NK activity by these amino sugars, although some inhibitory effect on the binding of LGL to K562 cells was observed in some cases. In contrast, the polarization of the effector cell cytoskeleton, one of the energy-dependent steps, was significantly impaired. The cellular ATP level of LGL was also significantly reduced and the reduction of cellular ATP correlated well with the degree of the inhibition of NK cytotoxicity. These results suggest that the suppression of NK activity by amino sugars is due to the reduction of the ATP-based energy supply of the effector cells and that amino sugars, especially D-mannosamine, should be recognized as potent suppressors of natural cell-mediated immunity.","['Yagita, M', 'Nakajima, M', 'Saksela, E']","['Yagita M', 'Nakajima M', 'Saksela E']","['Department of Pathology, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],['R01-CA41524/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Amino Sugars)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/analysis', 'Amino Sugars/*pharmacology', 'Cytoskeleton/physiology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/analysis/*drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(89)90150-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(89)90150-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1989 Aug;122(1):83-95. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(89)90150-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The implication of lyl-1 in cellular transformation suggests that other proteins containing similar DNA binding motifs may also be involved with neoplastic transformation in various cellular lineages.","['Mellentin, J D', 'Smith, S D', 'Cleary, M L']","['Mellentin JD', 'Smith SD', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical Center, California 94305.']",['eng'],"['5T32 CA09302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,1989/07/14 00:00,1989/07/14 00:01,['1989/07/14 00:00'],"['1989/07/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/14 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(89)90404-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(89)90404-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1989 Jul 14;58(1):77-83. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(89)90404-2.,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/M22637', 'GENBANK/M22638']",,,

Its potential antitumor activity stimulated the search for a synthetic production method and the development of new derivatives. In a recent screening investigation, three Sm analogues appeared to be more active and considerably less toxic than the parent drug. Sparsomycins became especially interesting when it was shown that Sm potentiates the antitumor activity of cisplatin. In the present study Sm and its three promising analogues: deshydroxy-Sm (dSm), ethyl-deshydroxy-Sm (EdSm) and n-pentyl-Sm (PSm) were studied for their cisplatin potentiating effect. The experiments were performed on CD2F1 mice inoculated with 10(6) L1210 cells s.c. Sparsomycins were administered i.p. 3 h before cisplatin on days 1, 5 and 9. Three of the drugs, Sm, dSm and PSm, showed no potentiating effect in this tumor model. At a dose of 10 mg/kg, EdSm potentiated cisplatin antitumor activity 2.8 times (P less than 0.01) without an increase in weight loss.

An interim analysis.,92-5,"Symptomatic immune thrombocytopenia is a life-threatening situation which is conventionally treated in the adult with prednisone, although subsequent splenectomy is frequently unavoidable. Recently, high-dose intravenous gamma-globulin has been reported to be an effective alternative option, particularly in children. To determine the role of this agent in adults a controlled prospective trial has been undertaken. Previously untreated patients with immune thrombocytopenia were randomised to compare oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day: Group 1: n = 13) to high-dose intravenous gamma-globulin (400 mg/kg on days 1 through 5: Group 2: n = 7), or a combination of both agents given on the same schedule (Group 3: n = 12). The time from diagnosis to commencement of treatment, initial platelet counts, age and sex were comparable in the three groups. At this interim analysis there has been no mortality, but one patient has suffered a cerebrovascular accident. Objective response, defined as a platelet count greater than 50 x 10(9)/l, was achieved in a median of 5, 5 and 3 days, whereas the time taken to reach peak counts were 9, 5 and 7 days, respectively. The relapse rates, percentage of patients subsequently requiring splenectomy for control of symptomatic bleeding and the postoperative course was comparable between the three groups. These data, although preliminary, re-emphasize differences between the paediatric and adult forms of immune thrombocytopenia and also suggest in the latter patients a need for caution before advocating replacement of prednisone by gammaglobulin as the primary form of treatment.","['Jacobs, P', 'Wood, L']","['Jacobs P', 'Wood L']","['University of Cape Town Leukemia Centre, South Africa.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,['VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*therapy', 'Humans', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Prednisone/*therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic/*therapy']",,1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00320256 [doi]'],ppublish,Blut. 1989 Jul;59(1):92-5. doi: 10.1007/BF00320256.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), where the molecular detection of the Ph1 chromosome is relatively straightforward using conventional Southern hybridization analysis, the detection of the Ph1 chromosome in ALL is complicated by the existence of several molecular subtypes, and the fact that translocation breakpoints are dispersed over a large genomic area. To circumvent these difficulties, we investigated pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to determine if this method could be used directly on clinical samples to detect the Ph1 chromosome in ALL. We report that, in a study of seven patients with Ph1-positive ALL, we could easily detect the Ph1 using only a single PFGE analysis, regardless of the Ph1 subtype, and we could confirm that the translocations occur either within or very near the BCR gene in all seven. We conclude that PFGE is a useful technique for the detection of the Ph1 in ALL, which ultimately may find wide applicability in the detection of other chromosomal abnormalities in other malignancies.","['Hooberman, A L', 'Rubin, C M', 'Barton, K P', 'Westbrook, C A']","['Hooberman AL', 'Rubin CM', 'Barton KP', 'Westbrook CA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL 60637.']",['eng'],"['CA 19266/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 44700-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (DNA Probes)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'DNA Probes', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogenes', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,1989/08/15 00:00,1989/08/15 00:01,['1989/08/15 00:00'],"['1989/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75434-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Aug 15;74(3):1101-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because most patients do not have a suitable marrow donor, the introduction of a normal ADA gene into the patient's marrow cells is a potentially useful alternative therapy. To identify vectors that provide optimal gene expression in human hematopoietic cells, we investigated retroviral vectors containing the ADA gene under the transcriptional control of the promoter/enhancers of Moloney murine leukemia virus, the simian virus 40 early region, the cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene, the lymphotropic papovavirus, and the human beta-globin gene. ADA expression from these vectors was monitored in the ADA- human histiocytic lymphoma cell line DHL-9, and in the multipotential chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562. ADA expression in infected K562 cells was also measured after induction of megakaryoblastic differentiation by phorbol ester, and after induction of erythroid differentiation by sodium n-butyrate or hemin. In these hematopoietic cell lines, the vectors that contained ADA controlled by either the Moloney murine leukemia virus promoter (LASN) or the cytomegalovirus promoter (LNCA) expressed ADA at much higher levels than the other vectors tested. Furthermore, in K562 cells infected with LASN and LNCA vectors, induction of terminal differentiation resulted in the same or higher level expression of ADA. These cell lines have permitted the evaluation of transduced gene expression in proliferating and differentiating hematopoietic cells that provide a model for bone marrow-targeted gene therapy.","['Hock, R A', 'Miller, A D', 'Osborne, W R']","['Hock RA', 'Miller AD', 'Osborne WR']","['Program in Molecular Medicine, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['CA01176/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Genes', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/genetics', 'Lymphoma/enzymology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology']",,1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85387-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Aug 1;74(2):876-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its pattern of expression during development is not fully defined, and its encoded protein has not yet been detected in vivo. The detection of theta globin messenger RNA (mRNA) in embryonic and fetal erythroid tissue but not in adults has suggested that theta is an embryonic globin gene. The present study further defines the pattern of theta globin gene expression. We use a modification of the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to assess the levels of theta globin gene expression during development. We confirm the presence of the theta globin mRNA in embryonic and fetal erythroid tissue, and, in addition, we find theta mRNA in the peripheral reticulocytes of normal adults. Furthermore, using the same analytic approach, we detect low but significant levels of the embryonic zeta and epsilon mRNAs in reticulocytes of normal adults. Both zeta and theta gene expression appears erythroid specific in that neither mRNA species is detected in RNA isolated from brain tissue, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or three nonerythroid cell lines (B-lymphocyte, T-lymphocyte, and hepatoma cell lines). The relative levels of zeta and theta gene expression were assayed during development by a coamplification technique. The results demonstrate the expected developmental regulation of zeta globin mRNA. In contrast, the level of theta globin mRNA fails to demonstrate the significant changes of the magnitude seen in other globin genes and remains low in embryonic, fetal, and adult life. The lack of zeta and epsilon globin proteins in normal adults using highly sensitive immunologic techniques, as reported by others, stands in contrast to these mRNA results and suggests a gap between mRNA and protein expression.","['Albitar, M', 'Peschle, C', 'Liebhaber, S A']","['Albitar M', 'Peschle C', 'Liebhaber SA']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Philadelphia, PA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Aging', 'Anemia, Sickle Cell/blood', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Fetal Blood/metabolism', 'Globins/blood/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood', 'Polycythemia Vera/blood', 'RNA, Messenger/isolation & purification/*physiology']",,1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85352-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Aug 1;74(2):629-37.,,,,,,,,,,,,

HL60 cells were shown to release to their growth medium a Tf-binding protein which could be immunoprecipitated by anti-Tf receptor monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) B3/25 and OKT9. Soluble Tf receptor was detected in the medium within one hour of replating of cells, and its release was inhibited at 4 degrees C. The affinity of Tf for the soluble receptor released by cells (kd = 2.3 x 10(-10) mol/L) was slightly lower than its affinity for the detergent-solubilized cellular receptor (kd = 1.2 x 10(-10) mol/L). 125I-Tf internalized and released by cells subsequently bound to Tf receptor released by the same cells, and soluble Tf receptor in the conditioned medium (CM) inhibited 125I-Tf binding to intact cells. The soluble Tf receptor isolated from the CM was smaller (78,000 daltons) than the cell surface receptor (94,000 daltons) when analyzed by gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Isolated cell membranes readily released soluble receptor; however, this release could be blocked by protease inhibitors. The soluble Tf receptor may represent the extracytoplasmic domain of the cellular Tf receptor released from the surface of HL60 cells through proteolytic cleavage by a membrane-based protease.","['Chitambar, C R', 'Zivkovic, Z']","['Chitambar CR', 'Zivkovic Z']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],['R01 CA41740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blood Physiological Phenomena', 'Carrier Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Culture Media', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Transferrin/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*metabolism']",,1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85348-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Aug 1;74(2):602-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have developed a psoralen photochemical system for decontamination of platelet concentrates in which platelets are treated with long wavelength ultraviolet radiation (UVA, 320-400 nm) in the presence of 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP). Bacteria, RNA viruses, and DNA viruses ranging in genome size from 1.2 x 10(6) daltons, encompassing the size range of human pathogens, were inoculated into platelet concentrates and subjected to treatment. This system inactivated 25 to 30 logs/h of bacteria Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus, 6 logs/h of bacteriophage fd, 0.9 log/h of bacteriophage R17 and 1.1 logs/h of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) in platelet concentrates maintained in standard storage bags. Platelet integrity and in vitro function before, immediately following photochemical treatment, and during prolonged storage after treatment, were evaluated by measuring: (1) extracellular pH; (2) platelet yields; (3) extracellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels; (4) platelet morphology; (5) platelet aggregation responsiveness; (6) thromboxane beta-2 (TXB-2) production; (7) dense body secretion; and (8) alpha granule secretion. These assays demonstrated that this photochemical inactivation system inactivated bacteria and viruses in platelet concentrates with minimal adverse effects on the in vitro function of platelets in comparison to untreated control concentrates maintained under current, standard blood bank conditions.","['Lin, L', 'Wiesehahn, G P', 'Morel, P A', 'Corash, L']","['Lin L', 'Wiesehahn GP', 'Morel PA', 'Corash L']","['Diamond Scientific Company, Des Moines.']",['eng'],['1R43HL39378/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '54397-85-2 (Thromboxane B2)', 'U4VJ29L7BQ (Methoxsalen)']",IM,"['Blood Platelets/physiology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Bacterial', 'DNA, Viral', 'Decontamination/methods', 'Humans', 'Methoxsalen/*pharmacology', 'Photochemistry', 'Platelet Aggregation', '*Platelet Transfusion', 'Thromboxane B2/biosynthesis', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Viruses/drug effects']",,1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77386-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Jul;74(1):517-25.,,,,,,,,,,,,
