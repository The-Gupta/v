METHODS: DN-Rac, DN-MEKK or DN-JNK were cotransfected with hsp90 beta CAT reporter plasmid beta 3.1 into Jurkat or LETPa-2 cells individually, the CAT mRNA expression was then determined quantitatively by competitive RT-PCR based system. Western blot was carried out to detect the expression level and phosphorylation of c-Jun in Jurkat and LETPa-2 cells that were transfected with DN-Rac, DN-MEKK or DN-JNK. By in vitro kinase activity assay and Western blot, the effect of geldnamycin (GA) on heat induced JNK activity were evaluated. RESULTS: In Jurkat cell transfected with DN-Rac, DN-MEKK or DN-JNK, heat shock induced relative CAT mRNA expression level was decreased to (72.8 +/- 5)%, (60 +/- 13.2)% and (47.7 +/- 12.1)% of the control respectively; while in LETPa-2 cell hsp90 beta 3.1 reporter gene expression was accordingly suppressed to (16.17 +/- 5.1)%, (50.2 +/- 8.7)% and (47.5 +/- 10)% of control.

The cell growth curves indicated that the over-expression of wild-type p53 gene significantly suppressed the growth of MEL, with G(0)-G(1) arrest and apoptosis shown by flow cytometric assays. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that the MEL-W had a more compact organization of the F-Actin cytoskeleton than MEL and MEL-M. Fluorescence polarization measurement indicated a higher membrane fluidity of MEL-W than the other two groups. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) showed changes in the composition and/or structure of membrane lipids in MEL-W, with decreases in secondary structures of proteins such as alpha-helix, turns and bends and random coil, in comparison to MEL and MEL-M. The osmotic fragility curves indicated that MEL-W was more fragile and micropipette experiments showed that they had increased elasticity and reduced deformability in comparison to MEL and MEL-M.

In whole-cell patch-clamp experiments current families evoked by 200-ms potential steps every 15 s from -70 mV to values from -120 to +100 mV revealed the functional expression of voltage-gated K+ channels. Pre-treatment of Jurkat T-lymphocytes for 2-3 h with 1 microM dexamethasone led to a significant decrease of voltage-gated K+ currents. Fura-2-fluorescence measurements showed that the readdition of Ca2+ to Ca(2+)-depleted cells led to a rapid increase of cytosolic Ca2+ activity. This increase of Ca2+ activity was blunted by both the K+ channel blocker margatoxin (10 nM) and 24 h pre-treatment with dexamethasone (1 microM).

This paper reports evidence that ceramides isolated from Sphingobacterium spiritivorum ATCC 33861 induce endonucleolytic DNA cleavage in human myeloid leukaemia HL-60 cells in vitro, which is the primary characteristic biochemical marker for apoptosis or programmed cell death. Ceramides and SPLs also induced DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation, followed by changes in morphology, such as alterations in the size of nuclei and cells, and cell cycle shortening. Apoptotic activity correlated with the ceramide structure. Ceramide with a 2-hydroxy fatty acid showed stronger apoptotic activity than ceramide with a non-hydroxy fatty acid. Furthermore, the major five SPLs (ceramide phosphorylethanolamine-1 and -2, ceramide phosphorylinositol-1 and -2, and ceramide phosphorylmannose-1) showed apoptosis-inducing activity in HL-60 cells, indicating that the ceramide moiety of the SPLs plays a crucial role as the intracellular second messenger but that their hydrophilicity is less important in this regard. The hydrophilic part of SPLs may play a role in other cellular response systems. The involvement of Fas antigen was implicated in the apoptotic event since Fas antigen expression was observed after 3 or 4 h stimulation of HL-60 cells with bacterial ceramides. However, a time-course study for caspase-3 activation indicated maximal activity at 1 h after stimulation with bacterial ceramides, suggesting that two (or possibly more) mechanisms of signal transduction, Fas-dependent and Fas-independent, may be involved. Fas antigen expression and caspase-3 activation by five kinds of SPLs were observed after 3 or 4 h. These results indicate that there is a difference in the response of HL-60 cells to bacterial ceramides and SPLs.","['Minamino, Miki', 'Sakaguchi, Ikuyo', 'Naka, Takashi', 'Ikeda, Norikazu', 'Kato, Yoshiko', 'Tomiyasu, Ikuko', 'Yano, Ikuya', 'Kobayashi, Kazuo']","['Minamino M', 'Sakaguchi I', 'Naka T', 'Ikeda N', 'Kato Y', 'Tomiyasu I', 'Yano I', 'Kobayashi K']","['Institute of Cosmetic Sciences, Club Cosmetics Co.

Here we demonstrate that MEDII, but not LIF, is able to support the maintenance and proliferation in culture of pluripotent cells derived from primitive ectoderm formed in vitro or during embryonic development. This distinguishes primitive ectoderm and inner cell mass (ICM) on the basis of cytokine responsiveness and validates the biological activity proposed for factors within MEDII in primitive ectoderm establishment and maintenance.

METHODS: A 15-mer PNA and the same sequence of ASODN, complementary to the 5' end of the AUG initiator codon-containing region of mdr1 messenger RNA (MDR1-PNA, MDR1-ASODN), were designed and synthesized. Proliferation and sensitivity to adriamycin of K562/ADM cells treated with MDR1-PNA- and MDR1-ASODN were analyzed with a MTT colorimetric assay. Apoptotic morphologies, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression, intracellular adriamycin accumulation, and cell cycle were measured. RESULTS: MDR1-PNA 1 to 10 micromol/L and MDR1-ASODN 2 to 20 micromol/L alone had no inhibitory effects on the proliferation of K562/ADM cells, but significantly inhibited the growth of K562/ADM cells cultured in adriamycin-containing medium. After treatment with MDR1-PNA and MDR1-ASODN, intracellular adriamycin accumulation in K562/ADM cells increased greatly and P-gp synthesis was strikingly reduced. The resistance to adriamycin of the drug-resistant cells was partly reversed and the cells were induced to apoptosis by adriamycin. The reversal efficacy of MDR1-PNA was 3.1-fold higher than that of the same sequence of MDR-ASODN, but neither MDR1-PNA nor MDR1-ASODN could completely block the mdr1/P-gp expression. CONCLUSION: Sequence-special PNA targeted to mdr1 gene more effectively than the same sequence of MDR1-ASODN inhibited the expression of P-glycoprotein to overcome the drug-resistance.","['Wei, Hu-Lai', 'Wu, Yong-Jie', 'Jing, Tao', 'Bai, De-Cheng', 'Ma, Lan-Fang']","['Wei HL', 'Wu YJ', 'Jing T', 'Bai DC', 'Ma LF']","['Laboratory Center for Medical Science, Lanzhou Medical College, Lanzhou 730000, China. weihl@public.lz.gs.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Peptide Nucleic Acids)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Peptide Nucleic Acids/*pharmacology']",2003/08/09 05:00,2004/03/17 05:00,['2003/08/09 05:00'],"['2003/08/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/09 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2003 Aug;24(8):805-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone (DEX), induce apoptosis in Nb2-11 cells; the addition of PRL abrogates the cytolytic actions of DEX in this model, presumably because of increased expression of survival genes. In the present study, we investigated whether inhibition of DEX-induced apoptosis by PRL in Nb2-T cells was accompanied by altered expression of Bcl-2 family members, mcl-1, bad or bcl-x(L) determined by Northern and immunoblot analysis. The results indicated that a 0.9 kb bcl-x(L) transcript was rapidly induced by PRL. It reached maximal levels within 2 to 4 h (>20-fold) before declining toward basal values. Similar results were obtained in primary cultures of mouse thymocytes exposed to DEX in combination with PRL. In addition to increasing its mRNA expression, PRL also increased Bcl-xL protein levels by 6 h. Moreover, the effect of PRL to increase bcl-x(L) appeared to reflect direct and indirect mechanisms, since it was attenuated by the inhibition of protein synthesis. Results from other experiments suggest that PRL signaling to bcl-x(L) expression was independent of the Jak2/Stat pathway but appeared to require activation of a Src tyrosine kinase. In contrast, while a 1.1 kb mcl-1 transcript was detected in proliferating and quiescent cells, PRL did not alter its expression at either mRNA or protein levels. Moreover, neither bad mRNA nor its protein product were detectable under any of the experimental conditions evaluated. We have concluded that bad and mcl-1 are unlikely candidates for apoptosis regulatory genes modulated by PRL. However, the kinetic pattern of PRL-provoked bcl-x(L) expression is consistent with its playing a role as an apoptosis suppressor in Nb2-T cells and primary cultures of mouse thymocytes exposed to glucocorticoids.","['Kochendoerfer, S K', 'Krishnan, N', 'Buckley, D J', 'Buckley, A R']","['Kochendoerfer SK', 'Krishnan N', 'Buckley DJ', 'Buckley AR']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, North Dakota, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Endocrinol,The Journal of endocrinology,0375363,"['0 (Bad protein, mouse)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Blotting, Northern/methods', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Electroporation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Immunoblotting/methods', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Prolactin/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",2003/08/09 05:00,2003/10/08 05:00,['2003/08/09 05:00'],"['2003/08/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/09 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Endocrinol. 2003 Aug;178(2):265-73. doi: 10.1677/joe.0.1780265.,,['10.1677/joe.0.1780265 [doi]'],,,['DK53452/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An adjuvant, either aluminium phosphate or aluminium hydroxide, is added to the vaccines, which are sometimes preserved with thiomersal. In placebo-controlled studies, common side effects other than local reactions were reported no more frequently among vaccine recipients than among individuals receiving a placebo. A number of controversial adverse events have, however, been purported to be associated with HBVs, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), diabetes, demyelinating diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis [MS]), chronic fatigue syndrome, and more recently, lymphoblastic leukaemia. In addition, the safety of the thiomersal and aluminium contained in the vaccine has also been under close scrutiny. These issues have been reviewed by a number of country-specific or international independent review committees such as that of the US Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS). Upon review of the scientific evidence, none of the serious allegations have so far been confirmed. On the contrary, scientific evidence has accumulated to disprove many of the allegations. In particular, the IOM committee has concluded that the evidence favoured rejection of a causal relationship between HBV administered to adults and incident MS or MS relapse. Whilst it is important to continue monitoring some of the safety issues, there is no evidence to suggest that the WHO should consider altering its recommendation that all countries should have universal infant and/or adolescent immunisation programmes. The risks of hepatitis B vaccination are only theoretical in comparison with clear benefits in terms of cirrhosis and cancer prevention, and the HBV remains one with an excellent safety profile.","['Duclos, Philippe']",['Duclos P'],"['Department of Vaccines and Biologicals, Health Technology and Pharmaceuticals, World Health Organization, Geneva, 20 Avenue Appia, CH-1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland. duclosp@who.int']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Drug Saf,Expert opinion on drug safety,101163027,['0 (Hepatitis B Vaccines)'],IM,"['Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Hepatitis B/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Hepatitis B Vaccines/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Vaccination/*adverse effects']",2003/08/09 05:00,2003/10/09 05:00,['2003/08/09 05:00'],"['2003/08/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/09 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Saf. 2003 May;2(3):225-31. doi: 10.1517/14740338.2.3.225.,,['10.1517/14740338.2.3.225 [doi]'],,,,56,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found EM and detection of DNA ladder pattern by agarose gel electrophoresis to b specific, but lacking in sensitivity. The combination of autoradiography and gel electrophoresis gave an increase in sensitivity of at least 50 fold although, of all the methods, the TdT assay was shown to be most sensitive. The four methods for quantifying apoptosis-EM, FCA, TUNEL and TdT assay proved to be reliable and gave statistically similar results on apoptotic lymphocytes.

METHODS: MEL cells were transfected with the recombinant construct muLCRAgammapsibetadeltabeta and the stable transformants were cultured in the medium with different concentrations of isobutyramide. The experimental mice and rabbit were injected with different doses of isobutyramide. The globin mRNAs were analyzed by RNase protection assay. The hematological toxicity and electrolyte toxicity of the drug were tested. RESULTS: An inducible and dose-dependent expression of the human gamma-, beta- and mouse alpha-globin gene was observed in the transfected MEL cells. The induction of the human gamma-globin gene is significant stronger than that of the beta-globin gene. With 2.5 approximately 5 mmol/L isobutyramide, the induction of the human gamma-globin gene is even more effective than that of mouse alpha-globin gene. After a 15-day injection under the doses of 500 approximately 900 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1), the level of the mouse embryonic epsilon(y)-globin mRNA could be significantly induced up to 3 approximately 4 fold of that of uninjected controls. The changes of hemoglobin(Hb), RBC, hematocrit(HCT), WBC, derived from mice injected with different doses of isobutyramide at the interval of 24 hours for 2 approximately 4 weeks, were generally within the normal range. In rabbits injected with isobutyramide in the same regiment for 2 weeks, the concentration of blood K+, Na+, Cl- and CO2 were all within normal range and serum ionic osmotic pressure remained stable as well. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that isobutyramide is a weak inducer of cell differentiation, but it can selectively activate transcription of human gamma-globin gene at a certain degree, and it can act on early stages of erythroid progenitor differentiation in adult mice and activate transcription of embryonic epsilon(y)-globin gene and have no hematological toxicity.

METHODS: Eleven AML patients were investigated by D-FISH with two-color break apart probe for MYH11 labeled directly by fluorescein isocyanate (FITC) and a Texas Red. The results were associated or compared with those of cell morphology, cytogenetics, single color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Four cases (M4Eo three cases, M2a one case) had inv(16), of which one had trisomy 22 in addition to inv(16), while the other seven cases had no inv(16), of which, five cases (M4Eo three cases, M4 two cases)had a normal karyotype, one (M2a) had 5p+ and trisomy 22, one (M4Eo) had a translocation t(9;22) on G-banded karyotypic analysis. All 11 cases of AML were positive for the rearrangement of inv(16) detected by D-FISH. The average positive cell rate for these 11 AML patients was 93.45% (range 86.6%-98.7%). Of them, four had a minimal deletion of 16p13 in addition to inv(16). The results of D-FISH coincided with those of RT-PCR or single color FISH. CONCLUSION: D-FISH is a powerful tool for the detection of inv(16) due to its sensitivity and specificity. For raising the detecting rate of inv(16), it is necessary to screen inv(16) rearrangement by D-FISH in all M4- and M2-AML cases or the cases with trisomy 22, no matter whether they are accompanied by bone marrow eosinophilia.","['Li, Ming', 'Xue, Yong-quan', 'Wu, Ya-fang', 'Pan, Jin-lan', 'Yao, Li']","['Li M', 'Xue YQ', 'Wu YF', 'Pan JL', 'Yao L']","['First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Haematology, Suzhou, Jiangsu, 215006 PR China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,9425197,,IM,"['*Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2003/08/07 05:00,2009/03/04 09:00,['2003/08/07 05:00'],"['2003/08/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2003/08/07 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi. 2003 Aug;20(4):331-5.,,['940602089 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Group 1 (immediate access group) had 23 patients and group 2 (delayed access) had 74 patients. RESULTS: The incidence of infection was 22% in group 1 and 14% in group 2. The difference between these infection rates was not statistically significant. All infections occurred in patients with a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Of the patients in this study with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 33% in group 1 and 36% in group 2 developed infections.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of outcome for newly diagnosed children with AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was performed using data collected from CCG-2891. The authors identified 11 patients whose blasts carried t(10;11) reciprocal translocations or other complex rearrangements involving 10p and 11q among 470 eligible patients entered with acceptable, centrally reviewed cytogenetics. A bone marrow specimen was used for each case of cytogenetic analysis in which 20 banded (either G-banded or Q-banded) metaphases were completed on each subject. All 11 patients had characteristic monocytoid morphology (M4 or M5) and tended to be young (0.1-7.9 years; median 0.9 years). RESULTS: All 11 patients entered remission, but remissions tended to be short; 9 patients relapsed within 12 months (median 4 months). The relapse rate of 82% was significantly higher for this group of patients compared with 46% for the group at large. The relapse rate for this group of patients having t(10;11) reciprocal translocations or other complex rearrangements involving 10p and 11q was also significantly higher compared with subjects with other 11q23 chromosomal abnormalities. The CNS relapse rate of 55% was higher for this group of patients compared with 3% for all other patients in the study. The CNS relapse rate was higher for the subjects who had t(10;11) reciprocal translocations or other complex rearrangements involving 10p and 11q compared with subjects with all other chromosome 11 abnormalities. Three children survived, two in second remissions (4.7 and 6.3 years after relapse) and one in first remission (7.0 years after diagnosis). Survival and event-free survival for the patients with t(10;11) reciprocal translocations or other complex rearrangements involving 10p and 11q was 27 +/- 27% and 9 +/- 17% at 6 years, respectively, and was not statistically different from all other patients with cytogenetics. Similarly, the survival and event-free survival for the patients with t(10;11) translocations and other rearrangements of chromosomes 10 and 11 was 27 +/- 27% and 9 +/- 17% at 6 years, respectively, and was not statistically different from the 11q23 group of subjects.

TNF-alpha levels secreted from human leukemic mast cell line (HMC-1) after the treatment of PAR2 agonists were also measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The PAR2 and TNF-alpha proteins were more significantly detectable in UC tissues than in normal tissues. Furthermore, 65.2% of PAR2+ cells and 66.4% of TNF-alpha+ cells in UC tissues were tryptase-positive cells. In other words, 60.6% and 46.3% of tryptase-positive cells in UC tissues were PAR2+ cells and TNF-alpha+ cells, respectively.

In the case of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), understanding the relationship between the induction of DC differentiation and the expression of the BCR-ABL oncogene has direct relevance to CML biology as well as the development of new therapeutic approaches. We now report that direct activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by the phorbol ester PMA in the BCR-ABL(+) CML cell line K562 and primary CML blasts induced nonterminal differentiation into cells with typical DC morphology (cytoplasmic dendrites), characteristic surface markers (MHC class I, MHC class II, CD86, CD40), chemokine and transcription factor expression, and ability to stimulate T cell proliferation (equivalent to normal monocyte-derived DC). PKC-induced differentiation was associated with down-regulation of BCR-ABL mRNA expression, protein levels, and kinase activity. This down-regulation appeared to be signaled through the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Therefore, PKC-driven differentiation of CML blasts into DC-like cells suggests a potentially novel strategy to down-regulate BCR-ABL activity, yet raises the possibility that CML-derived DC vaccines will be less effective in presenting leukemia-specific Ags.","['Lindner, Inna', 'Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A', 'Ayala, Ernesto', 'Kolonias, Despina', 'Carlson, Louise M', 'Beazer-Barclay, Yasmin', 'Scherf, Uwe', 'Hnatyszyn, James H', 'Lee, Kelvin P']","['Lindner I', 'Kharfan-Dabaja MA', 'Ayala E', 'Kolonias D', 'Carlson LM', 'Beazer-Barclay Y', 'Scherf U', 'Hnatyszyn JH', 'Lee KP']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Calcium/metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Lineage/genetics/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Dendritic Cells/enzymology/*pathology', 'Down-Regulation/*genetics', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/immunology', '*Genes, abl/immunology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism/physiology', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",2003/08/07 05:00,2003/11/01 05:00,['2003/08/07 05:00'],"['2003/08/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/01 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/07 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2003 Aug 15;171(4):1780-91. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.171.4.1780.,,['10.4049/jimmunol.171.4.1780 [doi]'],,,"['CA85208/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The question of whether an absolute nonthreshold or a relative nonthreshold, i.e., a ""practical"" threshold specifically in the low-dose level, is present may not be answered even with the use of a prohibitively large number of wild-type mice. Could the excessive incidence of tumorigenesis in p53-deficient mice contribute to our understanding of the threshold vs nonthreshold issue in genotoxic carcinogenesis? This is considered because an exaggeration of tumorigenesis in p53-deficient mice is hypothesized to reduce or eliminate the range of threshold due to the p53-deficiency-mediated reduction of DNA repair and apoptosis. The present study of chemical leukemogenesis in p53-deficient mice by transplantation assay was designed to answer this question. Briefly, 218 C3H/He mice were lethally irradiated and repopulated with bone marrow cells from wild-type, heterozygous p53-deficient, and homozygous p53-deficient C3H/He mice. This was followed by treatment with a single and graded dose of methyl nitrosourea at 6.6, 14.8, 33.3, 50.0, and 75.0 mg/kg body wt, with the vehicle-treated control groups treated with zero dose for each genotype. Whereas mice repopulated with p53-deficient bone marrow cells showed a marked reduction of the threshold for leukemogenicity, mice repopulated with wild-type bone marrow cells did not exhibit leukemia at a dose of 33.3 mg/kg body wt and showed a curve with a high probability for the linear regression model with a positive dose intercept, predicting a threshold by the likelihood ratio test. Thus, the failure of wild-type mice to show an increase in incidence of leukemogenesis at low doses of genotoxic carcinogens may be due not to a statistical rarity, but to various p53-related pharmacophysiological functions, possibly including DNA repair and apoptosis that may account for a threshold.","['Hirabayashi, Yoko', 'Yoshida, Kazuko', 'Aizawa, Shin-ichi', 'Kodama, Yukio', 'Kanno, Jun', 'Kurokawa, Yuji', 'Yoshimura, Isao', 'Inoue, Tohru']","['Hirabayashi Y', 'Yoshida K', 'Aizawa S', 'Kodama Y', 'Kanno J', 'Kurokawa Y', 'Yoshimura I', 'Inoue T']","['Cellular and Molecular Toxicology Division, Center for Biological Safety and Research, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan. yokohira@nihs.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '684-93-5 (Methylnitrosourea)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Genes, p53', 'Genetic Therapy', '*Leukemia, Experimental/chemically induced/mortality/therapy', 'Longevity/drug effects', 'Male', 'Methylnitrosourea/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*deficiency/genetics']",2003/08/07 05:00,2003/09/06 05:00,['2003/08/07 05:00'],"['2003/08/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/07 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2003 Aug 1;190(3):251-61. doi: 10.1016/s0041-008x(03)00185-6.,,"['S0041008X03001856 [pii]', '10.1016/s0041-008x(03)00185-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dibutyltin (DBT) is used as a stabilizer in plastic products, and as a deworming agent in poultry. Poultry products have been shown to contain measurable levels of DBT. Drinking water has also been reported to contain BTs due to leaching from PVC pipes. We, and others, have found measurable levels of DBT in human blood. BTs appear to increase the risk of cancer and other viral infections in exposed individuals. In previous studies we have shown that the tumor killing function of natural killer (NK) lymphocytes was greatly diminished after as little as a 1 h exposure to DBT and the inhibition continued even after removal of the compound. We also showed that there was a significant decrease in NK cell lysis of K562 target cells after an exposure to 1.5 microM DBT for 24 h. This 24 h exposure also decreased the ability of NK cells to bind to tumor cells. Loss of binding function was not seen when NK cells were exposed to 5-10 microM DBT for 1 h. However, NK cells exposed to 5 microM DBT for 1 h and then incubated in DBT-free media for 24, 48, or 96 h, showed a significant loss of tumor-binding function within 24 h. The effects of DBT exposure on seven cell surface molecules that are involved in NK-cell interactions with target cells were investigated. The results indicated that the exposure of NK cells to 1.5 microM DBT for 24 h decreased the expression of CD2, CD11a, CD16, CD11c. There was no decrease in expression of any of the markers studied when NK cells were exposed to 5 microM DBT for 1 h, consistent with the fact that a 1-h exposure had no effect on the ability of NK cells to bind tumor cells. However, when NK cells were exposed to 5 microM DBT for 1 h followed by 24, 48 or 96 h incubations in DBT-free media there was decreased expression of several of the cells surface molecules with the most dramatic decreases being in CD16 and CD56.","['Odman-Ghazi, Sabah O', 'Hatcher, Frank', 'Whalen, Margaret M']","['Odman-Ghazi SO', 'Hatcher F', 'Whalen MM']","['Department of Chemistry, Tennessee State University, 3500 John A Merritt Blvd, Nashville, TN 37209-1561, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '0 (Organotin Compounds)', '1002-53-5 (di-n-butyltin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Environmental Pollutants/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Male', 'Organotin Compounds/*toxicity', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/08/07 05:00,2003/09/10 05:00,['2003/08/07 05:00'],"['2003/08/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/07 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2003 Jul 25;146(1):1-18. doi: 10.1016/s0009-2797(03)00069-3.,,"['S0009279703000693 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-2797(03)00069-3 [doi]']",,,"['2G12RR03032/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '2S06GM0092/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '7R15CA74354/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This research was performed to study the anticancer effects of Paljin-Hangahmdan water extract (PHWE) in human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells. After HL-60 cells were routinely cultured, tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay was performed for cytotoxicity test. Cytotoxicity of PHWE (200-800 microg/ml) in HL-60 cells was increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. However, PHWE (200-800 microg/ml) had less cytotoxicity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from a healthy subject. To explore the mechanism of cytotoxicity, we used several measures of apoptosis to determine whether these processes were involved in PHWE-induced leukemic cell death. Our results showed PHWE induced the cell shrinkage, cell membrane blebbing, apoptotic body, and DNA fragmentation. In addition, the flow cytometric analysis revealed PHWE (200-800 microg/ml) dose-dependently increased apoptotic cells with hypodiploid DNA contents.

RESULTS: None of the 5 patients had cytogenetic evidence of clonal evolution at the start of treatment with imatinib. All patients developed grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia during treatment. The emergence of Ph(-), trisomy 8(+) metaphases was seen at 3, 6, 13, 16, and 18 months from the start of treatment and was present at multiple time points.

An ELISA-based assay suggested the occurrence of in vivo p53 alterations in bone marrow stromal cells from 2 of 12 ALL patients screened. Direct sequencing of one of these samples revealed a somatic heterozygous p53 gene mutation (Asp49His). This sample secreted more VEGF and provided increased growth support to leukemic cells. The ability of Asp 49His-p53 to increase the expression of VEGF was confirmed with transfection experiments in a p53-null cell line. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that genetic alterations, such as p53 mutations, in stromal cells can increase stromal-derived support of leukemia growth. Increased synthesis of pro-angiogenic cytokines, such as VEGF, may constitute one possible pathway by which this process is mediated.","['Narendran, Aru', 'Ganjavi, Hooman', 'Morson, Natalie', 'Connor, Alison', 'Barlow, Jason W', 'Keystone, Edward', 'Malkin, David', 'Freedman, Melvin H']","['Narendran A', 'Ganjavi H', 'Morson N', 'Connor A', 'Barlow JW', 'Keystone E', 'Malkin D', 'Freedman MH']","[""Southern Alberta Children's Cancer Program, Alberta Children's Hospital, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2003/08/07 05:00,2003/09/25 05:00,['2003/08/07 05:00'],"['2003/08/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/07 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Aug;31(8):693-701. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00159-0.,,"['S0301472X03001590 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00159-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because activating mutations of c-kit affecting codon 816 are associated with human mast cell neoplasms, we determined whether STI571 exerted a similar cytotoxic effect on neoplastic and normal human mast cells. METHODS: We investigated the effect of addition of STI571 in increasing concentrations (0.01 to 10 micromolar) to two HMC-1 human mast cell leukemia cell lines carrying two different activating c-kit mutations in codons 816 or 560, as well as the effect of the drug on short-term bone marrow cultures obtained from patients who carry a mutated codon 816 or wild-type c-kit. RESULTS: STI571 failed to inhibit the growth of HMC-1(560,816) cells bearing a codon 816 mutation but effectively suppressed the proliferation of HMC-1(560) carrying c-kit with the wild-type codon 816. STI571 did not induce preferential killing of neoplastic bone marrow mast cells in short-term cultures from patients bearing a codon 816 c-kit mutation. In contrast, STI571 caused a dramatic reduction in mast cells in patients without codon 816 c-kit mutations. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that STI571, while effectively killing mast cells with wild-type c-kit, did not show preferential cytotoxicity to neoplastic human mast cells and thus may not be effective in the treatment of human systemic mastocytosis associated with codon 816 c-kit mutations.","['Akin, Cem', 'Brockow, Knut', ""D'Ambrosio, Claudio"", 'Kirshenbaum, Arnold S', 'Ma, Yongsheng', 'Longley, B Jack', 'Metcalfe, Dean D']","['Akin C', 'Brockow K', ""D'Ambrosio C"", 'Kirshenbaum AS', 'Ma Y', 'Longley BJ', 'Metcalfe DD']","['Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1881, USA. cakin@niaid.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Codon)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Codon/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mastocytosis/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells/drug effects/metabolism']",2003/08/07 05:00,2003/09/25 05:00,['2003/08/07 05:00'],"['2003/08/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/07 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Aug;31(8):686-92. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00112-7.,,"['S0301472X03001127 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00112-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the function of CD95 on B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (B-CLL cells) has been studied intensively, the clinical importance of CD95 expression on normal T cells in B-CLL has not been clarified. This study aimed to investigate whether expression of CD95 on peripheral blood T cells correlates with clinically relevant parameters of B-CLL disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression of CD95 (Fas/Apo-1) on peripheral blood T lymphocytes of patients with B-CLL was determined using flow cytometry and was correlated with expression of activation markers, sensitivity to apoptosis by anti-CD95, and clinical data, such as blood count, Binet stage, therapy, progression-free probability, and survival probability. RESULTS: Differential CD95 expression did not correlate with activation markers or with levels of apoptosis through anti-CD95. However, high levels of CD95 on T cells from B-CLL patients correlated significantly with low lymphocyte doubling time, increased Binet stages, and requirement for chemotherapeutic treatment. Furthermore, increased cell-surface CD95 on T cells was associated with reduced progression-free probability and poorer survival. CONCLUSIONS: CD95 levels on T cells correlate with the clinical course of B-CLL. Prospective studies appear warranted to investigate whether CD95 on T cells has a direct influence on B-CLL disease progression.","['Groneberg, Claudia', 'Pickartz, Tilman', 'Binder, Alexander', 'Ringel, Frauke', 'Srock, Stefanie', 'Sieber, Thomas', 'Schoeler, Dagmar', 'Schriever, Folke']","['Groneberg C', 'Pickartz T', 'Binder A', 'Ringel F', 'Srock S', 'Sieber T', 'Schoeler D', 'Schriever F']","['Biomedizinisches Forschungszentrum, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Berlin, Germany']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Life Tables', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/chemistry/*immunology/*pathology', 'fas Receptor/analysis/*physiology']",2003/08/07 05:00,2003/09/25 05:00,['2003/08/07 05:00'],"['2003/08/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/07 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Aug;31(8):682-5. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00109-7.,,"['S0301472X03001097 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00109-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) is particularly diverse, both in terms of molecular changes and clinical course, and consequently our understanding of the pathology of this disease is generally poor. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of this tumour type coupled with the absence of an obvious genetic ""hallmark"", such as gain of oncogene function or loss of suppressor-gene function, has led many investigators to question whether B-CLL is a single disease entity. In most cases, B-CLL does not show specific reciprocal chromosomal translocations as found in other haemopoietic malignant diseases. The genomic instability of B-CLL results in numerous different types of chromosomal losses and gains, giving rise to unsettled karyotypes among individuals with this disease. Nevertheless, genetic data imply that B-CLL is a single disease characterised by a common gene-expression profile and by the existence of specific subtypes that may have clinical correlates in patients.","['Guipaud, Olivier', 'Deriano, Ludovic', 'Salin, Helene', 'Vallat, Laurent', 'Sabatier, Laure', 'Merle-Beral, Helene', 'Delic, Jozo']","['Guipaud O', 'Deriano L', 'Salin H', 'Vallat L', 'Sabatier L', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Delic J']","['Laboratoire de Radiobiologie et Oncologie, CEA, Fontenay aux Roses, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Lancet Oncol,The Lancet.

METHODS: Eleven cases with proven meningeal carcinomatosis were studied by conventional and Gd-DTPA enhanced MR imaging. The enhancement patterns and features, as well as the types of meningeal involvement, were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Conventional MR imaging showed no evident meningeal abnormalities. After the administration of Gd-DTPA, abnormal pia mater enhancement was detected in 9 cases, demonstrating as the continuous, thin, and lineal high signal intensity on the brain surface that could descend into the sulci. The abnormal pial enhancement occurred on the cortical surfaces of cerebellum, brainstem, and cerebrum. No abnormal enhancement in the subarachnoid space was found. Abnormal dura-arachnoid enhancement was seen in 3 cases, showing as the continuous, thick, and curvilineal high signal intensity over the convexities or in the tentorium without extension into the cortical sulci. Cerebral dura-arachnoid involvement was found in all 3 cases and one of them also showed abnormal enhancement in cerebellar dura-arachnoid and tentorium. Of the 11 cases, 9 with pial involvement had abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results, 2 involving only the dura-arachnoid had normal CSF results. CONCLUSION: Meningeal carcinomatosis could be well demonstrated by Gd-DTPA enhanced MR imaging, and its type could be differentiated by the enhancement features. Combined with the clinical information, Gd-enhanced MR imaging may lead to the diagnosis and guide the therapy of meningeal carcinomatosis.","['Ma, Lin', 'Yu, Shengyuan', 'Cai, Youquan', 'Liang, Li', 'Guo, Xinggao']","['Ma L', 'Yu S', 'Cai Y', 'Liang L', 'Guo X']","['Department of Radiology, PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med Sci J,Chinese medical sciences journal = Chung-kuo i hsueh k'o hsueh tsa chih,9112559,"['0 (Contrast Media)', 'K2I13DR72L (Gadolinium DTPA)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Child', 'Contrast Media', 'Female', 'Gadolinium DTPA', 'Humans', 'Image Enhancement', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*diagnosis/secondary', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spinal Cord Neoplasms/*diagnosis/secondary']",2003/08/07 05:00,2004/08/11 05:00,['2003/08/07 05:00'],"['2003/08/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/07 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chin Med Sci J. 2003 Mar;18(1):36-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: PMPs suspension (platelet poor plasma, PPP) was extracted by gradual centrifugation. According to the size of PMPs, 3 microm and 0.8 microm latex beads were used as internal standards for the quantitation. PMPs were counted by adjusting flow cytometric discrimination and voltage of forward scatter and side scatter. RESULTS: In 30 healthy donors, the average concentration of resting PMPs was (1.2 x 10(5) +/- 5.7 x 10(4))/ml and that of activated PMPs was (1.6 x 10(6) +/- 9.1 x 10(5))/ml. Compared with healthy donors, PMPs mean value was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in 18 patients with coronary artery disease, 12 with acute cerebral infraction and 23 with chronic renal failure [the average PMPs concentration, (6.1 x 10(5) +/- 2.5 x 10(5))/ml, (6.8 x 10(5) +/- 3.4 x 10(5))/ml and (5.9 x 10(5) +/- 3.1 x 10(5))/ml respectively].

Mortality from malignant diseases is the second most frequent cause of death in both sexes. The most frequent localisation of cancer is that of the bronchi and the lungs, followed by colorectal, breast and oral cavity cancers. AIM: Of the publication was to demonstrate the spatial distribution of mortality from malignant diseases of all sites, bronchi and the lungs, as well as mortality from cancer of the thyroid gland and leukaemias, and to evaluate the possible impact of the Chernobyl nuclear accident on the frequency of cancer mortality. METHOD: The spatial distribution of mortality in the country is evaluated by computing standardized mortality ratio on settlement level, using geographical information system. In case of frequent mortality events a region analysis was carried out, in the opposite case--a cluster analysis. RESULTS: Regarding the spatial distribution of mortality from all malignant diseases of 0-64 year-old males there are regions with excess mortality in almost each county. In case of women of this age group, there is a significantly higher mortality in Budapest, in three counties in the Eastern part of the country, and in some settlements in Transdanubia. Mortality from the cancer of the bronchi and the lungs significantly accumulates in both sexes in four counties in Eastern Hungary. Mortality from cancer of the thyroid gland and leukaemias does not show typical spatial accumulation as well. CONCLUSIONS: The premature mortality from all malignant diseases and of cancer of the bronchi and lungs of the Hungarian male and female population shows an increasing tendency. Mortality from the latter cause shows a typical spatial accumulation, which causes should be investigated in analytical epidemiological studies. The potential causative role of the Chernobyl accident could not be proven in any case.","['Paldy, Anna', 'Pinter, Alan', 'Nador, Gizella', 'Vincze, Istvan', 'Malnasi, Tibor']","['Paldy A', 'Pinter A', 'Nador G', 'Vincze I', 'Malnasi T']","['Fodor Jozsef Orszagos Kozegeszsegugyi Kozpont, Orszagos Kornyezetegeszsegugyi Intezet, Budapest.']",['hun'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Hungary,Orv Hetil,Orvosi hetilap,0376412,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/mortality', 'Bronchial Neoplasms/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hungary/epidemiology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Lung Neoplasms/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality/trends', 'Mouth Neoplasms/mortality', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Sex Distribution', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/mortality']",2003/08/07 05:00,2003/10/01 05:00,['2003/08/07 05:00'],"['2003/08/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/01 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/07 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Orv Hetil. 2003 Jun 22;144(25):1227-33.,,,,,,,,,,A daganatos halalozas teruleti kulonbsegei Magyarorszagon.,,,,,,,,,

The role of imatinib in relation to allogeneic stem cell transplantation is discussed, recognizing that the data on which any decisions can be made are relatively immature. At this time, it remains to be seen whether the chronic phase of CML can be extended sufficiently long in some patients so that they are functionally ""cured,"" and whether doses of imatinib higher than 400 mg daily will improve response rates in chronic-phase CML.

Conditioning and the period after transplantation were uneventful, complete donor chimerism was achieved and the patient continues to be in molecular remission without significant chronic graft-versus-host disease. When treating Jehovah's witnesses with diseases that may be cured by allogeneic SCT, this approach should be kept in mind.","['Zenz, T', 'Dohner, H', 'Bunjes, D']","['Zenz T', 'Dohner H', 'Bunjes D']","['University Hospital Ulm, Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/pathology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', ""*Jehovah's Witnesses"", 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Religion and Medicine', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*methods', 'Treatment Refusal', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",2003/08/06 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2003/08/06 05:00'],"['2003/08/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2003 Aug;32(4):437-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1704121.,,"['10.1038/sj.bmt.1704121 [doi]', '1704121 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to investigate the IGF system in children with acute leukemia prior to and after hematological stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In 51 patients (AML n=27; ALL n=24; mean age 11.2+/-4.8 years), serum parameters (IGF-I,-II, IGFBP-2,-3) were investigated up to 18 months after HSCT by RIA. Patients with AML showed a significant increase of IGFBP-2 up to 100 days after HSCT (mean +/-s.d. prior to HSCT: 3.2+/-3.6 SDS vs 100 days after HSCT: 5.3 degrees +/-3.4 SDS, P=0.005). Furthermore, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were significantly decreased (IGF-I: -0.3+/-1.5 vs -0.7 +/-1.2 SDS, P=0.001; IGFBP-3: -0.3+/-1.1 vs -1.0+/-1.1 SDS, P=0.02). Children with AML showed significantly higher IGFBP-2 (P=0.04) and significantly lower IGF-I (P=0.03) and IGFBP-3 (P=0.05) levels than children with ALL at day 100 after HSCT. We conclude that children with acute leukemia show important changes in the IGF system after HSCT. In particular, IGFBP-2 was significantly elevated at day 100 after HSCT. Increased IGFBP-2 and decreased IGF-I and IGFBP-3 may be associated with the increased proliferation rate of transplanted bone marrow.","['Dawczynski, K', 'Kauf, E', 'Zintl, F']","['Dawczynski K', 'Kauf E', 'Zintl F']","['1Department of Pediatrics, Friedrich-Schiller University, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2/*blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/*blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*biosynthesis', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/*therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/therapy', 'Radioimmunoassay/methods', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",2003/08/06 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2003/08/06 05:00'],"['2003/08/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2003 Aug;32(4):411-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1704149.,,"['10.1038/sj.bmt.1704149 [doi]', '1704149 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we used a third-generation self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector system based on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to improve transduction efficiency and prevent vector-related toxicity. The transduction efficiency of the HIV-1-based vector was compared directly with the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) SIN vector in human leukemia cell lines. Initial transduction efficiencies were almost 100% for the HIV and less than 50% for the MLV vectors. Similar results were observed in 11 types of primary cells obtained from leukemia or myeloma patients. Transgene expression persisted for 8 weeks in cells transduced with the HIV vector, but declined with the MLV vector. In addition, resting peripheral blood lymphocytes and CD34(+) hematopoietic cells were transduced successfully with the HIV vector, but not with the MLV vector. Finally, we confirmed vector gene integration in almost all colony-forming cells transduced with the HIV vector, but not with the MLV vector. In conclusion, this lentiviral vector is an excellent gene transduction system for human blood cells because of its high gene transduction and host chromosome integration efficiency.","['Bai, Y', 'Soda, Y', 'Izawa, K', 'Tanabe, T', 'Kang, X', 'Tojo, A', 'Hoshino, H', 'Miyoshi, H', 'Asano, S', 'Tani, K']","['Bai Y', 'Soda Y', 'Izawa K', 'Tanabe T', 'Kang X', 'Tojo A', 'Hoshino H', 'Miyoshi H', 'Asano S', 'Tani K']","['Division of Molecular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,,IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*administration & dosage/genetics', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Hematologic Diseases/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*virology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods', 'Transgenes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/08/06 05:00,2003/10/10 05:00,['2003/08/06 05:00'],"['2003/08/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2003 Aug;10(17):1446-57. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3302026.,,"['10.1038/sj.gt.3302026 [doi]', '3302026 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Akt phosphorylation increases with GqWT expression but is markedly attenuated in cardiomyocytes expressing GqQ209L or in those expressing GqWT and treated with agonist. A membrane-targeted Akt rescues GqQ209L-expressing cardiomyocytes from apoptotic cell death. In contrast, leukemia inhibitory factor fails to activate Akt or promote cell survival in these cells. Association of Akt and PDK-1 with the membrane is also diminished in GqQ209L-expressing cardiomyocytes. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), the primary regulator of Akt, increases significantly in GqWT-expressing cells but not in cardiomyocytes expressing GqQ209L. Levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), the immediate precursor of PIP3, are also markedly lower in GqQ209L-expressing compared to control cells. Expression of a GqQ209L mutant that has diminished capacity to activate phospholipase C does not decrease PIP2 or Akt or induce apoptosis. In transgenic mice with cardiac G alpha q overexpression, heart failure and increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis develop during the peripartal period. Akt phosphorylation and PIP2 levels decrease concomitantly.

However, its molecular mechanism of action is not understood. In this study, we found that TRSDY induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells as evidenced by both a characteristic ladder pattern of discontinuous DNA fragments and an increase of annexin V+/PI- stained cell population. Our data demonstrated that TRSDY-induced apoptotic cell death was accompanied by activation of caspase-3 and cleavages of its substrates, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and RhoGDP dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI-2; also called D4-GDI) in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Caspase-3 inhibitor, but not caspase-1 inhibitor, prevented TRSDY-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, treatment with TRSDY increased the production of intracellular hydrogen peroxide and pretreatment of cells with anti-oxidants conferred complete protection against hydrogen peroxide generation and subsequent caspase-3 activation. Taken together, these results suggest that TRSDY induces hydrogen peroxide generation, which, in turn, causes activation of caspase-3, degradation of PARP and D4-GDI, and eventually leads to apoptotic cell death.","['Kwon, Kang-Beom', 'Kim, Eun-Kyung', 'Shin, Byung-Cheul', 'Seo, Eun-A', 'Park, Jin-Woo', 'Kim, Jong-Suk', 'Park, Byung-Hyun', 'Ryu, Do-Gon']","['Kwon KB', 'Kim EK', 'Shin BC', 'Seo EA', 'Park JW', 'Kim JS', 'Park BH', 'Ryu DG']","['Department of Physiology, School of Oriental Medicine, Won-Kwang University, Iksan, Chonbuk 570-749, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (takrisodokyeum)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'Leukemia', 'Proteins/metabolism']",2003/08/06 05:00,2003/09/04 05:00,['2003/08/06 05:00'],"['2003/08/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2003 Aug 29;73(15):1895-906. doi: 10.1016/s0024-3205(03)00559-9.,,"['S0024320503005599 [pii]', '10.1016/s0024-3205(03)00559-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: (1) K562 cells, aline chronic granulocytic leukemia cells, and normal mononuclear cells (MNC) were cultured. Zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPcS(2)P(2)), a photosensitizer, with the terminal concentration of 1.0 micro g/ml was added into the cultures. The K562 cells and normal MNCs in the suspensions were broken. Fluorescence spectrophotometry was used to determine the concentration of zinc phthalocyanine in cells at different time points so as to find the optimal time for photodynamic purging process. (2) Suspensions of K562 cells and MNCs were made and incubated with zinc phthalocyanine of different concentrations (0.062 5, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 micro g/ml) for 5 hours. A blank control group (sodium chloride of the same volume was added), a PDT control group (without photosensitizer), and a photosensitizer control group (zinc phthalocyanine was added without PDT) were established. Then the suspensions were irradiated with 670 nm laser. Trypan blue dye exclusion technique was used to calculate the number of live cells for a period of 5 days. The proliferative potency of K562 cells was detected by MTT colorimetric assay. The OD value was detected with ELISA apparatus to calculate the inhibition rate. Colony formation of K562 cells and MNCs was determined. (3) K562 cells were mixed into normal MNCs at the ratios of 1:100 and 1:1,000 so as to create the model of simulated remission bone marrow. After PDT treatment, colony formation test was done and nested-PCR was used to detect the bcr-abl mRNA expression in K562 cells. Colony formation test was made on the MNCs treated with PDT. The antiproliferative effects of PDT on normal hematopoietic progenitors were evaluated by CFU-Mix, CFU-GM and CFU-E assays. RESULTS: (1) The zinc phthalocyanine content in the MNCs reached its peak within the first hour of incubation and then rapidly decreased to the lowest value in 4 hours. However, the zinc phthalocyanine content in the K562 cells gradually increased within the first 4 hours of incubation and reached its peak by the fifth hour with a ratio of zinc phthalocyanine content in K562 cells to that in MNCs of 4.59. Therefore, the fifth hour after incubation was selected as the optimal time to irradiate the suspensions using the laser with a wavelength of 670 nm. (2) The inhibitory rate of laser on the colony information rate was 91.1% for the K562 cells, 18.0% for the MNCs in CFU-Mix methyl cellulose culture system, 18.6% for the MNCs in CFU-GM methyl cellulose culture system, and 17.8% for the MNCs in CFU-E methyl cellulose culture system At the concentration of 0.25 micro g/ml, K562 cells were inhibited by 91.1%, however, CFU-Mix, CFU-GM and CFU-E were relatively spared, inhibitory rate being 18.0%, 18.6% and 17.8% respectively. (3) At the concentration of 0.25 micro g/ml, residual K562 cells in the simulated remission bone marrow were completely photoinactivated. CONCLUSION: Zinc phthalocyanine -based PDT selectively kills K562 cells. It would be a promising purging technique for chronic granulocytic leukemia.","['Huang, Hui-fang', 'Chen, Yuan-zhong', 'Wu, Yong']","['Huang HF', 'Chen YZ', 'Wu Y']","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou 350001, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Isoindoles)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Zinc Compounds)', '14320-04-8 (Zn(II)-phthalocyanine)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Cell Count', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indoles/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Isoindoles', 'K562 Cells', 'Organometallic Compounds/metabolism/*pharmacology', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Zinc Compounds']",2003/08/06 05:00,2003/12/12 05:00,['2003/08/06 05:00'],"['2003/08/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2003 Jun 10;83(11):986-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical data of 131 patients undergoing allo-HSCT August 1999 to July 2001 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Twenty-eight of the 131 patients developed CMV interstitial pneumonia (IP) with an incidence rate of 21.35%, 9 patients developed CMV enteritis with an incidence rate of 6.87%; in total 37 of the 131 patients developed CMV disease with the accumulative one-year incidence rate of 32.54%. Thirteen patients (35.14%)died of CMV diseases. Univariate analysis showed that accumulative incidence of CMV disease was associated with unrelated donor, II-IV degrees acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD), additional immunosuppressive therapy for GVHD, chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD), antilymphocyte globulin (ALG)/monoclonal antibody (MoAb) administration, high dose of methylprednisolone (MP), plasma viramia-PCR (PV-PCR) positivity of patients, blood transfusion and pre-emptive treatment. Multivariate analysis showed that risk factors for CMV disease included plasma CMV-DNA positivity, immense amount of blood transfused, and additional immunosuppressive therapy for aGVHD, and pre-emptive therapy capable of turning PV-PCR positive reduced the incidence of CMV disease (RR: 3.309, 1.046, 2.242, and 0.346). CONCLUSION: CMV disease has a high morbidity and mortality in allo-HSCT patients.

A questionnaire with detailed questions regarding infectious complications was mailed to patients and their general practitioners. Major infections (requiring intravenous antibiotics or inpatient treatment) were reported in 37 patients (19.8%) and minor infections (requiring oral antibiotics and outpatient treatment) in 113 patients (60.4%). Univariate analysis identified advanced disease (P = 0.02), gender (P = 0.01), duration of disease (P = 0.007), number of previous chemotherapy regimens (P < 0.001), previous therapy with purine analogues and monoclonal antibodies (P < 0.001; P = 0.019), massive splenomegaly (P = 0.03), low granulocyte count (P < 0.001), low serum immunoglobulin concentration (P = 0.005), low haemoglobin concentration (P < 0.001) and high serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration (P < 0.001) as risk factors for major infections. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, only the number of previous chemotherapy regimens (risk ratio [RR] = 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-8.0) and haemoglobin concentration (RR = 0.6; CI 0.5-0.8) remained significant for major infections. The number of previous chemotherapy regimens was the only independent risk factor for minor (RR = 7.6; CI 2.2-25.7) and varicella-zoster virus infections (RR = 2.1; CI 1.3-3.4). In untreated patients, the only risk factor for major infections was LDH concentration. Patients treated with purine analogues or autologous stem cell transplantation had a higher risk of developing viral infections. In conclusion, disease activity and pretreatment extent have a stronger impact on the risk of severe infectious complications than hypogammaglobulinaemia. Preferably, prophylactic strategies should be evaluated in patients defined by these parameters.","['Hensel, Manfred', 'Kornacker, Martin', 'Yammeni, Sophie', 'Egerer, Gerlinde', 'Ho, Anthony D']","['Hensel M', 'Kornacker M', 'Yammeni S', 'Egerer G', 'Ho AD']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Hospitalstrasse 3, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany.

However, the molecular mechanisms of stem cell-stromal cell interactions are not fully understood. We observed that mobilized peripheral blood and cord-blood-derived CD34+ progenitor cells, or CD34+ acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells spontaneously migrated beneath marrow stromal cells, an in vitro migration phenomenon termed pseudoemperipolesis. In contrast, the CD34+ myeloid leukaemia cell line, Kasumi-1, did not display pseudoemperipolesis. Cord blood CD34+ cells had a higher capacity than granulocyte-colony-stimulating-factor-mobilized CD34+ cells for pseudoemperipolesis (28.7 +/- 12%vs 18.1 +/- 6.1% of input cells within 24 h, mean +/- SD, n = 8), whereas 9.4 +/- 12.6% (mean +/- SD, n = 10) of input AML cells displayed this phenomenon. Pseudoemperipolesis of CD34+ progenitor and AML cells was significantly inhibited by pertussis toxin and antibodies to the CXCR4 chemokine receptor (CXCR4, CD184), but not control antibodies. Moreover, CD34+ and AML cell migration was significantly inhibited by a CS1 peptide that blocks alpha4beta1 integrin binding, but not by a control peptide, in which the fibronectin binding motif was scrambled. Pseudoemperipolesis was associated with an increased proliferation of migrated CD34+ progenitor cells but not AML cells within the stromal layer, demonstrated by cell cycle analysis and cell division tracking. We conclude that alpha4beta1 integrin binding and CXCR4 chemokine receptor activation are prerequisites for the migration of CD34+ haematopoietic progenitors and AML cells beneath marrow stromal cells. These observations suggest a central role of marrow stromal cells for HSC trafficking and homing within the marrow microenvironment.","['Burger, Jan A', 'Spoo, Anke', 'Dwenger, Anne', 'Burger, Meike', 'Behringer, Dirk']","['Burger JA', 'Spoo A', 'Dwenger A', 'Burger M', 'Behringer D']","['Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Freiburg University Hospital, Hugstetterstrasse 55, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany. burger@mm11.ukl.uni-freiburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Movement', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Ligands', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*physiology', 'Stromal Cells/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/08/06 05:00,2003/10/11 05:00,['2003/08/06 05:00'],"['2003/08/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Aug;122(4):579-89. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04466.x.,,"['4466 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04466.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the profile of aberrant gene promoter methylation is undefined. In this study, methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) was used to define the methylation status of a panel of nine genes, comprising p15, p16, RARbeta, oestrogen receptor (ER), E-cadherin (E-CAD), p73, caspase 8 (CASP8), VHL and MGMT, in 29 patients with APL. Aberrant methylation of p15, ER, RARbeta, p16 and E-CAD occurred, respectively, in 23 (79%), 14 (48%), six (21%), six (21%) and two (7%) patients at diagnosis, but p73, VHL, CASP8 and MGMT were not methylated in any patients. There was methylation of one gene in 13 patients (45%), two genes in four patients (14%), three genes in six patients (21%) and four genes in three patients (10%). Concurrent methylation of two or more genes occurred in 13 patients (45%). No association was identified between gene methylation and presenting clinicopathological features. However, p15 methylation was significantly associated with an inferior disease-free survival (DFS, P = 0.008), and remained the only poor prognostic factor in multivariate analysis (P = 0.019). In APL, p15, p16, ER and RARbeta were most frequently methylated. This profile is distinct from other types of myeloid leukaemias. p15 methylation has a poor prognostic impact on DFS.","['Chim, Chor S', 'Wong, Seung Y', 'Kwong, Yok L']","['Chim CS', 'Wong SY', 'Kwong YL']","['University Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Survival Analysis']",2003/08/06 05:00,2003/10/11 05:00,['2003/08/06 05:00'],"['2003/08/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Aug;122(4):571-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04462.x.,,"['4462 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04462.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PML/RARalpha fusion protein is involved in the pathogenesis of APL and the breakpoint site of the PML gene might be associated with aetiological factor(s). Because APL is over-represented in patients that originate in Latin America (Latinos), we evaluated whether the distribution of the PML/RARalpha fusion mRNA in this population is different to that reported in non-Latinos. Among 52 APL patients (28 from Mexico and Central America diagnosed in Los Angeles and 24 from Peru, South America), bcr1, bcr2 and bcr3 expression was 75%, 10% and 15% respectively. However, bcr1 breakpoints were significantly higher compared with non-Latino patients (340/654, 52%) reported in four studies. Often bcr1 and bcr2 are reported together; 862 (60%) of 1429 non-Latino APL patients reported in nine studies were either bcr1 or bcr2, compared with 44 (85%) in our 52 Latino patients. This difference was also statistically significant when our patients were compared to each of the individual studies from USA and Europe, but not for a small series from China and Japan. These results suggest that the overrepresentation of APL among Latin American patients can be accounted for by an increase of a single subtype--bcr1, and the breakage sites in the PML gene may not be random but possibly influenced by genetic and/or environmental factor(s).","['Douer, Dan', 'Santillana, Sergio', 'Ramezani, Laleh', 'Samanez, Cesar', 'Slovak, Marilyn L', 'Lee, Ming S', 'Watkins, Kristy', 'Williams, Tony', 'Vallejos, Carlos']","['Douer D', 'Santillana S', 'Ramezani L', 'Samanez C', 'Slovak ML', 'Lee MS', 'Watkins K', 'Williams T', 'Vallejos C']","['Division of Haematology, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Centre, 14421 Eastlake Avenue, Room 4360, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA. douer_d@ccnt.hsc.usd.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'California/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Latin America/ethnology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/ethnology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2003/08/06 05:00,2003/10/11 05:00,['2003/08/06 05:00'],"['2003/08/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Aug;122(4):563-70. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04480.x.,,"['4480 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04480.x [doi]']",,,,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Iodine-131 tositumomab has a dual mechanism of action. It is capable of initiating a host immune response to those B cells to which it is attached, and it also triggers apoptosis in a significant proportion of the cells to which it binds. The product was first discovered by Coulter Corporation, Miami, in collaboration with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the University of Michigan. The spin-off company Coulter Pharmaceutical, upon its formation, obtained worldwide rights to iodine-131 tositumomab. (Coulter Corporation was acquired subsequently by Beckman Instruments in October 1997. The union of the two companies produced Beckman Coulter.) In December 2000, Coulter Pharmaceutical was acquired by, and merged into, Corixa Corporation.Iodine-131 tositumomab is available for licencing in Japan. Corixa Corporation and GlaxoSmithKline signed an agreement to jointly develop and commercialise iodine-131 tositumomab. The total agreement has a potential value of up to $US132 million, plus shared profits and royalties. The two companies will jointly market the antibody in the US following regulatory approval. Corixa Corporation has announced it expects iodine-131 tositumomab to be approved in the US for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Under the terms of the original agreement, GlaxoSmithKline will receive exclusive marketing rights outside the US, excluding Japan. However, an amended agreement between the two companies will allow Corixa Corporation to also market the product outside the US. In February 2003, the European Commission granted iodine-131 tositumomab orphan-drug designation. Corixa Corporation and GlaxoSmithKline also intend to jointly investigate the use of the product in other indications. GlaxoSmithKline may also receive access to second generation anti-CD20 compounds under its agreement with Corixa Corporation. In May 2003, Corixa Corporation entered into an agreement that will see GlaxoSmithKline market Bexxar in Canada. Under the terms of the agreement, Corixa Corporation will manufacture and supply the product to GlaxoSmithKline, who will register, market and sell it in Canada. In October 2001, Amersham PLC, a supplier of medical equipment, announced that its Amersham Health unit had signed a marketing agreement with Corixa Corporation. The agreement allows Amersham Health to market iodine-131 tositumomab in Europe. Corixa Corporation formed agreements with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma KG and Lonza Biologics to produce the B1 antibody and radiolabelling of the antibody has been contracted out to MDS Nordion.Iodine-131 tositumomab has received orphan drug and fast track designation for the treatment of NHL. Corixa Corporation submitted a Biologics Licence Application (BLA) to the US FDA in 1999, seeking permission to market Bexxar in the US for the treatment of relapsed or refractory, low grade or transformed low grade B-cell NHL. Following a priority review, the US FDA requested that Corixa Corporation reformat certain sections and perform additional analyses of existing data in its BLA. Corixa Corporation and GlaxoSmithKline resubmitted their BLA to the US FDA in September 2000. The BLA was subsequently accepted by the US FDA in November 2000. However, in March 2001, the US FDA requested additional information in its complete review letter to Corixa Corporation and marketing partner GlaxoSmithKline. The two companies submitted data pertaining to the chemistry, manufacturing and controls section of the BLA, and to the majority of the questions regarding the clinical section of the BLA in August 2001. Corixa Corporation and GlaxoSmithKline submitted the remainder of the response to the US FDA in September 2001, following an independent review of clinical trial data. In March 2002, Corixa Corporation received another complete review letter from the US FDA, which stated that additional clinical trials would have to be conducted in order to provide adequate evidence of the safety and clinical benefit of Bexxa. The US FDA also denied Corixa Corporation's request for accelerated approval, stating that the data provided was inadequate to show that Bexxar filled an unmet medical need. Corixa Corporation has met formally with the US FDA but the two were unable to resolve their differences. Corixa Corporation will now file a formal request for dispute resolution under the Food and Drug Administration Modernisation Act. Corixa Corporation also requested a presentation of Bexxa data to the US FDA's scientific advisors. In June 2002, the US FDA granted the company's appeal for additional regulatory review. In December 2002, the US FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee agreed that Bexxar has clinical benefit for patients with NHL. In May 2003, Corixa Corporation and GlaxoSmithKline announced that they had fulfilled many of the steps required for US FDA approval, however the US FDA has extended its review of the application for another 3 months. This extension will allow for further refinement of post marketing commitments and package insert language, and to ensure they are consistent with an updated safety database requested by the US FDA and submitted by Corixa Corporation in early April. GlaxoSmithKline was waiting for the outcome of the situation before deciding on marketing plans for Bexxar. Corixa Corporation and GlaxoSmithKline will conduct a head-to-head study of Bexxar and Idec's Zevalin, planned for mid-2003. The trial will likely be one of three phase IV studies that the US FDA requires for accelerated approval of Bexxar. Corixa Corporation initiated its Expanded Access Program for Bexxar in response to requests from physicians and patients for continued access to Bexxar during the period prior to potential US FDA marketing approval.A phase II multicentre trial of Bexxar in combination with CHOP chemotherapy is underway in the US as first-line therapy in patients with intermediate-grade NHL. Corixa Corporation has initiated a phase II trial of iodine-131 tositumomab in combination with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone for the treatment of previously untreated low-grade NHL. The trial was initiated while the company was preparing its BLA for Bexxar for use as a single agent for relapsed or refractory NHL. Corixa Corporation intends to pursue additional trials to expand the potential use of iodine-131 tositumomab to other indications, including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The agent is also in a clinical trial for preparation in autologous bone marrow transplant patients. The trial is designed to test the combination of iodine-131 tositumomab and chemotherapy. The trial began in 1995 and has so far enrolled 40 patients. In addition, a phase II dose-escalation trial has begun at the University of Nebraska for the combined use of iodine-131 tositumomab and chemotherapy as preparation for autologous bone marrow transplant. Corixa Corporation has received an issued US patent covering methods for administering and dosing radioimmunotherapy for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas. The patent covers iodine-131 tositumomab and other anti-CD20 antibodies used to aid in selective tumour targeting. Corixa Corporation has exclusive rights to the patent.A February 2000 media release from GlaxoSmithKline and Corixa Corporation stated that they had been issued a composition patent relating to radiolabelled monoclonal antibodies (including Bexxar) for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas. On 11 September 2001, IDEC announced that it had filed two separate lawsuits. The first lawsuit is against Corixa Corporation and the University of Michigan on six patents pertaining to products and processes related to radioimmunotherapy. They seek a declaration that Zevalin does not infringe Corixa Corporation's issued US patents. The second lawsuit involves two patents relating to cell culture media, and is against GlaxoSmithKline. IDEC's lawsuit in this case, seeks a declaration that its manufacture of Zevalin does not infringe GlaxoSmithKline's issued US patents. Corixa Corporation and GlaxoSmithKline have also filed a complaint for patent infringement against IDEC. These actions however, should have no effect on the regulatory process that Zevalin is completing, or prevent IDEC from launching the drug before iodine-131 tositumomab.A year earlier, in March 2001, the Financial Times reported that Bexxar could reach peak sales of $US120 million. In 1998, Coulter Pharmaceutical received a licencee fee payment of $US34 million from SmithKline Beecham (now GSK) in the fourth quarter of the year, as part of the joint development and commercialisation agreement for Bexxar.",,,,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article']",New Zealand,BioDrugs,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",9705305,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', 'K1KT5M40JC (tositumomab I-131)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/complications', 'Patents as Topic/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/08/06 05:00,2004/06/24 05:00,['2003/08/06 05:00'],"['2003/08/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,BioDrugs. 2003;17(4):290-5. doi: 10.2165/00063030-200317040-00009.,,"['1749 [pii]', '10.2165/00063030-200317040-00009 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similar patterns of human globin gene expression were displayed in the two MEL cell lines transfected with the construct. Inducible expression of the Agamma- and beta-gene was observed during induced cell differentiation. However, the expression level of the Agamma-globin gene is much higher than that of the beta-globin gene in either uninduced or induced MEL transformants. No gamma to beta switching happened in the stable MEL transformants following a continuous culture. The much more effective enhance of the muLCR on the Agamma-globin gene than that on the beta-globin gene is resulted probably from the fact that the distance between the LCR and the beta-globin gene is much longer than that between the LCR and the Agamma-globin gene in the construct, in comparison with other constructs containing HS2 or muLCR linked to both of gamma- and beta-globin genes in different order. Two suggestions can be derived from these results: 1) A competition between the gamma- and beta-globin gene for interaction with the LCR may indeed present, but only an enough long distance difference between the LCR to the gamma- and to the beta-gene can effectively influence the competition; 2) Unlike transgenic mice, MEL cells are incapable of reconstructing the regulatory information involved in developmental control when it is provided by a fragment of the beta-globin gene cluster with limited length.","['Junwu, Z', 'Stamatoyannopoulos, G']","['Junwu Z', 'Stamatoyannopoulos G']","['National Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, CAMS & PUMC, Beijing 100005.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",China,Chin Med Sci J,Chinese medical sciences journal = Chung-kuo i hsueh k'o hsueh tsa chih,9112559,['9004-22-2 (Globins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cosmids', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Globins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Locus Control Region/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/08/06 05:00,2003/11/12 05:00,['2003/08/06 05:00'],"['2003/08/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chin Med Sci J. 1999 Mar;14(1):31-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 68 subjects were divided into 3 groups--carcinoma, precarcinoma, and common-on the basis of pathological diagnosis. The expressions of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), mutant-type P53, and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (BCL-2) proteins were detected by immunohistochemical staining. PCNA, P53, and BCL-2 proteins were overexpressed. The proteins' overexpressions correlated with the pathological changes seen in each pathological study group (i.e., common < precarcinoma < carcinoma). Statistical correlation was observed between P53 and BCL-2, and between PCNA and BCL-2. The authors concluded that cell proliferation, antiapoptosis, and up-regulation of the mutant-type P53 gene played vital roles in the pathological development of arsenicalism.","['Hu, Chang-Jun', 'Zhang, Ai-Hua', 'Huang, Hsiao-Hsin']","['Hu CJ', 'Zhang AH', 'Huang HH']","[""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Huaihua Medical College, Hunan Province, People's Republic of China. hcj66@21cn.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Environ Health,Archives of environmental health,0212627,"['0 (Coal)', '0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",IM,"['Arsenic/*adverse effects', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Coal', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Pollutants/*adverse effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Precancerous Conditions/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Skin Neoplasms/etiology/genetics/*pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",2003/08/06 05:00,2003/08/16 05:00,['2003/08/06 05:00'],"['2003/08/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Environ Health. 2003 Feb;58(2):92-6. doi: 10.3200/AEOH.58.2.92-96.,,['10.3200/AEOH.58.2.92-96 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prognosis varies among different age groups. Differences in the biological characteristics of the leukemic clone and clinical findings at diagnosis are also used for risk assignment in ALL. It is our hypothesis that age is a lesser risk defining parameter than are the biological characteristics of the leukemic clone and the clinical characteristics at presentation. An analytic, retrospective study was conducted where fifty-seven patients were evaluated. Patients were divided in two subgroups: nine years and older (up to 18 years of age) patients with favorable biological characteristics of the leukemic clone and favorable clinical findings at diagnosis (riesgo 0) and nine years and older (up to 18 years of age) patients with unfavorable characteristics of the leukemic clone and/or unfavorable clinical findings at diagnosis (riesgo 1).

The measurement of telomere length might therefore assess the lifespan of a cell. The aim of this study was to set up and validate a technique enabling the assessment of telomere length on tissue sections. Quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) with telomeric probes was performed on smears and sections from cell preparations or human tissues. The mean fluorescence intensity of telomere spots (FI/spot) was automatically quantified by image analysis. Telomeric restriction fragment (TRF) length was assessed by Southern blotting. There was a positive significant correlation between telomere length, as assessed by Q-FISH, and TRF length determined by Southern blotting in corresponding samples (p < 0.01, r = 0.6 for tissue and p < 0.01, r = 0.79 for cells). FI/spot was higher on smears than on sections, but pairwise comparison showed a significant correlation both for cells and for tissues (r = 0.77, p < 0.001 for cells and p < or = 0.01, r = 0.64 for tissue). Finally, since telomere length is expected to shorten with age, FI/spot was assessed in liver samples according to the age of patients: a negative correlation was demonstrated (r = 0.76, p < 0.01). Inter-assay variation was 7% for Q-FISH performed on tissue sections and 12% on touch preparations. This study shows that Q-FISH can be performed with confidence on fixed frozen tissue sections in order to assess telomere length. It is an easy, accurate, and reproducible in situ method for assessing telomeres in the context of cell type and tissue architecture.","['Ferlicot, Sophie', 'Youssef, Nelly', 'Feneux, Danielle', 'Delhommeau, Francois', 'Paradis, Valerie', 'Bedossa, Pierre']","['Ferlicot S', 'Youssef N', 'Feneux D', 'Delhommeau F', 'Paradis V', 'Bedossa P']","[""Services d'Anatomie Pathologique, Hopital de Bicetre, 78 Rue du General Leclerc, 94275 Le Kremlin-Bicetre Cedex, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aging/genetics', 'Blotting, Southern/methods', 'Child', 'Cryopreservation', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Kidney/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Telomere/*ultrastructure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/08/05 05:00,2003/10/08 05:00,['2003/08/05 05:00'],"['2003/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pathol. 2003 Aug;200(5):661-6. doi: 10.1002/path.1392.,"['Copyright 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",['10.1002/path.1392 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, plastic adherent cultures elaborated from murine bone marrow are an admixture of fibroblastoid and hematopoietic cell types. Here we report a reliable method based on immunodepletion to fractionate fibroblastoid cells from hematopoietic cells within plastic adherent murine marrow cultures. The immunodepleted cells expressed the antigens Sca-1, CD29, CD44, CD81, CD106, and the stem cell marker nucleostemin (NST) but not CD11b, CD31, CD34, CD45, CD48, CD90, CD117, CD135, or the transcription factor Oct-4. They were also capable of differentiating into adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts in vitro as well as osteoblasts/osteocytes in vivo. Therefore, immunodepletion yields a cell population devoid of hematopoietic and endothelial cells that is phenotypically and functionally equivalent to MSCs. The immunodepleted cells exhibited a population doubling time of approximately 5-7 days in culture. Poor growth was due to the dramatic down regulation of many genes involved in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression as a result of immunodepletion. Exposure of immunodepleted cells to fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) but not insulin-like growth factor (IGF), murine stem cell factor, or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) significantly increased their growth rate. Moreover, 82% of the transcripts down regulated by immunodepletion remain unaltered in the presence of FGF2. Exposure to the later also reversibly inhibited the ability of the immunodepleted cells to differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts in vitro. Therefore, FGF2 appears to function as a mitogen and self-maintenance factor for murine MSCs enriched from bone marrow by negative selection.","['Baddoo, Melody', 'Hill, Katy', 'Wilkinson, Robin', 'Gaupp, Dina', 'Hughes, Catherine', 'Kopen, Gene C', 'Phinney, Donald G']","['Baddoo M', 'Hill K', 'Wilkinson R', 'Gaupp D', 'Hughes C', 'Kopen GC', 'Phinney DG']","['Center for Gene Therapy, Tulane University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, Louisiana 70112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Plastics)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'DNA Primers', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Plastics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2003/08/05 05:00,2004/04/30 05:00,['2003/08/05 05:00'],"['2003/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2003 Aug 15;89(6):1235-49. doi: 10.1002/jcb.10594.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/jcb.10594 [doi]'],,,['R01-NS39033-01A2/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we demonstrate that EGF protection against tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induced apoptosis is mediated by increased expression of the Bcl-2 family member myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1). EGF increased the mRNA and protein levels of Mcl-1. Furthermore, expression of ErbB1 alone or in combination with ErbB2 in NIH3T3 cells up-regulates Mcl-1 following EGF treatment. In addition, up-regulation of Mcl-1 by EGF is mediated through AKT and NFkappaB activation since kinase inactive AKT and DeltaIkappaB effectively blocks this up-regulation. NFkappaB was also critical for the ability of EGF to prevent TRAIL induced apoptosis as a dominant negative IkappaB (DeltaIkappaB) blocked NFkappaB activation, and relieved EGF protection against TRAIL mediated mitochondrial cytochrome-c release and apoptosis. Finally, anti-sense oligonucleotides directed against Mcl-1 effectively reduced the protein levels of Mcl-1 and blocked EGF protection against TRAIL induced mitochondrial cytochrome-c release and apoptosis. Taken together, EGF signaling leads to increased Mcl-1 expression that is required for blockage of TRAIL induced apoptosis.","['Henson, Elizabeth S', 'Gibson, Erika M', 'Villanueva, Jacylyn', 'Bristow, Nicolle A', 'Haney, Neil', 'Gibson, Spencer B']","['Henson ES', 'Gibson EM', 'Villanueva J', 'Bristow NA', 'Haney N', 'Gibson SB']","['Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, University of Manitoba, 675 McDermot Ave., Winnipeg, Manitoba, R3E 0V9.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tnfsf10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Genes, erbB-1/physiology', 'Genes, erbB-2/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/enzymology/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",2003/08/05 05:00,2004/04/30 05:00,['2003/08/05 05:00'],"['2003/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2003 Aug 15;89(6):1177-92. doi: 10.1002/jcb.10597.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/jcb.10597 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated whether another MAPK module, the JNK pathway, also participates in this form of differentiation. We found that the dependence on the concentration of the inducer, the vitamin-hormone 1,25D(3), in two types of human leukemia cells, HL60 and U937, and the kinetics of monocytic differentiation in HL60 cells, parallel the degree of the activation of the JNK pathway. A blockade of JNK signaling by a stable expression of dominant negative (dn) JNK1 mutant in U937 cells resulted in reduced c-jun phosphorylation, and the differentiation of these cells was markedly decreased. Similarly, inhibition of JNK1 and JNK2 activities by the selective inhibitor SP600125 led to both dose-dependent reduction of c-jun and ATF-2 phosphorylation, and of the differentiation of HL60 cells. In addition, we found that JNK activity is essential for the AP-1 DNA binding induced by 1,25D(3) in HL60 and U937 cells. The results indicate that in cultured human leukemia cells, the JNK pathway participates in the induction of monocytic differentiation by 1,25D(3), probably by activating the AP-1 transcription factor.","['Wang, Qing', 'Wang, Xuening', 'Studzinski, George P']","['Wang Q', 'Wang X', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, 185 South Orange Avenue, Newark, New Jersey 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ergocalciferols)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '1TW30Y2766 (pyrazolanthrone)', '55248-15-2 (1,25-dihydroxyergocalciferol)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Anthracenes/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Ergocalciferols/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*cytology/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/drug effects/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*drug effects/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2003/08/05 05:00,2004/04/30 05:00,['2003/08/05 05:00'],"['2003/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2003 Aug 15;89(6):1087-101. doi: 10.1002/jcb.10595.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/jcb.10595 [doi]'],,,['R01-CA 44722-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Semen analysis according to WHO recommendations were performed in 16 patients suffering from unilateral testicular cancer (group 1) and in 21 patients who were diagnosed to have other malignant tumors (group 2: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: n=7, Hodgkin's disease: n=6, leukemia: n=3, osteosarcoma: n=2, rectal cancer: n=2, thyroid carcinoma: n=1) prior to anti-cancer treatment. RESULTS: Normozoospermia was observed in none of the testicular cancer patients but in five of the other patients ( p=0.047). Sperm concentration was significantly decreased in the patients of group 1 compared to those of group 2 (18.7+/-22.3x10(6)/ml versus 35.6+/-31.3x10(6)/ml, p=0.03).

In the present study, we investigated the effect of magnolol on apoptosis in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), using terminal-deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labelling (TUNEL) and flow cytometric analysis. Magnolol (5-20 micro M) concentration-dependently induced significant VSMC apoptosis, this effect being blocked by the caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk, 50 micro M). To study the molecular mechanism, the mitochondrial death pathway was examined. Magnolol increased caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities significantly and reduced the mitochondrial potential (Deltapsi(m)). The levels of B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), but not those of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) or Bcl-x(L), were down-regulated concentration dependently by magnolol. In an animal model, balloon angioplasty-induced neointima formation was inhibited significantly by magnolol and Bcl-2 protein levels were reduced. Taken together, these results show that magnolol induces apoptosis in VSMCs via the mitochondrial death pathway. This effect is mediated through down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein levels, both in vivo and in vitro. Magnolol thus shows potential as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of atherosclerosis and re-stenosis.","['Chen, Jiun-Han', 'Wu, Chin-Chen', 'Hsiao, George', 'Yen, Mao-Hsiung']","['Chen JH', 'Wu CC', 'Hsiao G', 'Yen MH']","['National Defence Medical Centre, 114, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,0326264,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Bax protein, rat)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, rat)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Lignans)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '001E35HGVF (magnolol)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp9 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Angioplasty, Balloon', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Carotid Artery Diseases/etiology/pathology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/biosynthesis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Constriction, Pathologic', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', '*Lignans', 'Male', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria, Muscle/drug effects/physiology', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/cytology/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",2003/08/05 05:00,2004/06/24 05:00,['2003/08/05 05:00'],"['2003/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2003/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol. 2003 Aug;368(2):127-33. doi: 10.1007/s00210-003-0779-3.

Here we show that HIV-1 sensitivity to restriction factors is modulated by cyclophilin A (CypA), a host cell protein that binds the HIV-1 capsid protein (CA). In certain nonhuman primate cells, the CA-CypA interaction is essential for restriction: HIV-1 infectivity is increased >100-fold by cyclosporin A (CsA), a competitive inhibitor of the interaction, or by an HIV-1 CA mutation that disrupts CypA binding. Conversely, disruption of CA-CypA interaction in human cells reveals that CypA protects HIV-1 from the Ref-1 restriction factor. These findings suggest that HIV-1 has co-opted a host cell protein to counteract restriction factors expressed by human cells and that this adaptation can confer sensitivity to restriction in unnatural hosts. Manipulation of HIV-1 CA recognition by restriction factors promises to advance animal models and new therapeutic strategies for HIV-1 and AIDS.","['Towers, Greg J', 'Hatziioannou, Theodora', 'Cowan, Simone', 'Goff, Stephen P', 'Luban, Jeremy', 'Bieniasz, Paul D']","['Towers GJ', 'Hatziioannou T', 'Cowan S', 'Goff SP', 'Luban J', 'Bieniasz PD']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Fv1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Proteins)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (APEX1 protein, human)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (Apex1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Cyclophilin A)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Aotidae', 'Binding Sites', 'Capsid/drug effects/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclophilin A/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/metabolism', 'HIV-1/chemistry/*pathogenicity', 'Host-Parasite Interactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/chemistry/pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/drug effects/pathogenicity']",2003/08/05 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/08/05 05:00'],"['2003/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2003/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2003 Sep;9(9):1138-43. doi: 10.1038/nm910.

We postulate that the drug resistance is induced by the attachment of very late antigen (VLA)-4 on leukemic cells to fibronectin on bone-marrow stromal cells. We found that VLA-4-positive cells acquired resistance to anoikis (loss of anchorage) or drug-induced apoptosis through the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI-3K)/AKT/Bcl-2 signaling pathway, which is activated by the interaction of VLA-4 and fibronectin. This resistance was negated by VLA-4-specific antibodies. In a mouse model of MRD, we achieved a 100% survival rate by combining VLA-4-specific antibodies and cytosine arabinoside (AraC), whereas AraC alone prolonged survival only slightly. In addition, overall survival at 5 years was 100% for 10 VLA-4-negative patients and 44.4% for 15 VLA-4-positive patients. Thus, the interaction between VLA-4 on leukemic cells and fibronectin on stromal cells may be crucial in bone marrow MRD and AML prognosis.","['Matsunaga, Takuya', 'Takemoto, Naofumi', 'Sato, Tsutomu', 'Takimoto, Rishu', 'Tanaka, Ikuta', 'Fujimi, Akihito', 'Akiyama, Takehide', 'Kuroda, Hiroyuki', 'Kawano, Yutaka', 'Kobune, Masayoshi', 'Kato, Junji', 'Hirayama, Yasuo', 'Sakamaki, Sumio', 'Kohda, Kyuhei', 'Miyake, Kensuke', 'Niitsu, Yoshiro']","['Matsunaga T', 'Takemoto N', 'Sato T', 'Takimoto R', 'Tanaka I', 'Fujimi A', 'Akiyama T', 'Kuroda H', 'Kawano Y', 'Kobune M', 'Kato J', 'Hirayama Y', 'Sakamaki S', 'Kohda K', 'Miyake K', 'Niitsu Y']","['Fourth Department of Internal Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, South-1, West-16, Chuo-ku, Sapporo 060-0061, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrin alpha5beta1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Integrin alpha5beta1/metabolism', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/mortality', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Predictive Value of Tests', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/08/05 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/08/05 05:00'],"['2003/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2003/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2003 Sep;9(9):1158-65. doi: 10.1038/nm909.

Interestingly, leptin also upregulates the secretion of leukemia inhibitory factor and expression of its receptor by rabbit endometrial cells. Analysis of a structural model of the leptin-leptin receptor complex suggested that helices I and III of the human leptin structure were likely sites of interaction with the cytokine binding domain of leptin receptor. Accordingly, we synthesized a peptide (LPA-2) comprising helix III (residues 70-95) and investigated its ability to inhibit leptin receptor function. The effects of LPA-2 were assayed in rabbit endometrial cells, and an antileptin receptor antibody and a scrambled version of LPA-2 were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. LPA-2 binds specifically and with high affinity (Ki ~ 0.6 x 10-10 M) to leptin receptor and is a potent inhibitor of its functions in rabbit endometrial cells. Because leukemia inhibitory factor and interleukin- 1 have been implicated in embryo implantation, our results raise the possibility that the LPA-2-induced inhibition of leptin receptor may be exploited to study the actions of leptin in endometrium and in other tissues under conditions characterized by abnormal leptin production.","['Gonzalez, Ruben Rene', 'Leavis, Paul C']","['Gonzalez RR', 'Leavis PC']","['Boston Biomedical Research Institute (BBRI), Watertown, MA 02111, USA. gonzalezr@bbri.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrine,Endocrine,9434444,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LEPR protein, human)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Leptin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endometrium/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leptin/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Peptide Fragments/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Rabbits', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Leptin', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Up-Regulation']",2003/08/05 05:00,2004/04/14 05:00,['2003/08/05 05:00'],"['2003/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2003/03/31 00:00 [revised]', '2003/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Endocrine. 2003 Jul;21(2):185-95. doi: 10.1385/ENDO:21:2:185.,,"['ENDO:21:2:185 [pii]', '10.1385/ENDO:21:2:185 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although HTLV-I is known to be associated with infective dermatitis in childhood, other HTLV-I-associated morbidity in children has not been well studied. We sought to determine the HTLV-I-associated health effects in Jamaican children. METHODS: We compared incidence rates of several health outcomes in 28 HTLV-I-infected and 280 uninfected children clinically followed from age 6 weeks to a maximum of 10 years. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to analyze these prospectively collected data, adjusting for confounding effects of other variables as necessary. RESULTS: HTLV-I-infected children had significantly higher incidence rates of seborrheic dermatitis (rate ratio [RR] = 4.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.9-12.5), eczema (RR = 3.1, CI = 1.2-7.9) and persistent hyperreflexia (RR = 3.7, CI = 1.6-8.2). Additionally, HTLV-I infected children had increased rates of severe anemia (RR = 2.5, CI = 0.8-7.9) and abnormal lymphocytes (RR = 2.4, CI = 0.8-7.6) that were of borderline statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that HTLV-I-associated skin diseases of childhood may include seborrheic dermatitis and eczema. Additionally, these data suggest that persistent hyperreflexia of the lower limbs may be an early sign of HTLV-I-associated neurologic involvement in children. Expansion and continued clinical observation of this cohort would be valuable.","['Maloney, Elizabeth M', 'Wiktor, Stefan Z', 'Palmer, Paulette', 'Cranston, Beverley', 'Pate, Ernest J', 'Cohn, Sylvia', 'Kim, Norma', 'Miley, Wendell', 'Thomas, Terry L', 'Blattner, William A', 'Hanchard, Barrie']","['Maloney EM', 'Wiktor SZ', 'Palmer P', 'Cranston B', 'Pate EJ', 'Cohn S', 'Kim N', 'Miley W', 'Thomas TL', 'Blattner WA', 'Hanchard B']","['Viral Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Department of Health and Human Services, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA. em34w@nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,,IM,"['Anemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Breast Feeding', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dermatitis, Seborrheic/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Eczema/epidemiology/*etiology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications/physiopathology', 'Incidence', 'Jamaica/epidemiology', 'Neurologic Examination', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*Reflex, Abnormal']",2003/08/05 05:00,2003/10/04 05:00,['2003/08/05 05:00'],"['2003/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2003 Aug;112(2):e136-42. doi: 10.1542/peds.112.2.e136.,,['10.1542/peds.112.2.e136 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arsenic is present as a contaminant in many traditional remedies. Arsenic trioxide is now used to treat acute promyelocytic leukaemia. Absorption occurs predominantly from ingestion from the small intestine, though minimal absorption occurs from skin contact and inhalation. Arsenic exerts its toxicity by inactivating up to 200 enzymes, especially those involved in cellular energy pathways and DNA synthesis and repair. Acute arsenic poisoning is associated initially with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and severe diarrhoea. Encephalopathy and peripheral neuropathy are reported. Chronic arsenic toxicity results in multisystem disease. Arsenic is a well documented human carcinogen affecting numerous organs. There are no evidence based treatment regimens to treat chronic arsenic poisoning but antioxidants have been advocated, though benefit is not proven.

While Mnk2a contains a MAP kinase-binding site in this region, Mnk2b lacks such a sequence and is much less readily activated by MAP kinases in vitro. Expression of Mnk2b in mammalian cells leads to increased phosphorylation of eIF4E, showing that it acts as an eIF4E kinase in vivo. While Mnk2a is cytoplasmic, a substantial amount of Mnk2b is found in the nucleus. Both enzymes contain a stretch of basic residues in their N termini that plays a role in binding to eIF4G and functions as a nuclear localization signal. Binding of eIF4G or nuclear import appears to be regulated by the C terminus of Mnk2a. Furthermore, the MAP kinase-binding site of Mnk2a regulates nuclear entry.

This review focuses primarily on MRD monitoring by PCR.","['Oehler, Vivian G', 'Radich, Jerald P']","['Oehler VG', 'Radich JP']","['Clinical Research Division, Program in Genetics and Genomics, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, D4-100, 1100 Fairview Avenue North, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferons/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*therapy', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence']",2003/08/05 05:00,2004/04/23 05:00,['2003/08/05 05:00'],"['2003/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2003 Sep;5(5):426-35. doi: 10.1007/s11912-003-0030-x.,,['10.1007/s11912-003-0030-x [doi]'],,,,77,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These defects are manifested as a propensity to develop infections with encapsulated bacteria, and less frequently, with gram-negative enterics. In addition, reactivation of viruses such as herpesvirus is not uncommon. Treatment of the disease further exacerbates immunosuppression by depleting immune effectors and broadening the spectrum of potentially offending pathogens. Risk of infection can potentially be reduced by administration of intravenous immunoglobulin and use of prophylactic antibiotics for individuals who are at high risk. Current work focuses on development of cellular and cytokine therapy to facilitate immune reconstitution in patients with CLL, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality and potentially improving survival.","['Wierda, William G']",['Wierda WG'],"['University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Box 428, Houston, TX 77030, USA. wwierda@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Blood Transfusion, Autologous', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/therapy', '*Monitoring, Immunologic']",2003/08/05 05:00,2004/04/23 05:00,['2003/08/05 05:00'],"['2003/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2003 Sep;5(5):419-25. doi: 10.1007/s11912-003-0029-3.,,['10.1007/s11912-003-0029-3 [doi]'],,,,81,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These profiles allow identification of residual leukemic cells in bone marrow or peripheral blood once morphologic complete remission is achieved. Until now, most immunophenotypic MRD studies in ALL have focused on children. In contrast, information on the value of MRD in adults with ALL is scanty and usually restricted to polymerase chain reaction studies. In this review, we focus on technical aspects of MRD detection by flow cytometry and on the clinical data concerning the value of immunologic MRD studies as a tool for relapse prediction in adult ALL. Although prospective studies are needed, we assert that immunophenotypic MRD studies are clinically useful. Such studies should be incorporated into the routine management of adult ALL patients for identification of those at high risk of relapse, who could benefit from new alternative therapeutic approaches, and to distinguish these patients from others who could be cured with more conventional approaches.","['Vidriales, Maria-Belen', 'Orfao, Alberto', 'San-Miguel, Jesus F']","['Vidriales MB', 'Orfao A', 'San-Miguel JF']","['Hematology Department, University Hospital of Salamanca, Paseo de San Vicente 58-182, 37007 Salamanca, Spain. mbvidri@usal.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', '*Monitoring, Immunologic', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2003/08/05 05:00,2004/04/23 05:00,['2003/08/05 05:00'],"['2003/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2003 Sep;5(5):413-8. doi: 10.1007/s11912-003-0028-4.,,['10.1007/s11912-003-0028-4 [doi]'],,,,81,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: AML blasts attachment to unactivated or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) activated-endothelial cell monolayers was investigate in vitro; The adhesion of leukemic blasts co cultured with unactivated endothelial cells under static conditions at 37 degrees C for 24 hours was observed;The binding of neutrophils and unactivated endothelial cell monolayers exposed to supernatant of blasts were tested.

We also observed the adhesion of leukemic blasts in the presence of the adhesion blocking mAbs anti-ICAM-1 and anti-LFA-1. RESULTS: This study has shown that the blast cells attached to unactivated endothelium was little (24.33 +/- 2.87)% and increased after exposure of endothelium to TNF alpha (81.87 +/- 4.08)% (n = 21, P < 0.001); The binding of blasts to endothelium also increased significantly after 24 hours co cultured with unactivated HUVEC (82.06 +/- 7.05)%, (n = 21, P < 0.001); The adhesion of neutrophils and unactivated endothelial cell monolayers exposed to supernatant of blasts was increased significantly (83.99 +/- 3.86)%, (n = 21, P < 0.001).

METHODS: Human erythroleukemia cell K562, murine erythroleukemia cell (MEL) and its sub-line MEL DS19 were used as target cells to select a cell line which is the most sensitive to HMBA, then analyzed the activity of inducing differentiation of two new designed HMBA derivatives: HMBPA [hexamethylenebi (3-pyridin) amide] and Co-HDTA (ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid cobalt) using cell biology, cytochemical and molecular biology techniques. RESULTS: We found that the MEL DS19 cells were most sensitive to HMBA (benzidine positive, B+ approximately 76%). Co-HDTA can inhibit the growth of MEL DS19, but induces differentiation just in a small population (B+ 2% approximately 4.5%). Between 0.02 approximately 5 micromol/L, HMBPA induces 3% approximately 8% cells committed to differentiation with little inhibition of cell proliferation. 1 micromol/L HMBPA and 2 mmol/L HMBA together, can obviously increase the percentage of differentiated cell (B+ approximately 72%), inhibit DNA synthesis and accelerate beta-globin transcription. CONCLUSION: The new HMBA derivatives may provide potential cancer differentiation inducers.","['Wang, Huali', 'Zhang, Shifu', 'Zhou, Jianping', 'Zhang, Jingbo']","['Wang H', 'Zhang S', 'Zhou J', 'Zhang J']","['Department of Cell Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, CAMS & PUMC, Beijing 100005.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med Sci J,Chinese medical sciences journal = Chung-kuo i hsueh k'o hsueh tsa chih,9112559,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (hexamethylenebi (3-pyridin) amide)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Globins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Pyridines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/08/05 05:00,2004/02/26 05:00,['2003/08/05 05:00'],"['2003/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chin Med Sci J. 2002 Mar;17(1):27-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among adults, high long-term survival rates due to improvements in chemotherapy for B-cell type ALL and core binding factor leukemias have been reported. For adult leukemias overall, however, long-term survival rates have stalled at 15-40% despite the high remission rate attained. In most cases this is due to a recurrence. Among the prognostic factors reported for acute leukemia, chromosome type may be cited as the currently most reliable. Acute leukemia patients are classified based on chromosome type, and the postremission therapeutic strategy is considered in terms of an appropriate combination of chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant. This accounts for an important part of the treatment given today. Target-based therapies such as all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) for AML have brought dramatic improvements in treatment results. The effect of imanitib against Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL, for which the prognosis is poor, is also attracting attention. Moreover, promising new treatment strategies that have been developed, including cord blood transplant, mini-transplant, antibody therapy, and immunotherapy, Clinical studies of PCR and other means to reveal small residual lesions and estimate prognosis are also making progress.

K562 and HEL cells expressing ERF expressed elevated levels of the erythroid-specific markers CD71 and Glycophorin A, as well as hemoglobin and GATA1. Treatment with the Erk kinase inhibitor PD98058 further enhanced the erythroid phenotype in ERF-expressing cells and cells expressing a non-phosphorylatable ERF mutant exhibited an even more enhanced phenotype. These results are consistent with the fact that ERF function is regulated by MAPK, and suggest that the effect of the MAPK pathway in erythroid differentiation is partially mediated by ERF.

Clues to the potential importance of Pur family members in cancer are derived from observations of genetic alterations of both Pur alpha and Pur beta in myelodysplastic syndrome progressing to acute myelogenous leukemia. A role for newly-discovered Pur gamma in neoplasia is also beginning to emerge as studies have indicated that cellular levels of two Pur gamma isoforms are elevated in certain tumors. A variety of studies have now implicated Pur alpha in development of blood cells and cells of the central nervous system. Clues to the functions of Pur alpha, a key family member, have recently been derived from studies of the interactions of HIV-1 and JC virus (JCV) in AIDS. JCV causes an opportunistic infection in the brains of certain HIV-1-infected individuals. Pur alpha can influence this viral interaction through functional associations with the Tat protein and TAR RNA of HIV-1, and with large T-antigen and DNA regulatory regions of JCV. Evidence is now strong that Pur alpha interacts with both DNA and RNA and that an important aspect of its function is to recruit regulatory proteins to specific nucleic acid sequences in processes as diverse as DNA replication, gene transcription, RNA transport in the cytoplasm and compartmentalized mRNA translation.","['Johnson, Edward M']",['Johnson EM'],"['Department of Pathology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (PURA protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*metabolism/virology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors']",2003/08/05 05:00,2003/08/20 05:00,['2003/08/05 05:00'],"['2003/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2003 May-Jun;23(3A):2093-100.,,,,,,67,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mice were treated with single drugs used in clinical protocols: daunorubicin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, cytarabine, asparaginase and methotrexate. Two ALL samples, established from primarily diagnosed patients, responded to 5 or 6 of the tested cytostatics, respectively, while 3 out of 5 ALLs from relapse patients were only sensitive towards 2-4 drugs tested. Daunorubicin was more efficient than doxorubicin. The response of xenografted ALL toward vincristine and cyclophosphamide was inversely correlated with the expression of P-gp, LRP and MRP1 (R2 = 0.71, 0.70 and 0.64 for vincristine and 0.44, 0.70 and 0.60 for cyclophosphamide). A good correlation could be detected between the expression of P-gp and LRP (R2 = 0.88), P-gp and MRP1 (R2 = 0.75) and LRP and MRP1 (R2 = 0.90). The highest co-expression of the drug resistance proteins in the leukemia ALL-SCID 6 coincided with a high resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Prediction of the individual drug resistance profile of a patient on the basis of results from the ALL-SCID xenograft studies was not possible because of the relatively long time necessary and because of the changes in the expression of P-gp, LRP and MRP1 during the murine generations. We conclude that in the drug resistance phenotype of ALL not only the above mentioned proteins but a variety of different molecules are involved.","['Fichtner, Iduna', 'Paal, Krisztina', 'Borgmann, Anja', 'Badiali, Lucia', 'Wurm, Reinhard', 'Henze, Gunter']","['Fichtner I', 'Paal K', 'Borgmann A', 'Badiali L', 'Wurm R', 'Henze G']","['Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Robert-Rossle-Strasse 10, 13092 Berlin-Buch, Germany.

Therefore an intensification of chemotherapy is required. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study the molecular mechanisms of cisplatin- and/or hyperthermia-mediated cytotoxicity in CEM cells, a human T leukemia cell line, were investigated. RESULTS: Both hyperthermia and cisplatin induced the activation of the effector caspases-3 and -6. However, caspase activation followed different time kinetics. While hyperthermia exerted maximum caspase activation immediately after application, cisplatin activated caspase-3 and -6 after 24 hours. At both time-points significant caspase-3 and -6 activation was observed when the cells were stimulated by a combination of heat and cisplatin. The application of z-VAD-fmk, a general caspase inhibitor, showed that hyperthermia mediated cytotoxicity mainly via caspase-dependent mechanisms, while cisplatin induced both caspase-dependent and -independent cytotoxicity. Time kinetic experiments revealed that hyperthermia induced cell death immediately after the heating pulse. In contrast, cisplatin-induced cell death had its maximum between 6 hours and 12 hours after the heating pulse. The combined application of heat and cisplatin induced two peaks of cytotoxicity, one immediately after the heating pulse and the other between 6 hours and 12 hours. CONCLUSION: Hyperthermia and cisplatin induced cell death in T leukemic cells by different molecular mechanisms, which might explain the enhanced cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity by hyperthermia.","['Mauz-Korholz, C', 'Dietzsch, S', 'Schippel, P', 'Banning, U', 'Korholz, D']","['Mauz-Korholz C', 'Dietzsch S', 'Schippel P', 'Banning U', 'Korholz D']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Oststr. 21-25, D-04317 Leipzig, Germany. mauc@medizin.uni-leipzig.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 6)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 6', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cisplatin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hyperthermia, Induced/*methods', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology/*therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/08/05 05:00,2003/08/29 05:00,['2003/08/05 05:00'],"['2003/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2003 May-Jun;23(3B):2643-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our recent data show that minor-groove binder netropsin (Nt) and its derivatives modulate the CPT-induced pattern of top I-mediated DNA cleavage. In an effort to develop a new molecule with good biological activity we have linked CPT with Nt and report here the first results of in vitro examination of the new compound. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CPT-Nt conjugate linked with flexible spacer through position 7 of CPT chromophore was synthesized and analyzed for lactone stability, the ability to modulate a top I-mediated DNA cleavage and antiproliferative activity within a panel of six tumor cell lines. RESULTS: CPT-Nt conjugate demonstrates enhanced lactone stability and concentration-dependent top I poisoning or suppression in vitro. The rate of conjugate hydrolysis in a water solution displays a 20-fold enhancement of stability compared with CPT. The cytotoxicity of the conjugate against acute promyelocytic leukaemia (HL60), chronic myelogenous leukaemia (K562), breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7), colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT29), lung carcinoma(A549) and ovarian adenocarcinoma (CaOV3) tumor cell lines was evaluated. The lowest IC50 value (0.08 microM) indicated its selective toxicity towards the ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line. CONCLUSION: The enhanced stability of CPT-Nt conjugate and its selective toxicity against the CaOV3 cell line may indicate its utility as an antitumor agent against ovarian adenocarcinoma.","['Sukhanova, Alyona', 'Grokhovsky, Sergei', 'Zhuze, Alexei', 'Devy, Jerome', 'Pluot, Michel', 'Oleinikov, Vladimir', 'Nabiev, Igor']","['Sukhanova A', 'Grokhovsky S', 'Zhuze A', 'Devy J', 'Pluot M', 'Oleinikov V', 'Nabiev I']","['EA 3306 Interactions Moleculaires et Cellulaires en Cancerologie, IFR no. 53 Biomolecules, UFR de Pharmacie, 51100 Reims, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '64B3O0RD7N (Netropsin)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Drug Stability', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lactones/chemistry', 'Netropsin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/08/05 05:00,2003/08/29 05:00,['2003/08/05 05:00'],"['2003/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2003 May-Jun;23(3B):2609-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The active compounds are 201-hydroxypurpurin-7 delta-lactone ethyl methyl diester (1) and the corresponding methyl phytyl diester (2). The apoptosis by compound 1 (0.3 to 0.1 microM for CMK-7 cells) was enhanced when the culture was briefly irradiated with a fluorescent lamp. This photodynamic induction of apoptosis by compound 1 was much stronger than that by a known photosensitizer, pyropheophorbidemethyl.

This novel strategy is based on the fusion of self-associating coiled-coil (CC) domain of the nuclear factor promyelocytic leukemia (PML) to target proteins. Here, we present the successful application of the OCR strategy for inactivation of the heterodimeric Cdk9/cyclin T1 complex. Cyclin T1/Cdk9 (P-TEFb) complex is a positive regulator of gene transcription, whose function is underlined by the ability to phosphorylate the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase II conferring productive transcript elongation. Fusion of the CC domain to Cdk9 leads to the formation of high molecular complexes to which the endogenous cyclin T1 is recruited. The CC-Cdk9 chimera effectively inhibits HIV-1 Tat activation, whose transcription activity is exquisitely dependent upon cyclin T1/Cdk9 function. Furthermore, expression of CC-Cdk9 protein inhibits cell proliferation, as shown by colony-formation assay. Collectively, our findings add further support to the OCR strategy for functional inactivation of hetero-associated factors such as the Cdk9/cyclin T1 complex, and highlight a putative function of Cdk9 in cell growth control.","['Napolitano, Giuliana', 'Mazzocco, Alberto', 'Fraldi, Alessandro', 'Majello, Barbara', 'Lania, Luigi']","['Napolitano G', 'Mazzocco A', 'Fraldi A', 'Majello B', 'Lania L']","['Department of Genetics, Molecular and General Biology, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CCNT1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin T)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Gene Products, tat)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Nuclear)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.- (Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK9 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cyclin T', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tat/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*chemistry', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Small Nuclear/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2003/08/02 05:00,2003/09/11 05:00,['2003/08/02 05:00'],"['2003/08/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Jul 31;22(31):4882-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206785.,,"['10.1038/sj.onc.1206785 [doi]', '1206785 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 39 protein spots, affected by UP inhibitors, were identified, including 11 new apoptosis-associated proteins.

Eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) was identified in two spots; however, the peptide mass-fingerprinting for the accumulated one included a peptide with lysine50, indicating that hypusine formation was suppressed during UP inhibitor-induced apoptosis. Hypusine modification ensues immediately following translation of eIF-5A precursor, unless cells are treated with the modification inhibitors diaminoheptane. However, UP inhibitors induced a much stronger accumulation of unmodified eIF-5A compared to the effect of diaminoheptane. We further showed the unmodified eIF-5A was regulated in a proteasome-dependent manner. Inhibition of hypusine formation by diaminoheptane triggered apoptosis, but of particular interest is the finding that eIF-5A expression inhibition by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides significantly enhanced the stimulating effect of GM-CSF on cell growth. Therefore, the eIF-5A accumulation played important roles in the apoptosis induced by UP inhibitors. Moreover, hypusine inhibition in apoptosis was further revealed to be associated with the subcellular localization of eIF-5A.

Interestingly, decreasing intracellular superoxide concentration with an inhibitor of the beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase or by transient transfection with a dominant-negative form of the guanosine triphosphate-binding protein Rac1 resulted in a significant increase in the sensitivity of CEM/Bcl-2 cells to CD95- or merocil-induced apoptosis. This increase in sensitivity was a direct result of a significant increase in caspase 8 activation and caspase 8-dependent acidification in the absence of caspase 9 activity or cytochrome c release. These findings suggest a mechanism of switching from mitochondria-dependent to mitochondria-independent death signaling in the same cell, provided the intracellular milieu is permissive for upstream caspase 8 activation, and could have implications for favorably tailoring tumor cells for drug treatment even when the mitochondrial pathway is compromised by Bcl-2.","['Clement, M-V', 'Hirpara, J L', 'Pervaiz, S']","['Clement MV', 'Hirpara JL', 'Pervaiz S']","['1Department of Biochemistry, National University of Singapore, 10 Kent Ridge Crescent, Singapore 119260, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Thiobarbiturates)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '143413-72-3 (merocil)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Fluid/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Superoxides/*metabolism', 'Thiobarbiturates/pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2003/08/02 05:00,2004/01/22 05:00,['2003/08/02 05:00'],"['2003/08/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/22 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2003 Nov;10(11):1273-85. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4401302.,,"['10.1038/sj.cdd.4401302 [doi]', '4401302 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coexposure of cells (24-48 hours) to minimally toxic concentrations of bortezomib + either suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) or sodium butyrate (SB) resulted in a striking increase in mitochondrial injury, caspase activation, and apoptosis, reflected by caspases-3 and -8 cleavage and poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) degradation. These events were accompanied by down-regulation of the Raf-1/mitogen-induced extracellular kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway as well as diminished expression of Bcr/Abl and cyclin D1, cleavage of p21CIP1 and phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), and induction of the stress-related kinases Jun kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Transient transfection of cells with a constitutively active MEK construct significantly protected them from bortezomib/SAHA-mediated lethality. Coadministration of bortezomib and SAHA resulted in increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and diminished nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation; moreover, the free radical scavenger L-N-acetylcyteine (LNAC) blocked bortezomib/SAHA-related ROS generation, induction of JNK and p21CIP1, and apoptosis. Lastly, this regimen potently induced apoptosis in STI571 (imatinib mesylate)-resistant K562 cells and CD34+ mononuclear cells obtained from a patient with STI571-resistant disease, as well as in Bcr/Abl- leukemia cells (eg, HL-60, U937, Jurkat).

Using oligonucleotide arrays, we examined changes in global gene expression mediated by the ectopic expression of either PML/RAR alpha (retinoid-sensitive) or PLZF/RAR alpha (retinoid-resistant) in U937 cells. Of more than 5000 genes analyzed, 16 genes were commonly up-regulated, and 57 genes were down-regulated by both fusion proteins suggesting their role in the APL phenotype. In our APL model, for example, TNFAIP2, TNFR2, ELF4, RAR gamma, and HoxA1 were down-regulated by both fusion proteins in the absence of retinoic acid (RA). RA strongly up-regulated these genes in PML/RAR alpha, but not in PLZF/RAR alpha expressing U937 cells. Expression studies in NB4, retinoid-resistant NB4-R2, normal human CD34+ cells, and APL patient samples strongly suggest their role in the regulation of granulocytic differentiation. Furthermore, combined treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and RA synergistically enhanced granulocytic differentiation in NB4 cells but not in NB4-R2 cells. Our data indicate that APL pathogenesis and retinoid-induced granulocytic differentiation of APL cells involve genes in the cell death pathway, and that cooperation between the RA and TNFalpha signaling pathways exists. Targeting both the retinoid-dependent differentiation and the cell death pathways may improve leukemic therapy, especially in retinoid-resistant acute myeloid leukemia.","['Park, Dorothy J', 'Vuong, Peter T', 'de Vos, Sven', 'Douer, Dan', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Park DJ', 'Vuong PT', 'de Vos S', 'Douer D', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, University of California, Los Angeles School of Medicine, 8700 Beverly Blvd, Rm 5433, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA. parkd@cshs.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*physiology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2003/08/02 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/08/02 05:00'],"['2003/08/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Nov 15;102(10):3727-36. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-02-0412.

While acute promyelocytic leukemia displays marked sensitivity to the differentiating effects of trans-retinoic acid (tRA), other subtypes of AML display resistance. We now describe a novel compound (E)-4-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-3-chlorocinnamic acid (3-Cl-AHPC/MM002) that induces apoptosis in the tRA-resistant leukemia cell lines M07e, KG-1, and HL-60R, and in tRA-resistant patient leukemic blasts. The 3-Cl-AHPC totally inhibits leukemia colony formation at concentrations that inhibit committed human bone marrow stem cell proliferation, that is, granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GMs) by only 30%. Exposure to 3-Cl-AHPC results in caspase activation and the cleavage of poly(adenosine diphosphate) (poly(ADP)) ribose polymerase. While activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 pathways is not necessary for 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated apoptosis, maximal apoptosis requires c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. The 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated cleavage of the antiapoptotic B-cell leukemia XL (Bcl-XL) protein to a proapoptotic 18-kDa product is found in both the M07e cell line and patient leukemic blasts. The 3-Cl-AHPC treatment of mice bearing the AML 1498 cell line results in a 3.3-log kill in the leukemic blasts. While 3-Cl-AHPC does not activate retinoic nuclear receptors, it is a potent inducer of apoptosis in AML cells and may represent a novel therapy in the treatment of this disease.","['Zhang, Yuxiang', 'Dawson, Marcia I', 'Ning, Yangmin', 'Polin, Lisa', 'Parchment, Ralph E', 'Corbett, Thomas', 'Mohamed, Anwar N', 'Feng, Kai-Chia', 'Farhana, Lulu', 'Rishi, Arun K', 'Hogge, Donna', 'Leid, Mark', 'Peterson, Valerie J', 'Zhang, Xiao-kun', 'Mohammad, Ramzi', 'Lu, Jing-Song', 'Willman, Cheryl', 'VanBuren, Eric', 'Biggar, Sandra', 'Edelstein, Mark', 'Eilender, David', 'Fontana, Joseph A']","['Zhang Y', 'Dawson MI', 'Ning Y', 'Polin L', 'Parchment RE', 'Corbett T', 'Mohamed AN', 'Feng KC', 'Farhana L', 'Rishi AK', 'Hogge D', 'Leid M', 'Peterson VJ', 'Zhang XK', 'Mohammad R', 'Lu JS', 'Willman C', 'VanBuren E', 'Biggar S', 'Edelstein M', 'Eilender D', 'Fontana JA']","['John D Dingell VA Medical Center, and Department of Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (4-(3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-chlorocinnamic acid)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD 437)', '0 (Cinnamates)', '0 (Retinoids)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'PJY633525U (Adamantane)']",IM,"['Adamantane/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cinnamates/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Retinoids/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/08/02 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/08/02 05:00'],"['2003/08/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Nov 15;102(10):3743-52. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-01-0108.

This is thought to be due to masking of CD20 by rituximab. We used specific antimouse immunoglobulin antibodies to detect rituximab on the surface of CLL lymphocytes and we demonstrate that rituximab is rarely detectable after therapy. Only 3 of 65 patients with CLL had rituximab detectable on their lymphocytes after rituximab therapy despite the fact that most had no detectable CD20 expression. In vitro mixing of CLL or Raji cells with rituximab demonstrated that rituximab was detectable on the surface of cells due to its binding to CD20. However, the addition of plasma led to the down-modulation of CD20 expression, and the rituximab became undetectable. This down-modulation of CD20 protein expression was associated with a down-modulation of CD20 mRNA. CLL cells that lost their CD20 expression regained CD20 expression after 24 hours in culture. These data suggest that rituximab therapy leads to a substantial but transient down-modulation of CD20 expression and that negativity for CD20 in cells from patients treated with rituximab is not necessarily due to CD20 masking. The importance of this down-modulation in the efficacy of current therapy with rituximab needs further investigation.","['Jilani, Iman', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Manshuri, Taghi', 'Thomas, Deborah A', 'Thomazy, Vilmos A', 'Imam, Maha', 'Naeem, Sana', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Giles, Francis', 'Keating, Michael', 'Albitar, Maher']","['Jilani I', ""O'Brien S"", 'Manshuri T', 'Thomas DA', 'Thomazy VA', 'Imam M', 'Naeem S', 'Verstovsek S', 'Kantarjian H', 'Giles F', 'Keating M', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rituximab', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/08/02 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/08/02 05:00'],"['2003/08/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Nov 15;102(10):3514-20. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-01-0055.

Patients with CML have high levels of neutrophil elastase, which has recently been shown to antagonize the action of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and other growth factors. We therefore compared the effect of elastase on the growth of normal and CML progenitor cells. In 10-day suspension cultures of normal or CML CD34+ cells supplemented with G-CSF, stem cell factor (SCF), and granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), CML cells had diminished sensitivity to the growth inhibitory effect of elastase. When equal numbers of CML and normal CD34+ cells were cocultured for 10 days, there was no change in the relative proportions of normal and leukemic cells (measured by fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] or flow cytometry). However, when elastase was added, CML cells predominated at the end of the culture period (78% vs 22% with 1 microg/mL and 80% vs 20% with 5 microg/mL elastase). CML neutrophils substituted effectively for elastase in suppressing the proliferation of normal CD34+ cells, but this effect was abrogated by serine protease inhibitors. These results suggest that elastase overproduction by the leukemic clone can change the growth environment by digesting growth factors, thereby giving advantage to Ph+ hematopoiesis.","['El-Ouriaghli, Frank', 'Sloand, Elaine', 'Mainwaring, Lori', 'Fujiwara, Hiroshi', 'Keyvanfar, Keyvan', 'Melenhorst, J Joseph', 'Rezvani, Katayoun', 'Sconocchia, Giuseppe', 'Solomon, Scott', 'Hensel, Nancy', 'Barrett, A John']","['El-Ouriaghli F', 'Sloand E', 'Mainwaring L', 'Fujiwara H', 'Keyvanfar K', 'Melenhorst JJ', 'Rezvani K', 'Sconocchia G', 'Solomon S', 'Hensel N', 'Barrett AJ']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Growth Substances)', 'EC 3.4.21.37 (Leukocyte Elastase)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Clone Cells/enzymology/pathology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/etiology/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Elastase/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/08/02 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/08/02 05:00'],"['2003/08/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Nov 15;102(10):3786-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-03-0861.

We have previously shown that inhibitory receptor blockade of syngeneic NK cells was an effective means of ex vivo purging of leukemia-contaminated bone marrow and that the transplantation of mice with the purged bone marrow cells (BMCs) resulted in long-term, relapse-free survival. We have extended the investigation to assess the antitumor effects mediated by NK cells H2-allogeneic to tumor cells. We demonstrate that various tumor cell lines are more susceptible to lysis by H2-allogeneic NK cells than by syngeneic NK cells in vitro even though comparable percentages of Ly49 NK cells were present. Using allogeneic NK cells to purge leukemia-contaminating BMCs before transplantation resulted in a higher proportion of mice with long-term survival than using syngeneic NK cells. Allogeneic NK cells did not suppress hematopoietic reconstitution as measured by granulocyte/monocyte-colony-forming unit (CFU-GM), complete blood count (CBC), and donor chimerism at various days after transplantation. Inhibitory receptor blockade of allogeneic NK cells also significantly increased these antitumor effects at lower NK/tumor ratios compared with those of syngeneic NK cells.

Interaction with its ligand, stem cell factor, is essential in the development of hematopoietic stem cells, mast cells, gametocytes, melanocytes, and interstitial cells of Cajal. C-kit expression has been identified in a number of different neoplasms that includes mastocytosis/mast cell leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, seminoma/dysgerminoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. This study examines c-kit expression in uterine endometrial stromal sarcomas, leiomyomas, and leiomyosarcomas using immunohistochemistry. METHODS: Archival tissue from 38 patients with the uterine mesenchymal tumors (16 leiomyosarcomas, 8 leiomyomas, 11 low-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas, and 3 high-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas) was stained with polyclonal antibody for c-kit. Modified avidin biotin (ABC) immunoperoxidase method was employed for antibody detection. Individual tumors were considered positive if more than 10% of the cells comprising the neoplasm displayed immunoreactive staining. Staining intensity was graded 1+ to 3+ and distribution graded as focal (10-30% of the cells), intermediate (30-60% of the cells), or diffuse (>60% of the cells). RESULTS: C-kit was positive in 12 (75%) of the 16 leiomyosarcomas. The staining was 3+ and diffuse in the majority of the positive tumors. C-kit expression was not detected in any of the 8 leiomyomas. Two of the 3 high-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas displayed c-kit positivity. Staining was diffuse and 3+ in both of these tumors. Expression of c-kit was observed in only 3 of the 11 low-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas. CONCLUSIONS: C-kit is expressed in uterine leiomyosarcomas and endometrial stromal sarcomas. Adjunctive diagnostic studies using c-kit may be useful in distinguishing leiomyosarcomas from benign leiomyomas in uterine tumors that offer uncharacteristic features. Furthermore, studies should investigate the prospect of treating these malignant tumors with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Wang, Lina', 'Felix, Juan C', 'Lee, Joyce L', 'Tan, Peik Y', 'Tourgeman, David E', ""O'Meara, Anne T"", 'Amezcua, Charles A']","['Wang L', 'Felix JC', 'Lee JL', 'Tan PY', 'Tourgeman DE', ""O'Meara AT"", 'Amezcua CA']","['Department of Pathology, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Gynecol Oncol,Gynecologic oncology,0365304,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leiomyosarcoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Sarcoma, Endometrial Stromal/genetics/metabolism', 'Uterine Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology']",2003/08/02 05:00,2003/09/03 05:00,['2003/08/02 05:00'],"['2003/08/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gynecol Oncol. 2003 Aug;90(2):402-6. doi: 10.1016/s0090-8258(03)00274-9.,,"['S0090825803002749 [pii]', '10.1016/s0090-8258(03)00274-9 [doi]']",,,,,,['Gynecol Oncol. 2004 Jun;93(3):718.

Besides histones, many nonhistone proteins are also acetylated in vivo. Aberrant acetylation has been linked to the development of various human diseases. Through acetylating histone and nonhistone proteins, histone acetyltransferases (HATs) play fundamental roles in regulating chromatin remodeling, transcription, and other nuclear processes. Known HATs belong to several groups, including the GCN5/PCAF, p300/CBP, and MYST families. ESA1, SAS3, MOF, TIP60, HBO1, MOZ, and MORF are the MYST family members with demonstrated HAT activity. The MOZ and MORF genes are rearranged by chromosome abnormalities associated with several types of leukemia, so these two HATs have been implicated in leukemogenesis. Compared with p300, CBP, and PCAF, much less is known about MOZ and MORF. To elucidate the function and regulation of these two interesting HATs, we have conducted their initial characterization. Here we describe the expression, purification, and activity analysis of MOZ and MORF. For comparison, we also include the procedure for expression and purification of PCAF.

Although some of these methods have achieved a high degree of accuracy, they generally lack transparency in their classification process. This, however, is crucial for the application in the medical field. In order to overcome this obstacle, we used knowledge-based neurocomputing (KBN), since KBN seeks to gain knowledge that is comprehensible to humans. In particular, we applied evolving fuzzy neural networks (EFuNNs) to classify cancer tissue, which is illustrated on the case studies of leukaemia and colon cancer. EFuNNs belong to the evolving connectionist system paradigm (ECOS) that has been recently introduced. They are well suited for adaptive learning and knowledge discovery. Fuzzy logic rules can be extracted from the trained networks and offer knowledge about the classification process in an easily accessible form.

Moreover, the degree of matching between extracted rules and neural network responses is 100% on training examples. We applied single DIMLP networks to 17 data sets related to medical diagnosis and medical prognosis problems. Results based on 10-fold cross-validation showed that the DIMLP model was on average as accurate as standard multi-layer perceptrons (MLP). Furthermore, DIMLP networks were significantly more accurate than CN2 on eight problems, whereas only on one problem CN2 was better than DIMLP. Finally, a non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis problem based on classification of electrophoresis gels was defined. It turned out that ensembles of DIMLP networks were significantly more accurate than CN2 (96.1% +/- 1.4 versus 82.7% +/- 4.0).

RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-one patients (100 males, 81 females) with a mean age of 72.5 years were included. Twenty-nine patients, 19 males and 10 females (16%, 95% CI: 12.0-24.0) had CAD. These included 6/53 (11.3%, 95% CI: 1.5-20.2) patients with CML, 1/26 (3.8%, 95% CI: -4.4 to 12.8) patients with PV, 5/30 (16.7%, 95% CI: 2.5-30.8) patients with ET, 3/7 (42.9%, 95% CI: 12.3-87.7) patients with MF and 14/65 (21.5%, 95% CI: 13.1-37.8) patients with co-existent MPS. Comparing the risk of CAD with CML as a baseline, MF had an OR of 8.2 (p < 0.01, 95% CI: 1.7-39), PV-0.4 (p = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.04-3.2), ET-1.6 (p = 0.7, 95% CI: 0.43-6.2) and patients with co-existent MPS-2.8 (p=0.07, 95% CI: 0.91-8.6). However, after adjusting for age, sex, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension and tobacco use, the difference in the prevalence of CAD between the various categories of MPS was not significant. CONCLUSION: Contrary to conventional belief, we did not find an increased prevalence of CAD in patients with either PV or ET. In fact, patients with MF had a significantly higher prevalence of CAD. However, this difference appears to be due to the increased age at diagnosis of MF. The conventional risk factors for CAD appear to be the major determinants of CAD among patients with MPS.","['Ganti, Apar Kishor', 'Potti, Anil', 'Koka, Vijay Kishore', 'Pervez, Hassan', 'Mehdi, Syed A']","['Ganti AK', 'Potti A', 'Koka VK', 'Pervez H', 'Mehdi SA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of North Dakota School of Medicine, 1919 Elm Street N., Fargo, ND 58102, USA. aganti@medicine.nodak.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Coronary Disease/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*complications', 'Polycythemia Vera/complications', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/complications', 'Risk Factors', 'Syndrome', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/complications']",2003/08/02 05:00,2004/04/21 05:00,['2003/08/02 05:00'],"['2003/08/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2003 May 1;110(2-3):83-6. doi: 10.1016/s0049-3848(03)00290-1.,,"['S0049384803002901 [pii]', '10.1016/s0049-3848(03)00290-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPA-1-deficient mice developed a spectrum of myeloid disorders that resembled human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic phase, CML in blast crisis, and myelodysplastic syndrome as well as anemia. Preleukemic SPA-1-deficient mice revealed selective expansion of marrow pluripotential hematopoietic progenitors, which showed abnormal Rap1GTP accumulation. Overexpression of an active form of Rap1 promoted the proliferation of normal hematopoietic progenitors, while SPA-1 overexpression markedly suppressed it. Furthermore, restoring SPA-1 gene in a SPA-1-deficient leukemic blast cell line resulted in the dissolution of Rap1GTP accumulation and concomitant loss of the leukemogenicity in vivo. These results unveiled a role of Rap1 in myeloproliferative stem cell disorders and a tumor suppressor function of SPA-1.","['Ishida, Daisuke', 'Kometani, Kohei', 'Yang, Hailin', 'Kakugawa, Kiyokazu', 'Masuda, Kyoko', 'Iwai, Kazuhiro', 'Suzuki, Misao', 'Itohara, Shigeyoshi', 'Nakahata, Tatsutoshi', 'Hiai, Hiroshi', 'Kawamoto, Hiroshi', 'Hattori, Masakazu', 'Minato, Nagahiro']","['Ishida D', 'Kometani K', 'Yang H', 'Kakugawa K', 'Masuda K', 'Iwai K', 'Suzuki M', 'Itohara S', 'Nakahata T', 'Hiai H', 'Kawamoto H', 'Hattori M', 'Minato N']","['Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University, 606-8501, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Cell,Cancer cell,101130617,"['0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (SIPA1 protein, human)', '0 (Sipa1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', '*GTPase-Activating Proteins', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/metabolism/prevention & control', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism']",2003/08/02 05:00,2004/03/10 05:00,['2003/08/02 05:00'],"['2003/08/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Cell. 2003 Jul;4(1):55-65. doi: 10.1016/s1535-6108(03)00163-6.,,"['S1535610803001636 [pii]', '10.1016/s1535-6108(03)00163-6 [doi]']",,,,,,['Cancer Cell. 2003 Jul;4(1):3-4.

Short-term safety and efficacy data were favorable. Experience with 6-TG in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia raised long-term safety concerns when implicated in nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) of the liver and portal hypertension. The aim of this study was to describe the association between 6-TG and NRH in IBD. METHODS: Liver chemistries and complete blood counts were monitored, and patients were encouraged to undergo liver biopsy. Clinical data were collected by chart review, and associations were tested by univariate and multivariable analyses. Patients were classified based on the presence (group 1) or absence (group 2) of laboratory abnormalities. RESULTS: Laboratory abnormalities occurred in 29 of 111 patients (26%). Elevations of liver enzymes and a decrease in platelet counts (<200,000) were most commonly observed. Male gender (odds ratio, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.1-7.3; P < 0.03) and preferential 6-methylmercaptopurine production on 6-mercaptopurine/azathioprine (odds ratio, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.2-7.4; P < 0.04) were independently associated with laboratory abnormalities. No association was seen with duration of 6-TG treatment, cumulative dose, or 6-TG nucleotide levels. The median increase in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase levels was 39, 30, and 75 U/L, respectively, in group 1, and the median decrease in platelet count was 115,000 in group 1 versus 7000 in group 2 (P < 0.001). NRH occurred in 76% of patients undergoing biopsy in group 1 and 33% in group 2. CONCLUSIONS: NRH is a common finding in 6-TG-treated patients with IBD. The progression or reversibility of NRH remains unknown. Our findings suggest that 6-TG should not be considered as therapy for patients with IBD.","['Dubinsky, Marla C', 'Vasiliauskas, Eric A', 'Singh, Hardeep', 'Abreu, Maria T', 'Papadakis, Kostas A', 'Tran, Tram', 'Martin, Paul', 'Vierling, John M', 'Geller, Stephen A', 'Targan, Stephan R', 'Poordad, Fred F']","['Dubinsky MC', 'Vasiliauskas EA', 'Singh H', 'Abreu MT', 'Papadakis KA', 'Tran T', 'Martin P', 'Vierling JM', 'Geller SA', 'Targan SR', 'Poordad FF']","['Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 8635 West Third Street, Suite 1165W, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA. dubinskym@csmc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,0374630,['FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/*drug therapy', 'Liver/*drug effects/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Thioguanine/*adverse effects']",2003/08/02 05:00,2003/09/26 05:00,['2003/08/02 05:00'],"['2003/08/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gastroenterology. 2003 Aug;125(2):298-303. doi: 10.1016/s0016-5085(03)00938-7.,,"['S0016508503009387 [pii]', '10.1016/s0016-5085(03)00938-7 [doi]']",,,,,,['Gastroenterology. 2004 Mar;126(3):940-1; author reply 941-2.

DESIGN: This observational cohort study included a questionnaire on supplement use before HSCT. Nonrelapse mortality, recurrence/relapse, and mortality or relapse (the inverse of disease-free survival) were followed to two years. Subjects/Setting Persons receiving HSCT at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center between September 1994 and December 1997 were eligible (N=1,182). Statistical Analyses Performed Descriptive statistics and univariate and Cox regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Sixty-six percent of patients used supplements (31% vitamin C, 19% vitamin E, and 20% herbs or others preparations). Vitamin C at > or =500 mg/day was inversely associated with recurrence among persons with breast cancer (RR=0.11; 95% CI, 0.02-0.89; P=.03). However, among persons with acute leukemia, vitamin C at > or =500 mg/day was positively associated with nonrelapse mortality (RR=2.25; 95% CI, 1.33-3.83; P=.01) and mortality or relapse (RR=1.63; 95% CI, 1.09-2.44; P=.01), respectively. Vitamin E at > or =400 IU/day was positively associated with mortality or relapse (RR=1.77; 95% CI, 1.06 -2.96; P=.02). Applications/Conclusions Though this work was observational, the results suggest supplemental vitamin C before therapy may be beneficial in persons with breast cancer but both vitamin C and vitamin E may increase risk in persons with acute leukemia receiving HSCT.

Both processes are closely associated with the t(9;22) chromosomal translocation that creates the BCR/ABL fusion gene in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their progeny. Chronic myelogenous leukemia is therefore classified as an HSC disorder in which a clone of multipotent HSCs is likely to be malignantly transformed, although direct evidence for malignant t(9;22)+ HSCs is lacking. To test whether HSC malignancy is required, we generated hMRP8p210BCR/ABL transgenic mice in which expression of BCR/ABL is absent in HSCs and targeted exclusively to myeloid progenitors and their myelomonocytic progeny. Four of 13 BCR/ABL transgenic founders developed a chronic MPD, but only one progressed to blast crisis. To address whether additional oncogenic events are required for progression to acute disease, we crossed hMRP8p210BCR/ABL mice to apoptosis-resistant hMRP8BCL-2 mice. Of 18 double-transgenic animals, 9 developed acute myeloid leukemias that were transplantable to wild-type recipients. Taken together, these data indicate that a MPD can arise in mice without expression of BCR/ABL in HSCs and that additional mutations inhibiting programmed cell death may be critical in the transition of this disease to blast-crisis leukemia.","['Jaiswal, Siddhartha', 'Traver, David', 'Miyamoto, Toshihiro', 'Akashi, Koichi', 'Lagasse, Eric', 'Weissman, Irving L']","['Jaiswal S', 'Traver D', 'Miyamoto T', 'Akashi K', 'Lagasse E', 'Weissman IL']","['Departments of Pathology and Developmental Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, abl', '*Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*metabolism/pathology']",2003/08/02 05:00,2003/10/30 05:00,['2003/08/02 05:00'],"['2003/08/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Aug 19;100(17):10002-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1633833100.

To address how MAP4 discriminates between destabilization of microtubules by these two mechanisms, we have evaluated the combined phenotypes of MAP4 coexpressed with Op18/stathmin family member derivatives with either catastrophe-promoting or sequestering activities. This approach relies on the finding that overexpression of MAP4 alone stabilizes microtubules during all phases of the cell cycle in human leukemia cells, and causes a potent mitotic block and a dramatic, previously unobserved, phenotype characterized by large monoastral spindles. Coexpression of either catastrophe-promoting or tubulin-sequestration-specific Op18 derivatives was found to modulate the activity of ectopic MAP4 during mitosis, but with differential functional outcome. Interestingly, the tubulin-sequestering derivative suppressed the monoastral mitotic phenotype of MAP4 (i.e. coexpression facilitated the formation of functional spindles). To evaluate whether this phenotypic suppression could be explained by tubulin-sequestration-dependent modulation of MAP4 activity, a plasma-membrane-targeted, tubulin-sequestering chimera was constructed to decrease the cytosolic free tubulin concentration substantially. This chimera likewise suppressed the monoastral phenotype caused by overexpression of MAP4, suggesting a direct downregulation of MAP4 activity by reduced free tubulin concentrations.","['Holmfeldt, Per', 'Brattsand, Goran', 'Gullberg, Martin']","['Holmfeldt P', 'Brattsand G', 'Gullberg M']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Umea, S-901 87 Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (MAP4)', '0 (Microtubule Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STMN1 protein, human)', '0 (Stathmin)', '0 (Tubulin)']",IM,"['Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interphase/*physiology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', '*Microtubule Proteins', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Microtubules/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Spindle Apparatus/*metabolism', 'Stathmin', 'Tubulin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/08/02 05:00,2004/05/29 05:00,['2003/08/02 05:00'],"['2003/08/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2003 Sep 15;116(Pt 18):3701-11. doi: 10.1242/jcs.00685.

AIM: To develop a restriction enzyme analysis (REA) based method for routine detection of BAX promoter SNP in a clinical laboratory. METHODS: The BAX promoter was analysed in duplicate by REA and sequencing in 90 samples (from 45 patients with CLL, 43 controls, and two cell lines). The promoter region was amplified, digested with restriction endonucleases (Aci I and Tau I), and separated by gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: After digestion, the normal GG genotype samples produced three distinct bands. The homozygous AA replacement abolished the cleavage site, resulting in a single band. Although the heterozygous samples produced three bands, the two smaller visible bands were reduced in intensity (> 50%). The test characteristics of Aci I REA were better than those of Tau I REA, in terms of sensitivity (100% v 77.8%), specificity (98.6% v 92.3%), positive predictive value (95.03% v 87.4%), and negative predictive value (100% v 85.83%).

Mitochondria may have important roles in the death process. Therefore, we investigated the mitochondrial contribution in cell death induced by a modified fatty acid, tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA), which cannot be beta-oxidized. TTA treatment induced apoptosis in IPC-81 leukemia cells via depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential (deltapsi) and early release of cytochrome c, accompanied by depletion of mitochondrial glutathione. Caspase-3 activation and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) occurred at a late stage, but the broad-spectra caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk did not block TTA-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of Bcl-2 partially prevented TTA-induced apoptosis, whereas cAMP-induced cell death was completely blocked. In conclusion, TTA seems to trigger apoptosis through mitochondrial-mediated mechanisms and selective modulation of the mitochondrial redox equilibrium.","['Tronstad, Karl Johan', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Krakstad, Camilla', 'Berge, Kjetil', 'Brustugun, Odd Terje', 'Doskeland, Stein Ove', 'Berge, Rolf Kristian']","['Tronstad KJ', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Krakstad C', 'Berge K', 'Brustugun OT', 'Doskeland SO', 'Berge RK']","['Section of Medical Biochemistry, Institute of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, N-5021 Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Chem Biol,Chemistry & biology,9500160,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Sulfides)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', ""41941-66-6 (8-((4-chlorophenyl)thio)cyclic-3',5'-AMP)"", '7ZU5I25S2O (1-(carboxymethylthio)tetradecane)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Cyclic AMP/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Cytosol/drug effects/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, bcl-2/genetics', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Immunoassay', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Subcellular Fractions/drug effects/metabolism', 'Sulfides/*pharmacology', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology']",2003/08/02 05:00,2003/12/13 05:00,['2003/08/02 05:00'],"['2003/08/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chem Biol. 2003 Jul;10(7):609-18. doi: 10.1016/s1074-5521(03)00142-x.,,"['S107455210300142X [pii]', '10.1016/s1074-5521(03)00142-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A novel class I beta-tubulin mutation, A231T, that affects microtubule stability but does not alter paclitaxel binding, was identified. The 300 nM selected cells acquired a second mutation, Q292E, situated near the M loop of class I beta-tubulin.

Primary repair is appropriate for only about 85% of injuries, and outcome is worse following secondary nerve repair, partly owing to the reduced regenerative potential of chronically axotomised neurons. Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a gp-130 neurocytokine that is thought to act as an 'injury factor', triggering the early-injury phenotype within neurons and potentially boosting their regenerative potential after secondary nerve repair. At 2-4 months after sciatic nerve axotomy in the rat, 1 cm gaps were repaired using either nerve isografts or poly-3-hydroxybutyrate conduits containing a calcium alginate and fibronectin hydrogel. Regeneration was determined by quantitative immunohistochemistry 6 weeks after repair, and the effect of incorporating recombinant LIF (100 ng/ml) into the conduits was assessed. LIF increased the regeneration distance in repairs performed after both 2 months (69%, P=0.019) and 4 months (123%, P=0.021), and was statistically comparable to nerve graft. The total area of axonal immunostaining increased by 21% (P>0.05) and 63% (P>0.05), respectively. Percentage immunostaining area was not increased in the 2 months group, but increased by 93% in the repairs performed 4 months after axotomy. Exogenous LIF, therefore, has a potential role in promoting peripheral nerve regeneration after secondary repair, and can be effectively delivered within poly-3-hydroxybutyrate bioartificial conduits used for nerve repair.","['McKay Hart, A', 'Wiberg, M', 'Terenghi, G']","['McKay Hart A', 'Wiberg M', 'Terenghi G']","['Blond-McIndoe Centre, Royal Free and University College Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Plast Surg,British journal of plastic surgery,2984714R,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxybutyrates)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Polyesters)', '26063-00-3 (poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Bioprosthesis', 'Graft Survival', 'Growth Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Hydroxybutyrates/therapeutic use', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Nerve Regeneration/*drug effects', 'Polyesters/therapeutic use', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sciatic Nerve/*injuries/physiology/surgery', 'Time Factors']",2003/08/02 05:00,2003/11/05 05:00,['2003/08/02 05:00'],"['2003/08/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Plast Surg. 2003 Jul;56(5):444-50. doi: 10.1016/s0007-1226(03)00134-6.,,"['S0007122603001346 [pii]', '10.1016/s0007-1226(03)00134-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The genes were screened through the analysis of the difference in two gene expression profiles. RESULTS: The analysis of gene expression profiles indicates that 9 genes were up-regulated and 37 genes were down-regulated.

METHOD: We present a patient with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) presenting with an acutely ischaemic lower limb. Large vessel thrombosis is a rare presentation of APL. We reviewed the literature on the coagulopathy of APL and discuss the pathology and current treatment options. DISCUSSION: Disordered haemostasis is typical of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (FAB M3) and relates to the intrinsic properties of the blast cells as well as thrombocytopenia from bone marrow involvement. Expression of procoagulants, stimulation of cytokines and alterations in endothelial cell anticoagulant properties initiate a disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) resulting in the typical clinical and laboratory findings in APL. The promyelocytes are characterized by the balanced reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17. All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) induces differentiation in these cells, revolutionizing the treatment of APL. CONCLUSION: Unexpected limb ischaemia in a young, apparently healthy patient might be the presenting symptom of an underlying haematological disorder such as APL. A thorough haematological investigation should be performed prior to contemplating surgery. New treatment strategies based on knowledge of the molecular biology of APL has improved the prognosis of patients suffering from APL.","['Kalk, E', 'Goede, A', 'Rose, P']","['Kalk E', 'Goede A', 'Rose P']","['Departments of Haematology and Surgery, Warwick Hospital, Warwick, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Clin Lab Haematol,Clinical and laboratory haematology,7907061,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.26 (cancer procoagulant)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Amputation', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Arterial Occlusive Diseases/*etiology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Gangrene', 'Humans', 'Intermittent Claudication/etiology', 'Ischemia/*etiology', 'Leg/*blood supply', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', '*Popliteal Artery', 'Remission Induction', 'Smoking/adverse effects', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Thrombophilia/etiology/physiopathology', 'Thromboplastin/metabolism', 'Thrombosis/*etiology', 'Toes/pathology/surgery', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",2003/08/02 05:00,2004/04/16 05:00,['2003/08/02 05:00'],"['2003/08/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Lab Haematol. 2003 Aug;25(4):267-70. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2257.2003.00526.x.,,"['526 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2257.2003.00526.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have clarified their biological and clinical manifestation gradually. However, some cases with NK malignancies still remain difficult to diagnose and differentiate into their subtypes in the absence of a distinct diagnostic hallmark, especially at initial presentation. We describe herein five patients with NK leukaemias with respect to the clinical, cytological, immunological and cytogenetic characteristics, varied among each case. Cytologically, two aggressive NK cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ANKL/L) cases were a morphologically hypogranular variant form. Clinically, one with ANKL/L was presented as haemophagocytic syndrome without leukaemic infiltration. Systemic chemotherapy resulted in complete remission in one ANKL/L and two blastic NK cell leukaemia/lymphoma (BNKL/L) patients; however, a good long-term outcome was achieved in only one CD4-positive BNKL/L patient with allogenic bone marrow transplantation. Cytogenetic analysis revealed that recurrent chromosomal aberration was rare; however, two had aberrations at 10p11 and 11q13. From these findings, we conclude that comprehensive individual studies should be carried out in these patients to obtain a correct diagnosis and to design an optimal therapeutic approach.","['Kuroda, J', 'Kimura, S', 'Kobayashi, Y', 'Jyoko, N', 'Kamitsuji, Y', 'Murotani, Y', 'Fukuda, W', 'Akaogi, T', 'Hayashi, H', 'Yoshikawa, T', 'Maekawa, T']","['Kuroda J', 'Kimura S', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Jyoko N', 'Kamitsuji Y', 'Murotani Y', 'Fukuda W', 'Akaogi T', 'Hayashi H', 'Yoshikawa T', 'Maekawa T']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Lab Haematol,Clinical and laboratory haematology,7907061,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/chemistry/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/*pathology', 'Peroxidase/analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/genetics/*pathology', 'Prognosis']",2003/08/02 05:00,2004/04/16 05:00,['2003/08/02 05:00'],"['2003/08/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Lab Haematol. 2003 Aug;25(4):239-45. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2257.2003.00528.x.,,"['528 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2257.2003.00528.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These two proteins, which are inactivated in some human malignancies, are possible tumour suppressor candidates. In this study, we investigated the expression of p16INK4A and p14ARF mRNAs in haematological malignancies. We studied eight normal bone marrow samples, three reactive granulocytic hyperplasia patients, and 21 haematological malignancy patients, including seven acute myelogenous leukaemia, four acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, five myelodysplastic syndrome, five chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML). p16INK4A and p14ARF mRNA expression was assayed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Normal bone marrows and reactive granulocytic hyperplasia showed barely detectable expression of either mRNA. In contrast, p16INK4A and p14ARF mRNA expression was abnormally increased in patients with haematological malignancies. Especially in CML, overexpression of p16INK4A and p14ARF mRNAs was more frequent than in controls (80 and 60%, respectively, P < 0.05). In conclusion, p16INK4A and p14ARF mRNA expression was frequently increased in haematological malignancies, especially in CML. We suggest that overexpression of these mRNAs may be related to the pathogenesis of haematological malignancies.","['Lee, Y K', 'Park, J-Y', 'Kang, H J', 'Cho, H C']","['Lee YK', 'Park JY', 'Kang HJ', 'Cho HC']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Hallym University College of Medicine, Anyang, Korea. lyoungk@hallym.or.kr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Lab Haematol,Clinical and laboratory haematology,7907061,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, p16', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2003/08/02 05:00,2004/04/16 05:00,['2003/08/02 05:00'],"['2003/08/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Lab Haematol. 2003 Aug;25(4):233-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2257.2003.00520.x.,,"['520 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2257.2003.00520.x [doi]']",,,,,,['Clin Lab Haematol. 2004 Aug;26(4):303.

In many cases these expression patterns can be linked to the tumour cells normal developmental counterpart, and represent distinct disease subgroups with different clinical presentations and outcomes. The technology has also identified genes that may be important in tumour cell biology including key genes in cell proliferation, adhesion, apoptosis, and the development of drug resistance.

However, studies evaluating the usefulness of FC in serous cavity effusions (SCE) are few. We performed a retrospective review of 115 consecutive SCE with concurrent FC analysis, comparing the provisional cytopathologic diagnosis (PCD), i.e., before the FC results were added, with final diagnoses as modified by subsequent FC immunophenotyping. The predominant clinical indication for the FC analysis was the presence of a spontaneous SCE in a patient with a history of malignant lymphoma. Three- or four-color analysis was performed using antibodies against CD45, CD71, CD33, CD22, CD19, CD20, kappa, lambda, CD5, CD3, and CD56. The PCD was benign in 47%, atypical in 16%, and malignant in 37% of cases. The latter category consisted mostly of malignant lymphoma (n = 32), but also included acute lymphoblastic leukemia (1 case), T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (2 cases), acute myelogenous leukemia (1 case), multiple myeloma (1 case), Hodgkin's lymphoma (1 case), sarcoma (1 case), and adenocarcinoma (4 cases). In 18 cases (16%), the PCD was later modified by the FC results from atypical/suspicious to benign (8) and from benign or atypical/suspicious to malignant (10 cases). The latter group included acute natural killer (NK) cell leukemia (1 case), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (1 case), mantle cell lymphoma (2 cases), follicular lymphoma (3 cases), angioimmunoblastic lymphoma (1 case), large cell lymphoma (1 case), and multiple myeloma (1 case). As expected, FC was noncontributory in cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma and nonlymphoid malignancies. In summary, immunophenotyping by FC modified the PCD significantly in 16% of SCE, permitting appropriate cancer staging and management. The above data underscore the importance of FC as an adjunct to cytomorphology in SCE.","['Czader, Magdalena', 'Ali, Syed Z']","['Czader M', 'Ali SZ']","['Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland 21287, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Diagn Cytopathol,Diagnostic cytopathology,8506895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Ascitic Fluid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', '*Biopsy, Fine-Needle', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Image Cytometry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Pericardial Effusion/metabolism/*pathology', 'Pleural Effusion/metabolism/*pathology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies']",2003/07/31 05:00,2004/03/17 05:00,['2003/07/31 05:00'],"['2003/07/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/31 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Diagn Cytopathol. 2003 Aug;29(2):74-8. doi: 10.1002/dc.10307.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/dc.10307 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, there have been several reports concerning the effects of statins on cancer cells including liver, colon, leukemia, malignant B, stomach, and breast cells. In this study, the in vitro effects of pravastatin on human myeloma cells and the factors closely related to its growth inhibitory effects were examined. Although concentrations were higher than those used clinically, 4 out of 10 myeloma lines showed growth inhibition by pravastatin. The study of factors related to the inhibition indicated IL-6 is important. Indeed, rhIL-6 abolished pravastatin-induced growth inhibition in KMS-21BM cells which did not express IL-6.

To investigate their anti-cancer effect, induction of apoptosis was tested in human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60), which is a valid model for testing antileukemic or general antitumoral compounds. Of six anthocyanidins representing the aglycons of most of anthocyanins, only those with an ortho-dihydroxyphenyl structure on the B-ring induce apoptosis, suggesting that the ortho-dihydroxyphenyl structure of anthocyanidins may contribute to the induction of apoptosis. Delphinidin, the most potent inducer, causes apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The efficacious induction of apoptosis was observed at 100 micro M for 6 h. Concomitant with the apoptosis, delphinidin stimulates JNK pathway activation including JNK phosphorylation and c-jun gene expression, and activates caspase-3. Antioxidants including N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and catalase effectively block delphinidin-induced JNK phosphorylation, caspase-3 activation, and DNA fragmentation. Moreover, anthocyanidins directly cause HL-60 cells to generate intracellular hydrogen peroxide. Thus, anthocyanidins may trigger an apoptotic death program through an oxidative stress-involved JNK signaling pathway. The induction of apoptosis by anthocyanins may be the pivotal mechanism by which its chemopreventive action against cancer is based.","['Hou, De-Xing', 'Ose, Takashi', 'Lin, Shigang', 'Harazoro, Kazuhiro', 'Imamura, Izumi', 'Kubo, Mayumi', 'Uto, Takuhiro', 'Terahara, Norihiko', 'Yoshimoto, Makoto', 'Fujii, Makoto']","['Hou DX', 'Ose T', 'Lin S', 'Harazoro K', 'Imamura I', 'Kubo M', 'Uto T', 'Terahara N', 'Yoshimoto M', 'Fujii M']","['Department of Biochemical Science and Technology, Faculty of Agriculture, Kagoshima University, Korimoto 1-21-24, Kagoshima 890-0065, Japan. hou@chem.agri.kagoshima-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Anthocyanins)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EM6MD4AEHE (delphinidin)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Anthocyanins/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Models, Chemical', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Time Factors']",2003/07/31 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2003/07/31 05:00'],"['2003/07/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/31 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2003 Sep;23(3):705-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to gain insight into the gene expression activities in AML, we carried out a gene expression profiling study with 21 AML samples using cDNA microarrays, focusing on acute promyelocytic leukemia with specific translocation t(15;17)(q22;q12) [French-American-British or FAB-M3 with t(15;17)] and AML without maturation (FAB-M1) characterized by morphologically and phenotypically immature AML blasts and no recurrent chromosomal abnormalities. Using a multivariate sigma-classifier algorithm, we identified 33 strong feature genes that distinguish FAB-M3 with t(15;17) from other AML samples, and 24 strong feature genes that classify FAB-M1. A direct comparison between FAB-M3 with t(15;17) and FAB-M1 led to selection of 13 strong feature genes. Those genes include some known to be related to leukemogenesis and cell differentiation. RIN1, a gene in the ras pathway, was up-regulated in FAB-M3 with t(15;17). Growth factor-binding protein 2 gene was down-regulated in FAB-M1. Huntingtin gene was up-regulated in FAB-M1.

Results of the PAARKA study.,235-44,"An association has been reported between thrombotic events and the use of L-asparaginase (ASP) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The mechanism for thrombosis is likely related to an acquired antithrombin deficiency. Since a primary prophylaxis using antithrombin concentrates may prevent thrombosis, the PARKAA (Prophylactic Antithrombin replacement in kids with ALL treated with L-asparaginase) study was performed. The objectives of PARKAA were to determine if there was a trend to efficacy and safety of antithrombin treatment as assessed by 1) incidence of thrombosis 2) incidence of bleeding and 3) plasma markers of endogenous thrombin generation as surrogate outcomes for thrombosis. The study was not powered to answer the question of efficacy and safety, but rather to detect a trend. PARKAA was an open, randomised, controlled study in children with ALL being treated with ASP. Children were randomised to receive antithrombin infusions or no antithrombin treatment. All thrombotic events were confirmed using bilateral venography, ultrasound, echocardiography and MRI. The incidence of thrombosis in patients treated with antithrombin was 28% (95% CI 10-46%), compared to 37% (95% CI 24-49%) in the non treated arm. Two minor bleeds occurred in patients in the treated arm, but were not considered to be related to antithrombin. No significant differences were seen in plasma markers by the treatment group. In conclusion, treatment with antithrombin concentrate shows a trend to efficacy and safety. In contrast, there was no difference in surrogate markers for thrombosis. Carefully designed clinical trials are needed to test the efficacy and safety of antithrombin in this population.","['Mitchell, Lesley', 'Andrew, Maureen', 'Hanna, Kim', 'Abshire, Thomas', 'Halton, Jacqueline', 'Wu, John', 'Anderson, Ron', 'Cherrick, Irene', 'Desai, Sunil', 'Mahoney, Donald', 'McCusker, Patricia', 'Chait, Peter', 'Abdolell, Mohamed', 'de Veber, Gabrielle', 'Mikulis, David']","['Mitchell L', 'Andrew M', 'Hanna K', 'Abshire T', 'Halton J', 'Wu J', 'Anderson R', 'Cherrick I', 'Desai S', 'Mahoney D', 'McCusker P', 'Chait P', 'Abdolell M', 'de Veber G', 'Mikulis D']","['Population Health Sciences, Hospital For Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Assays were performed to determine cell cycle kinetics, proliferation, apoptotic DNA-fragmentation and caspase-3-activity after 12, 24 and 48 h. Ellagic acid significantly potentiated the effects of quercetin (at 5 and 10 micro mol/L each) in the reduction of proliferation and viability and the induction of apoptosis. Significant alterations in cell cycle kinetics were also observed. The synergy was confirmed by an isobolographic analysis of the cell proliferation data.

After failure of interferon alpha and hydroxy-urea therapy, a durable and complete clinical and biological remission was induced by imatinib mesylate within 3 weeks. CONCLUSION: Imatinib mesylate, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases appears to be a very safe and effective treatment for this type of hypereosinophilia.

Here, we demonstrate that, like c-Abl, Bcr-Abl is negatively regulated through its SH3 domain. Kinase activity, transformation, and leukemogenesis by Bcr-Abl are greatly impaired by mutations of the Bcr coiled-coil domain that disrupt oligomerization, but restored by an SH3 point mutation that blocks ligand binding or a complementary mutation at the intramolecular SH3 binding site defined in c-Abl. Phosphorylation of tyrosines in the activation loop of the catalytic domain and the linker between the SH2 and catalytic domains (SH2-CD linker) is dependent on oligomerization and required for leukemogenesis. These results suggest that Bcr-Abl has a monomeric, unphosphorylated state with the SH3 domain engaged intramolecularly to Pro1124 in the SH2-CD linker, the form that is sensitive to the inhibitor imatinib (STI-571). The sole function of the coiled-coil domain is to disrupt the autoinhibited conformation through oligomerization and intermolecular autophosphorylation.","['Smith, Kristen M', 'Yacobi, Rinat', 'Van Etten, Richard A']","['Smith KM', 'Yacobi R', 'Van Etten RA']","['The Center for Blood Research and Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell,Molecular cell,9802571,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Alanine/genetics/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence/genetics', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Catalytic Domain/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Eukaryotic Cells/*enzymology', 'Feedback, Physiological/drug effects/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation/drug effects/genetics', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proline/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/drug effects/genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2003/07/31 05:00,2003/09/06 05:00,['2003/07/31 05:00'],"['2003/07/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/31 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell. 2003 Jul;12(1):27-37. doi: 10.1016/s1097-2765(03)00274-0.,,"['S1097-2765(03)00274-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s1097-2765(03)00274-0 [doi]']",,,"['R01 CA090576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007623/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL07623/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,PMC7128750,,,,,,,

Human leukemia K562 cells were cultured and infected with ADV-TSP1(f) or ADV-LacZ. PBS was used as control. TSP1(f) expression/secretion by these infected K562 cells was demonstrated using Western blot analysis. MTT assay was performed to determine the effect of ADV-TSP1(f) infection on K562 cell growth kinetics. Eighteen female Balb/c nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously with human leukemia K562 cells. When the diameter of the tumor reached 5 approximately 7 mm the rats were randomly divided into 3 groups of 6 rats injected intratumorally with ADV-TSP1(f), ADV-LacZ, and PBS respectively. The volume of K562 xenografts was measured every three days during the 3-week treatment. By the end of the 21st day the mice were killed and the tumors were taken to undergo histological examination. The intratumoral microvessel density (MVD) was determined by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: TSP-1f was expressed and secreted efficiently by ADV-TSP1(f)-infected K562 cells. Three weeks after the initial treatment, the volume of K562 xenografts in the mice treated with ADV-TSP1(f), ADV-LacZ, and PBS was (1,108 +/- 179) mm(3), (4,518 +/- 452) mm(3), and (4,666 +/- 458) mm(3) respectively (P < 0.01).

METHODS: 4 ml bone marrow was extracted from 100 AL patients and 10 normal controls to isolate the mononuclear cells (MNCs). The cyclin A mRNA levels in these MNCs were measured by RT-PCR. The cyclin A protein level and cell cycle in 75 randomly selected AL patients and 10 normal controls were examined by flow cytometric analysis. RESULTS: (1) The distribution of cyclin A protein was normal in cell cycle in AL patients. The positive rates of cyclin A protein and mRNA were 66.7% and 59%, significantly higher than those in the normal controls (0 and 1.4% respectively, both P < 0.01). The median expression levels of cyclin A protein and mRNA of cyclin A in AL patients were 18.5% and 0.539 +/- 0.490 respectively, significantly higher than those in the normal controls (both P < 0.01).

Etoposide, a DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor, is a significant risk factor for developing leukaemia; the risk appears to be correlated with the total dose given. Patients receiving cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy for testicular cancer also appear to have a higher relative risk for developing second non-germ cell malignancies; the greatest risks for therapy-related solid tumours were seen with a combination of radiation therapy plus chemotherapy. Long-term vascular toxicities associated with chemotherapy include Raynaud's phenomenon, acute myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events. Bleomycin is thought to be the most important drug in the pathogenesis of Raynaud's phenomenon, while cisplatin is the most likely agent involved in myocardial infarction. Peripheral neuropathy is the most common form of neurotoxicity observed with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Risk factors for the development of neural damage include a high cumulative dose of cisplatin, the use of vinblastine and the concomitant development of Raynaud's phenomenon. Cisplatin is also well known to cause significant nephrotoxicity. Approximately 25% of patients present with azoospermia after undergoing combination chemotherapy with a follow up of 2-5 years. Physician awareness of complications associated with chemotherapy is vital to maximise efficacy, minimise toxicity, and preserve quality of life after treatment. Sperm cryopreservation should be considered for patients who desire children. Close monitoring during therapy allows for the early diagnosis of complications, and close follow up of patients after the completion of therapy is necessary to monitor for relapse and development of long-term complications such as myelodysplastic syndrome and leukaemia. Despite these complications, given the potential for cure rates in this young group of patients, the benefits far outweigh the risks.","['Chaudhary, Uzair B', 'Haldas, Jason R']","['Chaudhary UB', 'Haldas JR']","['Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina 29425, USA. chaudu@musc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Germinoma/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Infertility/chemically induced', 'Kidney Diseases/chemically induced', 'Lung Diseases/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced', 'Risk Factors', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Vascular Diseases/chemically induced']",2003/07/31 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/07/31 05:00'],"['2003/07/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/31 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drugs. 2003;63(15):1565-77. doi: 10.2165/00003495-200363150-00004.,,"['63154 [pii]', '10.2165/00003495-200363150-00004 [doi]']",,,,97,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we examined the role of the subgroup A envelope in the pathogenesis of these recombinant viruses. Chickens of line 151(5) x 7(1) were inoculated at 1 day of age with r5701A, r6803A, Rous-associated virus type 1 (RAV-1), or strain ADOL-Hcl of ALV-J. At 2, 4, 10, 18, and 32 wk postinoculation (PI), chickens were tested for avian leukosis virus (ALV)-induced viremia, shedding, and neutralizing antibodies. All except one chicken inoculated with the recombinant viruses (98%) developed neutralizing antibodies by 10 wk PI compared with only 16% and 46% of the ADOL-Hcl and RAV-1-inoculated birds, respectively. ALV-induced tumors and mortality in the two groups inoculated with recombinant viruses were different. The incidence of tumors in groups inoculated with r5701A or RAV-1 was 100% compared with only 9% in the groups inoculated with r6803A or ADOL-Hcl. The data suggest that differences in pathogenicity between the two recombinant viruses might be due to differences in the sequence of the 3' untranslated region (presence or absence of the E element), and, therefore, not only the envelope but also other elements of the viral genome play an important role in the pathogenesis of ALV.","['Lupiani, Blanca', 'Williams, Susan M', 'Silva, Robert F', 'Hunt, Henry D', 'Fadly, Aly M']","['Lupiani B', 'Williams SM', 'Silva RF', 'Hunt HD', 'Fadly AM']","['U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory, 3606 East Mount Hope Road, East Lansing, MI 48823, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Avian Dis,Avian diseases,0370617,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (RNA, recombinant)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Avian Leukosis/immunology/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/classification/*genetics/immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chickens/immunology/virology', 'Female', 'Male', 'RNA/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Viremia', 'Virulence', 'Virus Shedding']",2003/07/31 05:00,2003/09/06 05:00,['2003/07/31 05:00'],"['2003/07/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/31 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Avian Dis. 2003 Apr-Jun;47(2):425-32. doi: 10.1637/0005-2086(2003)047[0425:POTRAL]2.0.CO;2.,,['10.1637/0005-2086(2003)047[0425:POTRAL]2.0.CO;2 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chimeric molecules having sequences of both viruses were detected by the hotspot-combined polymerase chain reaction (HS-cPCR) system. The detection of chimeric molecules provided evidence for avian retroviral inserts in the herpesvirus genome. The persistence of chimeric molecules on in vivo passage served to indicate the infectivity of the recombinant virus. The evaluation of formation and persistence of the chimeric molecules was performed in two trials involving three in vivo passages. The chimeric molecules were identified according to the primer sets, their product length, and pattern. The persistence of chimeric molecules on in vivo passages served as an indication of their ability to replicate in and infect chickens. In the first experimental passage, MDV and ALV-J prototype strains, MD11 and HC-1, were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected into 1-day-old chicks. The second trial included two passages. Passage II chicks were injected i.p. and passage III chickens were in contact with the chickens of passage II. For passage II, enriched white blood cells from blood samples of chickens from the first trial that had chimeric molecules were injected i.p. into 1-day-old chicks. For passage III, uninfected chicks were included together with the infected chicks. Synthesis evidence for the various species of chimeric molecules was assessed in the tissues of birds of the second trial. DNA was extracted from blood and feathers and analyzed by the hotspot-combined PCR and by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. To overcome the limits of detection, three amplification assays followed by hybridization of the products to specific viral probes were conducted. A variety of chimeric molecules were detected in low concentrations. Five species of chimeric molecules were characterized in blood, tumors, and feathers. Chimeric molecules were detected in 18 of 36 dually infected birds from the first trial and in 14 of 21 dually infected birds from the second trial. The findings show that, in four out of seven groups of the second trial, the chimeric molecule species persisted on passage.","['Borenshtain, R', 'Witter, R L', 'Davidson, I']","['Borenshtain R', 'Witter RL', 'Davidson I']","['Division of Avian Diseases, Kimron Veterinary Institute, Bet Dagan, P.O.

Besides involvement in a variety of physio(patho)logical processes, recent studies suggest a pivotal role of calpains in differentiation of hematopoietic cells and tumor cell invasion. However, the precise actions of calpains and their endogenous inhibitor, calpastatin, in these processes are only partially understood. Here we have studied the role of the calpain/calpastatin system in the invasion of leukemic cells under basal and differentiation-stimulating conditions. To further differentiate the human leukaemic cell line THP-1 (monocytic), the cells were treated for 24 hours with the differentiation-stimulating reagents phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Macrophage- and granulocyte-like differentiation was confirmed by induction of vimentin expression as well as by microscopic and fluorescence-assisted cytometric analysis. Extracellular matrix (ECM) invasion of both the basal and differentiation-stimulated cells in a Matrigel assay was inhibited by pre-incubation of the cells with the specific calpain inhibitor CP1B for 24 hours. Inhibition of invasiveness correlated with decreased mRNA expression and secretion of the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9. In contrast, addition of CP1B only during the invasion process did neither influence transmigration nor MMP release. This is the first report showing that the calpain/calpastatin system mediates MMP-mRNA expression of the leukemic THP-1 cells and as a consequence their invasiveness.","['Popp, Oliver', 'Heidinger, Michael', 'Ruiz-Heinrich, Lourdes', 'Ries, Christian', 'Jochum, Marianne', 'Gil-Parrado, Shirley']","['Popp O', 'Heidinger M', 'Ruiz-Heinrich L', 'Ries C', 'Jochum M', 'Gil-Parrado S']","['Abteilung fur Klinische Chemie und Klinische Biochemie, Chirurgische Klinik Innenstadt, Klinikum der LMU Munchen, Nussbaumstr. 20, D-80336 Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Biol Chem,Biological chemistry,9700112,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (calpain inhibitors)', '79079-11-1 (calpastatin)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Calcium-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/*genetics', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/07/31 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2003/07/31 05:00'],"['2003/07/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/31 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Chem. 2003 Jun;384(6):951-8. doi: 10.1515/BC.2003.107.,,['10.1515/BC.2003.107 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The authors analized karyotype (KT) and clinical data of newly diagnosed AML patients. METHODS: Thirty patients were studied, 16 male and 14 female. Age ranged from 19 to 84 years. Diagnostic criteria were based on WHO classification, immunophenotyping and G banding cytogenetics. They were treated according to standard protocol (daunorrubicin and cytarabine - 3+7) and those who had Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia additionally received ATRA. RESULTS: KT success rate was 84%. According to KT patients were divided into 4 groups: favourable prognosis (FP) (6) (t(8;21), t(15;17)); intermediary prognosis (IP) (7)(four normal karyotypes, + 8, t(1;2) and del 18(q)); unfavourable prognosis (UP); and 3 secondary AML; two evolving from prior Mylelodysplastic Syndrome and one presenting as an initial blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia. The median age of FP was 23 years while UP was 60 years (p<0.003). In the FP, 5/6 (83%) achieved complete remission (CR) while only 1/7 (20%)in the IP and 1/8 (12,5%) in the UP.

As granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) greatly enhances the cytotoxicity of neutrophils in ADCC, the efficacy of rituximab might be enhanced by the addition of G-CSF. In a phase I/II clinical trial, we investigated the safety and efficacy of the combination of rituximab and G-CSF (5 microg/kg/day, administered for 3 days, starting 2 days before each infusion) in 26 relapsed low-grade lymphoma patients. Adverse events occurred in 25/26 patients and mainly consisted of (grade I/II) fever (29%) and allergic reactions (19%). In phases I and II (375 mg/m(2) rituximab+G-CSF), 19 patients were evaluable for efficacy. The response rate was 42% (8/19; 95% CI 20-67%), with 16% (3/19) complete remissions and 26% (5/19) partial remissions. The median duration of response was 18 months, the median time to progression was 24 months. We conclude that the combination of rituximab and G-CSF is well tolerated. Although the overall response rate seems comparable to that reported for rituximab monotherapy, remission duration in this pilot phase II study is remarkably long. Randomized comparison with rituximab monotherapy should substantiate this promising finding.","['van der Kolk, L E', 'Grillo-Lopez, A J', 'Baars, J W', 'van Oers, M H J']","['van der Kolk LE', 'Grillo-Lopez AJ', 'Baars JW', 'van Oers MH']","['Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)', 'EC 3.4.21.37 (Leukocyte Elastase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Lactoferrin/blood', 'Leukocyte Elastase/blood', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophil Activation/drug effects', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Rituximab']",2003/07/30 05:00,2003/11/07 05:00,['2003/07/30 05:00'],"['2003/07/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/30 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Aug;17(8):1658-64. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402995.,,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2402995 [doi]', '2402995 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We cloned the breakpoint region of a chromosomal translocation, t(1;14)(p34;q32), found in the human multiple myeloma (MM) cell line, ODA. This rearrangement occurred between the nearby switch region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene (Sgamma3) at 14q32 and the first intron of the human retinoic acid-inducible E3 protein (E3)/lysosome-associated protein, transmembrane-5 (LAPTm5) gene at the 1p34 locus. Consequently, the E3 gene, which is a hematopoietic cell-specific transcript induced by retinoic acid and located at the rearranged allele, was interrupted within its coding region and was not expressed in the ODA cell line in spite of the other allele still being intact. The expression derived from the remaining intact allele in ODA cells was silenced by DNA methylation at sequences within the first intron around a GC-rich EagI site. Interestingly, the silenced expression of E3 mRNA due to DNA methylation of intron 1 sequences was frequently encountered in MM cells [6/10 (60%) of MM cell lines tested], while E3 is expressed in normal plasma cells and in most other hematopoietic cell lines including those of B-cell lineage. Thus, as the E3 protein has been suggested to be involved in cellular differentiation and apoptotic pathways in certain cell types, our results suggest that loss of E3 gene expression might be a crucial event during the progression of human MM.","['Hayami, Y', 'Iida, S', 'Nakazawa, N', 'Hanamura, I', 'Kato, M', 'Komatsu, H', 'Miura, I', 'Dave, B J', 'Sanger, W G', 'Lim, B', 'Taniwaki, M', 'Ueda, R']","['Hayami Y', 'Iida S', 'Nakazawa N', 'Hanamura I', 'Kato M', 'Komatsu H', 'Miura I', 'Dave BJ', 'Sanger WG', 'Lim B', 'Taniwaki M', 'Ueda R']","['Department of Internal Medicine(II) and Molecular Science, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Science, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '179801-28-6 (LAPTM5 protein, human)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Base Sequence', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*DNA Methylation', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Silencing/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Multiple Myeloma/etiology/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/07/30 05:00,2003/11/07 05:00,['2003/07/30 05:00'],"['2003/07/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/30 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Aug;17(8):1650-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403026.,,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2403026 [doi]', '2403026 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the contribution of EBV reactivation and de novo infection of B lymphocytes to tumor outgrowth in SCID/hu mice. Evaluation of BZLF-1, an early EBV activation transcript, in cells recovered from the mouse peritoneal cavity within 16 days following PBMC transfer did not reveal EBV reactivation, while BZLF-1 expression was only detected in tumor masses or in vitro established lymphoblastoid cell lines. To confirm these data by a different strategy, we coinjected PBMC from seropositive donors with purified B cells from seronegative donors of different sex. Fluorescence in situ hydridization analysis of the resulting tumor masses disclosed that the overwhelming majority of lymphoma cells originated from the seropositive donor, implying that no substantial in vivo production and transmission of virus had occurred. Further, treatment of SCID/hu mice with ganciclovir did not prevent lymphoma development. Our results suggest that in the SCID/hu mouse, early EBV replication and secondary infection of bystander B cells does not occur, and that the direct outgrowth of the transformed B lymphocytes present within the PBMC inoculum is the predominant mechanism, which leads to lymphoma generation in this experimental model.","['Piovan, E', 'Bonaldi, L', 'Indraccolo, S', 'Tosello, V', 'Menin, C', 'Comacchio, F', 'Chieco-Bianchi, L', 'Amadori, A']","['Piovan E', 'Bonaldi L', 'Indraccolo S', 'Tosello V', 'Menin C', 'Comacchio F', 'Chieco-Bianchi L', 'Amadori A']","['Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (BZLF1 protein, Herpesvirus 4, Human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/virology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*transplantation/virology', 'Lymphoma/*etiology/pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', '*Viral Proteins', 'Virus Activation', 'Virus Replication/physiology']",2003/07/30 05:00,2003/11/07 05:00,['2003/07/30 05:00'],"['2003/07/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/30 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Aug;17(8):1643-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403005.,,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2403005 [doi]', '2403005 [pii]']",,,,,,['Leukemia. 2003 Aug;17(8):1464-6.

To understand the mechanism of its beneficial effect, we studied the impact of DF on the expression of tissue factor (TF) and fibrinolytic proteins (PAI-1 and t-PA) on endothelial cells. The in vitro response to DF of two types of human endothelial cells (ECs) of different origins, that is from macrovascular (HUVEC) and microvascular (HMEC-1 cell line) beds, was evaluated in the presence or absence of a proinflammatory stimulus (ie bacterial endotoxin, LPS). The results show that DF was able to significantly reduce the LPS-induced TF expression by HMEC-1, and less prominently by HUVEC. In addition, DF importantly influenced the fibrinolytic properties of both HMEC-1 and HUVEC. Specifically, it dose-dependently counteracted the LPS-induced increase in PAI-1 levels and decrease in t-PA activity expression. It also significantly incremented t-PA antigen in resting EC. Decreasing the procoagulant activity and increasing the fibrinolytic potential of EC favors an anticoagulant phenotype of the endothelium, which may protect from fibrin deposition and vascular occlusion.","['Falanga, A', 'Vignoli, A', 'Marchetti, M', 'Barbui, T']","['Falanga A', 'Vignoli A', 'Marchetti M', 'Barbui T']","['Department of Hematology, Ospedali Riuniti, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Blood Coagulation Factors)', '0 (Fibrinolytic Agents)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1)', '0 (Polydeoxyribonucleotides)', '438HCF2X0M (defibrotide)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'EC 3.4.21.68 (Tissue Plasminogen Activator)']",IM,"['Blood Coagulation Factors/analysis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Fibrinolytic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1/analysis', 'Polydeoxyribonucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Thromboplastin/analysis', 'Tissue Plasminogen Activator/analysis', 'Umbilical Veins/cytology']",2003/07/30 05:00,2003/11/07 05:00,['2003/07/30 05:00'],"['2003/07/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/30 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Aug;17(8):1636-42. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403004.,,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2403004 [doi]', '2403004 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to learn to what extent the peripheral expansion of donor-derived mature T lymphocytes contributes to reconstitution of the TCRalphabeta+ T-cell repertoire after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for adult myeloid leukemias, we pursued the fate of donor-derived T-cell clones using the amino-acid sequences of the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of the TCR-beta chain as a clonal marker. Clonal expansion of TCRalphabeta+ T lymphocytes with specific TCRBV subfamilies was identified in donor blood. Identical T-cell clones were not found in blood from recipients before transplantation. The donor-derived T-cell clones were identified in the circulating blood from recipients a few months after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, and they remained in the blood for 18 months after transplant in two recipients, and for 56 months in one. These results suggest that the peripheral expansion of mature T lymphocytes in the graft makes a significant contribution to post-transplant T-cell regeneration during the early period of transplantation in humans, and that mature T cells can survive in recipients for several years. Further investigation will be required to explore which antigens drive the expansion of T-cell clones in donors and recipients, and the mechanisms of maintaining homeostatic balance between the thymus-dependent pathway and the peripheral expansion of mature T cells in post-transplant T-cell regeneration.","['Saitoh, H', 'Hirokawa, M', 'Fujishima, N', 'Ichikawa, Y', 'Kawabata, Y', 'Miura, I', 'Miura, A B', 'Matsutani, T', 'Suzuki, R', 'Sawada, K']","['Saitoh H', 'Hirokawa M', 'Fujishima N', 'Ichikawa Y', 'Kawabata Y', 'Miura I', 'Miura AB', 'Matsutani T', 'Suzuki R', 'Sawada K']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Akita University School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blood Cells', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Division', 'Clone Cells/physiology', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/genetics', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*analysis/genetics', 'Regeneration', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Time Factors', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2003/07/30 05:00,2003/11/07 05:00,['2003/07/30 05:00'],"['2003/07/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/30 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Aug;17(8):1626-35. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402994.,,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2402994 [doi]', '2402994 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although cultured human CB CD34(-)Lin(-) cells transplanted alone possessed only minimal repopulating capacity, with 15% of mice achieving low levels of engraftment, transplantation of cocultured male CD34(-)Lin(-) cells with female CD34(+)Lin(-) cells demonstrated human repopulation with a contribution from CD34(-)Lin(-)-derived progeny in 80% of the recipients. After coculture and transplantation, male CD34(-)Lin(-) cells gave rise to primitive CD34(+)CD38(-) cells isolated in vivo, which demonstrated clonogenic progenitor function into multiple lineages. Taken together, our study indicates that the presence of CD34(+)Lin(-) cells in coculture enhanced the low repopulating function of human CD34(-)Lin(-) cells in vivo.

We have sought to annotate proteins expressed at the cell surface membrane in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) using plasma-membrane-based proteomic analysis to identify previously uncharacterized and potentially B-cell-specific proteins. Proteins from plasma-membrane fractions were separated on one-dimensional gels and trypsinized fractions subjected to high-throughput MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Using this method, many known B-cell surface antigens were detected, but also known proteins not previously described in this disease or in this cellular compartment, including cell surface receptors, membrane-associated enzymes and secreted proteins, and completely unknown proteins. To validate the method, we show that BLK, a B-cell-specific kinase, is located in the CLL-plasma-membrane fraction. We also describe two novel proteins (MIG2B and B-cell novel protein #1, BCNP1), which are expressed preferentially in B cells. MIG2B is in a highly conserved and defined gene family containing two plasma-membrane-binding ezrin/radixin/moesin domains and a pleckstrin homology domain; the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog (UNC-112) is a membrane-associated protein that colocalizes with integrin at cell-matrix adhesion complexes. BCNP1 is a completely unknown protein with three predicted transmembrane domains, with three alternatively spliced final exons.

We studied in depth the 414 fully evaluable patients transplanted less than 96 days after achieving CR1; in these patients, only three factors predicted for the outcome by multivariate analysis: patient age, CR1 achievement with one or more induction courses and the recipient/donor sex combination. These three factors overcame the information from cytogenetics and source of stem cells. Three prognostic groups could be identified in relation to the outcome, using a prognostic score affecting 1 to each poor risk factor (total from 0 to 3): Group 1 (good prognosis) includes patients <35 years old, achieving CR1 with one induction course and to be transplanted with any other sex combination than female to male (score 0); group 2 (intermediate) with one adverse factor (score 1); and group 3 (bad prognosis) with two or three adverse criteria (scores 2 and 3). In these three groups, the 3-year leukaemia-free survival was 56+/-5%, 48+/-4% and 29+/-4% and the overall survival was 65+/-5, 53+/-4 and 29+/-5%, respectively. Therefore, adult patients with ALL and a score of 0 or 1 are good candidates for an early transplant if they have an identical sibling donor. Patient age, response to induction and the sex of the HLA-identical family donor (if existing) are the strongest easy predictors of the outcome for an early transplant in an adult patient with ALL.

We evaluated NG2 expression in 313 adult ALL patients by flow cytometry and simultaneously determined MLL rearrangement in 120 adult patients out of them with B-precursor ALL by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization. A total of 57% of pro-B ALL, 2% of common ALL and 20% of pre-B ALL were NG2 positive, but NG2 was absent in T-ALL and mature B-ALL. In B-precursor ALL, NG2 expression was significantly associated with a CD10(-)/CD34(-)/CD24(-)/CD65s(+)/CD15(+)/CD13(-)/CD33(-) phenotype and showed a sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of 0.89, 0.89, and 0.93 for MLL rearrangement, respectively. NG2 was positive in three patients without detectable MLL rearrangement and negative in eight patients with MLL-AF4 transcripts. However, NG2 predicted with a 100% accuracy MLL rearrangement among patients disclosing a CD65s(+) and/or CD15(+) immunophenotype. In summary, NG2 adds to a more precise identification of high-risk adult ALL and should therefore be included into diagnostic marker panels.

Consequences on minimal residual disease monitoring.,1573-82,"Detection of minimal residual disease (MRD), using immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements as clone-specific targets, represents the most recent development in diagnosis and treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Nevertheless, risk of false-negative results, due to secondary or ongoing rearrangements of Ig/TCR genes during the disease course, might hamper MRD detection. Therefore, to gain extensive information on clonal stability, we performed PCR-GeneScan analysis of Ig/TCR gene rearrangements at diagnosis and subsequent relapse in bone marrow samples from 53 childhood precursor-B-ALL patients. In addition, sequencing analysis of junctional regions at diagnosis and relapse provided a detailed insight in the stability and changes of Ig/TCR gene rearrangements during the disease course. At least one stable clonal Ig/TCR target was found in 94% of patients. In three patients complete differences in Ig/TCR rearrangements between diagnosis and relapse were observed, suggesting relapse with a new clone. At relapse, 71% of diagnostic clonal PCR targets was conserved. Since the comparison of Ig/TCR gene rearrangements at diagnosis and relapse in our precursor-B-ALL patients did not show significant difference in the stability of different clonal PCR targets (IGH, 70%; IGK, 71%; TCRD, 67%; TCRG, 75%), we conclude that there is no 'preferential' clone-specific target for MRD monitoring.","['Germano, G', 'del Giudice, L', 'Palatron, S', 'Giarin, E', 'Cazzaniga, G', 'Biondi, A', 'Basso, G']","['Germano G', 'del Giudice L', 'Palatron S', 'Giarin E', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Biondi A', 'Basso G']","[""Laboratorio di Emato Oncologia, Dipartimento di Pediatria, Universita' di Padova, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics/*pathology', 'Recurrence', '*Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Time Factors']",2003/07/30 05:00,2003/11/07 05:00,['2003/07/30 05:00'],"['2003/07/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/30 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Aug;17(8):1573-82. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403008.,,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2403008 [doi]', '2403008 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we used four-color flow cytometry to detect MRD in 1016 children undergoing therapy on Children's Oncology Group therapeutic protocols for precursor-B-cell ALL. Compliance was excellent, with follow-up samples received at the end of induction on nearly 95% of cases; sensitivity of detection at this time point was at least 1/10,000 in more than 90% of cases. Overall, 28.6% of patients had detectable MRD at the end of induction. Patients with M3 marrows at day 8 were much more likely to be MRD positive (MRD+) than those with M2 or M1 marrows. Different genetically defined groups of patients varied in their prevalence of MRD. Specifically, almost all patients with BCR-ABL had high levels of end-of-induction MRD. Only 8.4% of patients with TEL-AML1 were MRD+>0.01% compared with 20.3% of patients with trisomies of chromosomes 4 and 10. Our results show that MRD correlates with conventional measures of slow early response. However, the high frequency of MRD positivity in favorable trisomy patients suggests that the clinical significance of MRD positivity at the end of induction may not be the same in all patient groups.","['Borowitz, M J', 'Pullen, D J', 'Shuster, J J', 'Viswanatha, D', 'Montgomery, K', 'Willman, C L', 'Camitta, B']","['Borowitz MJ', 'Pullen DJ', 'Shuster JJ', 'Viswanatha D', 'Montgomery K', 'Willman CL', 'Camitta B']","['Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/standards', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/standards', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Trisomy']",2003/07/30 05:00,2003/11/07 05:00,['2003/07/30 05:00'],"['2003/07/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/30 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Aug;17(8):1566-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403001.,,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2403001 [doi]', '2403001 [pii]']",,,"['R01 CA86011/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 29139/PHS HHS/United States']",,"[""Children's Oncology Group study""]",,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, gene expression microarray technology has been used to investigate lymphoblastic leukemias, demonstrating that known and novel pB-ALL subclasses can be separated on the basis of gene expression profiles. The strength of microarray technique lays in part in the multivariate nature of the expression data. We propose a parallel multiparametric approach based on immunophenotypic flow-cytometry expression data for the analysis of leukemia patients. Specifically, we tested the potential of this approach on a data set of 145 samples of pediatric pB-ALL that included 46 samples positive for mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) translocations (MLL+) and 99 control pB-ALLs, negative for this translocation (MLL-). The expression levels of 16 marker proteins have been monitored by four-color flow cytometry using a standardized diagnostic panel of antibodies. The protein expression database has been then analyzed using those univariate and multivariate computational techniques normally applied to mine and model large microarray data sets. Marker protein expression profiling not only allowed separating pB-ALL cases with an MLL rearrangement from other ALLs, but also demonstrates that MLL+ leukemias constitute a heterogeneous group in which MLL/AF4 leukemias represent a homogenous subclass described by a specific expression fingerprint.","['De Zen, L', 'Bicciato, S', 'te Kronnie, G', 'Basso, G']","['De Zen L', 'Bicciato S', 'te Kronnie G', 'Basso G']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Padova, via Giustiniani, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '150826-18-9 (AFF1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Infant', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/diagnosis/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*diagnosis/pathology', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2003/07/30 05:00,2003/11/07 05:00,['2003/07/30 05:00'],"['2003/07/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/30 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Aug;17(8):1557-65. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403013.,,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2403013 [doi]', '2403013 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In ALL-(Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster) trials, early treatment response is assessed by the in vivo response to glucocorticoids (prednisone response, PR), the molecular background of which is unknown. The intracellular effects of glucocorticoids (GCs) are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In the absence of GC, the inactive GR resides within a multiprotein complex, consisting predominantly of the chaperone protein hsp90 (heat-shock protein 90). Until now, studies targeting GC resistance mainly focused on GR disorders and alterations of genes known to be associated with drug resistance. In addition, the GR multiprotein complex was associated with GC resistance in in vitro studies. We performed a case-control study for PR to investigate the association of in vivo GC resistance and hsp90 expression in childhood ALL. Hsp90 expression was assessed using a real-time PCR approach (Taqman technology) and Western blot technology. In this setting, we found no association of in vivo GC resistance and hsp90 expression. Therefore, we conclude that the expression of hsp90, the major component of the GR activating complex, is of minor importance for the in vivo GC resistance in childhood ALL.","['Lauten, M', 'Beger, C', 'Gerdes, K', 'Asgedom, G', 'Kardinal, C', 'Welte, K', 'Schrappe, M']","['Lauten M', 'Beger C', 'Gerdes K', 'Asgedom G', 'Kardinal C', 'Welte K', 'Schrappe M']","['Hannover Medical School, Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Prednisone/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2003/07/30 05:00,2003/11/07 05:00,['2003/07/30 05:00'],"['2003/07/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/30 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Aug;17(8):1551-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403027.,,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2403027 [doi]', '2403027 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We characterized acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with low CD65s expression (CD65s(low) AML) in 711 patients entered on seven Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group AML treatment trials (1986-1999). Of those, 198 (28%) qualified as having CD65s(low) AML. Morphologically, CD65s(low) AML was more common in FAB subgroups with minimal differentiation, M0/M1 (P=<0.0001). Early precursor antigens CD34, CD117 and terminal transferase were more frequent in CD65s(low) than CD65s(high) AML (P=<0.0001). Myeloperoxidase was present in fewer CD65s(low) myeloblasts, and the more mature myeloid antigens, CD15 and CD11b, were rarely detected (P=<0.0001). Yet, the two diagnoses did not differ in the distribution of cytogenetic prognostic groups or the occurrence of the multidrug-resistance mediator, P-glycoprotein. CD65s(low) AML patients were significantly older than CD65s(high) cases (P<0.0001). Furthermore, the incidence of CD65s(low) cases increased with age, from 20% in patients under the age of 50 years to 67% in patients older than 80 years (P<0.0001).

However, among patients >55 years of age, CD65s(low) AML had a decreased CR rate of 33 vs 44% in CD65s(high) AML (P=0.055).

To evaluate the role of hydroxyurea (HU) for the outcome of IFN therapy, we conducted a randomized trial to compare the combination of IFN and HU vs HU monotherapy (CML-study II). From February 1991 to December 1994, 376 patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase were randomized. In all, 340 patients were Ph/BCR-ABL positive and evaluable. Randomization was unbalanced 1:2 in favor of the combination therapy, since study conditions were identical to the previous CML-study I and it had been planned in advance to add the HU patients of study I (n=194) to the HU control group. Therefore, a total of 534 patients were evaluable (226 patients with IFN/HU and 308 patients with HU). Analyses were according to intention-to-treat. Median observation time of nontransplanted living patients was 7.6 years (7.9 years for IFN/HU and 7.3 years for HU). The risk profile (new CML score) was available for 532 patients: 200 patients (38%) were low, 239 patients (45%) intermediate, and 93 patients (17%) high risk. Complete hematologic response rates were higher in IFN/HU-treated patients (59 vs 32%). Of 169 evaluable IFN/HU-treated patients (75%), 104 patients (62%) achieved a cytogenetic response that was complete in 12% (n=21), major in 14% (n=24), and at least minimal in 35% (n=59). Of the 534 patients, 105 (20%) underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation in first chronic phase. In the low-risk group, 65 of 200 patients were transplanted (33%), 30 (13%) in the intermediate-risk group, and nine (10%) in the high-risk group. Duration of chronic phase was 55 months for IFN/HU and 41 months for HU (P<0.0001). Median survival was 64 months for IFN/HU and 53 months for HU-treated patients (P=0.0063).

In view of the data of CML-study I, these results suggest that IFN/HU is also superior to IFN alone.

The rationales for the study design were based (i) on previous favorable results with high-dose cytarabine in AML with t(8;21), inv/t(16q22) and in AML with normal karyotype, and ii) on encouraging results obtained in several phase II trials using autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT). Between July 1993 and January 1998, 223 eligible patients, 16-60 years of age with newly diagnosed AML other than French-American-British type M3/M3v, were entered into the trial. Risk groups were defined as follows: low risk: t(8;21) or inv/t(16q22); intermediate risk: normal karyotype; high risk: all other chromosomal abnormalities. Following intensive double induction therapy with idarubicin, cytarabine and etoposide, all patients in complete remission (CR) received a first consolidation therapy with high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone (HAM). A second consolidation therapy was stratified according to the risk group: low risk: HAM; intermediate risk: related allogeneic SCT or sequential HAM; high risk: related allogeneic or autologous SCT. Double induction therapy resulted in a high CR rate of 74.5%, and 90% of the responding patients were eligible for consolidation therapy. Survival for all 223 trial entrants was 40%, and for the 166 patients who entered CR, disease-free (DFS) and overall survival were 40 and 51% after 5 years, respectively. Within the low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups, DFS and survival after 5 years were 62.5 and 87, 40 and 49 and 17 and 26% respectively, without advantage for allogeneic transplantation in the intermediate- and high-risk groups. Postremission therapy-related mortality was 0, 7 and 14%, respectively. This study demonstrates the feasibility of cytogenetically defined risk-adapted consolidation therapy.

Farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) are the most promising class of these new cancer therapeutics. Several FTIs have entered phase II clinical trials in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Since geranylgeranylation of K-RAS and N-RAS in the presence of FTIs may represent an important mechanism of FTI resistance, 6 geranylgeranyl transferase-I inhibitors (GGTIs) were screened alone and in combination with FTI for growth inhibition of myeloid leukemia cells. Significant growth inhibition (>70%) in myeloid cell lines was observed for GGTI-286 (9/19), GGTI-298 (14/19), GGTI-2147 (16/19) and FTI L-744,832 (17/17). GGTI treatment of NB-4 cells resulted in an accumulation of cells in G(0)/G(1), whereas FTI L-744,832 primarily caused an increase in G(2)/M. FTI and GGTIs both induced apoptosis. In all cases, FTI/GGTI cotreatment led to synergistic cytotoxic effects in both myeloid cell lines (5/5) and primary AML cells (6/6). This synergy coincided with increased apoptosis. FTI/GGTI cotreatment caused an accumulation of unprocessed N-RAS and inactive N-RAS-RAF complexes. Our results suggest that alternative geranylgeranylation of N-RAS may represent an important mechanism of resistance to FTI monotherapy in myeloid leukemia cells.","['Morgan, M A', 'Wegner, J', 'Aydilek, E', 'Ganser, A', 'Reuter, C W M']","['Morgan MA', 'Wegner J', 'Aydilek E', 'Ganser A', 'Reuter CW']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (geranylgeranyltransferase type-I)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Farnesyltranstransferase', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interphase/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'ras Proteins/drug effects/metabolism']",2003/07/30 05:00,2003/11/07 05:00,['2003/07/30 05:00'],"['2003/07/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/30 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Aug;17(8):1508-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403022.,,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2403022 [doi]', '2403022 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, with the advent of modern therapy, it had been relegated to a historical footnote. In the 1990s, investigators in China reported that ATO was safe and had dramatic efficacy in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Preclinical investigations indicate that the biological targets of this novel drug extend to a variety of malignancies other than APL and include induction of apoptosis, nonterminal differentiation, and suppression of proliferation and angiogenesis. The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) present a particular therapeutic challenge. Ineffective hematopoiesis predominates in patients with low-grade prognostic scores. The survival of those patients with high-grade disease is compromised by a high risk of leukemia transformation. Although a number of therapeutic options have been investigated, none has emerged as being broadly efficacious and having an acceptable toxicity profile. No drug has yet received approval by the Food and Drug Administration for this indication. Biologic features of MDS, which include accelerated apoptotic potential, limited maturation capacity, and medullary neovascularity, create a strong scientific rationale for the investigation of ATO in MDS. This report describes the history and scientific basis for ATO treatment of hematologic malignancies, enumerates the potential benefits of ATO in MDS, and discusses the direction of ongoing trials of this novel antineoplastic agent.","['List, A', 'Beran, M', 'DiPersio, J', 'Slack, J', 'Vey, N', 'Rosenfeld, C S', 'Greenberg, P']","['List A', 'Beran M', 'DiPersio J', 'Slack J', 'Vey N', 'Rosenfeld CS', 'Greenberg P']","['Arizona Cancer Centre 3945, University of Arizona, Tucson 85724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Physiological Phenomena/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Oxides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/07/30 05:00,2003/11/07 05:00,['2003/07/30 05:00'],"['2003/07/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/30 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Aug;17(8):1499-507. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403021.,,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2403021 [doi]', '2403021 [pii]']",,,,83,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This renders the malignant cells resistant to endogenous apoptotic stimuli, as well as exogenous stimuli, such as chemotherapy drugs and radiation. The defective apoptosis seen in human cancers often results from overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins in the Bcl-2 protein family, particularly Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L). A great deal of effort is currently aimed at developing novel agents to inhibit the expression or function of these proteins. Antisense agents directed against Bcl-2 mRNA are showing considerable promise in clinical trials. In addition, detailed knowledge of the structures of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L), coupled with high-throughput and computer-assisted screening of chemical libraries, has led to the identification of a number of short peptides and small organic molecules capable of inhibiting Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) function.

While mtDNA alterations have been observed in human cancer, their roles in oncogenesis and chemosensitivity remain unclear. We investigated the relationship between mtDNA mutations, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and clinical outcomes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. An analysis of mtDNA from 20 CLL patients revealed that primary CLL cells from patients with prior chemotherapy had a significantly higher frequency of heteroplasmic mutations than did those from untreated patients. Overall, mtDNA mutations appeared to be associated with increased ROS generation. Patients refractory to conventional therapeutic agents tended to have higher mutation rates than patients who responded to treatment. Analysis of paired blood samples from the same patient led to the identification of a heteroplasmic mutation in the cytochrome c oxidase II gene several months after chemotherapy. The mutation was associated with increased ROS generation. Our results suggest for the first time that chemotherapy with DNA-damaging agents may cause mtDNA mutations in primary leukemia cells, which often exist in heteroplasmy, and are associated with increased ROS generation.","['Carew, J S', 'Zhou, Y', 'Albitar, M', 'Carew, J D', 'Keating, M J', 'Huang, Peng']","['Carew JS', 'Zhou Y', 'Albitar M', 'Carew JD', 'Keating MJ', 'Huang P']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, the University of Texas MD.

Consistently, both cytokines also induced the degradation of the NF-kappaB inhibitors, IkappaBalpha and IkappaB epsilon, and up-regulated the surface expression of TRAIL-R3, a known NF-kappaB target. However, NF-kappaB activation and IkappaB degradation occurred with different time-courses, since TNF-alpha was more potent, rapid, and transient than TRAIL. Of the two TRAIL receptors constitutively expressed by HL-60 (TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2), only the former was involved in IkappaB degradation, as demonstrated by using agonistic anti-TRAIL receptor antibodies. Moreover, NF-kappaB nuclear translocation induced by TRAIL but not by TNF-alpha was abrogated by z-IETD-fmk, a caspase-8-specific inhibitor. The key role of NF-kappaB in mediating the biological effects of TNF-alpha and TRAIL was demonstrated by the ability of unrelated pharmacological inhibitors of the NF-kappaB pathway (parthenolide and MG-132) to abrogate TNF-alpha- and TRAIL-induced monocytic maturation. These findings demonstrate that NF-kappaB is essential for monocytic maturation and is activated via distinct pathways, involving or not involving caspases, by the related cytokines TRAIL and TNF-alpha.","['Secchiero, Paola', 'Milani, Daniela', 'Gonelli, Arianna', 'Melloni, Elisabetta', 'Campioni, Diana', 'Gibellini, Davide', 'Capitani, Silvano', 'Zauli, Giorgio']","['Secchiero P', 'Milani D', 'Gonelli A', 'Melloni E', 'Campioni D', 'Gibellini D', 'Capitani S', 'Zauli G']","['Department of Morphology and Embryology, Human Anatomy Section, St. Anna Hospital, University of Ferrara, Italy. secchier@mail.umbi.umd.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 10c)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10C protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'HL-60 Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 10c', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2003/07/30 05:00,2003/09/10 05:00,['2003/07/30 05:00'],"['2003/07/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/30 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2003 Aug;74(2):223-32. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0103004.,,['10.1189/jlb.0103004 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the features of primer selection, a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and a murine leukemia virus (MuLV) were created that require yeast tRNA(Phe) to be supplied in trans for infectivity. Wild-type yeast tRNA(Phe) expressed in mammalian cells was transported to the cytoplasm and aminoacylated. In contrast, tRNA(Phe) without the D loop (tRNA(Phe)D(-)) was retained within the nucleus and did not complement infectivity of either HIV-1 or MuLV; however, infectivity was restored when tRNA(Phe)D(-) was directly transfected into the cytoplasm of cells. A tRNA(Phe) mutant (tRNA(Phe)UUA) that did not have the capacity to be aminoacylated was transported to the cytoplasm and did complement infectivity of both HIV-1 and MuLV, albeit at a level less than that with wild-type tRNA(Phe).

These activities correlate with the functions of ICP0 in stimulating lytic infection and reactivating quiescent HSV-1. The disruption of ND10 occurs because ICP0 induces the loss of the SUMO-1-modified forms of PML and the subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of the PML protein. The functions of ICP0 are largely dependent on the integrity of its zinc-binding RING finger domain. Many RING finger proteins have been found to act as ubiquitin E3 ligase enzymes, stimulating the production of conjugated polyubiquitin chains in the presence of ubiquitin, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, and the appropriate E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Substrate proteins that become polyubiquitinated are then subject to degradation by proteasomes. We have previously shown that purified full-length ICP0 acts as an efficient E3 ligase in vitro, producing high-molecular-weight polyubiquitin chains in a RING finger-dependent but substrate-independent manner. In this paper we report on investigations into the factors governing the degradation of PML induced by ICP0 in a variety of in vivo and in vitro assays. We found that ICP0 expression increases the levels of ubiquitinated PML in transfected cells. However, ICP0 does not interact with or directly ubiquitinate either unmodified PML or SUMO-1-modified PML in vitro, suggesting either that additional factors are required for the ICP0-mediated ubiquitination of PML in vivo or that PML degradation is an indirect consequence of some other activity of ICP0 at ND10. Using a transfection-based approach and a family of deletion and point mutations of PML, we found that efficient ICP0-induced PML degradation requires sequences within the C-terminal part of PML and lysine residue 160, one of the principal targets for SUMO-1 modification of the protein.","['Boutell, Chris', 'Orr, Anne', 'Everett, Roger D']","['Boutell C', 'Orr A', 'Everett RD']","['MRC Virology Unit, Glasgow G11 5JR, Scotland, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*physiology', 'Lysine/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'SUMO-1 Protein/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2003/07/30 05:00,2003/09/25 05:00,['2003/07/30 05:00'],"['2003/07/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/30 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Aug;77(16):8686-94. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.16.8686-8694.2003.,,['10.1128/jvi.77.16.8686-8694.2003 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,PMC167235,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Children with DS were significantly younger at diagnosis than those without (median age, 1.8 v 7.5 years, respectively; P <.001), with more megakaryocytic leukemia (70% v 6%; P <.001). Higher complete remission rates (91%) were achieved in children with DS than among those without DS (75%; P <.001).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 1,261 patients treated for HD before age 41 between 1965 and 1987. Follow-up was complete until October 2000. For 95% of deaths, the cause was known. Long-term cause-specific mortality was compared with general population rates to assess relative risk (RR) and absolute excess risk (AER) of death. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 17.8 years, 534 patients had died (55% of HD). The RR of death from all causes other than HD was 6.8 times that of the general population, and still amounted to 5.1 after more than 30 years. RRs of death resulting from solid tumors (STs) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) were increased overall (RR = 6.6 and 6.3, respectively), but especially in patients treated before age 21 (RR = 14.8 and 13.6, respectively). When these patients grew older, this elevated mortality decreased. The overall AER of death from causes other than HD increased throughout follow-up. Patients receiving salvage chemotherapy had a significantly increased RR of death from STs, compared to patients receiving initial therapy only. CONCLUSION: The main cause of death among HD patients was lymphoma, but after 20 years, HD mortality was negligible. The RRs and AERs of death from second primary cancers (SCs) and CVDs continued to increase after 10 years. Even more than 30 years after diagnosis, HD patients experienced elevated risk of death from all causes other than HD. Increased risk of death from SCs and CVDs was found especially in patients treated before age 21, but these risks seemed to abate with age.","['Aleman, Berthe M P', 'van den Belt-Dusebout, Alexandra W', 'Klokman, Willem J', ""Van't Veer, Mars B"", 'Bartelink, Harry', 'van Leeuwen, Flora E']","['Aleman BM', 'van den Belt-Dusebout AW', 'Klokman WJ', ""Van't Veer MB"", 'Bartelink H', 'van Leeuwen FE']","['Department of Epidemiology, the Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/mortality', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/*mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Infections/mortality', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",2003/07/30 05:00,2003/10/24 05:00,['2003/07/30 05:00'],"['2003/07/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/30 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Sep 15;21(18):3431-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.07.131.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1987 and 1995, 618 children treated on two consecutive Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Consortium protocols for ALL were measured for height and weight at diagnosis, and approximately every 6 months thereafter. Patient height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were converted to z scores for age and sex using the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts for the United States. RESULTS: Children younger than 13 years at diagnosis had a statistically significant decrease in their height z scores and an increase in their BMI z scores, regardless of whether they had received cranial radiation. Young age at diagnosis and increased chemotherapy intensity were major risk factors. Unexpectedly, there was no significant difference in long-term height between children who received radiation and those who did not. CONCLUSION: Final height is compromised in survivors of ALL. The detrimental effects on height occur during therapy without the ability for long-term catch-up growth. Although patients became overweight for height, this seemed to be a result of relative height loss with normal weight gain rather than accelerated weight gain. The type of CNS treatment received did not affect changes in height, weight, or BMI.","['Dalton, Virginia Kimball', 'Rue, Montse', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Gelber, Richard D', 'Asselin, Barbara L', 'Barr, Ronald D', 'Clavell, Luis A', 'Hurwitz, Craig A', 'Moghrabi, Albert', 'Samson, Yvan', 'Schorin, Marshall', 'Tarbell, Nancy J', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Cohen, Laurie E']","['Dalton VK', 'Rue M', 'Silverman LB', 'Gelber RD', 'Asselin BL', 'Barr RD', 'Clavell LA', 'Hurwitz CA', 'Moghrabi A', 'Samson Y', 'Schorin M', 'Tarbell NJ', 'Sallan SE', 'Cohen LE']","[""Department of Medicine, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

To evaluate response to 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CDA) and etoposide (VP-16) in patients who did not respond to mitoxantrone and cytarabine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with relapsed/refractory AML (n = 101) and secondary AML (n = 13) were entered. RESULTS: Mitoxantrone and cytarabine induction achieved a remission rate of 76% for relapsed/refractory patients and 77% for patients with secondary AML, with a 3% induction mortality rate. Cytarabine and etoposide intensification exceeded the acceptable toxic death rate of 10%. The response rate of 2-CDA/VP-16 was 8%. Two-year overall survival was estimated at 24% and was better than historical control data. Patients with secondary AML had similar outcomes to relapsed or refractory patients. Initial remission longer than 1 year was the most important prognostic factor for patients with primary AML (2-year survival rate, 75%), whereas for patients with primary AML, with less than 12 months of initial remission, survival was 13% and was similar to that of refractory patients (6%). CONCLUSION: Mitoxantrone and cytarabine induction is effective with reasonable toxicity in patients with relapsed/refractory or secondary AML. The cytarabine and etoposide intensification regimen should be abandoned because of toxicity. Patients with relapsed AML with initial remissions longer than 1 year have a relatively good prognosis.","['Wells, Robert J', 'Adams, Mary T', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Arceci, Robert J', 'Buckley, Jonathan', 'Buxton, Allen B', 'Dusenbery, Kathryn', 'Gamis, Alan', 'Masterson, Margaret', 'Vik, Terry', 'Warkentin, Phyllis', 'Whitlock, James A']","['Wells RJ', 'Adams MT', 'Alonzo TA', 'Arceci RJ', 'Buckley J', 'Buxton AB', 'Dusenbery K', 'Gamis A', 'Masterson M', 'Vik T', 'Warkentin P', 'Whitlock JA']","['MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. rjwells@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/07/30 05:00,2003/09/05 05:00,['2003/07/30 05:00'],"['2003/07/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/30 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Aug 1;21(15):2940-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.06.128.,,"['10.1200/JCO.2003.06.128 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.06.128 [pii]']",,,,,"[""Children's Cancer Group Study 2951""]",,,,,,,,,,,,

Rearrangements involving 11q23 are frequent in cases of AML M5 and often involve the MLL gene. Nevertheless, t(11;17)(q23;q21) is very rare in this type of leukemia. In acute promyelocytic leukemia, the RARalpha gene, located at 17q21, is involved in almost all cases. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies revealed a deletion of the C-terminal part of the MLL gene and a translocation of the RARalpha gene on the derivative chromosome 11, proximal to the remaining part of the MLL gene. However, hybridization with the LSI RARA dual color break-apart rearrangement probe showed that the RARalpha gene was not rearranged in this translocation. This is the first study reporting a t(11;17)(q23;q21) with a deletion distal to MLL gene exon 6 in a case of AML M5.

Flow cytometry results were somewhat unusual. Specifically, the promyelocytic population showed partial positivity for antigens not usually expressed in APL (HLA-DR and CD117). The interpretation of these results was that the abnormal population contained a proportion of very early promyeolocytes that had not completely lost all their ""precursor"" antigens. Cytogenetic analysis of a bone marrow aspirate showed a t(15:17;17)(q22;q23;q21) in all cells analyzed. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using the PML-RARA DNA probe showed a positive signal pattern (fusion) in 100% of 200 total interphase and metaphase cells examined, confirming the presence of the PML-RARA rearrangement. Multicolor FISH, which produces 24 colors to differentiate all chromosomes in a single hybridization, was applied. This study confirmed the cytogenetic interpretation of the rearrangement. No material from any other chromosome was detected on the second smaller derivative chromosome 17. Additional studies using the RARA(17q21) break-apart DNA FISH probe showed that 17q21 (RARA) was not rearranged on the derivative chromosome 17 that received the q22-->qter segment from chromosome 15. The RARA locus on the smaller derivative 17 was the allele involved in the fusion in this three-way rearrangement. The signal pattern was consistent in 100% of interphase and metaphase cells scored. This unusual t(15;17;17) prompted us to investigate further using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction with primers from the 3' and 5' regions of both the RARA and PML loci. These studies showed that the PML-RARA fusion was present, but the complementary fusion RARA-PML, which is usually detectable, was absent.

Using rabbit beta-globin mRNA as the template together with an appropriate primer, the enzyme readily makes full-length DNA transcripts in which all thymidine 5' oxygen atoms have been replaced with methylene groups. In sequence analyses using the partial depurination procedure, the analogue DNA transcript produces electrophoretic gel patterns identical with those of the corresponding natural DNA transcript. Experiments on second strand synthesis using the four regular triphosphates show that the analogue DNA transcript, like the natural transcript, can serve as a template. The two DNA duplexes (natural/natural and analogue/natural) formed by these reactions produce similar electrophoretic cleavage patterns when treated with either of the endonucleases HaeIII and EcoRI. However, further studies on template properties indicate that, while the enzyme makes a full-length product when using the analogue substrate with a natural DNA strand as template, it appears unable to use the analogue transcript as template with the analogue triphosphate as substrate during second strand synthesis. Preliminary experiments have also been carried out with a DNA polymerase.

We have examined the effects of H(2)O(2) stimulation in a primary rat basophilic leukemia cell line (RBL-2H3) and compared with IgE-dependent stimulation. Like IgE stimulation, H(2)O(2) up-regulates IL-4 and IL-6 gene expression and cytokine secretion, shows a little effect on IL-5 but does not induce IL-10 gene expression. Simultaneous H(2)O(2) treatment and FcepsilonRI triggering of mast cells has additive effects on IL-4 expression. In addition, we show that both stimuli induce the nuclear translocation of APE/Ref-1, a bifunctional enzyme that stimulates the DNA-binding activity of several transcription factors through the reduction of highly reactive cysteines. Conditional inactivation of APE/Ref-1 expression abolishes H(2)O(2)-induced IL-4 and IL-6 gene expression but does not affect that induced by FcepsilonRI stimulation. Our findings indicate that oxidative stress activates the gene expression of a specific cytokine pattern in mast cells through an APE/Ref-1-dependent pathway, which is distinct from the one that is activated by FcepsilonRI stimulation. Nonetheless, H(2)O(2) and FcepsilonRI signalings are additive in augmenting IL-4 production. Most importantly, oxidative stress can induce a pro-type 2 inflammatory response from mast cells that is independent of FcepsilonRI stimulation.","['Frossi, Barbara', 'De Carli, Marco', 'Daniel, Kenn Curt', 'Rivera, Juan', 'Pucillo, Carlo']","['Frossi B', 'De Carli M', 'Daniel KC', 'Rivera J', 'Pucillo C']","['Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Biomediche, Universita degli Studi di Udine, Udine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 4.2.- (Carbon-Oxygen Lyases)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (Apex1 protein, rat)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active/drug effects', 'Carbon-Oxygen Lyases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/genetics', '*DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/drug effects/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2003/07/29 05:00,2003/09/30 05:00,['2003/07/29 05:00'],"['2003/07/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/29 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2003 Aug;33(8):2168-77. doi: 10.1002/eji.200323995.,,['10.1002/eji.200323995 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, bone marrow from these patients may contain residual leukemic cells that should be ideally eliminated prior to the infusion of the graft.

We studied whether suicide adenoviral vectors expressing the cytosine deaminase gene (AdCD) could be used for selectively killing leukemic WEHI-3B cells. The AdCD transduction followed by the 5-fluorocytosine exposure abrogated the growth of WEHI-3B cells in vitro, with a minimal effect on normal hematopietic progenitors. To test the efficacy of the purging protocol in vivo, bone marrow cells were mixed with syngenic WEHI-3B cells and this chimeric cell population was transduced with AdCD vectors. Infected cells were injected into myeloablated Balb-c mice, which then received a 5-fluorocytosine treatment for 4 days. All mice transplanted with unpurged bone marrow developed leukemia and died. However, 90% of recipients receiving the purging treatment were healthy up to 9 months post-transplantation and had a perfectly re-established hematopoietic system, without any signal of leukemic cell presence.

METHODS: We evaluated, retrospectively, the performance characteristics of linear and nonlinear (U-shaped) logistic models for predicting bacteremia that are based on the total peripheral WBC count. Research subjects were consecutive 0- to 89-day-old infants who had a temperature in triage of greater than or equal to 38 degrees C (> or =100.4 degrees F) and were evaluated for infection at a pediatric emergency department (1993 to 1999). Infants with leukemia were excluded. Areas under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUC), as well as sensitivity, specificity, interval likelihood ratios, and the corresponding odds of bacteremia predicted at various thresholds of the test, were calculated. RESULTS: The rate of bacteremia was 1% (38/3,810). The U-shaped model was more accurate (AUC 0.69 versus 0.56); however, no threshold of the total peripheral WBC count had both good sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity and specificity values were 79% and 5%, respectively, at a peripheral WBC count cutoff of 5,000 cells/mm(3), and 45% and 78%, respectively, at a cutoff of 15,000 cells/mm(3). The odds of bacteremia were not decreased substantially at any cutoff and were increased only modestly at values outside published norms of the test. CONCLUSION: The total peripheral WBC count is an inaccurate screen for bacteremia in febrile young infants; thus, decisions to obtain blood cultures should not rely on this test.","['Bonsu, Bema K', 'Chb, Mb', 'Harper, Marvin B']","['Bonsu BK', 'Chb M', 'Harper MB']","[""Department of Medicine, Division of Emergency Medicine, Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH 43213, USA. bonsub@pediatrics.ohio-state.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",United States,Ann Emerg Med,Annals of emergency medicine,8002646,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Bacteremia/*blood/complications/*diagnosis', 'Boston', 'Child', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Emergency Treatment/methods/standards', 'Fever/*microbiology', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukocyte Count/*standards', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Linear Models', 'Logistic Models', 'Mass Screening/*methods/standards', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Selection', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Triage/methods/standards']",2003/07/29 05:00,2003/08/23 05:00,['2003/07/29 05:00'],"['2003/07/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/29 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Emerg Med. 2003 Aug;42(2):216-25. doi: 10.1067/mem.2003.299.,,"['S0196064403004414 [pii]', '10.1067/mem.2003.299 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There has been accelerated progress in understanding the mechanisms underlying the clinical features of the disease over the last decade. The development of PNH requires not only a somatic mutation of the phospatidylinositol glycan complementation class A (PIG-A) gene, but also a survival advantage of the PNH clone ('dual pathogenesis' theory). There is increasing evidence that negative selection against the non-mutated cells rather than positive selection of the PIG-A gene mutant cells is responsible for the dominance of the PNH clone. In this review, we summarize the important advances in the understanding of PNH, but we also concentrate on the presence of PNH clones in other hematological disorders, including aplastic anemia (AA), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute leukemias, and myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative syndromes.

The mechanisms of the apoptosis was investigated in MiaPaCa2 and PANC-1 cells that have been previously shown to be responsive to arsenic trioxide. The results show the caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-9 are all activated by arsenic trioxide, together with cleavage of the downstream caspase-3 target poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). Expression of the anti-apoptosis proteins, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 expression decreased time-dependently while Bax expression increased. These findings indicate that the Bcl family of proteins, the mitochondrial pathway and activation of the caspase cascade are responsible for arsenic-induced apoptosis. Flow cytometric analysis revealed changes of cell cycle distribution from a G0/G1 phase arrest at 24 hours to G2/M phase arrest at 72 hours following arsenic treatment. The sub-G0/G1 cell population of apoptotic cells was increased at these times. Arsenic increased expression of the P21 protein and decreased levels of cyclin A, cyclin B1 and cyclin D1, but expression of CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, and cyclin E were not affected. Arsenic trioxide markedly enhanced the expression of GADD45 and GADD153 in a time-dependent manner. In summary, arsenic trioxide induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells through activating the caspase cascade via the mitochondrial pathway, GADD expression and by modifying cell cycle progress and changes in several cycle-regulating proteins. This old drug may be valuable for treatment of pancreatic cancer.","['Li, Xinquan', 'Ding, Xianzhong', 'Adrian, Thomas E']","['Li X', 'Ding X', 'Adrian TE']","['Department of Surgery, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pancreas,Pancreas,8608542,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DDIT3 protein, human)', '0 (GADD45 protein)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 7', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factor CHOP', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2003/07/29 05:00,2004/03/30 05:00,['2003/07/29 05:00'],"['2003/07/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/29 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pancreas. 2003 Aug;27(2):174-9. doi: 10.1097/00006676-200308000-00011.,,"['00006676-200308000-00011 [pii]', '10.1097/00006676-200308000-00011 [doi]']",,,['CA72712/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extramedullary involvement occurs in a subset of patients and is infrequently examined histologically. The files of M.D. Anderson Cancer Center were searched for patients with WM who underwent biopsy of one or more extramedullary sites during the course of disease. Each biopsy specimen was classified using the criteria of the World Health Organization classification. The study group consisted of 44 patients (26 men and 18 women), with a total of 51 specimens obtained from lymph nodes (n = 36), soft tissue (n = 4), spleen (n = 3), skin (n = 2), lung (n = 2), tonsils (n = 1), colon (n = 1), liver (n = 1), and gallbladder (n = 1). Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma was the most common histologic type, in 40 (78%) samples. This category was morphologically heterogeneous and was further subclassified as lymphoplasmacytic (n = 21), lymphoplasmacytoid (n = 18), and polymorphous (n = 1). Four of these LPL cases morphologically resembled marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. Four additional samples were involved by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, probably transformed from LPL. Three more samples were involved by LPL with unusual features: two were CD5-positive and one was a composite tumor with classical Hodgkin's disease. Other categories of lymphoma in this group of patients with WM included small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 2), mantle cell lymphoma (n = 1), and follicular lymphoma (n = 1). Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is most commonly associated with LPL but can rarely occur with other types of B-cell lymphoma. Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma in patients with WM is morphologically heterogeneous and can be indistinguishable from marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. CD5+ B-cell lymphomas with features otherwise typical of LPL are rare, and we think these tumors are part of the spectrum of LPL.","['Lin, Pei', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Wilson, Carla S', 'Mansoor, Adnan', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey']","['Lin P', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Wilson CS', 'Mansoor A', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. peilin@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/etiology/immunology/*pathology']",2003/07/29 05:00,2003/09/05 05:00,['2003/07/29 05:00'],"['2003/07/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/29 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2003 Aug;27(8):1104-13. doi: 10.1097/00000478-200308000-00007.,,['10.1097/00000478-200308000-00007 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed a high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method to measure vincristine concentrations in human mononuclear cells (MNC). This method, with on-line column solid-phase extraction and electrochemical detection, previously developed for determination of vincristine concentrations in human plasma, was validated for determination of intracellular vincristine concentrations over a range of 1.17 to 50.8 micro g/L with a lower limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 1.17 micro g/L. Linearity of the relationship between concentration and response was characterized by a slope (sd) of 0.0683 (0.0008), an intercept (sd) of 0.0004 micro g/L (0.0085), and a regression coefficient of 0.997 (P = 0.05). Maximum bias and within-day and between-day coefficients of variation (CV) were 14.2%, 4.8%, and 5.7%, respectively. The HPLC detector response did not interfere with the vincristine peaks of five independent MNC sources. The method was used successfully to measure intracellular vincristine concentrations in 8 of 35 bone marrow MNC samples of children newly diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 3 days after the first injection of 1.5 mg/m2 vincristine. Vincristine concentrations were in the range of 4.0 to 26.4 micro g/L, which was 5 to 20 times the bone marrow plasma concentration. The described HPLC method is accurate and precise and is suitable for detection of intracellular vincristine concentrations in MNC of children with ALL. The results confirm that in vivo vincristine accumulates in bone marrow MNC of patients.","['Groninger, Ellis', 'Koopmans, Pauline', 'Kamps, Willem', 'de Graaf, Siebold', 'Uges, Donald']","['Groninger E', 'Koopmans P', 'Kamps W', 'de Graaf S', 'Uges D']","['Department of Paediatric Oncology Haematology, University Hospital Groningen, 9700 RB, Groningen, The Netherlands. ellisgroninger@home.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/metabolism', 'Calibration', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Electrochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*chemistry', 'Linear Models', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Vincristine/*blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",2003/07/29 05:00,2003/12/16 05:00,['2003/07/29 05:00'],"['2003/07/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/29 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 2003 Aug;25(4):441-6. doi: 10.1097/00007691-200308000-00004.,,['10.1097/00007691-200308000-00004 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We evaluated the ability of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) to mediate GVL effects without GVHD in mixed chimeras prepared with cyclophosphamide, anti-T-cell antibodies, and thymic irradiation. To examine the fate of GVH-reactive donor CD8+ T cells, we used the 2C T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mouse strain, which carries an Ld-specific transgenic TCR on the B6 background. RESULTS: Administration of DLI on day 35 post-BMT led to conversion from mixed to full donor chimerism and mediated a powerful GVL effect with complete protection (100% survival) against mortality induced by a host-type lymphoma (EL4) administered 7 days later (100% mortality in non-DLI controls; P<0.001). No GVHD occurred in DLI recipients. Rechallenging the surviving DLI recipients, which had converted to full chimerism, with the same tumor dose 17 weeks later led to rapid tumor mortality. Long-term DLI recipients had anti-host proliferative responses, but not CTL responses in vitro. When given as DLI together with wild-type spleen cells, marked expansion of GVH-reactive 2C CD8+ T cells was observed on day 10, followed by a marked decline in their numbers by week 10 post-DLI. CONCLUSIONS: Nonmyeloablative induction of mixed chimerism followed by administration of DLI can mediate powerful GVL effects. The late loss of DLI-mediated GVL effects may reflect the eventual loss of donor-derived GVH-reactive CTL, which occurs in association with conversion to full donor chimerism.","['Mapara, Markus Y', 'Kim, Yong-Mi', 'Marx, Julie', 'Sykes, Megan']","['Mapara MY', 'Kim YM', 'Marx J', 'Sykes M']","['Transplantation Biology Research Center, Bone Marrow Transplantation Section, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/cytology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/drug effects/*immunology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Transplantation Chimera/*immunology', '*Transplantation Immunology']",2003/07/29 05:00,2003/09/05 05:00,['2003/07/29 05:00'],"['2003/07/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/29 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2003 Jul 27;76(2):297-305. doi: 10.1097/01.TP.0000072014.83469.2D.,,['10.1097/01.TP.0000072014.83469.2D [doi]'],,,['R01 CA 79989/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Probable occupational exposure to electromagnetic fields at higher than typical residential levels was investigated among 764 patients diagnosed with acute leukaemia during 1991-96 and 1510 sex and age matched controls. A job exposure matrix was applied to the self reported employment histories to determine whether or not a subject was exposed to electromagnetic fields. Risks were assessed using conditional logistic regression for a matched analysis. RESULTS: Study subjects considered probably ever exposed to electromagnetic fields at work were not at increased risk of acute leukaemia compared to those considered never exposed. Generally, no associations were observed on stratification by sex, leukaemia subtype, number of years since exposure stopped, or occupation; there was no evidence of a dose-response effect using increasing number of years exposed. However, relative to women considered never exposed, a significant excess of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia was observed among women probably exposed to electromagnetic fields at work that remained increased irrespective of time prior to diagnosis or job ever held. CONCLUSION: This large population based case-control study found little evidence to support an association between occupational exposure to electromagnetic fields and acute leukaemia. While an excess of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia among women was observed, it is unlikely that occupational exposure to electromagnetic fields was responsible, given that increased risks remained during periods when exposure above background levels was improbable.","['Willett, E V', 'McKinney, P A', 'Fear, N T', 'Cartwright, R A', 'Roman, E']","['Willett EV', 'McKinney PA', 'Fear NT', 'Cartwright RA', 'Roman E']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Epidemiology and Genetics Unit, Margaret Smith Building, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, UK.

METHODS: 38 cases of AL were studied. 27 of the 38 cases receiving initial treatment were randomly divided into two groups, one treated with routine chemotherapy plus thalidomide (A) and the other with routine chemotherapy alone (B). 11 of the 38 were relapsing cases and all treated with routine chemotherapy plus thalidomide (C). Marrow microvascular density (MVD) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were examined with factor-VIII related antigen/CD(34) immunohistological stain and ELISA respectively before and after the treatment. The initial dose of thalidomide was 200 mg/d and increased to 400 - 500 mg/d by increasing 50 mg/d weekly for 4 to 6 months. RESULTS: The complete remission (CR) rate and efficacy rate were 57.1%, 53.8% and 78.6%, 76.9% in the two groups respectively with no statistical difference. The CR rate and efficacy rate in the relapsing group were 27.3%, 54.5%. The relapsing rate 6 months after the treatment was low in the thalidomide group. MVD and VEGF were significantly different before and after the treatment (P < 0.001). There was a negative correlation between the MVD, VEGF and efficacy.

METHODS: 1 x 10(7) viable HL-60 cells were treated with 10 micro mol/L bcl-2 ASPO seven days before the intraperitoneal (IP) inoculation to the SCID mice, Treatment with sense oligonucleotides (SPO) was similar as for the controls. 35 days after the inoculation, all the SCID mice of both groups were sacrificed and their peripheral blood, bone marrow, liver and spleen were examined using half nested RT-PCR and histopathology for detecting the appearance and distribution of the HL-60 cells treated beforehand with antisense or sense oligonucleotides respectively. RESULTS: ASPO could down regulate the expression of bcl-2 resulting in both inhibition of growth and induction of apoptosis in treated HL-60 cells, which failed to develop leukemia in SCID mice at all. However, SPO treated HL-60 cells still behaved their own ways and proliferated agressively, and developed leukemia at last. CONCLUSION: The bcl-2 ASPO enables to suppress HL-60 cell growth and prevent the development of leukemia in the SCID mice.

DESIGN: Unblinded pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-three adult patients with acute leukaemia. METHODS: Blood, bone marrow and urine samples were collected at appropriate intervals on days 1-6. Total daunorubicin and daunorubicinol concentrations in plasma, bone marrow, peripheral blood cells and urine were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Liposomal daunorubicin exhibited a markedly different pharmacokinetic behaviour from the free drug due to a slow distribution of the liposomal moiety into the body. The ratio of area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for metabolite to parent drug was lower for liposomal daunorubicin than for free daunorubicin, mainly due to higher concentrations of the parent drug in plasma, whereas daunorubicinol exposure was more or less comparable, if not higher. After liposomal daunorubicin at both 80 and 100 mg/m(2), total daunorubicin concentrations in leukaemic cells were at least similar to those observed for free daunorubicin, and significant accumulation was also observed in bone marrow blast cells. Nineteen of 23 patients obtained a complete remission, although 13 had P-glycoprotein-overexpressing blast cells. Grade 3-4 mucositis was found only in three patients with very high AUCs for total daunorubicin and daunorubicinol. CONCLUSIONS: Liposomal daunorubicin at both 80 and 100 mg/m(2) in combination with cytarabine may represent a valid treatment for high-risk acute leukaemia. Liposomal daunorubicin may be helpful in overcoming multidrug resistance, since it shows significant accumulation into tumour target cells, irrespective of P-glycoprotein expression. The tolerability profile suggests that toxicity may be related to exposure to both the parent drug and the metabolite.","['Pea, Federico', 'Russo, Domenico', 'Michieli, Mariagrazia', 'Damiani, Daniela', 'Fanin, Renato', 'Michelutti, Angela', 'Michelutti, Teresa', 'Piccolrovazzi, Stefano', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Furlanut, Mario']","['Pea F', 'Russo D', 'Michieli M', 'Damiani D', 'Fanin R', 'Michelutti A', 'Michelutti T', 'Piccolrovazzi S', 'Baccarani M', 'Furlanut M']","['Department of Experimental and Clinical Pathology and Medicine, Institute of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Udine, Udine, Italy. federico.pea@med.uniud.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,"['0 (Liposomes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liposomes', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",2003/07/29 05:00,2003/12/06 05:00,['2003/07/29 05:00'],"['2003/07/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/29 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 2003;42(9):851-62. doi: 10.2165/00003088-200342090-00004.,,"['4294 [pii]', '10.2165/00003088-200342090-00004 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A review of the literature.,181-93,"Routine platelet transfusions for patients with acute leukemia were introduced in the early 1960s, and since then platelet use has increased steadily. Despite widespread use, good clinical evidence supporting prophylactic platelet transfusions is limited, and there are very few studies that have examined the dose for prophylactic platelet transfusions. Review of the platelet dose used in both early studies of routine platelet transfusions and more recent clinical trials of platelet transfusions shows wide variation in dosing, which is also reflected in clinical practice. As such, only limited recommendations for platelet dose have been forthcoming from consensus conferences or guidelines. The results from 3 recent clinical trials and a mathematical model examining the dose for prophylactic platelet transfusions suggest that lower dose transfusions may decrease the total number of platelets transfused; however, no definitive conclusions about the optimal platelet dose can be reached as these trials were not designed to evaluate bleeding outcomes or total platelet utilization. Future large clinical trials of platelet dose, which examine these critical outcomes, are required. Only with these results can the optimal platelet dose be determined.","['Tinmouth, Alan T', 'Freedman, John']","['Tinmouth AT', 'Freedman J']","['University of Ottawa Centre for Transfusion Research, Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada. atinmouth@ottawahospital.on.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Transfus Med Rev,Transfusion medicine reviews,8709027,['0 (Isoantibodies)'],IM,"['Blood Donors', 'Blood Platelets/immunology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Hemorrhage/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Isoantibodies/blood', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Platelet Count', '*Platelet Transfusion/methods', 'Plateletpheresis', 'Thrombocytopenia/prevention & control']",2003/07/26 05:00,2003/11/08 05:00,['2003/07/26 05:00'],"['2003/07/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/26 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transfus Med Rev. 2003 Jul;17(3):181-93. doi: 10.1016/s0887-7963(03)00018-x.,,"['S088779630300018X [pii]', '10.1016/s0887-7963(03)00018-x [doi]']",,,,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nine of the Mlh1-/-;Nf1+/- mice were found to harbor intrathoracic NOS2-immunoreactive myeloid leukemias similar to the hematopoietic malignancies observed in older Nf1+/- mice.

To gain insight into the processes that govern tumor onset and progression, we have examined the impact of BLV-Tax expression on ovine B-cells, the targets of BLV in experimentally infected sheep, using B-cell clones that are dependent on CD154 and gammac-common cytokines. Tax was capable of mediating progression of B-cells from cytokine dependence to cytokine independence, indicating that the transactivator can over-ride signaling pathways typically controlled by cytokine receptor activation in B-cells. When examined in the presence of both CD154 and interleukin-4, Tax had a clear supportive role on B-cell growth, with an impact on B-cell proliferation, cell cycle phase distribution, and survival. Apoptotic B-cell death mediated by growth factor withdrawal, physical insult, and NF-kappaB inhibition was dramatically reduced in the presence of Tax. Furthermore, the expression of Tax was associated with higher Bcl-2 protein levels, providing rationale for the rescue signals mediated by the transactivator. Finally, Tax expression in B-cells led to a dramatic increase of nuclear RelB/p50 and p50/p50 NF-kappaB dimers, indicating that cellular signaling through NF-kappaB is a major contributory mechanism in the disruption of B-cell homeostasis. Although Tax is involved in aspects of pathogenesis that are unique to complex retroviruses, the viral strategies associated with this transactivating oncoprotein may have wide-ranging effects that are relevant to other B-cell malignancies.","['Szynal, Maud', 'Cleuter, Yvette', 'Beskorwayne, Terry', 'Bagnis, Claude', 'Van Lint, Carine', 'Kerkhofs, Pierre', 'Burny, Aisene', 'Martiat, Philippe', 'Griebel, Philip', 'Van den Broeke, Anne']","['Szynal M', 'Cleuter Y', 'Beskorwayne T', 'Bagnis C', 'Van Lint C', 'Kerkhofs P', 'Burny A', 'Martiat P', 'Griebel P', 'Van den Broeke A']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Bordet Institute, 1000 Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism/virology', 'CD40 Ligand/pharmacology/physiology', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells/cytology/metabolism/virology', 'Cytokines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology/physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/chemistry', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Sheep', '*Signal Transduction', 'Up-Regulation']",2003/07/26 05:00,2003/08/20 05:00,['2003/07/26 05:00'],"['2003/07/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/26 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Jul 17;22(29):4531-42. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206546.,,"['10.1038/sj.onc.1206546 [doi]', '1206546 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML/ETO may contribute to leukemogenesis by interacting with nuclear corepressor complexes that include histone deacetylases, which mediate the repression of target genes. However, expression of AE is not sufficient to transform primary hematopoietic cells or cause disease in animals, suggesting that additional mutations are required. Activating mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) are present in at least 30% of patients with AML. To test the hypothesis that activating RTK mutations cooperate with AE to cause leukemia, we transplanted retrovirally transduced murine bone marrow coexpressing TEL-PDGFRB and AE into lethally irradiated syngeneic mice. These mice (19/19, 100%) developed AML resembling M2-AML that was transplantable in secondary recipients. In contrast, control mice coexpressing with TEL-PDGFRB and a DNA-binding-mutant of AE developed a nontransplantable myeloproliferative disease identical to that induced by TEL-PDGFRB alone. We used this unique model of AML to test the efficacy of pharmacological inhibition of histone deacetylase activity by using trichostatin A and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid alone or in combination with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate. We found that although imatinib prolonged the survival of treated mice, histone deacetylase inhibitors provided no additional survival benefit. These data demonstrate that an activated RTK can cooperate with AE to cause AML in mice, and that this system can be used to evaluate novel therapeutic strategies.","['Grisolano, Jay L', ""O'Neal, Julie"", 'Cain, Jennifer', 'Tomasson, Michael H']","['Grisolano JL', ""O'Neal J"", 'Cain J', 'Tomasson MH']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, Siteman Cancer Center, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (TEL-PDGFRbeta fusion protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Genetic', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/biosynthesis', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Vorinostat']",2003/07/26 05:00,2003/10/04 05:00,['2003/07/26 05:00'],"['2003/07/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/26 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Aug 5;100(16):9506-11. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1531730100.

Imatinib mesylate (STI-571 or Gleevec) is a potent inhibitor of the BCR/ABL and c-KIT tyrosine kinases. It has displayed considerable efficacy in treatment of patients with Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia and those with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). However, recently imatinib-resistant relapse has emerged as a significant problem. Although a major cause of resistance appears to be point mutation in the kinase domain of the target enzyme, the potential contribution of elevated multidrug efflux activity has not been systematically evaluated. The imatinib-sensitive human leukemic cell line K562, which is dependent on the activity of BCR/ABL for survival and growth, provides a convenient system for evaluating modulation of drug activity. By expressing Pgp at high levels in these cells, we have demonstrated that this pump provides minimal protection against cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induced by imatinib. In contrast, overexpression of Bcl-xL, which blocks apoptosis, resulted in partial protection against the drug. We conclude that Pgp up-regulation is not likely to be a significant contributor to imatinib resistance.","['Ferrao, Petranel T', 'Frost, Michelle J', 'Siah, Shoo-Peng', 'Ashman, Leonie K']","['Ferrao PT', 'Frost MJ', 'Siah SP', 'Ashman LK']","['Rm 511, Medical Sciences Bldg, University of Newcastle, University Dr, Callaghan, New South Wales 2308, Australia. petranel.ferrao@newcastle.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Biological Transport', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*physiology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'bcl-X Protein']",2003/07/26 05:00,2004/01/22 05:00,['2003/07/26 05:00'],"['2003/07/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/22 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/26 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Dec 15;102(13):4499-503. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-01-0083.

We now demonstrate high-level expression of the MEIS1 and MEIS2 genes, as well as efficient expression of most other TALE family member genes in a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines. Stable transfection of MEIS1-expressing cell lines with cDNA encoding a naturally occurring dominant-negative splice variant of MEIS1 (MEIS1E) yielded clones with impaired cell proliferation, gain of differentiated phenotype, and increased contact inhibition and cell death. This indicated a relevance of MEIS expression for neuroblastoma cell growth and proliferation. We therefore determined the gene expression profiles of several MEIS1E transfectants using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). A large number of genes showed differential expression as a result of MEIS1E expression. These include genes involved in developmental signalling pathways, chromatin binding, cell cycle control, proliferation, and apoptosis. The results presented provide important clues for the oncogenic function of MEIS1 in neuroblastoma.","['Geerts, Dirk', 'Schilderink, Nathalie', 'Jorritsma, Gerda', 'Versteeg, Rogier']","['Geerts D', 'Schilderink N', 'Jorritsma G', 'Versteeg R']","['Department of Human Genetics M1-159, Academic Medical Centre, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. d.geerts@amc.uva.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Chromosomes, Human/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neuroblastoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Oncogenes/genetics']",2003/07/26 05:00,2003/09/25 05:00,['2003/07/26 05:00'],"['2003/07/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/26 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2003 Jul 18;197(1-2):87-92. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(03)00087-9.,,"['S0304383503000879 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(03)00087-9 [doi]']",,,,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TPMT activity is polymorphic as a result of gene mutations. Ethnic variations in phenotype and genotype have been identified in previous population studies, but no information was available within Latin-American populations. AIM: To establish the genetic polymorphism of TPMT in an Argentine population. METHODS: TPMT enzymatic activity of 147 healthy Argentine subjects was measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography method. The genotyping assay for nine defective alleles (TPMT*2 - *8) was based on restriction fragment length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction and allele-specific polymerase chain reaction methods. RESULTS: All subjects had detectable TPMT activity. Twelve individuals with low to intermediate activity were heterozygous for one of the mutant alleles: nine were TPMT*1/*3A, two TPMT*1/*2 and one TPMT*1/*4. All examined subjects with normal activity had wild-type genotype (TPMT*1/*1). CONCLUSION: Variant TPMT alleles were present in 8.2% of the examined subjects, which is in accordance with other studies. The frequency of TPMT*3A, TPMT*2 and TPMT*4 was 3.1%, 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. TPMT*3A was the most prevalent allele, which is in accordance with results from Caucasian populations. This study provides the first analysis of TPMT activity and allele frequency distribution in Argentina, South America.","['Larovere, L E', 'de Kremer, R Dodelson', 'Lambooy, L H J', 'De Abreu, R A']","['Larovere LE', 'de Kremer RD', 'Lambooy LH', 'De Abreu RA']","['Centro de Estudio de las Metabolopatias l Congenitas, Catedra de Clinica Pediatrica l Universidad Nacional de Cordoba Hospital de Ninos de la Santisima Trinidad l Ferroviarios 1250, X5014AKN Cordoba, Argentina. lauralarovere@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Clin Biochem,Annals of clinical biochemistry,0324055,"['EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Argentina', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ethnicity/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymorphism, Genetic']",2003/07/26 05:00,2004/02/21 05:00,['2003/07/26 05:00'],"['2003/07/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/26 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Clin Biochem. 2003 Jul;40(Pt 4):388-93. doi: 10.1258/000456303766477039.,,['10.1258/000456303766477039 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluconazole is an attractive alternative for antifungal prophylaxis because of its activity against many Candida species, long half-life, good patient tolerability, and minimal associated toxicity. The results of clinical trials suggest that fluconazole is superior to placebo and oral polyenes in preventing superficial fungal infection in neutropenic patients; however, its efficacy against systemic infection is not as strongly supported. Fluconazole use may increase emergence of resistant yeasts, particularly Candida krusei and Torulopsis glabrata. The cost of fluconazole 50 mg/day is similar to the costs of other antifungals used for prophylaxis; however, fluconazole 400 mg/day (the most frequently studied dose in neutropenic patients) is considerably more expensive. Comparative clinical trials between fluconazole and other antifungals are needed to determine which is superior for prophylaxis. Fluconazole is effective for prophylaxis against superficial fungal infection and may be an attractive alternative therapeutic regimen in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation.

The objective of the current study was to determine the levels of sTNFRp55 and their impact on outcome in 106 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first recurrence. METHODS: Between January 1997 and December 2001, bone marrow (BM) samples were collected from 106 children with a first recurrence of ALL at diagnosis. These patients were enrolled in the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) ALL recurrence trial, ALL-REZ BFM 90-96. Levels of sTNFRp55 in BM samples were determined with a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival were assessed from the date of study entry or the date of randomization, as appropriate. RESULTS: The mean sTNFRp55 level (+/- standard deviation) was 3.40 +/- 2.57 ng/mL. High levels of sTNFRp55 were associated with shorter duration of first complete remission and observation time as well as poor response to chemotherapy. Most importantly, the probability of EFS (pEFS) at 3 years was significantly worse for children with recurrent ALL who had sTNFRp55 levels greater than the median value (> 2.77 ng/mL) compared with patients who had levels that were less than the median value (pEFS: 0.44 +/- 0.10 ng/mL vs. 0.12 +/- 0.10 ng/mL; P = 0.006). It is noteworthy that the sTNFRp55 levels in 22 children with recurrent, TEL-AML1-positive ALL ([t(12;21)(p13;q22)]; 2.69 +/- 1.05 ng/mL) were significantly lower compared with the levels in children who had TEL-AML1-negative ALL (3.34 +/- 1.49 ng/mL; P < 0.05).

METHODS: The study was based on data collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program for cancers diagnosed in the U.S. between 1973 and 1998. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for new malignancies was estimated as the number of patients diagnosed with a particular type of cancer (observed), divided by the number of diagnoses expected based on person-years of follow-up and incidence rates for SEER cancer registries. RESULTS: Among patients who were diagnosed first with cancer of the brain or CNS, statistically significant excesses were observed for cancers of bone (SIR = 14.4), soft tissue (SIR = 4.6), brain and CNS (SIR = 5.9), salivary gland (SIR = 5.1), and thyroid gland (SIR = 2.7) in addition to acute myelocytic leukemia (SIR = 4.1) and melanoma of the skin (SIR = 1.7). Excess risk of new malignancies was markedly greater after first cancers of the brain or CNS diagnosed in childhood compared with similar diagnoses in adulthood. In reverse associations, significant excesses of cancer of the brain and CNS were observed only after diagnoses of acute lymphocytic leukemia (SIR = 7.4) and cancer of the testis (SIR = 1.8) or the thyroid gland (SIR = 1.7). CONCLUSIONS: Cancer treatment appears to have been the major factor underlying most of the positive associations between brain cancer and primary cancers of other types, with a probable lesser contribution from shared genetic susceptibility.

Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent that has shown encouraging preliminary anti-CML activity. This study evaluated the activity and toxicity of decitabine in different phases of CML. METHODS: One hundred and thirty patients with CML were treated: 123 with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive CML (64 blastic, 51 accelerated, 8 chronic) and 7 with Ph-negative CML. Decitabine was given at 100 mg/m(2) over 6 hours every 12 hours x 5 days (1000 mg/m(2) per course) in the first 13 patients, 75 mg/m(2) in the subsequent 33 patients, and 50 mg/m(2) in the remaining 84 patients. RESULTS: A total of 552 courses were given to the 130 patients. Only four patients (3%) died during the first course from myelosuppressive complications (three patients) or progressive disease (one patient). Of 64 patients in the CML blastic phase, 18 patients (28%) achieved objective responses. Of these 18 patients, 6 achieved complete hematologic responses (CHR), 2 achieved partial hematologic responses (PHR), 7 achieved hematologic improvements (HI), and 3 returned to the second chronic phase (second CP). Five patients (8%) had cytogenetic responses. Among 51 patients in the accelerated phase, 28 patients (55%) achieved objective responses (12 CHR, 10 PHR, 3 HI, and 3 second CP). Seven patients (14%) had cytogenetic responses. Among eight patients treated in the chronic phase, five (63%) had objective responses. Of seven patients treated for Ph-negative CML, four (57%) had objective responses. There was no evidence of a dose-response effect. The estimated 3-year survival rate was less than 5% in the blastic phase and 27% in the accelerated phase. The only significant toxicity reported was severe myelosuppression, which was delayed, prolonged, and dose dependent. With decitabine 50-75 mg/m(2), the median time to granulocyte recovery above 0.5 x 10(9)/L was about 4 weeks. Myelosuppression-associated complications included febrile episodes in 37% and documented infections in 34%. CONCLUSIONS: Decitabine appears to have significant anti-CML activity. Future studies should evaluate lower-dose, longer-exposure decitabine schedules alone in imatinib-resistant CML, as well as combinations of decitabine and imatinib in different CML phases.","['Kantarjian, Hagop M', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Rios, Mary Beth', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Keating, Michael', 'Talpaz, Moshe']","['Kantarjian HM', ""O'Brien S"", 'Cortes J', 'Giles FJ', 'Faderl S', 'Issa JP', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Rios MB', 'Shan J', 'Andreeff M', 'Keating M', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Members of this family have diverse biologic effects, including induction of apoptosis, promotion of cell survival, and regulation of the immune system. The current review focuses on four members that play important roles in regulating hematopoietic cells and are involved in the pathogenesis of several hematologic malignancies.

In cells transformed with BCR/ABL, Stat5 is constitutively activated by promiscuous phosphorylation. Cytometry of intracellular antigens can be used to evaluate cell treatments affecting gene expression, because it precisely provides the fraction of affected cells and the quantitative change in expression. Here, we asked whether we could measure a phosphorylated epitope on Stat5 by cytometry, and whether that measurement would respond to Bcr/Abl inhibition. METHODS: Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell lines or control Bcr/Abl-negative cells were treated or not with imatinib mesylate, fixed and permeabilized with formaldehyde followed by methanol; reacted with rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal antibodies against an epitope including tyrosine 694 of Stat5a (pSTAT5); reacted with antibodies that mark mitotic cells; counterstained with secondary fluorescent antibodies and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI); and then subjected to flow cytometry. Western blotting was performed with pSTAT5 and Stat5 antibodies. RESULTS: Optimal fixation and staining parameters were established for pSTAT5 antibodies with K562 cells. These cells displayed high levels of immunoreactivity with pSTAT5 probes that could be inhibited uniformly with imatinib mesylate in a dose-response and time-dependent manner. The IC50 for downregulation of pSTAT5 immunoreactivity for K562 cells by cytometry was approximately 70 nM. The inhibition half-time was approximately 1 min. At micromolar doses this reactivity remained minimal for up to 7 days. Cultured cells also displayed a population of negative cells that increased under conditions related to cessation of cell growth (media nutrient depletion). This study also showed quantitatively that a rabbit polyclonal antibody that cross-reacted with an additional epitope could be used successfully as a measure of Bcr/Abl activity. CONCLUSION: We have developed a sensitive cytometric assay for Bcr/Abl kinase activity in human hematopoietic cell lines.","['Jacobberger, James W', 'Sramkoski, R Michael', 'Frisa, Phyllis S', 'Ye, Peggy Peng', 'Gottlieb, Megan A', 'Hedley, David W', 'Shankey, T Vincent', 'Smith, Bradley L', 'Paniagua, Mary', 'Goolsby, Charles L']","['Jacobberger JW', 'Sramkoski RM', 'Frisa PS', 'Ye PP', 'Gottlieb MA', 'Hedley DW', 'Shankey TV', 'Smith BL', 'Paniagua M', 'Goolsby CL']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106-4944, USA. jwj@cwru.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

However, there exist cases in which the cause of thrombocytopenia has been unexplained. Recently, thrombopoietin (TPO) from bone marrow (BM) stromal cells and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta from platelets and megakaryocytes have been identified as strong positive and negative regulators of megakaryopoiesis in vivo. We hypothesized that the decreased TPO production from BM could be one of the causes of thrombocytopenia in the patients with cGVHD. In the present study, therefore, TPO and TGF-beta concentrations in peripheral blood (PB) and BM were measured serially in two patients with acute leukemia who had received fully matched stem cell transplantation from relatives and subsequently developed extensive cGVHD with thrombocytopenia. The results showed that platelet numbers correlated well with the TPO concentrations, which were consistently higher in BM than in PB. The difference in TPO concentrations between BM and PB was decreased when the platelet levels were low, indicating that the amount of TPO production from BM decreased throughout the duration of thrombocytopenia. TGF-beta concentrations were normal during all periods in which measurements were carried out. Thus, our results suggest that one mechanism of thrombocytopenia in patients with cGVHD is low TPO production by BM cells.","['Hirayama, Yasuo', 'Sakamaki, Sumio', 'Tsuji, Yasushi', 'Sagawa, Tamotsu', 'Chiba, Hiroki', 'Matsunaga, Takuya', 'Kuroda, Hiroyuki', 'Kusakabe, Toshiro', 'Akiyama, Takehide', 'Kato, Junji', 'Niitsu, Yoshiro']","['Hirayama Y', 'Sakamaki S', 'Tsuji Y', 'Sagawa T', 'Chiba H', 'Matsunaga T', 'Kuroda H', 'Kusakabe T', 'Akiyama T', 'Kato J', 'Niitsu Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Higashi Sapporo Hospital, Sapporo, Japan. yhirayama@hsh.or.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*complications', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/therapy', 'Platelet Count', 'Thrombocytopenia/*etiology', 'Thrombopoietin/*analysis/blood', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/analysis/blood']",2003/07/25 05:00,2003/09/17 05:00,['2003/07/25 05:00'],"['2003/07/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2003 Aug;73(4):285-9. doi: 10.1002/ajh.10345.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/ajh.10345 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The adult form is characterized by the presence of Philadelphia chromosome resulting from bcr/abl translocation. The BCR-ABL fusion proteins are immunogenic, and the junctional sequences show unique HLA class I and class II restriction patterns in vitro. A previous study in the west of Scotland showed an influence of several HLA genotypes on the age-at-onset of CML. In the present study, we examined the HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1/3/4/5 allele and haplotype distributions in Turkish CML patients diagnosed in a single center where they are routinely HLA-typed by PCR-SSP analysis as a preparation for stem cell transplantation. The patients were 169 subjects of age 17-60 years. The older patients were not HLA typed and missing from the study group. The age-matched control group (n = 213) was healthy blood donors from the same geographical area. HLA-B*37 showed a risk association with CML [P = 0.02; odds ratio (OR) = 5.35]. The DRB1*10 association at similar magnitude was due to its linkage disequilibrium (LD) with B*37. HLA-B*35 and DRB1*11 showed independent protective effects (P = 0.007 and 0.017; OR = 0.54 and 0.60, respectively). The protective association of DRB1*11 may be due to its involvement in the presentation of the common (b3a2) fusion gene. HLA-B*14 and DRB1*01 showed strong LD, and all 5 patients who were positive for the presumed haplotype B*14-DRB1*01 were of age 43 years old or older (P = 0.003), suggesting a delay effect. We also examined the influence of homozygosity for DRB3 (DR52) and DRB4 (DR53) haplotypes on susceptibility. As previously shown in CML and CLL, DRB4 homozygosity was a risk marker (P = 0.01; OR = 3.36), and DRB3 homozygosity was protective (P = 0.007; OR = 0.51). Despite the lack of elderly patients in the study group, the opposite accelerating (DRB4) and delaying (DRB3) effects of homozygous genotypes on the age-at-onset were evident. Besides replicating previously found associations in a different population, this study also suggested new, and probably population-specific associations in CML. The mechanisms by which the HLA system modifies susceptibility to CML are unknown, likely to include immune and nonimmune ones, and worthy of further studies.","['Oguz, Fatma Savran', 'Kalayoglu, Sevgi', 'Diler, A Sarper', 'Tozkir, Hilmi', 'Sargin, Deniz', 'Carin, Mahmut', 'Dorak, M Tevfik']","['Oguz FS', 'Kalayoglu S', 'Diler AS', 'Tozkir H', 'Sargin D', 'Carin M', 'Dorak MT']","['Department of Medical Biology, Istanbul University, Istanbul Medical School, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DRB1 Chains)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Age of Onset', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'HLA Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-A Antigens/genetics', 'HLA-B Antigens/genetics', 'HLA-DR Antigens/genetics', 'HLA-DRB1 Chains', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology/genetics/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Turkey/epidemiology']",2003/07/25 05:00,2003/09/17 05:00,['2003/07/25 05:00'],"['2003/07/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2003 Aug;73(4):256-62. doi: 10.1002/ajh.10365.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/ajh.10365 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an identical clinical trial setting with 39 chronic-phase CML patients we achieved comparable cytogenetic response rates after a median follow up of 30.1 weeks, with an almost identical toxicity profile. In order to identify predictive markers for the therapeutical use of imatinib, we monitored apart from standard hematology parameters bcr/abl fusion transcripts by quantitative real-time fluorescence RT-PCR. As previous investigations demonstrated that the plasma protein alpha-1 acid glycoprotein might inactivate circulating levels of free imatinib by protein binding with high affinity, we assessed plasma alpha-1 acid glycoprotein concentrations in our study cohort as well. Median bcr/abl fusion transcripts declined gradually over the entire treatment period and became significantly lowered at month 3 after initiation of imatinib therapy. Further, we observed elevated pretreatment levels of alpha-1 acid glycoprotein in patients who relapsed with leukemia, whereas initial bcr/abl mRNA copy numbers were not of predictive value. In addition, we provide data showing molecular response to this therapy in the vast majority of patients. Finally, our results support the hypothesis, that initially elevated plasma levels of alpha-1 acid glycoprotein might serve as a predictive marker for the clinical outcome of treatment with imatinib.","['Le Coutre, Philipp', 'Kreuzer, Karl-Anton', 'Na, Il-Kang', 'Schwarz, Michaela', 'Lupberger, Joachim', 'Holdhoff, Matthias', 'Baskaynak, Gokben', 'Gschaidmeier, Harald', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Prejzner, Witold', 'Huhn, Dieter', 'Schmidt, Christian A']","['Le Coutre P', 'Kreuzer KA', 'Na IK', 'Schwarz M', 'Lupberger J', 'Holdhoff M', 'Baskaynak G', 'Gschaidmeier H', 'Platzbecker U', 'Ehninger G', 'Prejzner W', 'Huhn D', 'Schmidt CA']","['Medizinische Klinik mit Schwerpunkt Hamatologie und Onkologie, Campus Virchow, Charite, Humboldt Universitat Berlin, Germany. lecoutrep@aol.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Orosomucoid)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Orosomucoid/analysis', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors']",2003/07/25 05:00,2003/09/17 05:00,['2003/07/25 05:00'],"['2003/07/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2003 Aug;73(4):249-55. doi: 10.1002/ajh.10364.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/ajh.10364 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent reports suggest that C/EBPalpha is activated or inactivated via protein-protein interactions. We previously reported that C/EBPalpha needs to inactivate the proto-oncogene c-Jun via leucine zipper domain interaction in order to induce granulocytic differentiation. We, therefore, hypothesized that c-Jun expression might be elevated in AML and subsequently inactivate C/EBPalpha. In fact, compared to normal bone marrow mononuclear cells, c-Jun expression is increased in AML patient samples (Affymetrix expression microarray analysis, n=166). c-Jun binds to C/EBPalpha via the leucine zipper domains and prevents C/EBPalpha from DNA binding. Inactivation of C/EBPalpha by c-Jun is necessary for c-Jun to induce proliferation because c-Jun-induced proliferation can be prevented by ectopic overexpression of C/EBPalpha. The dominant-negative 30-kDa C/EBPalpha protein, found in AML, fails to downregulate c-Jun mRNA expression in AML patient samples. Thus, our data suggest a model for AML in which c-Jun promotes proliferation and prevents differentiation by inhibiting C/EBPalpha DNA binding via leucine zipper domain interaction. It might depend on the expression levels of C/EBPalpha and c-Jun, if inhibition of C/EBPalpha by c-Jun or if inhibition of c-Jun by C/EBPalpha is more predominant: proliferation versus differentiation; AML versus normal myeloid development.","['Rangatia, Janki', 'Vangala, Rajani K', 'Singh, Sheo M', 'Peer Zada, Abdul A', 'Elsasser, Annika', 'Kohlmann, Alexander', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Tenen, Daniel G', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Behre, Gerhard']","['Rangatia J', 'Vangala RK', 'Singh SM', 'Peer Zada AA', 'Elsasser A', 'Kohlmann A', 'Haferlach T', 'Tenen DG', 'Hiddemann W', 'Behre G']","['Medicine III at University of Munich Hospital Grosshadern and GSF Research Center, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Models, Molecular', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/07/25 05:00,2003/11/08 05:00,['2003/07/25 05:00'],"['2003/07/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Jul 24;22(30):4760-4. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206664.,,"['10.1038/sj.onc.1206664 [doi]', '1206664 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to identify unique oncogenes that are differentially expressed in human cancers and characterize their functions in tumorigenesis. To discover new putative oncogenes, the differential display RT-PCR method was applied using normal cervical tissues, cervical cancer cell lines, cervical cancer tissues, and metastatic tissues. We identified a new human cervical cancer oncogene HCCR-2 that was overexpressed in various human tumors including leukemia, lymphoma, and carcinomas of the breast, kidney, ovary, stomach, colon, and uterine cervix. Ectopic expression of HCCR-2 resulted in direct tumorigenic conversions of NIH/3T3 and Rat1 fibroblasts. Nude mice injected with NIH/3T3 cells stably transfected with HCCR-2 formed tumors in 4 weeks. The resultant tumors display characteristics of an epithelial carcinoma. In HCCR-2 transfected NCI-H460 cells and RKO cells, stabilization of the p53 tumor suppressor occurred without genetic mutation and correlated with functional impairment, as indicated by the defective induction of p53-induced p21(WAF1), MDM2, and bax. These results indicate that HCCR-2 probably represents a new oncogene that is related to tumorigenesis, functioning as a negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor.","['Ko, Jesang', 'Lee, Young Han', 'Hwang, Seung Yong', 'Lee, Youn Soo', 'Shin, Seung Min', 'Hwang, Jae Hoon', 'Kim, Jin', 'Kim, Yong Wook', 'Jang, Sung-Wuk', 'Ryoo, Zae Young', 'Kim, In-Kyung', 'Namkoong, Sung Eun', 'Kim, Jin Woo']","['Ko J', 'Lee YH', 'Hwang SY', 'Lee YS', 'Shin SM', 'Hwang JH', 'Kim J', 'Kim YW', 'Jang SW', 'Ryoo ZY', 'Kim IK', 'Namkoong SE', 'Kim JW']","['Asan Institute for Life Sciences, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul 138-736, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Cdk5r1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cdk5r1 protein, rat)', '0 (LETMD1 protein, human)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cervix Uteri/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lipoproteins/*metabolism', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microscopy, Phase-Contrast', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Oncogenes/*genetics', '*Phosphotransferases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Rats', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism']",2003/07/25 05:00,2003/11/08 05:00,['2003/07/25 05:00'],"['2003/07/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Jul 24;22(30):4679-89. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206624.,,"['10.1038/sj.onc.1206624 [doi]', '1206624 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical records of 3 patients. RESULTS: Two patients presented with bilateral dermatochalasis that obscured the upper visual field and was more prominent on one side. One patient presented with bilateral ptosis and dermatochalasis. All three patients underwent bilateral upper blepharoplasty. In one patient, bilateral ptosis repair was performed in addition to upper blepharoplasty. Blepharoplasty specimens were sent for histopathologic analysis because of the unusual appearance of the preaponeurotic fat at the time of surgery. Histopathology showed low-grade B-cell lymphocytic lymphoma in all three cases. Postoperative CT scan showed a mass in the lacrimal fossa in one patient. None of the patients had evidence of systemic involvement. Two patients were treated with external beam radiotherapy with good results. One patient recently diagnosed with orbital lymphoma was referred to the oncology clinic for further treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Histopathologic evaluation of blepharoplasty specimens is highly recommended in cases in which the orbital fat has an unusual appearance, color, or consistency at the time of surgery.","['Arat, Yonca Ozkan', 'Boniuk, Milton']","['Arat YO', 'Boniuk M']","['Baylor College of Medicine, Department of Opthalmology, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg,Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery,8508431,,IM,"['Aged', '*Blepharoplasty', 'Blepharoptosis/surgery', 'Cutis Laxa/surgery', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidental Findings', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Orbital Neoplasms/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/radiotherapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2003/07/25 05:00,2003/10/08 05:00,['2003/07/25 05:00'],"['2003/07/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg. 2003 Jul;19(4):316-9. doi: 10.1097/01.IOP.0000077085.58437.81.,,"['10.1097/01.IOP.0000077085.58437.81 [doi]', '00002341-200307000-00011 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHOD: We examined 6 children, aged from 7 to 15 yrs, 3 with brain tumours, 1 with esthesioneuroblastoma treated with chemo and radiotherapy and 2 patients with chemotherapy only, for other neoplasms (leukemia, Wilms tumor). Indications to perform imaging studies were routine for brain tumour patients (no clinical symptoms) and suspicion of disease recurrence in others. MR with 1.5 T scanner and additionally single voxel HMRS in PRESS sequence were performed. RESULTS: In all cases MRI showed extensive hyperintensive changes in brain tissue with significant mass effect. In 3 cases HMRS was within normal limits, in other 3 cases moderately elevated peak of choline and peak of lactate and lipids were found. In follow up examinations all lesions regressed and all patients are in good clinical condition. COMMENTS: It could be difficult to differentiate white matter injury from malignancies on MRI.

These modifications are tightly controlled in the cell because they are involved in vital processes such as cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis. Therefore, any deregulation of acetylation/deacetylation equilibrium or inappropriate modifications could lead to different diseases. Since previous studies have shown that some oncoproteins also undergo this modification, acetylation could be involved in the processes of cell transformation and oncogenesis. Here, we report that AML1/MDS1/EVI1 (AME), a repressor produced by the t(3;21) associated with human leukemia, physically interacts with the acetyltransferases P/CAF and GCN5. Our data suggest that AME has at least two binding sites for these acetyltransferases, one of which is in the Runt domain. Both P/CAF and GCN5 efficiently acetylate AME in vivo in the central region. AME acetylation has no effect on its interaction with the co-repressor CtBP1. Finally, we demonstrate that the co-expression of AME and either P/CAF or GCN5 abrogates the repression of an AML1-dependent reporter gene.","['Senyuk, Vitalyi', 'Sinha, Kislay Kumar', 'Chakraborty, Soumen', 'Buonamici, Silvia', 'Nucifora, Giuseppina']","['Senyuk V', 'Sinha KK', 'Chakraborty S', 'Buonamici S', 'Nucifora G']","['Department of Pathology, Molecular Biology Research Building, M/C 737, University of Illinois at Chicago, 900 South Ashland Avenue, Chicago, IL 60607, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (AML1-MDS1-EVI1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.1.- (Alcohol Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (C-terminal binding protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Gcn5l2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT2A protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP-associated factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Acetyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Alcohol Oxidoreductases', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/analysis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors']",2003/07/25 05:00,2003/09/13 05:00,['2003/07/25 05:00'],"['2003/07/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2003 Aug 8;307(4):980-6. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(03)01288-9.,,"['S0006291X03012889 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(03)01288-9 [doi]']",,,"['CA72675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA96448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells depleted of mtDNA were resistant to araG, but the mechanism of resistance was not specific for nucleoside analogs incorporated into mtDNA.

The P0 transcript is distinguished from the predominant P1 and P2 c-myc mRNAs by an approximately 639-nucleotide extension of the 5'-untranslated region. We hypothesized that this complex 5'-untranslated RNA sequence unique to the P0 transcript may contribute significantly to the composite regulation of the c-myc locus and that enforced intracellular synthesis of the isolated P0 5'-UTR, out of its native sequence context, might amplify or dominantly interfere with its normal regulatory function. Human tumor (HeLa) cells in which the isolated P0 5'-UTR was ectopically expressed displayed a dramatic decrease in anchorage-independent proliferation. Furthermore, P0 5'-UTR-expressing HeLa cells failed to form tumors when inoculated into SCID mice. This loss of tumorigenicity was associated with increases in levels of the c-Myc1 (p67) and c-Myc2 (p64) proteins and a 3- to 5-fold elevation of spontaneous apoptotic index. These results demonstrate that an isolated 5'-untranslated RNA sequence can be attributed potent in trans gene-regulatory and phenotype-altering capabilities and that extrinsic alterations in c-myc regulation can be utilized to reestablish the natural proapoptotic (tumor suppressor) activities associated with this protooncogene.","['Blume, Scott W', 'Miller, Donald M', 'Guarcello, Vincenzo', 'Shrestha, Kedar', 'Meng, Zheng', 'Snyder, Richard C', 'Grizzle, William E', 'Ruppert, J Michael', 'Gartland, G Larry', 'Stockard, Cecil R', 'Jones, David E Jr', 'Emanuel, Peter D']","['Blume SW', 'Miller DM', 'Guarcello V', 'Shrestha K', 'Meng Z', 'Snyder RC', 'Grizzle WE', 'Ruppert JM', 'Gartland GL', 'Stockard CR', 'Jones DE Jr', 'Emanuel PD']","['Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Tumor Institute, Room 508, 1824 6th Avenue South, Birmingham, AL 35294-3300, USA. scott.blume@ccc.uab.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions/*genetics"", 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*pharmacology', 'Transfection']",2003/07/25 05:00,2003/09/25 05:00,['2003/07/25 05:00'],"['2003/07/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2003 Aug 1;288(1):131-42. doi: 10.1016/s0014-4827(03)00182-4.,,"['S0014482703001824 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-4827(03)00182-4 [doi]']",,,"['CA 80916/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 87312/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, immune reconstitution and overall alloreactivity after BCT versus BMT differ significantly. Indeed, despite an increased number of donor T cells infused, the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) after BCT appears to remain identical or lesser than after BMT. On the other hand, a higher risk of chronic GvHD has been reported after BCT. In a SFGM phase III trial, 101 patients with early leukemia and an HLA-matched sibling donor randomly received a BCT or BMT. BCT was associated with a higher number of infused CD34+ cells, accelerated platelet and neutrophil reconstitution, fewer platelet transfusions and similar acute GvHD incidence. However, chronic GvHD occurred more frequently after BCT. With a median follow-up of 20 months, relapse, survival and leukemia-free survival were not different. In the course of this study, immune parameters related to the graft as well as to early reconstitution were prospectively examined. T cells subsets, B cells, NK cells and monocytes numbers were significantly higher in BC grafts (versus BM). T cells in BC grafts were less activated than in BM grafts. Frequency of IFN-gamma, IL-2- and TNF-alpha-secreting cells and single-cell IFN-gamma production potential was reduced in BC graft. One month after BCT, blood T-cell counts were 3-fold higher than after BMT. Moreover, post-BCT T cells were less activated and counts correlated with the number of T cells infused with the graft, which was not the case after BMT. Several acute hemolysis episodes, resulting from anti-A and/or -B donor-derived Ab directed at Ag present on recipient red blood cells (minor ABO mismatch), have been described after BCT. Recipients indeed exhibited significantly increased anti-A and/or -B Ab titers after BCT, particularly in the setting of a ""minor"" ABO mismatch. Furthermore, the frequency of anti-HLA Ab early after BCT was significantly increased (despite the reduction in platelet transfusion requirements). The higher number of activated B cells and/or CD4 T cells and monocytes in a BCT graft and/or the higher number of circulating CD4 T- and B-cells after BCT could be associated with the enhanced alloAb production. G-CSF-induced TH2 cytokine profile of the T cells present in the graft could also be contributive. Recent studies have determined that BC grafts contained a higher number of type 2 dendritic cells (DC2), themselves associated with high frequencies of TH2 CD4+ cells. Since chronic GvHD is associated with the occurrence of Ab-mediated auto-immune-like syndromes, it is tempting to speculate that a higher incidence of chronic GvHD may result from these findings. In conclusion, BCT results in clinically relevant distinct hematopoietic and immune reconstitution patterns.","['Robinet, Eric', 'Lapierre, Valerie', 'Tayebi, Hakim', 'Kuentz, Mattieu', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Tiberghien, Pierre']","['Robinet E', 'Lapierre V', 'Tayebi H', 'Kuentz M', 'Blaise D', 'Tiberghien P']","['INSERM E0119--UPRES EA2284, EFS Bourgogne-Franche-Comte, 1 Bd Alexandre Fleming, BP 1937, 25020 Besancon Cedex, France. eric.robinet@efs.sante.fr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Transfus Apher Sci,Transfusion and apheresis science : official journal of the World Apheresis Association : official journal of the European Society for Haemapheresis,101095653,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,"['Antigens, CD34/blood', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Random Allocation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Th2 Cells/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*methods']",2003/07/25 05:00,2003/12/06 05:00,['2003/07/25 05:00'],"['2003/07/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transfus Apher Sci. 2003 Aug;29(1):53-9. doi: 10.1016/S1473-0502(03)00104-6.,,"['S1473-0502(03)00104-6 [pii]', '10.1016/S1473-0502(03)00104-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND RESULTS: The new World Health Organization (WHO) classification was used to classify NHL. The patients included 109 males and 34 females, with an average age of 54.1 years. Tumour sites were as follows: ileocaecal (n = 51, 35.7%), ileum (n = 29, 20.3%), rectum (n = 13, 9.1%), and duodenum (n = 11, 7.7%). Macroscopically, 124 cases (86.7%) were classified as tumorous type, 12 (8.4%) as diffuse infiltration type (erosion, superficial ulceration), five (3.5%) as polyposis type, and only two cases (1.4%) as ulceration type. Immunohistochemically, 122 lesions (85.3%) were of B-cell phenotype and 21 lesions (14.7%) were of T-cell phenotype. According to the WHO classification, of the B-cell lymphomas, 84 cases (68.9%) were large cell, 16 (13.1%) were Burkitt, 10 (8.2%) were marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), and seven (5.7%) were mantle cell tumours. Among the T-cell lymphomas, 15 (71.4%) were of unspecified type, two (9.5%) were natural killer type, two were anaplastic large-cell lymphomas, one was lymphoblastic, and one was an adult T-cell leukaemia lymphoma. The survival rate for T-cell lymphomas was poorer than for B-cell lymphomas. Among the B-cell lymphomas, mantle cell lymphoma tended to have a poorer prognosis, whereas MALT lymphomas had a better prognosis than other B-cell tumour types.

KG1a cells are sensitized to FAS-induced apoptosis by chelerythrin, an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC). As cytoplasmatic adaptor molecules of FAS, e.g. FLIP [Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD)-like interleukin 1 beta-converting enzyme [FLICE (caspase-8)-inhibitory protein]], also modulate TRAIL signals, we determined whether chelerythrin affected TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Chelerythrin by itself induced apoptosis in KG1a cells, and apoptosis was associated with activation of caspase-8. While TRAIL alone failed to activate caspase-8 or induce apoptosis, the addition of TRAIL to chelerythrin-treated cells significantly enhanced cleavage of caspase-8 and apoptosis. Chelerythrin-pretreated KG1a cells showed decreased phosphorylation of protein kinase C (PKC)-zeta and downregulation of both FLIP long and FLIP short proteins. Downregulation of FLIP and induction of apoptosis were partially abrogated by pretreatment with the specific caspase-8 inhibitor, Z-IETD-FMK. The decrease in FLIP protein expression induced by chelerythrin was accompanied by a progressive increase in mRNA levels of both FLIP long and FLIP short. CD34+ precursors from normal human marrow were also sensitive to chelerythrin but, in contrast to KG1a cells, were not sensitized to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Thus, resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in leukaemic KG1a cells but not in normal CD34+ precursors was overcome in the presence of chelerythrin. The mechanism appeared to involve inhibition of PKC. Central targets were FLIP long and FLIP short, and their interactions with caspase-8. Whether such a pathway can be exploited to selectively target leukaemic progenitor cells remains to be determined.","['Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Ward, Jessica L', 'Deeg, H Joachim']","['Platzbecker U', 'Ward JL', 'Deeg HJ']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA. platzbecker@mk1.med.tu-dresden.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Benzophenanthridines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Phenanthridines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '147604-96-4 (FliP protein, Bacillus)', 'E3B045W6X0 (chelerythrine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Alkaloids', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Bacterial Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Benzophenanthridines', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phenanthridines/*pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",2003/07/25 05:00,2003/09/18 05:00,['2003/07/25 05:00'],"['2003/07/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Aug;122(3):489-97. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04445.x.,,"['4445 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04445.x [doi]']",,,"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA87948/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study investigated whether an epoetin beta dose of 30,000 IU given subcutaneously once weekly (q.w.) was at least as effective as 10,000 t.i.w. administration in anaemic patients with lymphoproliferative malignancy and defective endogenous erythropoietin (Epo) production. Overall, 241 anaemic patients with multiple myeloma, low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, all with serum Epo values </= 100 mU/ml, were randomized to receive the q.w. (n = 119) or t.i.w. (n = 122) regimen for 16 weeks. The primary efficacy criterion, i.e. the time-adjusted area under the haemoglobin-time curve from weeks 5-16, was comparable between the q.w. and t.i.w. groups [difference = - 0.20 g/dl (90% confidence interval - 0.52-0.11)]. Moreover, response rates were high and similar in both arms (72%vs 75%, q.w. and t.i.w. groups respectively). Baseline serum Epo was predictive of response: the lower serum Epo, the higher the likelihood of response (P = 0.002). Thus, epoetin beta administered q.w. is an effective and convenient treatment for anaemia in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders. Tailoring this treatment modality to subjects with defective endogenous Epo production represents a rational use of epoetin from both a medical and a community perspective.","['Cazzola, Mario', 'Beguin, Yves', 'Kloczko, Janusz', 'Spicka, Ivan', 'Coiffier, Bertrand']","['Cazzola M', 'Beguin Y', 'Kloczko J', 'Spicka I', 'Coiffier B']","['Division of Haematology, University of Pavia Medical School, Pavia, Italy. mario.cazzola@unipv.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (epoetin beta)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Area Under Curve', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', '*Erythropoietin/*administration & dosage/analysis/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/complications/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/complications/drug therapy', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*blood/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/complications/drug therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Time']",2003/07/25 05:00,2003/09/18 05:00,['2003/07/25 05:00'],"['2003/07/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Aug;122(3):386-93. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04439.x.,,"['4439 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04439.x [doi]']",,,,,,"['Br J Haematol. 2004 Apr;125(1):98-9; author reply 99-100.

The resistance to each of 10 drugs was measured by the fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay (FMCA) and was related to clinical outcome. The median follow-up time was 41 months. Risk-group stratified analyses indicated that in vitro resistance to dexamethasone, doxorubicin and amsacrine were each significantly related to the probability of disease-free survival. In the high-risk (HR) group, increased in vitro resistance to dexamethasone (P = 0.014), etoposide (P = 0.025) and doxorubicin (P = 0.05) was associated with a worse clinical outcome. Combining the results for these drugs provided a drug resistance score with an independent prognostic significance superior to that of any other factor studied, with a relative risk of relapse in the most resistant group 9.8 times that in the most sensitive group (P = 0.007). The results in the intermediate-risk (IR) and standard-risk (SR) groups were less clear cut.

The clinical presentation is associated with a haemorrhagic diathesis and the blasts almost always have Auer rods. Poor prognostic factors include older age, elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and CD56 expression. The introduction of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which leads to the differentiation of leukaemic blasts into mature granulocytes has been the major breakthrough in the treatment of APL. Induction treatment with concurrent ATRA and chemotherapy leads to a rapid resolution of the characteristic life-threatening coagulopathy, high complete remission rates and excellent survival rates, compared to chemotherapy alone. However, treatment with ATRA is associated with the retinoic acid syndrome (RAS), which is a major toxicity and may lead to mortality. The role of cytarabine as a part of initial induction regimen remains unclear. After achievement of complete remission (CR), there is a definitive role of maintenance therapy with ATRA with or without low-dose chemotherapy. In relapsed patients, arsenic trioxide is considered the treatment of choice. However, the best postremission treatment for patients with second CR remains unknown. With the continued improvement in the field of stem cell transplantation, it may play an important role in the few patients with relapsed/refractory disease or those in second CR.","['Parmar, Simrit', 'Tallman, Martin S']","['Parmar S', 'Tallman MS']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, 676 North St. Clair, Suite 850, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",2003/07/25 05:00,2003/10/16 05:00,['2003/07/25 05:00'],"['2003/07/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2003 Aug;4(8):1379-92. doi: 10.1517/14656566.4.8.1379.,,['10.1517/14656566.4.8.1379 [doi]'],,,,146,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This triphenolic stilbene has also displayed in vitro growth inhibition in a number of human cancer cell lines. In this context, a series of cis- and trans-stilbene-based resveratrols were prepared with the aim of discovering new lead compounds with clinical potential. All the synthesized compounds were tested in vitro for cell growth inhibition and the ability to induce apoptosis in HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. The tested trans-stilbene derivatives were less potent than their corresponding cis isomers, except for trans-resveratrol, whose cis isomer was less active. The best results were obtained with compounds 11b and 7b, the cis-3,5-dimethoxy derivatives of rhapontigenin 10a (3,5,3'-trihydroxy-4'methoxy-trans-stilbene) and its 3'-amino derivative 10b, respectively, which showed apoptotic activity at nanomolar concentrations. The corresponding trans isomers 12b and 8b were less active both as antiproliferative and as apoptosis-inducing agents. Of interest, 11b and 7b were active toward resistant HL60R cells and their activity was higher than that of several classic chemotherapeutic agents. The flow cytometry assay showed that at 50 nM compounds 7b or 11b were able to recruit almost all cells in the apoptotic sub-G(0)-G(1) peek, thus suggesting that the main mechanism of cytotoxicity of these compounds could be the activation of apoptosis. These data indicate unambiguously that structural alteration of the stilbene motif of resveratrol can be extremely effective in producing potent apoptosis-inducing agents.","['Roberti, Marinella', 'Pizzirani, Daniela', 'Simoni, Daniele', 'Rondanin, Riccardo', 'Baruchello, Riccardo', 'Bonora, Caterina', 'Buscemi, Filippo', 'Grimaudo, Stefania', 'Tolomeo, Manlio']","['Roberti M', 'Pizzirani D', 'Simoni D', 'Rondanin R', 'Baruchello R', 'Bonora C', 'Buscemi F', 'Grimaudo S', 'Tolomeo M']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Farmaceutiche, Universita di Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"[""0 (3,4',5-trimethoxy-3'-aminostilbene)"", ""0 (3,4',5-trimethoxy-3'-hydroxystilbene)"", '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Stilbenes)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Isomerism', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/07/25 05:00,2003/08/27 05:00,['2003/07/25 05:00'],"['2003/07/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 2003 Jul 31;46(16):3546-54. doi: 10.1021/jm030785u.,,['10.1021/jm030785u [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major characteristics of DC2 malignancies are summarized and compared to natural killer cell (NK) lymphomas, another type of proliferative disease sharing the expression of CD56.","['Bene, Marie C', 'Feuillard, Jean', 'Jacob, Marie C']","['Bene MC', 'Feuillard J', 'Jacob MC']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie du CHU, Nancy, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)']",IM,"['CD4 Antigens', 'CD56 Antigen', 'Cell Lineage', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/pathology', 'Leukemia/immunology/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology']",2003/07/24 05:00,2004/05/01 05:00,['2003/07/24 05:00'],"['2003/07/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/01 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/24 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2003 Jul;40(3):257-66. doi: 10.1016/s0037-1963(03)00139-2.,,"['S0037196303001392 [pii]', '10.1016/s0037-1963(03)00139-2 [doi]']",,,,76,"[""Groupe d'Etude Immunologique des Leucemies""]",,,,,,,,,,,,

They show a broad clinicopathological spectrum. Besides precursor T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, various post-thymic gammadelta T-cell neoplasms have been recognized. Among these, hepatosplenic gammadelta T-cell lymphoma constitutes the prototype of T-cell lymphomas expressing the gammadelta TCR and was listed as a provisional entity in the Revised European-American Lymphoma (REAL) classification. The recognition of this lymphoma subtype was further supported by the demonstration that the neoplasm results from a proliferation of nonactivated cytotoxic T cells and is associated with a recurrent cytogenetic abnormality, the isochromosome 7q. More recently, a few cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma with similar clinicopathologic features and alphabeta phenotype have been described that are thought to belong to the same entity, and the term ""hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma"" is preferred in the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Most nonhepatosplenic gammadelta T-cell lymphomas occur in skin or in mucosal sites, a location that parallels that of normal gammadelta T cells. In contrast to hepatosplenic gammadelta T-cell lymphomas, they show an important clinical and morphological heterogeneity, have an activated cytotoxic phenotype, and are not believed to constitute a single disease entity.","['Gaulard, Philippe', 'Belhadj, Karim', 'Reyes, Felix']","['Gaulard P', 'Belhadj K', 'Reyes F']","['Departement de Pathologie, CHU Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*immunology', '*Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta']",2003/07/24 05:00,2004/05/01 05:00,['2003/07/24 05:00'],"['2003/07/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/01 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/24 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2003 Jul;40(3):233-43. doi: 10.1016/s0037-1963(03)00137-9.,,"['S0037196303001379 [pii]', '10.1016/s0037-1963(03)00137-9 [doi]']",,,,75,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More research is required to ascertain the role of high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue and that of non-multidrug resistance-related chemotherapeutic agents. Aggressive NK cell leukemia affects younger patients, who present with poor general condition, fever, and disseminated disease; they often die within a short time from systemic disease or complications such as multi-organ failure. The peripheral blood and bone marrow show atypical large granular lymphocytes, which exhibit an immunophenotype similar to that of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma.

In general, the clinical findings and treatment outcome are similar to the idiopathic or primary forms of AA and PRCA.

In refractory cases, studies using newer immunosuppressive agents active against T cells and natural killer (NK) cells are necessary.

More recently other diseases such as isolated peripheral polyneuropathy, myopathy, artropathy, and uveitis have been associated with this retrovirus. Only a few uncontrolled studies, without necessary exclusion criteria, have described mild cognitive deficits among TSP/HAM patients. To further clarify this the authors evaluated, through neuropsychological testing patients with TSP/HAM and asymptomatic infected carriers, comparing both groups with healthy controls. OBJECTIVES: To verify the presence of cognitive deficits among TSP/HAM patients and asymptomatic HTLV-1 infected carriers. In addition, the authors aimed to investigate if these deficits correlated with the degree of motor impairment in TSP/HAM patients. METHODS: From a cohort of 501 HTLV-1 infected people the authors selected, according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 40 asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers and 37 TSP/HAM patients. Neuropsychological testing was blindly performed in both groups and their scores were compared with those obtained from controls. RESULTS: Both the HTLV-1 carrier group and the group of patients with TSP/HAM exhibited a lower performance in neuropsychological tests when compared with controls. Asymptomatic infected carriers and TSP/HAM patients did not differ in their cognitive results. Also, there was no relation between the degree of motor disability and cognitive deficits in the TSP/HAM group. Psychomotor slowing and deficits in the some domains characterised the neuropsychological impairment in HTLV-1 infection: verbal and visual memory, attention and visuomotor abilities. CONCLUSIONS: TSP/HAM as well as asymptomatic infection can be associated with mild cognitive deficits. This finding, if confirmed by further studies, will permit the inclusion of cognitive impairment among the neurological manifestations of HTLV-1.","['Silva, M T T', 'Mattos, P', 'Alfano, A', 'Araujo, A Q-C']","['Silva MT', 'Mattos P', 'Alfano A', 'Araujo AQ']","['The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and Evandro Chagas Clinical Research Institute/FIOCRUZ, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",2985191R,,IM,"['Adult', 'Brazil', 'Carrier State/*diagnosis/psychology', 'Cognition Disorders/*diagnosis/psychology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*diagnosis/psychology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelitis/*diagnosis/psychology', 'Neurologic Examination/statistics & numerical data', 'Neuropsychological Tests/*statistics & numerical data', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*diagnosis/psychology', 'Psychometrics/statistics & numerical data', 'Psychomotor Disorders/diagnosis/psychology', 'Reaction Time', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2003/07/24 05:00,2003/09/10 05:00,['2003/07/24 05:00'],"['2003/07/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/24 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry. 2003 Aug;74(8):1085-9. doi: 10.1136/jnnp.74.8.1085.,,['10.1136/jnnp.74.8.1085 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,PMC1738599,,,,,,,

Monoclonal CD4(+) T-LGLshowed expression of TCRalphabeta, variable levels of CD8 (CD8(-/+dim)) and a homogeneous typical cytotoxic (granzyme B(+), CD56(+), CD57(+), CD11b(+/-)) and activated/memory T cell (CD2(+bright), CD7(-/+dim), CD11a(+bright), CD28(-), CD62L(-) HLA-DR(+)) immunophenotype. In addition, they exhibited a Th1 pattern of cytokine production [interferon-gamma(++), tumor necrosis factor-alpha(++), interleukin (IL-2)(-/+), IL-4(-), IL-10(-), IL-13(-)]. Phenotypic analysis of the TCR-Vbeta repertoire revealed large monoclonal TCR-Vbeta expansions; only a restricted number of TCR-Vbeta families were represented in the 34 cases analyzed. These findings suggest that monoclonal TCRalphabeta(+)/CD4(+)/NKa(+)/CD8(-/+dim) T-LGL represent a subgroup of monoclonal LGL lymphoproliferative disorders different from both CD8(+) T-LGL and natural killer cell-type LGL leukemias. Longer follow-up periods are necessary to determine the exact significance of this clonal disorder.","['Lima, Margarida', 'Almeida, Julia', 'Dos Anjos Teixeira, Maria', 'Alguero Md, Maria del Carmen', 'Santos, Ana Helena', 'Balanzategui, Ana', 'Queiros, Maria Luis', 'Barcena, Paloma', 'Izarra, Antonio', 'Fonseca, Sonia', 'Bueno, Clara', 'Justica, Benvindo', 'Gonzalez, Marcos', 'San Miguel, Jesus F', 'Orfao, Alberto']","['Lima M', 'Almeida J', 'Dos Anjos Teixeira M', 'Alguero Md Mdel C', 'Santos AH', 'Balanzategui A', 'Queiros ML', 'Barcena P', 'Izarra A', 'Fonseca S', 'Bueno C', 'Justica B', 'Gonzalez M', 'San Miguel JF', 'Orfao A']","['Servico de Hematologia Clinica, Unidade de Citometria, Hospital Geral de Santo Antonio, Porto, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cytokines/immunology/metabolism', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Lymphocytosis/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*immunology/metabolism']",2003/07/24 05:00,2003/09/11 05:00,['2003/07/24 05:00'],"['2003/07/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/24 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2003 Aug;163(2):763-71. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9440(10)63703-0.,,"['S0002-9440(10)63703-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9440(10)63703-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,PMC1868208,,,,,,,

Developmentally programmed DSBs are restricted to cellular subsets within lymphoid tissues and we asked whether ATM expression is differentially regulated during lymphoid differentiation. We showed that immature B cells in bone marrow and immature T cells of the thymic cortex were negative or weakly ATM-positive. T cells of thymic medulla and peripheral tissues strongly expressed ATM. High levels of ATM were present in the B lymphocytes of the mantle zone and in plasma cells, while the majority of germinal center B cells were negative or weakly labeled. Therefore, ATM expression appears to be down-regulated at those stages of lymphoid development where physiological DNA DSBs occur. In B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma we observed two categories: ATM-negative tumors, most likely reflecting the presence of ATM mutation, and tumors with abundant ATM expression. Most follicular center-cell lymphomas and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, which rarely show inactivation of the ATM gene, were negative or weakly ATM-positive. Tumor cells from most cases of Hodgkin's disease were ATM-negative. Therefore, unless ATM inactivation occurs, ATM expression in lymphoid tumors is likely to reflect their cellular origin. As a result, immunostaining to identify lymphoid neoplasias with ATM inactivation might only be feasible for tumors derived from the stages where ATM is constitutively highly expressed.","['Starczynski, Jane', 'Simmons, William', 'Flavell, Joanne R', 'Byrd, Phillip J', 'Stewart, Grant S', 'Kullar, Harjit S', 'Groom, Alix', 'Crocker, John', 'Moss, Paul A H', 'Reynolds, Gary M', 'Glavina-Durdov, Meri', 'Taylor, A Malcolm R', 'Fegan, Christopher', 'Stankovic, Tatjana', 'Murray, Paul G']","['Starczynski J', 'Simmons W', 'Flavell JR', 'Byrd PJ', 'Stewart GS', 'Kullar HS', 'Groom A', 'Crocker J', 'Moss PA', 'Reynolds GM', 'Glavina-Durdov M', 'Taylor AM', 'Fegan C', 'Stankovic T', 'Murray PG']","[""Department of Histopathology, Birmingham Heartland's Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Hodgkin Disease/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/cytology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2003/07/24 05:00,2003/09/11 05:00,['2003/07/24 05:00'],"['2003/07/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/24 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2003 Aug;163(2):423-32. doi: 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63672-3.,,"['S0002-9440(10)63672-3 [pii]', '10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63672-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,PMC1868216,,,,,,,

In this study, we compared the expression profiles of cancer-related genes by cDNA microarray analysis during the differentiation of human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells into either monocytes or granulocytes. RNA was isolated at times 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h following stimulation of differentiation with all-trans retinoic acid (all-trans RA) or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)], and hybridized to the microarray gene chips containing 872 genes related to cell-cycles, oncogenes and leukemias. Several genes were commonly or differentially regulated during cell differentiation into either lineage, as demonstrated by both hierarchical and self-organizing map clustering analysis. At 72 h the expression levels of 45 genes were commonly up- or down-regulated at least a twofold in both lineages. Most importantly, 32 genes including alpha-L-fucosidase gene and adducin gamma subunit gene were up- or down-regulated only in all-trans RA-treated HL-60 cells, while 12 genes including interleukin 1beta and hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha were up- or down-regulated only in 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-treated HL-60 cells. The expression of selected genes was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. As expected, some genes identified have not been examined during HL-60 cell differentiation into either lineage. The identification of genes associated with a specific differentiation lineage may give important insights into functional and phenotypic differences between two lineages of HL-60 cell differentiation.","['Song, Ju Han', 'Kim, Jong Man', 'Kim, Seung Hyun', 'Kim, Hyeoung Joon', 'Lee, Jae Jung', 'Sung, Myung Hui', 'Hwang, Seung Yong', 'Kim, Tae Sung']","['Song JH', 'Kim JM', 'Kim SH', 'Kim HJ', 'Lee JJ', 'Sung MH', 'Hwang SY', 'Kim TS']","['College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Drug Development, Chonnam National University, Kwangju, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Granulocytes/pathology/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Monocytes/pathology/*physiology', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/07/24 05:00,2003/08/16 05:00,['2003/07/24 05:00'],"['2003/07/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/24 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2003 Aug 15;73(13):1705-19. doi: 10.1016/s0024-3205(03)00515-0.,,"['S0024320503005150 [pii]', '10.1016/s0024-3205(03)00515-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generally speaking, in many circumstances dispersal is expected to increase disease persistence. We consider the case when host populations show density-dependent dynamics and are connected through the dispersal of individuals. Taking the domestic cats (Felis catus)--Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) as a toy model of host-microparasite system, we predict the disease dynamics when two host populations with distinct or similar structures are connected together and to the surrounding environment by dispersal. Our model brings qualitatively different predictions from one-population models. First, as expected, biologically realistic rates of dispersal may allow FeLV to persist in sets of populations where the virus would have gone extinct otherwise, but a reverse outcome is also possible: eradication of FeLV from a small population by connexion to a larger population where it is not persistent. Second, overall prevalence as well as depression of host population size due to infection are both enhanced by dispersal, even at low dispersal rates when disease persistence is not achieved in the two populations. This unexpected prediction is probably due to the combination of dispersal with density-dependent population dynamics. Third, the dispersal of non-infectious cats has more influence on virus prevalence than the dispersal of infectious. Finally, prevalence and depression of host population size are both related to the rate of dispersion, to the health status of individuals dispersing and to the dynamics of host populations.","['Fromont, Emmanuelle', 'Pontier, Dominique', 'Langlais, Michel']","['Fromont E', 'Pontier D', 'Langlais M']","['U.M.R.

METHODS: Twenty patients with leukemia in relapse after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) were treated with chemotherapy followed by donor-derived lymphocytes (DDL) without G-CSF mobilization (Group A, n = 11), or donor peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) with G-CSF mobilization (Group B, n = 9). RESULTS: Five patients in Group A were in hematologic relapse. After DDL infusion, 3 of 5 patients had a temporary complete remission (CR) and relapsed after 3, 7 and 10 months, respectively. One achieved partial remission and died of interstitial pneumonia; and the other one showed no response. Another 6 patients in Group A were in cytogenetic relapse or central nerve system (CNS) leukemia, and all achieved CR and remained in disease free survival (DFS) for 10 to 98 months after DDL infusion. All 9 patients in group B were in hematologic relapse. Three patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) had cytogenetic and molecular remission for 16, 35 and 51 months, respectively after PBPC infusion; and 5 patients with acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) had CR and were still in CR for 10 to 18 months except 1 patient relapsed soon. And the other one with AML showed no response to the therapy. CONCLUSION: Donor immunocompetent cells infusion is an effective therapy for relapsed leukemia after allo-BMT, especially for the patients with early (molecular and cytogenetic) or CNS relapse. Infusion of donor PBPC mobilized by G-CSF seems to have more potentiated graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect than DDL infusion.","['Huang, Xiaojun', 'Guo, Nailan', 'Ren, Hanyun', 'Zhang, Yaochen', 'Gao, Zhiyong', 'Lu, Daopei']","['Huang X', 'Guo N', 'Ren H', 'Zhang Y', 'Gao Z', 'Lu D']","[""Institute of Hematology, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China. xjhrm@cenpok.net""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence']",2003/07/24 05:00,2003/09/26 05:00,['2003/07/24 05:00'],"['2003/07/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/24 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2003 May;116(5):736-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Longitudinal study. ANIMALS: 593 milking cows. PROCEDURE: Cattle were tested for antibodies against BLV by use of agar gel immunodiffusion or ELISA 4 times each year from 1989 to 1993 and then annually through 1999. Dates of birth, first calving, and culling or death were obtained from Dairy Herd Improvement Association records. Most cows were enrolled in the study on the date of first calving. Survival times were compared among seropositive, seronegative, and seroconverted cows with the Kaplan-Meier method and a Cox regression model stratified on the basis of year of birth. RESULTS: Complete records were available for 593 of 685 (87%) cattle in the dairy herd during the study period. Median survival time for all cows was 31.7 months. Survival times, which correspond to cull rates, did not differ significantly between seropositive and seronegative cattle, whereas cattle that seroconverted during the study had a significantly longer survival time. Year of birth was positively and significantly associated with survival time. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: BLV serologic status was not associated with cull rate as measured by survival time in this dairy herd. This finding is in contrast to results of studies that used survival analysis techniques; our results may influence management decisions concerning BLV.","['Rhodes, J Kelly', 'Pelzer, Kevin D', 'Johnson, Yvette J', 'Russek-Cohen, Estelle']","['Rhodes JK', 'Pelzer KD', 'Johnson YJ', 'Russek-Cohen E']","['Avrum Gudelsky Veterinary Center, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Am Vet Med Assoc,Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,7503067,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Maryland/epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",2003/07/24 05:00,2003/10/28 05:00,['2003/07/24 05:00'],"['2003/07/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/24 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Am Vet Med Assoc. 2003 Jul 15;223(2):229-31. doi: 10.2460/javma.2003.223.229.,,['10.2460/javma.2003.223.229 [doi]'],,,,,,['J Am Vet Med Assoc. 2003 Oct 1;223(7):946; author reply 946.

However, the effect of glycosylation on their biological functions is still undefined. In the present study, the apoptosis-inducing activities of three structure-related flavonoids including aglycone quercetin (QUE), and glycone rutin (RUT; QUE-3-O-rutinoside), and glycone quercitrin (QUI; QUE-3-O-rhamnoside) were studied. Both RUT and QUI are QUE glycosides, and possess rutinose and rhamnose at the C3 position of QUE, respectively. Results of the MTT assay showed that QUE, but not RUT and QUI, exhibits significant cytotoxic effect on HL-60 cells, accompanied by the dose- and time-dependent appearance of characteristics of apoptosis including an increase in DNA ladder intensity, morphological changes, apoptotic bodies, and an increase in hypodiploid cells by flow cytometry analysis. QUE, but not RUT or QUI, caused rapid and transient induction of caspase 3/CPP32 activity, but not caspase 1 activity, according to cleavage of caspase 3 substrates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and D4-GDI proteins, and the appearance of cleaved caspase 3 fragments being detected in QUE- but not RUT- or QUI-treated HL-60 cells. A decrease in the anti-apoptotic protein, Mcl-1, was detected in QUE-treated HL-60 cells, whereas other Bcl-2 family proteins including Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bag remained unchanged. The caspase 3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-FMK, but not the caspase 1 inhibitor, Ac-YVAD-FMK, attenuated QUE-induced cell death. Results of DCHF-DA assay indicate that no significant increase in intracellular peroxide level was found in QUE-treated cells, and QUE inhibited the H(2)O(2)-induced intracellular peroxide level. Free radical scavengers N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and catalase showed no prevention of QUE-induced apoptosis. In addition, QUE did not induce apoptosis in an mature monocytic cell line THP-1, as characterized by a lack of DNA ladders, caspase 3 activation, PARP cleavage, and an Mcl-1 decrease, compared with those in HL-60 cells. Our experiments provide evidence to indicate that the addition of rutinose or rhamnose attenuates the apoptosis-inducing activity of QUE, and that the caspase 3 cascade but not free radical production is involved.","['Shen, Shing-Chuan', 'Chen, Yen-Chou', 'Hsu, Feng-Lin', 'Lee, Woan-Rouh']","['Shen SC', 'Chen YC', 'Hsu FL', 'Lee WR']","['Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, 250 Wu-Hsing Street, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glycosides)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peroxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 1/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromosomes/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'DNA/analysis/drug effects', 'Diploidy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Glycosides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Peroxides/analysis', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Quercetin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",2003/07/23 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/07/23 05:00'],"['2003/07/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/23 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2003 Aug 1;89(5):1044-55. doi: 10.1002/jcb.10559.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/jcb.10559 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although these proteins are known to bind DNA through a C-terminal zinc-finger domain and may require an N-terminal SNAG domain (SNAIL/Gfi-1) to repress transcription, the mechanism by which Gfi-1 and Gfi-1B act is unknown. A first step towards understanding the mechanism by which these proteins repress transcription is to identify interacting proteins that could contribute to transcriptional repression. ETO (also termed MTG8), was first identified through its involvement in the (8;21) translocation associated with acute myelogenous leukemia. It attaches to the nuclear matrix and associates with histone deacetylases and the co-repressors N-CoR, SMRT, and mSin3A, and may act as a co-repressor for site-specific transcriptions factors. In this report we demonstrate that Gfi-1 interacts with ETO and related proteins both in vitro and in vivo and with histone deacetylase proteins in vivo. We observed that a portion of Gfi-1 and Gfi-1B associated with the nuclear matrix, as is the case with ETO. Moreover, Gfi-1 and ETO co-localize to punctate subnuclear structures. When co-expressed in mammalian cells, Gfi-1 associates with histone deacetylse-1 (HDAC-1), HDAC-2, and HDAC-3. These data identify ETO as a partner for Gfi-1 and Gfi-1B, and suggest that Gfi-1 proteins repress transcription through recruitment of histone deacetylase-containing complexes.","['McGhee, Laura', 'Bryan, Josh', 'Elliott, Liza', 'Grimes, H Leighton', 'Kazanjian, Avedis', 'Davis, J Nathan', 'Meyers, Shari']","['McGhee L', 'Bryan J', 'Elliott L', 'Grimes HL', 'Kazanjian A', 'Davis JN', 'Meyers S']","['The Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center-Shreveport, 1501 Kings Highway, Shreveport, LA 71130, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (GFI1 protein, human)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Intermediate Filaments/metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Nuclear Matrix/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology', 'Transfection']",2003/07/23 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/07/23 05:00'],"['2003/07/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/23 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2003 Aug 1;89(5):1005-18. doi: 10.1002/jcb.10548.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/jcb.10548 [doi]'],,,['CA 76186/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since, after IR exposure, the apoptotic profile appeared different in the two chosen cell lines K562 and Jurkat along with caspase-3 activation, we paid attention to the influence exerted by Protein kinase C delta on transcription factor NF-kappaB activation. Interestingly, K562 resist to IR carrying out a survival strategy which includes PKC delta/NF-kappaB pathway activation, probably mediated by novel IKKs and a role for PI-3-kinase in activating PKC delta at Thr 505 by PDK-1 phosphorylation is suggested. In addition, since caspase-3 is not activated in these cells upon ionizing radiation exposure, it could be supposed that NF-kappaB antagonizes apoptosis induction interfering with pathways which lead to caspase activation, may be by inducing expression of IAP, caspases 3, 7, 9, inhibitor. Thus NF-kappaB activation explains the resistance displayed by K562 to IR and drug potential interference directed to this protein could overcome apoptosis resistance in clinical settings.","['Cataldi, Amelia', 'Rapino, Monica', 'Centurione, Lucia', 'Sabatini, Nadia', 'Grifone, Giovanna', 'Garaci, Francesco', 'Rana, Rosalba']","['Cataldi A', 'Rapino M', 'Centurione L', 'Sabatini N', 'Grifone G', 'Garaci F', 'Rana R']","[""Dipartimento di Biomorfologia, Universita G.D'Annunzio, 66100 Chieti, Italy. cataldi@unich.it""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology/*radiation effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/physiology/radiation effects', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Enzyme Activation/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism/radiation effects', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Jurkat Cells/cytology/radiation effects', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Radiation, Ionizing']",2003/07/23 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/07/23 05:00'],"['2003/07/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/23 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2003 Aug 1;89(5):956-63. doi: 10.1002/jcb.10560.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/jcb.10560 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet there is a paucity of data on the relationship between gene-environment interactions and the mechanisms associated with the somatic mutational events involved with malignant transformation, especially in children. To gain insight into somatic mutational mechanisms in children who develop cancer, we determined the background mutant frequency (Mf) in the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) reporter gene of peripheral blood lymphocytes from pediatric cancer patients at the time of diagnosis and prior to therapeutic intervention. We studied 23 children with hematologic malignancies and 31 children with solid tumors prior to initial therapeutic intervention. Children with solid tumors, specifically sarcomas, and Hodgkin's disease were significantly older and had elevated HPRT Mfs (6.1 x 10(-6) and 3.7 x 10(-6), respectively) at the time of diagnosis, compared to normal controls (2.3 x 10(-6)) and other pediatric tumor groups including children with acute lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (ALL/NHL, 1.7 x 10(-6)), central nervous system tumors (CNS, 3.6 x 10(-6)), and neuroblastoma (1.9 x 10(-6)). Of importance is that the significant differences observed in HPRT Mfs between these groups no longer existed after correcting for the effects of age. These data demonstrate that in children who develop cancer there appears to be no significant increase in background HPRT Mf that would indicate significant exposure to genotoxic chemicals or an underlying DNA repair defect resulting in genomic instability. In addition, these data demonstrate the importance of correcting for the effect of age when comparing the frequency of somatic mutations in children and should provide baseline data for future longitudinal biomonitoring studies on the genetic effects of chemotherapy in children treated for cancer.","['Rice, Sederick C', 'Vacek, Pamela M', 'Homans, Alan H', 'Kendall, Heather', 'Rivers, Jami', 'Messier, Terri', 'Finette, Barry A']","['Rice SC', 'Vacek PM', 'Homans AH', 'Kendall H', 'Rivers J', 'Messier T', 'Finette BA']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Environ Mol Mutagen,Environmental and molecular mutagenesis,8800109,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics']",2003/07/23 05:00,2003/09/10 05:00,['2003/07/23 05:00'],"['2003/07/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/23 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Environ Mol Mutagen. 2003;42(1):44-9. doi: 10.1002/em.10171.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/em.10171 [doi]'],,,"['1F32ES058701ZRG4/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', '1K01CA77737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1K11HD01010/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', '1R29HD35309-01A1/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, it is hypothesized that chemicals sharing a common mode of genotoxicity should exhibit similar changes in gene expression. We have evaluated these hypotheses by analyzing transcriptome profiles of mouse lymphoma L5178Y/TK(+/-) cells treated with bleomycin and hydrogen peroxide, two mutagens that produce genotoxicity by generating reactive free radicals. The cells were treated for 4 hr and RNA was isolated at the end of the treatment and after a 20 hr recovery. Transcriptome analyses were performed using the Clontech Mouse 1.2K cDNA microarray (1,185 genes) and hybridization with a (32)[P]-labeled probe. Of the genes examined, each mutagen altered the expression (1.5-fold or greater) of only two genes after the 4 hr treatment. In cells allowed to recover for 20 hr after treatment, bleomycin and hydrogen peroxide altered the expression of 8 and 5 genes, respectively. Many of the altered genes have some association with apoptosis. Of these genes, three (the genes encoding granzyme A, integrin beta 7, and 45 kDa calcium-binding protein precursor) were in common between chemical treatments. The expression of DNA repair and cell cycle controlling genes present on the array was not affected by the treatments. These results show that bleomycin and hydrogen peroxide both have unique and commonly regulated genes that have the potential to serve as biomarkers of exposure to agents causing DNA damage by free radical mechanisms.","['Seidel, Shawn D', 'Kan, H Lynn', 'Stott, William T', 'Schisler, Melissa R', 'Gollapudi, B Bhaskar']","['Seidel SD', 'Kan HL', 'Stott WT', 'Schisler MR', 'Gollapudi BB']","['Toxicology & Environmental Research and Consulting, The Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Michigan 48674, USA. sseidel2@dow.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Mol Mutagen,Environmental and molecular mutagenesis,8800109,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Bleomycin/*toxicity', '*DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*toxicity', 'Leukemia L5178/genetics', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pharmacogenetics/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/07/23 05:00,2003/09/10 05:00,['2003/07/23 05:00'],"['2003/07/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/23 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Environ Mol Mutagen. 2003;42(1):19-25. doi: 10.1002/em.10169.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/em.10169 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of note, the MLL/SEPTIN6 rearrangements in these cases were cryptic or complex, and it was shown that the 5'-MLL/SEPTIN6-3' transcript resides on the derivative X chromosome rather than on the derivative chromosome 11 as in the majority of cases of MLL translocations. These observations suggested that MLL and SEPTIN6 reside on their respective chromosome loci in reverse orientation, that is, centromere-to-telomere and telomere-to-centromere, respectively.

All the methods depend on constructing a test statistic Z and a so-called null statistic z. The null statistic z is used to provide some reference distribution for Z such that statistical inference can be accomplished. A common way of constructing z is to apply Z to randomly permuted data. Here we point our that the distribution of z may not approximate the null distribution of Z well, leading to possibly too conservative inference. This observation may apply to other permutation-based nonparametric methods. We propose a new method of constructing a null statistic that aims to estimate the null distribution of a test statistic directly. RESULTS: Using simulated data and real data, we assess and compare the performance of the existing method and our new method when applied in EB, SAM and MMM. Some interesting findings on operating characteristics of EB, SAM and MMM are also reported. Finally, by combining the idea of SAM and MMM, we outline a simple nonparametric method based on the direct use of a test statistic and a null statistic.","['Pan, Wei']",['Pan W'],"['Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota, A460 Mayo Building (MMC 303), Minneapolis, MN 55455-0378, USA. weip@biostat.umm.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Validation Study']",England,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Computer Simulation', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', '*Models, Genetic', '*Models, Statistical', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",2003/07/23 05:00,2004/04/21 05:00,['2003/07/23 05:00'],"['2003/07/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/23 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bioinformatics. 2003 Jul 22;19(11):1333-40. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btg167.,,['10.1093/bioinformatics/btg167 [doi]'],,,['R01-HL65462/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eleven of these 147 genes were up-regulated in all PV patients studied and may represent a molecular signature for this disorder. An increase in the expression of several protease inhibitors with affinity for proteases that promote apoptosis in neutrophils (e.g., cystatin F, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor), as well as the up-regulation of a number of antiapoptotic and survival factors was found (e.g., adrenomedullin, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase).

We set up a fast FISH procedure using an extensive set of specific probes. Conventional banding analysis (CBA) and FISH were compared in 260 newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. For FISH the following probes were used: MLL, CBF-beta/MYH11, ETV-6/AML1; AML1/ETO, BCR/ABL, PML/RAR, c-MYC, TP53, RB1, 5q31/5p15.2, 5q33-34, 7q31/CEP7, 20q13; CEP 4, X, Y. Result time was 96 h for CBA versus 5 h for FISH from direct harvest. CBA showed clonal abnormalities in 41% (n=105/260), normal karyotype in 39% (n=102/260) and failed in 20% (n=53/260). FISH screened all patients and detected abnormalities in 39% (n=102/260); CBA and FISH together identified abnormalities in 49% (n=128/260). In six patients with normal CBA and in eight patients with clonal karyotype, it detected further cryptic abnormalities. CBA showed clonal abnormalities in 13% of patients negative at FISH (n=21/158). FISH screening does not add relevant information to CBA, but is the quickest method for detecting major genetic abnormalities in AML. The speed of FISH is very valuable in AML-M3/M3v because PML/RAR+ patients require specific therapy. Furthermore, we suggest FISH screening in failed, complex or suboptimal quality chromosome and specific FISH analysis for 5q, 7q, 12p, 17p, inv(16), t(11q23) in order to implement CBA accuracy.","['Cox, Maria Christina', 'Panetta, Paola', 'Venditti, Adriano', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Franchi, Annibale', 'Buccisano, Francesco', 'Tamburini, Anna', 'Maurillo, Luca', 'Amadori, Sergio']","['Cox MC', 'Panetta P', 'Venditti A', 'Del Poeta G', 'Franchi A', 'Buccisano F', 'Tamburini A', 'Maurillo L', 'Amadori S']","['Department of Hematology, University Tor Vergata, St. Eugenio Hospital, Rome, Italy. mccox@libero.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,['0 (DNA Probes)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding/*standards', 'DNA Probes', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*standards', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Time Factors']",2003/07/23 05:00,2004/05/01 05:00,['2003/07/23 05:00'],"['2003/07/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/01 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/23 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol J. 2003;4(4):263-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200262.,,"['10.1038/sj.thj.6200262 [doi]', '6200262 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe a cross-sectional comparison of QoL in patients randomised to long-term treatment with IFN versus no IFN within the UK MRC CML 3 trial, assessing the long-term consequences and psychosocial side effects of IFN therapy. Patients completed the EORTC QoL QLQ-C30, an in-house leukaemia/IFN questionnaire, a brief assessment of sexual functioning and demographic details. In total, 163 eligible patients completed questionnaires (85% response). Patients receiving IFN reported significantly worse QoL for emotional, cognitive and social functioning, pain and dyspnoea (P<0.01), and marginally worse fatigue, nausea and vomiting (P<0.05). As expected from other IFN use, those on IFN experienced more flu-like and febrile symptoms and skin problems than those not on IFN. In all, 35% of patients stopped IFN before questionnaire completion. This made no material difference to the results, except that those continuing on IFN had slightly better self-assessed Global health/QoL than those who had stopped (P<0.03). IFN treatment adversely affected sexual health after allowing for age and gender. In conclusion, IFN treatment has a significant adverse impact on QoL. Patient awareness of the survival benefits and these QoL effects should enable better-informed decision-making. The impact on QoL of IFN dose, and of imatinib therapy versus IFN in early CP CML, are being investigated. QoL will need evaluating in future studies of combination treatment (IFN+imatinib).","['Homewood, Janis', 'Watson, Maggie', 'Richards, Sue M', 'Halsey, Jim', 'Shepherd, Pat C A']","['Homewood J', 'Watson M', 'Richards SM', 'Halsey J', 'Shepherd PC']","['Department of Epidemiology, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],IM,"['Cognition/drug effects', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Dyspnea/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/*drug therapy/psychology', 'Pain', '*Quality of Life', 'Random Allocation', 'Self-Assessment', 'Sexual Behavior/drug effects', 'Social Behavior', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2003/07/23 05:00,2004/05/01 05:00,['2003/07/23 05:00'],"['2003/07/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/01 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/23 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol J. 2003;4(4):253-62. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200251.,,"['10.1038/sj.thj.6200251 [doi]', '6200251 [pii]']",,,,,['Adult Leukaemia Working Party'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Our current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological functions of NGF is in part based on the studies with PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells, which differentiate into sympathetic neuron-like cells upon NGF treatment. Here we report that the expression of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), one of the signaling molecules shared by several neuropoietic cytokines of the interleukin-6 family, is specifically up-regulated in PC12 cells following treatment with NGF. Attenuation of LIFR signaling through stable transfection of antisense- or dominant negative-LIFR constructs enhances NGF-induced neurite extension in PC12 cells. On the contrary, overexpression of LIFR retards the growth of neurites. More importantly, whereas NGF-induced Rac1 activity is enhanced in antisense-LIFR and dominant negative-LIFR expressing PC12 cells, it is reduced in LIFR expressing PC12 cells. Following combined treatment with NGF and ciliary neurotrophic factor, sympathetic neurons exhibit attenuated neurite growth and branching. On the other hand, in sympathetic neurons lacking LIFR, neurite growth and branching is enhanced when compared with wild type controls.

Treatment of PCP (100 microM) with horseradish peroxidase (HRP/H(2)O(2)) or myeloperoxidase (MPx/H(2)O(2), from human leukocytes) in the presence of excess deoxyguanosine (dG, 2 mM) led to the isolation and identification of the oxygen-bonded C8-dG nucleoside adduct 4. The reaction was absolutely specific for dG; no detectable adduct(s) was observed from HRP/H(2)O(2) and PCP in the presence of deoxyadenosine, deoxycytidine, or thymidine. Formation of 4 was also specific for peroxidase activation that is known to oxidize PCP into the phenoxyl radical. Treatment of PCP/dG with rat liver microsomes (RLM) failed to generate 4; instead, an adduct derived from the benzoquinone electrophile tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone (chloranil) was observed in the extracted ion chromatogram from the RLM/NADPH-treated PCP/dG sample. The adduct 4 is the first structurally characterized O-bonded phenolic DNA nucleoside adduct and highlights the ambident electrophilicity of phenoxyl radicals (O- vs C-) in reaction at C8 of dG, as we have previously demonstrated that the para-chlorophenolic toxin, ochratoxin A (2), reacts at C8 of dG to give the C-bonded adduct 3 via the intermediacy of the OTA phenoxyl radical. Given that PCP is known to induce DNA adduct formation in vivo and human exposure has been linked to incidences of leukemia, the adduct 4 could play a key role in PCP-mediated carcinogenesis.","['Dai, Jian', 'Wright, Marcus W', 'Manderville, Richard A']","['Dai J', 'Wright MW', 'Manderville RA']","['Department of Chemistry, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27109-7486, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', '0 (Deoxyguanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Ochratoxins)', '0 (Phenols)', '3229-70-7 (phenoxy radical)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'D9BSU0SE4T (Pentachlorophenol)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Horseradish Peroxidase)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/*chemistry/toxicity', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Deoxyguanine Nucleotides/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Horseradish Peroxidase/chemistry', 'Hydrogen Peroxide', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Microsomes, Liver/chemistry/metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Ochratoxins/chemistry', 'Oxygen/chemistry', 'Pentachlorophenol/*chemistry/toxicity', 'Phenols/*chemistry', 'Rats']",2003/07/23 05:00,2004/03/31 05:00,['2003/07/23 05:00'],"['2003/07/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/23 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2003 Jul;16(7):817-21. doi: 10.1021/tx034084b.,,['10.1021/tx034084b [doi]'],,,['R01-CA080787/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The biotransformation of this drug is catalyzed by various cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, but relatively little is known about the effect of ATRA on CYP enzyme expression in leukemic cells. In the present study, we conducted transcript profiling of CYP and related genes in cultured HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemic cells and determined the effect of ATRA on the expression of these genes. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis with a block-cycler indicated the presence of CYP1B1 but not CYP1A1, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, or CYP26A1 transcript in cultured HL-60 cells. ATRA treatment (0.1-40 microM for 3 days) increased CYP1B1 mRNA levels by up to 3 fold, as determined by a quantitative real-time PCR method. The same ATRA treatment also resulted in the detection of CYP26A1 but not CYP1A1, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CY2C9, CYP3A4, or CYP3A5 mRNA. Additional experiments showed that phenobarbital increased CYP2B6 mRNA expression and that pregnane X receptor (PXR) but not constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) was detected in HL-60 cells.

Alterations in this gene have been reported for various neoplasia types, including acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL), especially T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL). OBJECTIVE: To determine probable alterations in the p16 gene in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemias using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct DNA sequencing and also to analyze event-free survival (EFS). DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Department of Child Care and Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-six children with ALL (mean age 4 years). Forty (71.43%) had B-cell and 12 (21.43%) had T-cell ALL; 4 (7.1%) were biphenotypic. SAMPLE: DNA samples were extracted from bone marrow upon diagnosis and/or relapse. In 2 T-cell cases, DNA from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was analyzed. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Deletions or nucleotide substitutions in exons 1, 2 and 3 of the p16 gene were determined by PCR and nucleotide sequencing. Event-free survival was determined by the Kaplan-Meyer and log-rank test for patients carrying normal and altered p16. RESULTS: Deletions in exon 3 were observed in five cases. Abnormal migration in PCR was observed in seven cases for exon 1, six for exon 2, and five for exon 3. Mutations in exon 1 were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing in four cases and in exon 2 in two cases. The Kaplan-Meyer survival curves and the log-rank test showed no significant differences in 5-year EFS between children with normal or altered p16, or between patients with B-ALL carrying normal or altered p16 gene. Patients with T-ALL could not be evaluated via Kaplan-Meier due to the small number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results, particularly regarding deletion frequency, agree with others suggesting that deletions in the p16 are initial events in leukemia genesis. The small number of samples did not allow establishment of correlation between childhood ALL and the p16 point mutations found in our study. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed no significant correlation between EFS and alterations in ALL. The p16 alterations frequency observed for B and T-ALL agreed with reports from other centers.","['Lemos, Jos Alexandre Rodrigues', 'Defavery, Ricardo', 'Scrideli, Carlos Alberto', 'Tone, Luiz Gonzaga']","['Lemos JA', 'Defavery R', 'Scrideli CA', 'Tone LG']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Brazil,Sao Paulo Med J,Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,100897261,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', '*Genes, p16', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies']",2003/07/19 05:00,2003/08/26 05:00,['2003/07/19 05:00'],"['2003/07/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/19 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Sao Paulo Med J. 2003 Mar 5;121(2):58-62. doi: 10.1590/s1516-31802003000200005.

Patients eligible for transplantation included those in first remission, especially those at high risk of relapse (n = 41), and any patient in second or later remissions (n = 46) or in relapse (n = 95). The median patient age was 29.4 years (range, 18.0-57.6 years), and the median duration of disease was 13.3 months (range, 2.4-221.9 months). Fifty-six patients had Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL. Most patients (n = 169) received a conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg plus 12.0 to 15.75 Gy of total body irradiation and a combination of cyclosporine and methotrexate as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. One hundred twenty-one patients received stem cells from HLA-identical donors (88 related donors and 33 unrelated donors), and 61 received stem cells from HLA-mismatched donors (26 related donors and 35 unrelated donors). Actuarial disease-free survival at 5 years was 21% for all patients, 43% for patients in first remission, 24% for patients in second or later remissions, and 9% for patients in relapse. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with survival, relapse, nonrelapse mortality, and disease-free survival. Factors significantly associated (P <.01) with improved survival and disease-free survival included younger age and being in first remission. Lower disease-free survival was associated with receiving cyclosporine alone as GVHD prophylaxis (P <.01). Risk of relapse correlated only with disease status at transplantation: patients who underwent transplantation in relapse had a 9-fold increased risk compared with patients who underwent transplantation in first remission. Acute or chronic GVHD had no significant effect on relapse. Increased nonrelapse mortality was associated with HLA-mismatched donors, a positive cytomegalovirus serology before transplantation, and GVHD prophylaxis with only cyclosporine. Patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL had survival and relapse rates similar to patients with normal cytogenetics.","['Doney, Kristine', 'Hagglund, Hans', 'Leisenring, Wendy', 'Chauncey, Thomas', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Storb, Rainer']","['Doney K', 'Hagglund H', 'Leisenring W', 'Chauncey T', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Storb R']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave N, D5-280, P.O.

Complications included GVHD in 6 patients (3 patients had grade I or II GVHD of skin and liver, and 3 patients had grade III or IV GVHD of liver and gut). Two of the patients with GVHD had mismatched grafts. Transplant-related toxicity was seen in 4 patients and infection in 5 patients. The median length of follow-up was 162 days (range, 17-854 days). Complete remissions were seen in 10 patients. Four patients remained in complete response (CR) at 280 to 595 days. One patient relapsed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma after a CR of 728 days. Of the 25 patients, 16 died (6 of relapsed disease, 4 of GVHD, 3 of infection, and 3 of transplant-related toxicity) and 9 are alive (6 with CR-2 of them after donor leukocyte infusion-and 3 with relapsed disease). The addition of ATG to low-dose TBI and fludarabine nonmyeloablative conditioning was well tolerated and resulted in >80% donor engraftment in this small cohort. As in other series of truly nonmyeloablative transplantation, a high rate of relapse was observed. Donor engraftment may be facilitated by the addition of ATG to low-dose TBI and fludarabine conditioning.","['Grosskreutz, Celia', 'Ross, Virginia', 'Scigliano, Eileen', 'Fruchtman, Steven', 'Isola, Luis']","['Grosskreutz C', 'Ross V', 'Scigliano E', 'Fruchtman S', 'Isola L']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, New York 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/drug therapy/*radiotherapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Rejection/drug therapy', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', '*Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",2003/07/19 05:00,2004/03/25 05:00,['2003/07/19 05:00'],"['2003/07/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/19 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2003 Jul;9(7):453-9. doi: 10.1016/s1083-8791(03)00139-3.,,"['S1083879103001393 [pii]', '10.1016/s1083-8791(03)00139-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib, an ATP-competitive selective inhibitor of Bcr-Abl, has unprecedented efficacy for the treatment of CML. Most patients with early stage disease achieve durable complete hematological and complete cytogenetic remissions, with minimal toxicity. In contrast, responses are less stable in patients with advanced CML. This review highlights the pathogenesis of CML, its clinical features, and the development of imatinib as a specific molecularly targeted therapy.

We therefore used a murine Msh2 knockout model to elucidate the in vivo importance of MSH2 protein expression in determining thiopurine hematopoietic cytotoxicity. After mercaptopurine (MP) treatment (30 mg/kg/day for 14 days), there was a significantly greater decrease in circulating leukocytes in Msh2+/+ and Msh2+/- mice when compared with Msh2-/- mice (p < 0.002). Likewise, the decrease in erythrocyte counts was more prominent in mice with at least one functional Msh2 allele. MP doses of more than 50 mg/kg/day for 14 days resulted in treatment-related deaths, but Msh2-/- mice had a significant survival advantage (p = 0.02). Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Msh2+/+ mice also exhibited increased sensitivity to MP when compared with MEFs from Msh2-/- mice (IC50, 3.8 +/- 0.1 microM versus 11.9 +/- 1.3 microM, p < 0.001). After MP treatment, deoxythioguanosine incorporation into DNA was similar in mice and MEFs with each of the Msh2 genotypes. Electromobility shift assay experiments identified an Msh2-containing GT- or GST-DNA-nuclear protein complex in Msh2+/+ but not Msh2-/- MEFs. Together, these findings establish that hematopoietic toxicity in vivo after treatment with mercaptopurine is attenuated but not abolished by MSH2 deficiency.","['Krynetskaia, Natalia F', 'Brenner, Timothy L', 'Krynetski, Eugene Y', 'Du, Weinan', 'Panetta, John C', 'Ching-Hon, Pui', 'Evans, William E']","['Krynetskaia NF', 'Brenner TL', 'Krynetski EY', 'Du W', 'Panetta JC', 'Ching-Hon P', 'Evans WE']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 N.

This protein, which was named JAML (junctional adhesion molecule-like), contains 2 extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic tail. JAML mRNA is expressed in hematopoietic tissues and is prominently expressed in granulocytes. The fact that JAML protein is localized at the cell plasma membrane in the areas of cell-cell contacts, whereas it is not detected at free cell borders, suggests that JAML is engaged in homophilic interactions. Furthermore, a conserved dimerization motif among JAM members was shown to be important for JAML localization at the cell membrane. Finally, exogenous expression of JAML in myeloid leukemia cells resulted in enhanced cell adhesion to endothelial cells. Altogether, our results point to JAML as a novel member of the JAM family expressed on leukocytes with a possible role in leukocyte transmigration.","['Moog-Lutz, Christel', 'Cave-Riant, Florence', 'Guibal, Florence C', 'Breau, Marie A', 'Di Gioia, Yolande', 'Couraud, Pierre Olivier', 'Cayre, Yvon E', 'Bourdoulous, Sandrine', 'Lutz, Pierre G']","['Moog-Lutz C', 'Cave-Riant F', 'Guibal FC', 'Breau MA', 'Di Gioia Y', 'Couraud PO', 'Cayre YE', 'Bourdoulous S', 'Lutz PG']","['Hopital Robert Debre, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Unite U417, 48 Boulevard Serurier, 75019 Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (JAML protein, human)', '0 (Junctional Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Junctional Adhesion Molecules', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/07/19 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/07/19 05:00'],"['2003/07/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/19 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Nov 1;102(9):3371-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-11-3462.

All virus-specific CD8+ T-cell clones isolated from recipients after alloSCT contained DNA of donor origin. In all 6 D+/R+ sibling alloSCTs from seropositive donors into seropositive recipients, donor virus-specific clones transferred in the allograft underwent early expansion and were maintained long term in the recipient. In contrast, in 2 of 3 HCMV D+/R- alloSC transplant recipients in whom there was no detectable HCMV infection, donor HCMV-specific clones were undetectable, whereas donor EBV-specific clones were maintained in the same EBV-seropositive recipients, suggesting that transferred clones require antigen for their maintenance. Following D-/R+ transplantation from 3 seronegative donors into seropositive recipients, a delayed primary virus-specific CD8+ T-cell response was observed, in which the T cells contained donor DNA, suggesting that new antigen-specific T cells arose in the recipient from donor-derived progenitors. In 2 of 4 HCMV D+/R+ sibling allograft recipients the clonal composition underwent diversification as compared with their donors, with delayed persistent expansion of HCMV-specific clones that were undetectable in the donor or in the recipient during the early months after transplantation; this diversification may represent expansion of new clones generated from donor-derived progenitors.

Gene disruption in mice blocks early granulocyte differentiation and disruption of C/EBP alpha function has been implicated in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but no systematic structure-function analysis has been undertaken to identify the mechanisms involved in C/EBP alpha-mediated granulocyte differentiation. Here we demonstrate that loss of either of 2 key regions results in disruption of C/EBP alpha granulocytic development: the amino terminus and specific residues residing on the non-DNA binding face of the basic region. Mutation of either results in loss of C/EBP alpha inhibition of E2F and down-regulation of c-Myc, but only mutation of the basic region results in loss of physical interaction with E2F. In contrast, while the amino terminal mutant retains the ability to interact with E2F, this mutant fails to bind a C/EBP alpha site efficiently, fails to activate C/EBP alpha target genes, and is also defective in inhibition of E2F activity. These results further emphasize the importance of inhibition of proliferative pathways in granulopoiesis and demonstrate that several regions of the C/EBP alpha protein are involved in this mechanism.","[""D'Alo', Francesco"", 'Johansen, Lisa M', 'Nelson, Erik A', 'Radomska, Hanna S', 'Evans, Erica K', 'Zhang, Pu', 'Nerlov, Claus', 'Tenen, Daniel G']","[""D'Alo' F"", 'Johansen LM', 'Nelson EA', 'Radomska HS', 'Evans EK', 'Zhang P', 'Nerlov C', 'Tenen DG']","['Hematology/Oncology Division, Harvard Institutes of Medicine, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (SMARCA2 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*chemistry/genetics/*physiology', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'E2F Transcription Factors', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism/physiology']",2003/07/19 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/07/19 05:00'],"['2003/07/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/19 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Nov 1;102(9):3163-71. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-02-0479.

Transfer of T-cell receptors (TCRs) directed against these mHags into T lymphocytes may provide a strategy to generate antileukemic T cells. To investigate the feasibility of this strategy the TCR usage of mHag HA-2-specific T-cell clones was characterized. Thirteen different types of HA-2-specific T-cell clones were detected, expressing TCRs with diversity in TCR alpha- and beta-chain usage, however, containing in the TCR alpha chain a single conserved gene segment J alpha 42, indicating that J alpha 42 is involved in HA-2-specific recognition. We transferred various HA-2 TCRs into T lymphocytes from HLA-A2-positive HA-2-negative individuals resulting in T cells with redirected cytolytic activity against HA-2-expressing target cells. Transfer of chimeric TCRs demonstrated that the HA-2 specificity is not only determined by the J alpha 42 region but also by the N-region of the alpha chain and the CDR3 region of the beta chain. Finally, when HA-2 TCRs were transferred into T cells from HLA-A2-negative donors, the HA-2 TCR-modified T cells exerted potent antileukemic reactivity without signs of anti-HLA-A2 alloreactivity. These results indicate that HA-2 TCR transfer may be used as an alternative strategy to generate HA-2-specific T cells to treat hematologic malignancies of HLA-A2-positive, HA-2-expressing patients that received transplants from HLA-A2-matched or -mismatched donors.","['Heemskerk, Mirjam H M', 'Hoogeboom, Manja', 'de Paus, Roelof A', 'Kester, Michel G D', 'van der Hoorn, Menno A W G', 'Goulmy, Els', 'Willemze, Roel', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik']","['Heemskerk MH', 'Hoogeboom M', 'de Paus RA', 'Kester MG', 'van der Hoorn MA', 'Goulmy E', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, C2-R, PO Box 9600, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands. m.h.m.heemskerk@lumc.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HA-2 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Joining Region)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blood Cells/immunology', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor alpha', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Joining Region/genetics', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/pathology', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/metabolism/transplantation', '*Transduction, Genetic']",2003/07/19 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/07/19 05:00'],"['2003/07/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/19 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Nov 15;102(10):3530-40. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-05-1524.

Constructs were designed to encode a [Gly(4)Ser](2) flexible linker between the nucleic acid coding sequences for the NGFR and CD genes. Retroviral vectors constructed with wild-type CD and NG/CD fusion genes were used to transduce 3T3 fibroblasts and the human T cell line CEM. The function of CD fusion genes was comparable to that of wild-type genes as determined in cytotoxicity assays. By flow cytometry, the NGFR antigen was detectable after expression of the fusion gene derived from either Escherichia coli (NG/CDe) or Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NG/CDs), but the greatest antigen density was observed in cells transduced with the NG/CDs vector. Similarly, superior 5-FC sensitivity was observed with NG/CDs fusion gene in both murine fibroblasts and human T cells. In addition, CEM cells expressing NG/CDs were more efficiently eliminated in vivo.

Most cancers developed by XP patients are basal and squamous cell carcinoma strikingly restricted to sun-exposed parts of the skin. Cells from patients with classic XP are deficient in nucleotide excision repair, a versatile biochemical mechanism for removal of ultraviolet-induced DNA lesions. Among the seven classic XP complementation groups known to date (XP-A to XP-G), XP-C is the most common one in Europe and North Africa and XP-C patients remain free of neurologic problems often seen in other XP complementation groups. This has prompted us to undertake genetic correction of XP-C fibroblasts and particularly keratinocytes, which are the most relevant cells in relation to skin cancer and have proven recently to be capable of reconstructing XP-C skin in vitro. In this study, we demonstrate that DNA repair capacity, cell survival properties, and transition from proliferative to abortive keratinocyte colonies toward UVB irradiation can be fully recovered in keratinocytes from patients with XPC transduced with a retroviral vector stably driving the expression of the wild-type XPC protein. In addition, we show that in the absence of UV, XP-C keratinocytes exhibit intrinsic cell cycle abnormalities, and beta(1)-integrin overexpression, defects that are also both fully reversed after genetic correction. Together with full correction of the defects in XP-C corrected keratinocytes, in vitro reconstruction of skin from these cells open a rational perspective to XP tissue therapy.","['Arnaudeau-Begard, Catherine', 'Brellier, Florence', 'Chevallier-Lagente, Odile', 'Hoeijmakers, Jan', 'Bernerd, Francoise', 'Sarasin, Alain', 'Magnaldo, Thierry']","['Arnaudeau-Begard C', 'Brellier F', 'Chevallier-Lagente O', 'Hoeijmakers J', 'Bernerd F', 'Sarasin A', 'Magnaldo T']","['Laboratory of Genetic Instability and Cancer, CNRS UPR2169, Institut Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif Cedex 05, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '156533-34-5 (XPC protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1/metabolism', 'Keratinocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Skin/anatomy & histology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Xeroderma Pigmentosum/*genetics']",2003/07/19 05:00,2003/09/27 05:00,['2003/07/19 05:00'],"['2003/07/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/19 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2003 Jul 1;14(10):983-96. doi: 10.1089/104303403766682241.,,['10.1089/104303403766682241 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By working with human T-lymphoblastic CCRF-CEM cells and by using MS and SouthWestern blotting, we identified eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) as the main nuclear protein that specifically recognizes these oligonucleotides. Western blotting and supershift assays confirmed the nature of this protein and its involvement in forming a cytotoxicity-related complex (CRC). On the contrary, normal human lymphocytes did not show nuclear proteins able to produce CRC in a SouthWestern blot. Comparative bidimensional PAGE and Western-blotting analysis for eEF1A revealed the presence of a specific cluster of spots, focusing at more basic pH, in nuclear extracts of cancer cells but absent in those of normal lymphocytes. Moreover, a bidimensional PAGE SouthWestern blot demonstrated that cytotoxic GT oligomers selectively recognized the more basic eEF1A isoform expressed only in cancer cells. These results suggest the involvement of eEF1A, associated with the nuclear-enriched fraction, in the growth and maintenance of tumour cells, possibly modulated by post-translational processing of the polypeptide chain.","['Dapas, Barbara', 'Tell, Gianluca', 'Scaloni, Andrea', 'Pines, Alex', 'Ferrara, Lino', 'Quadrifoglio, Franco', 'Scaggiante, Bruna']","['Dapas B', 'Tell G', 'Scaloni A', 'Pines A', 'Ferrara L', 'Quadrifoglio F', 'Scaggiante B']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Technologies, University of Udine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factor 1)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', 'QR26YLT7LT (Thymine)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Southwestern', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Extracts/chemistry', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Guanine/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides/chemistry/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Peptide Elongation Factor 1/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Thymine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/07/19 05:00,2003/09/13 05:00,['2003/07/19 05:00'],"['2003/07/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/19 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 2003 Aug;270(15):3251-62. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-1033.2003.03713.x.,,"['3713 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-1033.2003.03713.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A retrospective investigation of 13 patients from Northern Ireland diagnosed with M4Eo acute myeloid leukaemia.,16-21,"M4Eo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients with the typical chromosome 16 abnormalities have a favourable prognosis. These subtle 16q22 gene rearrangements can be difficult to detect by conventional cytogenetic methods and if missed could lead to the incorrect assignment of prognostic group and hence subsequent treatment strategies. We retrospectively studied 13 patients diagnosed with M4Eo AML for such chromosome 16 abnormalities comparing conventional cytogenetic (G-banding) and molecular (FISH) methods. G-banded analysis detected only 2 patients with definite chromosome 16 abnormalities whereas FISH detected 4 patients, one with the typical inversion and three with the typical chromosome 16 translocation. FISH analysis also confirmed a false +ve G-banded result in one patient and a false -ve G-banded result in another patient. Finally, FISH confirmed a deletion of one chromosome 16 homologue in another patient indicating a poor prognosis. The overall survival of patients with the typical 16q22 rearrangements (n=4) was also significantly better (P=0.007) than patients with normal chromosome 16 homologues or having other numerical and/or structural abnormalities (n=9). This set of data shows that FISH is a more accurate method for the detection of cryptic 16q22 gene rearrangements and because of the prognostic implications has become a mandatory test along with conventional cytogenetics for all newly diagnosed M4Eo AML patients in Northern Ireland.","['McGrattan, P', 'Humphreys, M W']","['McGrattan P', 'Humphreys MW']","['Northern Ireland Regional Genetics Centre, Belfast City Hospital Trust, Lisburn Road, Belfast BT9 7AB.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Northern Ireland,Ulster Med J,The Ulster medical journal,0417367,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chi-Square Distribution', '*Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/*genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Northern Ireland', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2003/07/19 05:00,2003/09/06 05:00,['2003/07/19 05:00'],"['2003/07/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/19 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ulster Med J. 2003 May;72(1):16-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC2475396,,,,,,,

We show here that SCL/Tal-1 is a key target of caspases in developing erythroblasts. SCL/Tal-1 degradation occurred rapidly after caspase activation and preceded the cleavage of the major erythroid transcription factor GATA-1. Expression of a caspase-resistant SCL/Tal-1 in erythroid progenitors was able to prevent amplification of caspase activation, GATA-1 degradation and impaired erythropoiesis induced by growth factor deprivation or death receptor triggering. The potent proerythropoietic activity of uncleavable SCL/Tal-1 was clearly evident in the absence of erythropoietin, a condition that did not allow survival of normal erythroid cells or expansion of erythroblasts expressing caspase-resistant GATA-1. In the absence of erythropoietin, cells expressing caspase-resistant SCL/Tal-1 maintain high levels of Bcl-X(L), which inhibits amplification of the caspase cascade and mediates protection from apoptosis. Thus, SCL/TAL-1 is a survival factor for erythroid cells, whereas caspase-mediated cleavage of SCL/Tal-1 results in amplification of caspase activation, GATA-1 degradation and impaired erythropoiesis.","['Zeuner, A', 'Eramo, A', 'Testa, U', 'Felli, N', 'Pelosi, E', 'Mariani, G', 'Srinivasula, S M', 'Alnemri, E S', 'Condorelli, G', 'Peschle, C', 'De Maria, R']","['Zeuner A', 'Eramo A', 'Testa U', 'Felli N', 'Pelosi E', 'Mariani G', 'Srinivasula SM', 'Alnemri ES', 'Condorelli G', 'Peschle C', 'De Maria R']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome 00161, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 7', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Erythroblasts/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Erythropoiesis/*physiology', 'Erythropoietin/deficiency/pharmacology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein', 'fas Receptor/immunology/physiology']",2003/07/18 05:00,2004/05/07 05:00,['2003/07/18 05:00'],"['2003/07/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2003 Aug;10(8):905-13. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4401255.,,"['10.1038/sj.cdd.4401255 [doi]', '4401255 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine the function of amino acid residues at the R peptide cleavage site in virus entry, mutant Env expression plasmids containing amino acid substitutions at these cleavage site residues were constructed. Some of these mutants induced syncytia in NIH 3T3 cells, even though they expressed the R peptide, indicating the importance of these residues for membrane fusion inhibition by the R peptide. Some mutants in which R peptide cleavage was detected had comparable transduction efficiency to wild-type Env, but mutants in which R peptide cleavage was not detected had lower transduction efficiency than wild-type Env.

In human liver microsomes, 1,3-butadiene is rapidly oxidized to butadiene monoxide, which can then be hydrolyzed to 3-butene-1,2-diol (BDD). In this study, BDD and several potential metabolites were characterized in the urine of male B6C3F1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats after BDD administration (i.p.). Rats given 1420 micromol kg(-1) BDD excreted significantly greater amounts of BDD relative to rats administered 710 micromol kg(-1) BDD. Rats administered 1420 or 2840 micromol kg(-1) BDD excreted significantly greater amounts of BDD per kilogram of body weight than mice given an equivalent dose. Trace amounts of 1-hydroxy-2-butanone and the carboxylic acid metabolites, crotonic acid, propionic acid, and 2-ketobutyric acid, were detected in mouse and rat urine after BDD administration. Because of the identification of the carboxylic acid metabolites and because of the known ability of carboxylic acids to conjugate coenzyme A, which is critical for hippuric acid formation, the effect of BDD treatment on hippuric acid concentrations was investigated. Rats given 1420 or 2272 micromol kg(-1) BDD had significantly elevated ratios of benzoic acid to hippuric acid in the urine after treatment compared with control urine. However, this effect was not observed in mice administered 1420 or 2840 micromol kg(-1) BDD. Collectively, the results demonstrate species differences in the urinary excretion of BDD and show that BDD administration in rats inhibits hippuric acid formation. The detection of 1-hydroxy-2-butanone and the carboxylic acids also provides insight regarding pathways of BDD metabolism in vivo.","['Sprague, Christopher L', 'Elfarra, Adnan A']","['Sprague CL', 'Elfarra AA']","['School of Veterinary Medicine, 2015 Linden Drive, Madison, WI 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Butanones)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Carboxylic Acids)', '0 (Crotonates)', '0 (Glycols)', '0 (Hippurates)', '0 (Propionates)', '600-18-0 (alpha-ketobutyric acid)', '8SKN0B0MIM (Benzoic Acid)', 'JHU490RVYR (propionic acid)', 'JSD5FGP5VD (1,3-butadiene)', 'M57N50D82D (1-hydroxy-2-butanone)', 'PP8001HM3T (3-butene-1,2-diol)', 'TE0865N2ET (hippuric acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzoic Acid/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/urine', 'Butadienes/*chemistry', 'Butanones/urine', 'Butyrates/urine', 'Carboxylic Acids/*urine', 'Crotonates/urine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glycols/*administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'Hippurates/*antagonists & inhibitors/urine', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Microsomes, Liver', 'Molecular Structure', 'Propionates/urine', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Species Specificity']",2003/07/18 05:00,2004/06/18 05:00,['2003/07/18 05:00'],"['2003/07/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 2003 Aug;31(8):986-92. doi: 10.1124/dmd.31.8.986.,,"['10.1124/dmd.31.8.986 [doi]', '31/8/986 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,['Drug Metab Dispos. 2003 Sep 31(9):1198'],,,,,,,,

Several randomized trials have failed to identify major differences in survival between any of these doublets. This lack of evidence for improvement in survival with any chemotherapy regimen has created a tabula rasa where no more large randomized trials should be conducted without including a genetic analysis. Patients see survival as their major concern, and other considerations, such as cost and quality of life, are relegated to lower positions. Genetic alterations related to the transcription-coupled repair pathway of the nucleotide excision repair system (TC-NER) have revealed the subset of patients who are resistant to cisplatin. TC-NER involves genes that are deficient in rare inborn disorders such as Cockayne syndrome and xeroderma pigmentosum. For a long time, ERCC1 mRNA levels have been known to correlate with DNA repair capacity in various tissues. Levels of DNA cisplatin adducts in peripheral blood and buccal mucosa cells predict chemotherapy response, and high ERCC1 mRNA levels have been related to chemoresistance in ovarian cancer and in malignant lymphocytes from chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Moreover, in some instances, mRNA expression has been correlated with polymorphisms. Overexpression of ERCC1 correlates with poor survival in gemcitabine/cisplatin-treated NSCLC patients. An ongoing customized ERCC1-based chemotherapy trial has been designed based on this knowledge. Patients are randomized to the control arm of cisplatin/docetaxel or to the experimental arm, where docetaxel is combined with cisplatin or gemcitabine according to ERCC1 levels.

It uses its N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) to interact with the CARD in the downstream adaptor Bcl-10. We show that primary B and T lymphocytes from knock-in mice expressing only a CARDless form of CARMA1 (Delta CARD) are defective at mitogen-induced NF-kappa B activation and fail to proliferate. CARMA1 mutant mice exhibited normal T but impaired B cell development; CD5(+) peritoneal B cells were absent, and serum immunoglobulin levels were markedly reduced.

Thus, CARMA1 has an essential role in mediating B and T lymphocyte proliferation and requires its CARD to engage downstream signaling components.","['Newton, Kim', 'Dixit, Vishva M']","['Newton K', 'Dixit VM']","['Molecular Oncology Department, Genentech, 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Curr Biol,Current biology : CB,9107782,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 2.7.4.4 (Nucleoside-Phosphate Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.4.8 (Guanylate Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Guanylate Kinases', 'Lac Operon/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Nucleoside-Phosphate Kinase/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism']",2003/07/18 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/07/18 05:00'],"['2003/07/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Biol. 2003 Jul 15;13(14):1247-51. doi: 10.1016/s0960-9822(03)00458-5.,,"['S0960-9822(03)00458-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0960-9822(03)00458-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are two standardized criteria for the classification of patients into groups of cytogenetic risk. One of them was established by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) and the other by the US Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG). They define three and four cytogenetic categories, respectively. The aim of this study was to define the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities and to compare the groups of cytogenetic risk in patients with AML who received intensive chemotherapy, as a guide for future investigations. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Chromosomal analysis was performed using standard techniques on bone marrow samples from 146 adult patients between January 1995 and December 2001. Kaplan-Meier and Cox's regression models were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Cytogenetic results were obtained in 142 patients. The incidence of a complex karyotype and del(5q) was higher in patients with secondary AML. Classification by cytogenetic risk was performed in 105 treated patients. The classification using both models was identical in 82 patients and different in 23. Results in univariate analysis were significant for EFS (p < 0.000 for MRC and p < 0.02 for SWOG). Nevertheless, only the MRC model was significant for OS (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, age and cytogenetics were the only variables having prognostic value. CONCLUSIONS: There was some relation between secondary AML, advanced age and adverse karyotype. Both classification models have a great prognostic value. In our experience, codification according to MRC criteria appears to be more effective to detect patients at high risk of relapse.","['Martin Ramos, Maria Luisa', 'Lopez Pastor, Margarita', 'de la Serna Torroba, Javier', 'Ayala, Rosa', 'Garcia Alonso, Luis', 'Barreiro Miranda, Emilia']","['Martin Ramos ML', 'Lopez Pastor M', 'de la Serna Torroba J', 'Ayala R', 'Garcia Alonso L', 'Barreiro Miranda E']",['Servicios de Genetica y Hematologia.

Managed care organizations will face reimbursement decisions for genetic tests on a growing scale, and they should have a framework in place to evaluate the clinical and economic outcomes of this new class of diagnostics. OBJECTIVE: To develop a set of criteria that could assist decision makers in evaluating the cost effectiveness of genetic testing. METHODS: A literature review was conducted of marketed genetic tests and criteria used to evaluate the clinical and economic benefits of genetic testing. Criteria were developed and pilot-tested on currently available genetic tests in colon cancer, periodontitis, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and anticoagulation. RESULTS: A robust cost-effectiveness analysis requires data demonstrating (1) genotype-phenotype association; (2) genetic variant prevalence; (3) clinical outcome severity and incidence; (4) interventions for the variant group; and (5) sensitivity, specificity, and timing of the assay result. In addition, calculating the number of patients who need to be screened based on the above factors is useful for evaluating genetic tests. CONCLUSIONS: When evaluating a genetic test for reimbursement, these criteria can help to: (1) quantify the potential clinical benefit and economic savings; (2) assess the robustness of a cost-effectiveness analysis; and (3) clarify areas where data are deficient. These criteria should be used to inform the decision-making process in the context of ethical, legal, and social issues related to genetic testing.","['Higashi, Mitchell K', 'Veenstra, David L']","['Higashi MK', 'Veenstra DL']","['Pharmaceutical Outcomes Research and Policy Program, Institute for Public Health Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle, Wash 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Am J Manag Care,The American journal of managed care,9613960,,,"['Cost-Benefit Analysis/*methods', 'Decision Making', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Testing/*economics', 'Health Services Research', 'Human Genome Project', 'Humans', '*Insurance Claim Review', '*Insurance Coverage', 'Managed Care Programs/*economics', 'United States']",2003/07/18 05:00,2003/08/09 05:00,['2003/07/18 05:00'],"['2003/07/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Manag Care. 2003 Jul;9(7):493-500.,,['2 [pii]'],,,,44,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A possible S-LFA3 interactive immunotherapy.,213-21,"Reports concerning the compartmentwise immunoreactivity and migratory property of the bone marrow derived stem/progenitor cells have been poorly documented. The present study shows that both in normal and leukemic mice a low density group of bone marrow cells (LDC) are functionally less matured than a high density group of cells (HDC) as revealed from spontaneous E-rosetting, cytotoxic efficacy and phagocytic function against the targets which correlated well with the migratory activity of the cells from LDC to HDC compartment. This is deranged in leukaemic groups of animals. Administration of Sheep Erythrocytes (SRBC) significantly increased the CD34+ cell population as evident through flowcytometric (FACS) analysis and the above immune reactivity in leukemic mice. The results indicated that, (a) bone marrow cells comprising the major fractions of immature cells are capable of eliciting immune-reactivity against the targets in normal and (b) poorly in leukemic mice and that (c) sheep red blood cells could effectively trigger such immunological functions together with enhanced maturation dependent migration in leukemic mice. The study hints at therapeutic potentiality of SRBC or its determinant molecule TIITS or Sheep-leucocyte function antigen 3 (S-LFA3/CD 58) in stimulating the stem and progenitor cells in vivo.","['Law, S', 'Begum, B', 'Chaudhuri, S']","['Law S', 'Begum B', 'Chaudhuri S']","['Immunology and Immunohaematology Lab., Dept. of Haematology, School of Tropical Medicine, Calcutta, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Carcinogens)', 'P8M1T4190R (Ethylnitrosourea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Carcinogens', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Separation', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Ethylnitrosourea', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Phagocytosis', 'Sheep', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Time Factors']",2003/07/18 05:00,2004/03/11 05:00,['2003/07/18 05:00'],"['2003/07/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Jun;22(2):213-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similar to the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP), this method is based on PCR amplification following the in vitro telomerase reaction, while the in vitro telomerase reaction here is prematurely, rather than randomly, terminated. Apart from this, the telomeric extension products are used as initial primers, instead of as templates, to trigger the amplification with a specially constructed plasmid DNA as the template that cannot be directly amplified with the telomerase primer. The end product is a specific 159-bp DNA fragment that reflects telomerase activity.

Using a joinpoint regression model, based on data from a national mortality routine reporting system in China (CHIS), time trends in mortality for 9 major cancers are analyzed. Between 1987 and 1999, the age-standardized mortality rates for all cancers combined declined slightly in rural areas but have increased since 1996 in urban areas. The mortality rates for cancers in oesophagus, stomach, cervix uteri, leukaemia (except for urban males after 1996) and nasopharynx declined, while lung cancer and female breast cancer showed significant increasing trends in both urban and rural areas and for both sexes. Cancers of the colon-rectum and liver had different trends in mortality in urban and rural populations. The trends in age-specific mortality rates suggest some different trends in the younger population, which may presage future overall trends, for example, increasing mortality from cancer of the cervix. The observed trends primarily reflect the dramatic changes in socioeconomic circumstances and lifestyles in China in the last 2 decades. Tobacco smoking remains a major problem, with increases in mortality from lung cancer. The improvements in socioeconomic status, diet and nutrition may be responsible for the declining risk of some cancers (oesophagus, stomach and nasopharynx), while increasing the risk for others (breast and colon-rectum). Screening programs (especially for cervix cancer), and more available and better facilities for cancer therapy, may have helped to reduce mortality for several cancers. The large increases in the absolute number of deaths that resulted from the increasing and aging population are much more important in determining the future cancer burden than any changes due to change in risk, emphasizing the increasing importance of cancer as a health problem in the 21st century in China.","['Yang, Ling', 'Parkin, Donald M', 'Li, Liandi', 'Chen, Yude']","['Yang L', 'Parkin DM', 'Li L', 'Chen Y']","['International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Rural Population', 'Sex Distribution', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Urban Population']",2003/07/17 05:00,2003/09/17 05:00,['2003/07/17 05:00'],"['2003/07/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/17 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2003 Sep 20;106(5):771-83. doi: 10.1002/ijc.11300.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/ijc.11300 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported Hodgkin-like adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (HL-like ATLL) (new WHO classification). Various CXC and CC chemokines are expressed on H&RS cells and the relationships between chemokines and the chemokine receptor (R) are thought to be important for selectivity of local immunity of Th1 and Th2 T cells. To clarify the role of T-cell immunity in classical HL and Hodgkin-like ATLL, we performed gene expression profiling (chemokine, chemokine R and cytokine DNA chips) in 12 cases [classical HL, 8 cases [mixed cellularity (MC) type, 4; nodular sclerosis (NS) type, 4]; Hodgkin-like ATLL, 4 cases] and immunohistochemical staining in 29 cases (MC, 10; NS, 10; Hodgkin-like ATLL, 9). EBV-infected H&RS cells were detected in 9 of 10 cases of HL MC, 5 of 9 of HL-like ATLL and 2 of 10 HL NS. T-cell-directed chemokine thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC)- and/or macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC)-positive H&RS cells were detected in all 20 cases of HL MC and HL NS but only in 5 of 9 cases of HL-like ATLL. Interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP10)- and monokine induced by interferon-gamma (MIG)-positive H&RS cells were detected in all 10 HL MC but only in 5 of 10 cases of HL NS and 2 of 9 cases of HL-like ATLL. However, 2 of 5 cases of HL-like ATLL with EBV infection and 2 of 2 HL NS with EBV had IP10/MIG-positive H&RS cells. The chemokine expressions in H&RS cells seemed to be associated with EBV infection rather than histologic subtypes. In the DNA chip expression analysis, classical HL and HL-like ATLL had a mixed Th1/Th2-type profile, and HL MC (EBV-positive) and HL NS (EBV-negative) were differentially clustered. However, 2 cases of HL-like ATLL clustered with HL MS and the other 2 cases of HL-like ATLL clustered with HL NS. The former HL-like ATLL had EBV infection in H&RS cells, whereas the latter did not have EBV infection. This finding also suggests that EBV might influence local expression of chemokines rather than HL subtypes. Our results indicate that local immunologic disorder or imbalance appears to influence the formation of H&RS cells and that in HL-like ATLL, HTLV-1 infection might not be necessary for H&RS cell formation.","['Ohshima, Koichi', 'Karube, Kennosuke', 'Hamasaki, Makoto', 'Suefuji, Hiroaki', 'Tutiya, Takeshi', 'Yamaguchi, Takahiro', 'Suzumiya, Junji', 'Kikuchi, Masahiro']","['Ohshima K', 'Karube K', 'Hamasaki M', 'Suefuji H', 'Tutiya T', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Suzumiya J', 'Kikuchi M']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan. ohshima@fukuoka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA 1)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)']",IM,"['Chemokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Herpesviridae Infections/pathology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/isolation & purification', 'Hodgkin Disease/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Receptors, Chemokine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Virus Infections/pathology']",2003/07/17 05:00,2003/09/17 05:00,['2003/07/17 05:00'],"['2003/07/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/17 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2003 Sep 20;106(5):706-12. doi: 10.1002/ijc.11301.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/ijc.11301 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have demonstrated that imatinib mesylate also inhibits the survival and functions of normal mast cells by interfering with the receptor tyrosine kinase for stem cell factor (SCF), c-kit, which is expressed by mast cells. Because mast cells extensively surround many types of cancer and contain powerful anticoagulants such as heparin, we investigated the effects of imatinib mesylate on blood clotting and tumor growth within subcutaneous implants of a mammary adenocarcinoma cell line (4T1) in BALB/c mice. After 5 days of oral treatment with 10 mg/kg of the drug, the average mass of the tumors in treated mice (198 +/- 42 mg, n = 5) was significantly (p < 0.05) greater than the average mass of the tumors from untreated (control) mice (60 +/- 23 mg, n = 5). Moreover, the tumors in the treated mice were frequently surrounded by large lakes of clotted blood that were not evident in tumors from the control mice. Accelerated growth and blood clotting were also observed in tumor-bearing mice treated with heparinase I enzyme to destroy endogenous mast cell heparin and in NDST-2 knockout mice in which there is a targeted disruption in the gene coding for mast cell heparin synthesis. We conclude that imatinib mesylate accelerated the growth and peri-tumoral blood clotting of implants of mammary adenocarcinoma in mice. These results suggest that imatinib mesylate may have significant effects on mast cells infiltrating tumors, in addition to its other biologic activities. Our results also indicate that the mechanism of this effect may be related to the anticoagulant properties of mast cell heparin.","['Samoszuk, Michael', 'Corwin, Mark A']","['Samoszuk M', 'Corwin MA']","['Pathology Department, University of California Irvine Medical Center, Orange, CA 92868, USA. msamoszu@uci.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.8.2.- (NDST2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.8.2.- (Ndst2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.8.2.- (Sulfotransferases)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 4.2.2.7 (Heparin Lyase)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*blood/pathology', 'Amidohydrolases/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Anticoagulants/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Blood Coagulation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Heparin/pharmacology', 'Heparin Lyase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/*blood/pathology', 'Mast Cells/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Sulfotransferases/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/07/17 05:00,2003/09/17 05:00,['2003/07/17 05:00'],"['2003/07/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/17 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2003 Sep 20;106(5):647-52. doi: 10.1002/ijc.11282.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/ijc.11282 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inhibitory activity of compound K was more potent than that of disodium cromoglycate, one of the commercial anti-allergic drugs. This compound demonstrated a membrane stabilizing action on differential scanning calorimetry. However, compound K did not inhibit the activation of hyaluronidase and did not scavenge active oxygen.

Quantification of donor chimerism may predict graft failure and relapse. METHODS: We quantified donor long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) in nine patients during the early phase after NST and lineage-specific donor cells of myeloid (CD33+, CD34+, granulocytes) and lymphoid lineage (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD56+) in 38 patients with a median follow-up of 40 weeks after NST. Conditioning therapy consisted of fludarabine 90 mg/m2 followed by total body irradiation of 2 Gy. RESULTS: Only rapid establishment of donor T-cell chimerism was essential for stable donor engraftment. Patients with less than 90% of donor T cells 4 weeks after NST had a significantly higher risk of relapse, graft rejection, or both (14 of 18 patients) than patients with donor T-cell chimerism of 90% and higher (3 of 20 patients). Although conditioning therapy was nonmyeloablative, a significant decrease of repopulating stem cells defined as LTC-IC was seen after 2 weeks followed by rapid recovery of LTC-IC to pretransplant values. Interestingly, all LTC-IC were from donor origin 2 and 4 weeks after NST, but rapid establishment of donor LTC-IC was not predictive for progression-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid establishment of lymphoid but not myeloid donor chimerism is a prognostic factor for stable donor engraftment after NST. It seems that an immunologic shield of alloreactive donor T cells is essential for early hematopoietic progenitors.","['Keil, Felix', 'Prinz, Erika', 'Moser, Karin', 'Mannhalter, Christine', 'Kalhs, Peter', 'Worel, Nina', 'Rabitsch, Werner', 'Schulenburg, Axel', 'Mitterbauer, Margit', 'Greinix, Hildegard']","['Keil F', 'Prinz E', 'Moser K', 'Mannhalter C', 'Kalhs P', 'Worel N', 'Rabitsch W', 'Schulenburg A', 'Mitterbauer M', 'Greinix H']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Vienna, Austria. felix.keil@akh-wien.ac.at']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Blood Group Incompatibility', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Chimera/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/07/17 05:00,2003/09/05 05:00,['2003/07/17 05:00'],"['2003/07/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/17 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2003 Jul 15;76(1):230-6. doi: 10.1097/01.TP.0000071862.42835.76.,,['10.1097/01.TP.0000071862.42835.76 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of liver biopsy in such cases has not been defined in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-prevalent patients. The impact of liver biopsy in the management of LFT derangement after HSCT in an HBV-prevalent population was examined. METHODS: Seventy-five liver biopsies, performed for 323 patients with LFT derangement post-HSCT (263 allogeneic, 60 autologous), were analyzed. The HBV carrier rate was 13.6%. RESULTS: Significantly more LFT derangements and therefore liver biopsies occurred in allogeneic versus autologous HSCT. Before biopsy, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and HBV reactivation were clinically diagnosed in 70.6% and 25.3% of cases, respectively. A definite histopathologic diagnosis was obtained after biopsy in 53 cases, with GVHD, HBV hepatitis, and concomitant GVHD-HBV hepatitis found in 33%, 21%, and 8% of cases, respectively. The clinical and histopathologic diagnoses were concordant in 43 cases and discordant in 9 cases. Clinical management was altered in six of nine discordant cases, five of which were caused by HBV or hepatitis C virus (HCV) reactivation. Twenty-two biopsy specimens showed nondiagnostic histopathologic features. Twenty of these cases were successfully managed on the basis of clinical diagnoses. The clinical-biochemical features of patients clinically diagnosed to have GVHD did not differ significantly whether or not they were HBV-HCV carriers. However, liver biopsies in HBV-HCV carriers resulted in significantly more treatment alterations as compared with noncarriers. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical diagnoses of LFT derangements post-HSCT might be adequate for initiation of treatment, but liver biopsies in HBV-HCV carriers were needed, as this might impact on management.","['Ma, Shing-Yan', 'Au, Wing-Yan', 'Ng, Irene O L', 'Lie, Albert K W', 'Leung, Anskar Y H', 'Liang, Raymond H S', 'Lau, George K K', 'Kwong, Yok-Lam']","['Ma SY', 'Au WY', 'Ng IO', 'Lie AK', 'Leung AY', 'Liang RH', 'Lau GK', 'Kwong YL']","['University Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', 'Hepatitis B/*epidemiology', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/blood', 'Hong Kong/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Liver/*pathology', 'Liver Diseases/*etiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy', 'Platelet Count', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects']",2003/07/17 05:00,2003/09/05 05:00,['2003/07/17 05:00'],"['2003/07/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/17 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2003 Jul 15;76(1):169-76. doi: 10.1097/01.TP.0000072809.22740.A8.,,['10.1097/01.TP.0000072809.22740.A8 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The pertinent literature was reviewed to yield 116 cases in which a glioma developed after radiotherapy for cranial pathologies (included 10 personal cases treated in our Institution). One of our patients had undergone radiosurgery for a cavernous angioma. RESULTS: Patients who developed a radiation-induced glioma were younger, as a group, than those affected with so-called ""spontaneous"" gliomas. The tumor originated in the previously irradiated area, after average doses of 32 Gy and an average latency period of 9.6 years in accordance with the findings reported by the authors and in our experience as well. Radiotherapy had most frequently been performed for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our Case 10 is the fourth case of intracranial tumor arising after radiosurgery to be described in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: Though rare, gliomas may represent a late complication of radiation treatment. The behavior of the radiation-induced variety of glioma does not seem to differ significantly from that of its ""spontaneous"" counterpart. Late complications of the radiosurgery are probably underestimated because of the relatively recent introduction of this technique. On the contrary, these should be scrupulously evaluated when deciding whether to employ this method for therapeutic purposes for relatively benign or congenital lesions (which generally affect young patients with a long life expectancy).","['Salvati, Maurizio', 'Frati, Alessandro', 'Russo, Natale', 'Caroli, Emanuela', 'Polli, Filippo Maria', 'Minniti, Giuseppe', 'Delfini, Roberto']","['Salvati M', 'Frati A', 'Russo N', 'Caroli E', 'Polli FM', 'Minniti G', 'Delfini R']","['Department of Neurosurgery-INM Neuromed, Pozzilli (Is), University of Rome La Sapienza, Via Cardinal Agliardi 15, 00165 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Surg Neurol,Surgical neurology,0367070,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Brain Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Glioma/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care']",2003/07/17 05:00,2003/08/14 05:00,['2003/07/17 05:00'],"['2003/07/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/17 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Surg Neurol. 2003 Jul;60(1):60-7; discussion 67. doi: 10.1016/s0090-3019(03)00137-x.,,"['S009030190300137X [pii]', '10.1016/s0090-3019(03)00137-x [doi]']",,,,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: (C57BL/6 x 615) F1 (H-2bk) mice which was inoculated with L615 cells to develop leukemic murine model was the recipient. The healthy C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice was the donor. CD(34)(+) cells from bone marrow and CD(3)(+)cells from spleen of the donor were purified by miniMACS. The purity of CD(34)(+) cells and CD(3)(+) cells were (81.5 +/- 2.4)% and (95.4 +/- 2.9)% respectively. Sixty-nine recipient mice were divided into seven groups. Group A received no treatment, group B received TBI only, the rest groups were irradiated 9 Gy by (60)Co and transfused 10(5) CD(34)(+) cells or mixed with 10(7) (E), 10(8) (F), 1.5 x 10(8) (G) of CD(3)(+) cells respectively.

Immunotherapy with dendritic cells (DCs) eliciting specific T cell responses to leukemia-associated antigens (LAAs) might be a therapeutic option. DCs must express HLA class I/II molecules and the costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD86 to effectively activate T cells for the subsequent lysis of leukemic blasts. The expression of these antigens on DCs generated from 15 AML patients (AML-DCs) and on DCs generated from 15 healthy volunteers (HV-DCs) was analyzed by FACS. All DCs displayed the typical morphology and tested negative for B, T and NK cell markers. The sustained mRNA expression of LAAs such as PRAME, RHAMM or WT-1 proved that the AML-DCs originated from AML blasts. Compared with AML blasts, the expression of CD40, CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR was upregulated during DC culture to a median of 80-98% on AML-DCs. HLA-ABC was preserved on AML-DCs (median 95%). Expression of CD40, CD80 and CD83 remained lower on AML-DCs than on HV-DCs.

HYPOTHESIS: Work-related factors affect cancer pattern of the pilots. METHODS: A cohort of 10,051 male and 160 female airline pilots from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden was followed for cancer incidence through the national cancer registries. There were 177,000 person-years at follow-up, 51,000 of them accumulated after 20 yr since the time of first employment. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were defined as ratios of observed over expected numbers of cases based on national cancer incidence rates. Dose-response analyses were done with Poisson regression method. RESULTS: Among male pilots, there were 466 cases of cancer diagnosed vs. 456 expected. The only significantly increased SIRs concerned skin cancer: melanoma 2.3 (95% CI 1.7-3.0), squamous cell cancer 2.1 (1.7-2.8), and basal cell carcinoma 2.5 (1.9-3.2). The relative risk of skin cancers increased with the time since first employment, the number of flight hours, and the estimated radiation dose. There was an increase in the relative risk of prostate cancer with increasing number of flight hours in long-distance aircraft (p trend 0.01). No increased incidence was found for acute myeloid leukemia or brain cancer which were of interest a priori based on earlier studies. CONCLUSIONS: This large study, based on reliable cancer incidence data, showed an increased incidence of skin cancer. It did not indicate a marked increase in cancer risk attributable to cosmic radiation although some influence of cosmic radiation on skin cancer cannot be entirely excluded.","['Pukkala, Eero', 'Aspholm, Rafael', 'Auvinen, Anssi', 'Eliasch, Harald', 'Gundestrup, Maryanne', 'Haldorsen, Tor', 'Hammar, Niklas', 'Hrafnkelsson, Jon', 'Kyyronen, Pentti', 'Linnersjo, Anette', 'Rafnsson, Vilhjalmur', 'Storm, Hans', 'Tveten, Ulf']","['Pukkala E', 'Aspholm R', 'Auvinen A', 'Eliasch H', 'Gundestrup M', 'Haldorsen T', 'Hammar N', 'Hrafnkelsson J', 'Kyyronen P', 'Linnersjo A', 'Rafnsson V', 'Storm H', 'Tveten U']","['Finnish Cancer Registry, Institute for Statistical and Epidemiological Cancer Research, Helsinki, Finland. eero.pukkala@cancer.fi']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Aviat Space Environ Med,"Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",7501714,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', '*Aircraft/*statistics & numerical data', 'Causality', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Iceland/epidemiology', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/statistics & numerical data', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Risk', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries/epidemiology', 'Sex Distribution', 'Skin Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Workload/statistics & numerical data']",2003/07/17 05:00,2003/11/05 05:00,['2003/07/17 05:00'],"['2003/07/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/17 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Aviat Space Environ Med. 2003 Jul;74(7):699-706.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infusion-related events can be minimized by stepwise administration and appropriate prophylaxis. Cytopenia can be minimized by drug postponement and cytokine support or red blood cell or platelet transfusions. Patients also are at risk for infection because of lymphopenia, and anti-infective prophylaxis is mandatory at initiation of therapy until at least two months post-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: With satisfactory supportive measures in place, patients with chemorefractory B-CLL can experience the benefits of alemtuzumab therapy without excessive toxicity.

The HTLV-1 transactivator, Tax, is implicated as the viral oncoprotein. Naive cells expressing Tax for the first time develop severe cell cycle abnormalities that include increased DNA synthesis, mitotic arrest, appearance of convoluted nuclei with decondensed DNA, and formation of multinucleated cells. Here we report that Tax causes a drastic reduction in Pds1p/securin and Clb2p/cyclin B levels in yeast, rodent, and human cells and a loss of cell viability. With a temperature-sensitive mutant of the CDC23 subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), cdc23(ts); a temperature-sensitive mutant of cdc20; and a cdh1-null mutant, we show that the diminution of Pds1p and Clb2p brought on by Tax is mediated via the Cdc20p-associated anaphase-promoting complex, APC(Cdc20p). This loss of Pds1p/securin and Clb2p/cyclin B1 occurred before cellular entry into mitosis, caused a G(2)/M cell cycle block, and was accompanied by severe chromosome aneuploidy in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells and human diploid fibroblasts. Our results support the notion that Tax aberrantly targets and activates APC(Cdc20p), leading to unscheduled degradation of Pds1p/securin and Clb2p/cyclin B1, a delay or failure in mitotic entry and progression, and faulty chromosome transmission. The chromosomal instability resulting from a Tax-induced deficiency in securin and cyclin B1 provides an explanation for the highly aneuploid nature of adult T-cell leukemia cells.","['Liu, Baoying', 'Liang, Min-Hui', 'Kuo, Yu-liang', 'Liao, Wei', 'Boros, Imre', 'Kleinberger, Tami', 'Blancato, Jan', 'Giam, Chou-Zen']","['Liu B', 'Liang MH', 'Kuo YL', 'Liao W', 'Boros I', 'Kleinberger T', 'Blancato J', 'Giam CZ']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, 4301 Jones Bridge Road, Bethesda, MD 20814, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Apc8 Subunit, Anaphase-Promoting Complex-Cyclosome)', '0 (CDC23 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (CLB2 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PDS1 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Securin)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligase Complexes)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Anaphase-Promoting Complex-Cyclosome)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (histone H1 kinase)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Anaphase-Promoting Complex-Cyclosome', 'Aneuploidy', 'Animals', 'Apc8 Subunit, Anaphase-Promoting Complex-Cyclosome', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromosomes/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cyclin B/*metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G2 Phase', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics/*physiology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Karyotyping', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Metaphase', 'Mitosis', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Securin', 'Temperature', 'Thymidine/chemistry', 'Time Factors', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligase Complexes']",2003/07/16 05:00,2003/08/30 05:00,['2003/07/16 05:00'],"['2003/07/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2003 Aug;23(15):5269-81. doi: 10.1128/MCB.23.15.5269-5281.2003.,,['10.1128/MCB.23.15.5269-5281.2003 [doi]'],,,"['R01 CA 48709/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA075688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA/GM 75688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 GM075688/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA048709/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,PMC165734,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with advanced B-cell CLL were included into the study. After reduced-intensity conditioning with fludarabine, busulfan, and antithymocyte globulin, patients received a transplant from related (n = 15) or unrelated donors (n = 15). Minimal residual disease (MRD) was monitored with a clone-specific polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 2 years, 23 patients are alive (to date). Neutrophil and platelet engraftment occurred after a median of 17.5 and 15 days, respectively. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade 2 to 4 was observed in 17 patients (56%), and chronic GVHD was observed in 21 patients (75%). Twelve patients (40%) achieved a complete remission (CR), and 16 patients (53%) achieved a partial remission. Late CR occurred up to 2 years after transplantation. MRD was monitored in eight patients with CR. All patients achieved a molecular CR. At last follow-up, six patients were in ongoing molecular CR. Causes of death were treatment-related complications in four patients and progressive disease in three patients. The probability of overall survival, progression-free survival, and nonrelapse mortality at 2 years was 72% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54% to 90%), 67% (95% CI, 49% to 85%), and 15% (95% CI, 1% to 29%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Treatment-related mortality after reduced-intensity conditioning followed by allogeneic HSCT was low. The procedure induced molecular remissions in patients with advanced CLL. The observation of late remissions provided evidence of a graft-versus-leukemia effect.","['Schetelig, J', 'Thiede, C', 'Bornhauser, M', 'Schwerdtfeger, R', 'Kiehl, M', 'Beyer, J', 'Sayer, H G', 'Kroger, N', 'Hensel, M', 'Scheffold, C', 'Held, T K', 'Hoffken, K', 'Ho, A D', 'Kienast, J', 'Neubauer, A', 'Zander, A R', 'Fauser, A A', 'Ehninger, G', 'Siegert, W']","['Schetelig J', 'Thiede C', 'Bornhauser M', 'Schwerdtfeger R', 'Kiehl M', 'Beyer J', 'Sayer HG', 'Kroger N', 'Hensel M', 'Scheffold C', 'Held TK', 'Hoffken K', 'Ho AD', 'Kienast J', 'Neubauer A', 'Zander AR', 'Fauser AA', 'Ehninger G', 'Siegert W']","['Charite Campus Virchow Klinium, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Busulfan/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Probability', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use']",2003/07/16 05:00,2003/08/15 05:00,['2003/07/16 05:00'],"['2003/07/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Jul 15;21(14):2747-53. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.12.011.,,"['10.1200/JCO.2003.12.011 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.12.011 [pii]']",,,,,['Cooperative German Transplant Study Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations of the androgen receptor (AR) gene that broaden ligand specificity have been implicated. Bone marrow specimens containing prostate tumor were obtained from men undergoing antiandrogen withdrawal for AR sequence analysis and clinical correlation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible men enrolled on a trial of antiandrogen withdrawal had a minimum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 5 ng/dL that was increasing on castration therapy including an antiandrogen. With informed consent, marrow biopsies were obtained to collect prostate tumor. Additional samples were obtained from men enrolled on chemotherapy trials. AR cDNA or DNA was polymerase chain reaction-amplified, cloned, and sequenced. The AR CAG repeat length was recorded. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-four bone marrow biopsies were obtained, and 48 had prostate tumor detected by light microscopy. The ARs from these 48 samples were sequenced. Overall, five (10%) of 48 tumors had mutated ARs. AR point mutations were detected in the hormone-binding domain involved in transcription factor binding. Three mutations were novel in prostate cancer. One tumor sample had a CAG repeat length of 21, compared with germline length of 22 repeats. There was no association between detectability of AR mutations and antiandrogen withdrawal response or survival. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that AR mutations are present in approximately 10% of patients with prostate cancer who experience treatment failure with hormone therapy that included an antiandrogen. Mutations in the AR likely confer a growth advantage for a subset of progressive prostate cancers. Correlation of AR mutation with antiandrogen withdrawal response or survival could not be made.","['Taplin, Mary-Ellen', 'Rajeshkumar, Barur', 'Halabi, Susan', 'Werner, Cary P', 'Woda, Bruce A', 'Picus, Joel', 'Stadler, Walter', 'Hayes, Daniel F', 'Kantoff, Philip W', 'Vogelzang, Nicholas J', 'Small, Eric J']","['Taplin ME', 'Rajeshkumar B', 'Halabi S', 'Werner CP', 'Woda BA', 'Picus J', 'Stadler W', 'Hayes DF', 'Kantoff PW', 'Vogelzang NJ', 'Small EJ']","['University of Massachusetts Memorial Health Center, Department of Oncology, 55 Lake Ave North, Worcester, MA 01655, USA. taplinm@ummhc.org.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Androgen Antagonists)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Aged', 'Androgen Antagonists/*administration & dosage', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Confidence Intervals', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Receptors, Androgen/*genetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/07/16 05:00,2003/08/15 05:00,['2003/07/16 05:00'],"['2003/07/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Jul 15;21(14):2673-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.11.102.,,"['10.1200/JCO.2003.11.102 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.11.102 [pii]']",,,"['U10CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10CA78967/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['Cancer and Leukemia Group B Study 9663'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND RESULTS: We demonstrate a novel gene therapy for MI using leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) cDNA. We injected LIF plasmid DNA into the thigh muscle of mice immediately after inducing MI. Intramuscular injection of LIF cDNA resulted in a marked increase in circulating LIF protein concentrations. Two weeks later, left ventricular remodeling, such as infarct extent and myocardial fibrosis, was markedly attenuated in the LIF cDNA-injected mice compared with vehicle-injected mice. More myocardium was preserved and cardiac function was better in the LIF-treated mice than in the vehicle-injected mice. Injection of LIF cDNA not only prevented the death of cardiomyocytes in the ischemic area but also induced neovascularization in the myocardium. Furthermore, LIF cDNA injection increased the number of cardiomyocytes in cell cycle and enhanced mobilization of bone marrow cells to the heart and their differentiation into cardiomyocytes. CONCLUSIONS: The intramuscular injection of LIF cDNA may induce regeneration of myocardium and provide a novel treatment for MI.","['Zou, Yunzeng', 'Takano, Hiroyuki', 'Mizukami, Miho', 'Akazawa, Hiroshi', 'Qin, Yingjie', 'Toko, Haruhiro', 'Sakamoto, Masaya', 'Minamino, Tohru', 'Nagai, Toshio', 'Komuro, Issei']","['Zou Y', 'Takano H', 'Mizukami M', 'Akazawa H', 'Qin Y', 'Toko H', 'Sakamoto M', 'Minamino T', 'Nagai T', 'Komuro I']","['Department of Cardiovascular Science and Medicine, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-8-1 Inohana, Chuo-ku, Chiba 260-8670, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Circulation,Circulation,0147763,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA, Complementary/administration & dosage/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Heart/*drug effects/physiology', 'Heart Function Tests/drug effects', 'Injections, Intramuscular', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myocardial Infarction/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Myocardium/pathology', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*drug effects/pathology', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/drug effects', 'Regeneration/*drug effects', 'Ventricular Remodeling/drug effects']",2003/07/16 05:00,2003/09/18 05:00,['2003/07/16 05:00'],"['2003/07/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Circulation. 2003 Aug 12;108(6):748-53. doi: 10.1161/01.CIR.0000081773.76337.44.

In this study, we investigated the effects of cinnamaldehyde on the cytotoxicity, induction of apoptosis and the putative pathways of its actions in human promyelocytic leukemia cells. Using apoptosis analysis, measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and assessment of mitochondrial membrane potentials (DeltaPsim), we show that cinnamaldehyde is a potent inducer of apoptosis and that it transduces the apoptotic signal via ROS generation, thereby inducing mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) and cytochrome c release to the cytosol.

Both autologous and allogeneic SCT are used, depending on donor availability and the type of disease being treated, resulting in different morbidity and outcomes. In both types of SCT, immune regulation via graft manipulation is being studied, although with highly different targeted outcomes. In general, autologous SCT have lower treatment-related morbidity and mortality, but a higher incidence of tumor relapse, and graft manipulation targets immune augmentation and/or the reduction of immune tolerance. In contrast, allogeneic SCT have a higher incidence of treatment-related morbidity and mortality and a significantly longer time of disease progression, and the targeted outcomes or graft manipulation focus on a reduction in graft versus host disease (GVHD). One source of the increased relapse rate and shorter overall survival (OS) following high dose chemotherapy (HDT) and autologous SCT is the immune tolerance that limits host response, both innate and antigen (Ag) specific, against the tumor. The immune tolerance that is observed is due in part to the tumor burden and prior cytotoxic therapy. Therefore, graft manipulation, as an adjuvant therapeutic approach in autologous SCT, is primarily focused on non-specific or specific immune augmentation using cytokines and vaccines. Recently, manipulation of the infused product as a form of cellular therapy has begun to also focus on approaches to reduce immune tolerance found in transplant patients, both prior to and following HDT and SCT. To this end, graft manipulation to reduce the presence of Fas Ligand (FasL)-expressing cells or interleukin (IL)10 and tumor growth factor (TGF)beta production has been proposed. In contrast to autologous transplantation, graft manipulation during allogeneic transplantation is used extensively. This includes limiting the infusion of T cells within the product or as a donor leukocyte infusion (DLI), resulting in a reduction in GVHD and the induction of long-term survivors. Indeed, allogeneic SCT provide the only curative therapy for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), refractory acute leukemia, and myelodysplasia. The curative potential of allogeneic SCT is reduced, however, by the development of GVHD, a potentially lethal T-cell-mediated immune response targeting host tissues [Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 102 (1993) 309, J. Exp. Med. 183 (1996) 589]. The morbidity and mortality associated with GVHD limit this technology, resulting focus on those patients who have no alternative therapeutic options or who have advanced disease. Thus, allogeneic SCT provide one of the few statistically supported demonstrations of therapeutic efficacy by T cells (comparison of allogeneic to autologous transplantation). In contrast to autologous transplantation, control of GVHD following allogeneic SCT focuses on immune suppression and the induction of tolerance. Here too, graft manipulation is appropriate, and there are numerous studies of T-cell depletion to reduce GVHD, with or without the isolation and infusion of T cells as DLI. Additional strategies are examining the isolation and infusion of T cells with graft versus leukemia (GVL) activity to reduce GVHD and/or the infusion of genetically manipulated and/or selected cellular populations (monocytes or dendritic cells (DC)) to induce tolerance. Therefore, depending upon the type of transplant, the goals associated with graft manipulation can be radically different. In this review, we emphasize using graft manipulation to regulate immune tolerance and anergy in association with SCT. Although this paper focuses on hematopoietic SCT, it should be noted that these strategies are relevant to conditions other than neoplastic and congenital diseases, including solid organ transplants, and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.","['Talmadge, James E']",['Talmadge JE'],"['Nebraska Medical Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center 987660, Omaha, NE 68198-7660, USA. jtalmadg@unmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,,IM,"['Apoptosis/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', '*Transplantation Immunology', 'Transplantation, Autologous/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology']",2003/07/16 05:00,2004/03/30 05:00,['2003/07/16 05:00'],"['2003/07/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2003 Aug;3(8):1121-43. doi: 10.1016/S1567-5769(03)00014-6.,,"['S1567-5769(03)00014-6 [pii]', '10.1016/S1567-5769(03)00014-6 [doi]']",,,,219,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a substantial number of cases both alleles are rearranged and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products have either to be cloned or excised and reamplified from acrylamide gels. Here we describe a novel HPLC-based method for identification and characterization of clonal TCR-delta targets. Clonality of PCR amplified TCR-delta products was examined on a high-resolution micropellicular DNASep matrix (WAVE Nucleic Acid Fragment Analysis System, Transgenomic) and subsequently classified into clonal, biclonal or negative samples. Vdelta2-Ddelta3 and Ddelta2-Ddelta3 rearrangements were analyzed by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), using triethylammonium acetate as an ion-pairing reagent, with a linear acetonitrile gradient at 50 degrees C. Biclonal elution profiles consisted of two individual homoduplex peaks and one heteroduplex peak unique for each patient sample. For characterization of biclonal rearrangements DHPLC separated samples were subjected to a second run and individual clonal peaks were collected. A software-controlled fragment collector was arranged in tandem with the HPLC system for this purpose and purified PCR products were collected in a time-dependent manner. Fractions were air dried and subsequently sequenced directly. The specificity of the observed patient specific sequences was tested via real time quantitative PCR on a LightCycler system.","['zur Stadt, Udo', 'Eckert, Conny', 'Rischewski, Johannes', 'Michael, Katharina', 'Golta, Steffi', 'Muller, Manuela', 'Schneppenheim, Reinhard', 'Kabisch, Hartmut']","['zur Stadt U', 'Eckert C', 'Rischewski J', 'Michael K', 'Golta S', 'Muller M', 'Schneppenheim R', 'Kabisch H']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital, University of Hamburg, Martinistrasse 52, 20246 Hamburg, Germany. zurstadt@uke.uni-hamburg.de""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci,"Journal of chromatography.

We evaluated nine naturally occurring staurosporine derivatives as modulators of chemokine production by monitoring the secretion of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in the cell line NB-4. Several staurosporines increased, dose- and time-dependently, the IL-8 and MCP-1 concentration in the cell culture supernatants and three derivatives strongly inhibited proliferation of the NB-4 cells. By comparing the efficiency of these analogues at the same concentration, the lead compound staurosporine (STS-1) was the best inducer of chemokine secretion, whereas 3-hydroxystaurosporine (STS-3) was the most potent growth inhibitor. Besides the staurosporines, also 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) strongly increased the IL-8 and MCP-1 secretion of NB-4 cells. Several staurosporine analogues clearly inhibited the TPA-induced but enhanced the TNFalpha-mediated chemokine increase. These effects, namely the increase of chemokines in untreated or TNFalpha-treated cells and the inhibition of chemokine release in TPA-treated cells, cannot be explained by the exclusive inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC).

The expression of G1 cell cycle regulatory proteins was also measured. Stimulation via CD40-CD40L resulted in increased viability, as did stimulation with IL-4. A combination of the two stimulators (CD40L plus IL-4) induced increased expression of cyclins D3 and E, pRb phosphorylation and downregulated p27. Cdk2 and Cdk4 activities were not detected.

Furthermore, Fluda-induced apoptosis was not prevented by CD40L, IL-4, or a combination of both agents, although a delay in the onset of apoptosis was observed.

The relatively new cell type of NKT-cells (also termed NK-like T-cells) represents a subpopulation of T-cells that share some characteristics with NK-cells. T- and NKT-cells have their T-cell receptor (TCR) genes rearranged while NK-cells are identified molecularly and immunologically by the absence of TCR gene rearrangements and TCR protein and lack of certain surface antigens. Various continuous malignant cell lines have been derived from patients with T-cell, NK- and NKT-cell neoplasms. These cell lines possess several traits typical of the respective diseases. Characterization of these cell lines which was the objective of this study will facilitate future studies of cell biology and therapeutics for which cell lines are indispensable models. In view of the imprecision of morphological criteria alone, we analyzed a series of seven NK-cell, five NKT-cell and five T-cell lines using functional and immunophenotypic tools. All T-cell lines were negative for the presence of azurophilic granules, NK activity and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). In contrast, 7/7 NK-cell and 4/5 NKT-cell lines displayed the azurophilic granules but only three of these combined twelve NK/NKT-cell lines showed significant NK activity which may be explained by the functional immaturity of the cells. EBV was found in 5/7 NK-cell and in 1/5 NKT-cell lines. As expected, T-cell lines were commonly positive for T-cell surface antigens and negative for NK-cell markers, and NK-cell lines vice versa; nevertheless, a number of immunomarkers were shared between T- and NK-cell lines. NKT-cell lines express T-cell, NK-cell and markers shared between T- and NK-cells. Sets of markers distinctive for the three types of cell lines are presented. The composite data gained on the present panels of cell lines allow for the operational definition of typical NK- and NKT-cell line profiles. Such cell lines will prove invaluable as informative models for studies of normal and neoplastic NK- and NKT-cell biology.","['Matsuo, Yoshinobu', 'Drexler, Hans G']","['Matsuo Y', 'Drexler HG']","['Hayashibara Biochemical Labs, Fujisaki Cell Center, Okayama 702-8006, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/07/16 05:00,2003/09/18 05:00,['2003/07/16 05:00'],"['2003/07/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2003 Oct;27(10):935-45. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00024-9.,,"['S0145212603000249 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00024-9 [doi]']",,,,,,['Leuk Res. 2003 Oct;27(10):879-81.

Here we report an aleukaemic case of GSSI with inv(16) and its molecular equivalent, the CBFbeta/MYH11 fusion gene, detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), that after treatment with conventional AML chemotherapy followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation, achieved complete haematological and molecular remission on bone marrow examination. After chemotherapy, a thickened ileum wall positive for CBFbeta/MYH11 on tumour mass samples was still observed on computed tomography (CT) studies, raising the question of residual GS representing a reservoir of malignant cells. This case demonstrates the critical need of multidisciplinary diagnosis and follow-up of this entity combining immunopathologic, cytogenetic and molecular studies, reinforcing the potentiality of risk-adapted therapy strategies, as it is increasingly claimed for patients with overt AML.","['Xavier, Sandra G', 'Fagundes, Evandro M', 'Hassan, Rocio', 'Bacchi, Carlos', 'Conchon, Monika', 'Tabak, Daniel G', 'Spector, Nelson', 'Zalcberg, Ilana R']","['Xavier SG', 'Fagundes EM', 'Hassan R', 'Bacchi C', 'Conchon M', 'Tabak DG', 'Spector N', 'Zalcberg IR']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center (CEMO), Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCa), Praca da Cruz Vermelha 23, 7 Andar, 20230-130, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Ileum/diagnostic imaging', 'Intestinal Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2003/07/16 05:00,2003/10/04 05:00,['2003/07/16 05:00'],"['2003/07/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2003 Nov;27(11):1063-6. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00070-5.,,"['S0145212603000705 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00070-5 [doi]']",,,,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the aggressive nature of the Molt-4 model, the ET and LT were accelerated to day 3 or 4 and day 8 post-implant, respectively. For each model, 2 x 10(7) (KBM-3B) or 1 x 10(7) (Molt-4, HL-60 and CEM) leukemia cells were injected intravenously into the tail vein. Each control and test group consisted of eight animals. All three schedules (1mg/kg qd1-5, 1.75 mg/kg d1, 3, 5 and 6 mg/kg d1, 8) increased the life span of OSI-211 treated animals in each model, with a tendency toward improved efficacy with the 6 mg/kg d1, 8 schedule. As a result, the activity of the 6 mg/kg d1, 8 schedule is detailed for each model. ET significantly (P<0.005) increased survival in the KBM-3B model with 86% long-term survivors (LTS). Using PRC analysis, human beta-globin gene sequences in one or several tissues were amplified in all but 3 LTS, suggesting minimal residual disease in 26 of the 29 LTS. LT also significantly (P<0.005) improved average life span in the KBM-3B model, with an average ILS=196+/-11% and one LTS. Treatment of HL-60 leukemia animals significantly (P<0.005) increased life span, with an ILS=213+/-9% and two LTS for ET, and with an ILS=219+/-4% and no LTS for LT. Treatment of Molt-4 animals, the most aggressive leukemia model tested, significantly (P<0.005) increased life span, with an average ILS=181+/-3% and no LTS for ET and an average ILS=172+/-1% with no LTS for LT. In the CEM model, ET resulted in a significantly (P<0.005) improved ILS=244+/-24% with one LTS. In comparison to OSI-211, treatment with DaunoXome, the liposomal formulation of daunorubicin, a drug with clinical efficacy in AML and ALL, had no effect on survival in the KBM-3B, nor Molt-4 A4 leukemia models when administered at its maximum or near maximum tolerated doses of 3mg/kg d1, 8.

Hematopoietic growth factors (HGFs) stimulate their growth and simultaneously sensitize them to cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), a cell-cycle-specific cytotoxic drug. Since tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) modifies HGF activities, we examined the effects of TNFalpha in combination with HGFs on in vitro growth and Ara-C sensitivity of AML blast progenitors in patient samples. TNFalpha variably affected HGF-supported colony formation and the self-renewal of blast progenitors. However, the combination of TNFalpha with IL-3 uniformly rendered blast progenitors more resistant to Ara-C irrespective of whether TNFalpha suppressed or augmented IL-3-supported growth, indicating that TNFalpha regulates the Ara-C sensitivity of leukemic progenitors independently of their cell cycle status. Since nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is activated by TNFalpha and induces expression of prosurvival genes, effects of the antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to NF-kappaB subunits, p65 and p50, were examined. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides sensitized HL60 cells to Ara-C but rendered leukemic progenitors in patient samples even more resistant to Ara-C in the presence of TNFalpha and IL-3 in combination, indicating that NF-kappaB is involved in the Ara-C sensitivity of leukemic blast progenitors but may exert opposite dual functions, namely protection from and induction of apoptosis, under different conditions.","['Wu, Zhenghong', 'Shen, Lisong', 'Inatomi, Yuka', 'U, Mami', 'Miyashita, Toshiyuki', 'Toyama, Keisuke', 'Miyauchi, Jun']","['Wu Z', 'Shen L', 'Inatomi Y', 'U M', 'Miyashita T', 'Toyama K', 'Miyauchi J']","[""Department of Clinical Laboratory, National Children's Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",2003/07/16 05:00,2003/10/04 05:00,['2003/07/16 05:00'],"['2003/07/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2003 Nov;27(11):1009-18. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00069-9.,,"['S0145212603000699 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00069-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this investigation, we have determined the effect of the DNA demethylating drug decitabine (DAC; 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) on the growth, cell cycle kinetics, RB phosphorylation, and expression of p16 (INK4a) and p21(WAF1) in EBV- human myeloma and EBV+ lymphoblastic cell lines possessing silenced, methylated p16 (INK4a) genes to: (1). evaluate its potential as a therapeutic agent and (2). investigate its mechanism of action. Demethylation of the p16 (INK4a) gene and expression of the p16 (INK4a) protein were observed using higher doses (10(-6)-10(-7)M) of drug while growth inhibition at lower doses (IC(50)=2 x 10(-8)-4 x 10(-8)M) was associated with RB dephosphorylation and increased expression of p21 (WAF1), but not with induction of p16 (INK4a), or apoptosis. Kinetic experiments demonstrated that RB dephosphorylation and the increase of p21 (WAF1) preceded the induction of p16 (INK4a). The drug induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 and G2/M phases. Antisense experiments demonstrated that the G1 arrest was mediated by transcriptional induction of p21(WAF1). In addition to these observed effects on cell cycle regulatory proteins, decitabine also increased phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase. The G2/M arrest was inhibited by the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580, indicating that activation of p38 MAP kinase pathway was required for G2/M arrest. Thus, decitabine inhibited growth by inducing cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase mediated by p21(WAF1) and the G2/M phase through activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway.","['Lavelle, Donald', 'DeSimone, Joseph', 'Hankewych, Maria', 'Kousnetzova, Tatiana', 'Chen, Yi-Hsiang']","['Lavelle D', 'DeSimone J', 'Hankewych M', 'Kousnetzova T', 'Chen YH']","['VA Chicago, Westside Division, Hematology Research MP151C, 820 South Damen Avenue, Chicago, IL 60612, USA. dlavelle@uic.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'G1 Phase', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mitosis', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2003/07/16 05:00,2003/10/04 05:00,['2003/07/16 05:00'],"['2003/07/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2003 Nov;27(11):999-1007. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00068-7.,,"['S0145212603000687 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00068-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, other possible cytotoxicity mechanisms, e.g., oxidative stress, are studied insufficiently. In the single-electron reduction of quinones including a novel compound RH1 (2,5-diaziridinyl- 3-(hydroxymethyl)-6-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone), by NADPH:cytochrome P-450 reductase (EC 1.6.2.4, P-450R), their reactivity increased with an increase in the redox potential of quinone/semiquinone couple (E(1)7), reaching a limiting value at E(1)7> or =-0.1V. The reactivity of quinones towards NQO1 did not depend on their E(1)7. The cytotoxicity of aziridinyl-unsubstituted quinones in bovine leukemia virus-transformed lamb kidney fibroblasts (line FLK) mimics their reactivity in P-450R-catalyzed reactions, exhibiting a parabolic dependence on their E(1)7. The toxicity of aziridinyl-benzoquinones, although being higher, also followed this trend and did not depend on their reactivity towards NQO1. The action of aziridinylbenzoquinones in FLK cells was accompanied by an increase in lipid peroxidation, their toxicity decreased by desferrioxamine and the antioxidant N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylene diamine, and potentiated by 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea. The inhibitor of NQO1, dicumarol, protected against the toxicity of aziridinyl-benzoquinones except of 2,5-bis-(2'-hydroxyethylamino)-3,6-diaziridinyl-1,4-benzoquinone (BZQ), which was almost inactive as NQO1 substrate. The same events except the absence of pronounced effect of dicumarol were characteristic in the cytotoxicity of aziridinyl-unsubstituted quinones. These findings indicate that in addition to the activation by NQO1, the oxidative stress presumably initiated by single-electron transferring enzymes may be an important factor in the cytotoxicity of aziridinylbenzoquinones. The information obtained may contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of aziridinylquinone cytotoxicity and may be useful in the design of future bioreductive drugs.","['Nemeikaite-Ceniene, Ausra', 'Sarlauskas, Jonas', 'Anusevicius, Zilvinas', 'Nivinskas, Henrikas', 'Cenas, Narimantas']","['Nemeikaite-Ceniene A', 'Sarlauskas J', 'Anusevicius Z', 'Nivinskas H', 'Cenas N']","['Institute of Immunology, MoletuPl. 29, 2021, Vilnius, Lithuania.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (2,5-diaziridinyl-3-(hydroxymethyl)-6-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Aziridines)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Phenylenediamines)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', '7QID3E7BG7 (Dicumarol)', ""DD517SCM92 (N,N'-diphenyl-4-phenylenediamine)"", 'EC 1.6.2.4 (NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NQO1 protein, human)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Aziridines/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Benzoquinones/*toxicity', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Dicumarol/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/virology', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects/*metabolism', 'NADP/metabolism', 'NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase/drug effects/metabolism', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Phenylenediamines/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Toxicity Tests']",2003/07/16 05:00,2003/08/20 05:00,['2003/07/16 05:00'],"['2003/07/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 2003 Aug 1;416(1):110-8. doi: 10.1016/s0003-9861(03)00281-9.,,"['S0003986103002819 [pii]', '10.1016/s0003-9861(03)00281-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, we searched for IFNgamma sensitive binding sites within the murine LPL promoter. A region of the LPL promoter was identified that specifically binds nuclear, but not cytosolic, extracts isolated from IFNgamma-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. EMSA analysis revealed that two protein complexes bind to this site within the LPL promoter and supershift analysis demonstrated that both of these complexes contained STAT 1 proteins. In addition, we have shown that this effect is specific for IFNgamma, since LIF treatment, which also induces STAT 1, did not confer binding to this site. Interestingly, binding to this site within the LPL promoter could be effectively competed with a STAT 1 binding site that we previously identified in the PPARgamma2 promoter. Also, IFNgamma treatment resulted in decreased levels of LPL protein. In summary, we have identified a STAT 1 binding site within the murine LPL promoter which likely plays a role in the IFNgamma induced decrease of LPL expression.","['Hogan, Jessica C', 'Stephens, Jacqueline M']","['Hogan JC', 'Stephens JM']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA 70803, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/*metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism']",2003/07/16 05:00,2003/09/17 05:00,['2003/07/16 05:00'],"['2003/07/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2003 Jul 25;307(2):350-4. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(03)01198-7.,,"['S0006291X03011987 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(03)01198-7 [doi]']",,,['R01DK52968-02/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: By using RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and MTT assay, CYP3A5 mRNA and protein were detected in leukemia cell lines and acute leukemia patients, meanwhile transcriptional regulation of CYP3A5 induced by daunorubicin was observed. A pcDNA3-CYP3A5 reconstituted plasmid and its stably transfected cell line HL-60/CYP3A5 were both established. RESULTS: CYP3A5 mRNA was detected in K562 and U937 cells, whose IC(50) values of daunorubicin were 2.1-fold higher than those of NB4 and HL-60 cells. Bone marrow CYP3A5 positive blast cell percentage at the time of diagnosis in primary drug resistance group (17.2%) was significantly higher than that of continuous complete remission (CCR) group (0.4%) and secondary drug resistance group (5.4%). In their first complete remission of the early relapsed group, the positive rate had been 23.9% as compared with that of CCR group (1.3%). Daunorubicin increased CYP3A5 mRNA level in K562/A02 and activated its transcription in HL-60/ADR. HL-60/CYP3A5 cell was significantly resistant to daunorubicin and vincristine than HL-60 cells did (3.0 and 4.0 times, respectively). CONCLUSION: CYP3A5 expressed in leukemia cells may cause in situ metabolization of many kinds of anticancer drugs, thus led to drug resistance.","['Wang, Ting', 'Chen, Fang-yuan', 'Han, Jie-ying', 'Shao, Nian-xian', 'Ou-Yuang, Ren-rong']","['Wang T', 'Chen FY', 'Han JY', 'Shao NX', 'Ou-Yuang RR']","['Hematology Department, Renji Hospital of Shanghai Second Medical University, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai 200001, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A5 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics/*physiology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/07/16 05:00,2003/10/24 05:00,['2003/07/16 05:00'],"['2003/07/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2003 Jun;24(6):286-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULT: Fifty-three patients being able to evaluate achieved complete hematological response within 7 to 28 days. Fifty-two (98%) of them remained in this situation at last follow-up. One patient relapsed after 7 months' treatment, and progressed to accelerated phase. Gleevec induced major cytogenetic response in 37 patients (70%) and complete cytogenetic response in 27 (51%). Twenty-nine of 37 patients (78%) achieved major cytogenetic response within 3 months. Grade 3 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia occurred in about 10% of patients, which were manageable or tolerated.

We used cultured sympathetic neurons to investigate the effects of these cytokines on catecholamine content, the tyrosine hydroxylase co-factor, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), and norepinephrine (NE) uptake. CT-1, but not IL-6 or TNFalpha, suppressed NE uptake and catecholamines in these neurons, whereas CT-1 and, to a lesser extent, IL-6 decreased BH4 content. CT-1 exerted these effects by decreasing tyrosine hydroxylase, GTP cyclohydrolase (GCH) and NE transporter mRNAs, while IL-6 lowered only GCH mRNA. The neurons innervating the heart are also activated by the central nervous system after myocardial infarction. We examined the combined effect of depolarization and cytokines on noradrenergic function. In CT-1-treated cells, depolarization caused a small increase in BH4 and NE uptake, and a large increase in catecholamines. These changes were accompanied by increased TH, GCH and NE transporter mRNAs. CT-1 and depolarization regulate expression of noradrenergic properties in an opposing manner, and the combined treatment results in elevated cellular catecholamines and decreased NE uptake relative to control cells.","['Li, Wei', 'Knowlton, David', 'Woodward, William R', 'Habecker, Beth A']","['Li W', 'Knowlton D', 'Woodward WR', 'Habecker BA']","['Department of Physiology & Pharmacology, Oregon Health & Science University School of Medicine, Portland, Oregon 97239, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Catecholamines)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Norepinephrine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Slc6a2 protein, rat)', '0 (Symporters)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '22150-76-1 (Biopterin)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)', 'EC 1.14.16.2 (Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase)', 'EC 3.5.4.16 (GTP Cyclohydrolase)', 'EGX657432I (sapropterin)', 'X4W3ENH1CV (Norepinephrine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biopterin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Catecholamines/metabolism', 'Cell Polarity/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/pharmacology/*physiology', 'GTP Cyclohydrolase/genetics', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Heart/innervation', 'Inflammation Mediators/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology/physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Neurons/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Norepinephrine/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Norepinephrine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sympathetic Nervous System/cytology', 'Symporters/genetics', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology/physiology', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/genetics']",2003/07/16 05:00,2003/09/13 05:00,['2003/07/16 05:00'],"['2003/07/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurochem. 2003 Aug;86(3):774-83. doi: 10.1046/j.1471-4159.2003.01890.x.,,"['1890 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1471-4159.2003.01890.x [doi]']",,,"['R01 HL068231/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL68231/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cellular source of IL-4 has yet to be determined, although basophils have been proposed. Eosinophils and mast cells are likely contenders investigated here, and the eosinophil-like leukaemia line AML14.3D10 is compared to eosinophils as an in vitro culturable model for eosinophils. Lectins can cross-link-specific surface glycoproteins and are found in the ingested (processed foods) and inhaled (airborne pollen grains) human environment. Therefore it is of interest to determine whether lectins can elicit the release of IL-4 from Th2-associated granulocytes other than basophils. METHOD: This study investigated the ability of eosinophils, AML14.3D10 and mast cells to secrete preformed IL-4 in response to stimulation with lectins, and explored molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction. RESULTS: Purified eosinophils and basophils, and cultured mast cells and AML14.3D10 cells were incubated with 1 micro m lectin. Agglutination was scored by microscopy. IL-4 secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Biotinylated lectins were used to determine binding to cells by flow cytometry and in lectin blots of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) gels. DISCUSSION: Purified human eosinophils, AML14.3D10 cells and cultured mast cells secrete IL-4 with a pattern similar to that found in basophils when stimulated with a panel of reactive and unreactive lectins. The lectin SNA induces IL-4 secretion from mast cells and basophils, but not from eosinophils or AML14.3D10. Eosinophils appear to secrete only pre-formed IL-4, whereas mast cells may synthesize IL-4 on ligation with the lectin LCA. Lectins that agglutinate the granulocytes investigated do not necessarily induce secretion of IL-4. Lectins that elicit secretion of IL-4 bind more to eosinophils than unreactive lectins as determined by flow cytometry and lectin blotting of SDS gels. CONCLUSION: As granulocytes with functions related to that of basophils, eosinophils, AML14.3D10 and cultured mast cells respond to stimulation with lectins similarly to basophils. This emphasizes the possibility that eosinophils and mast cells may be linked in their cellular heritage as the cellular partners, and lectins as ligands, may contribute to the maintenance of a Th2-favoured microenvironment that is thought to underlie the allergic march.","['Hoffmann, H J', 'Dahl, C', 'Schiotz, P O', 'Berglund, L', 'Dahl, R']","['Hoffmann HJ', 'Dahl C', 'Schiotz PO', 'Berglund L', 'Dahl R']","['Department of Respiratory Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark. hansjuergen.hoffmann@get2net.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Allergy,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,8906443,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Lectins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Agglutination', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Eosinophils/*metabolism', 'Fetal Blood/physiology', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*metabolism', 'Lectins/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/07/16 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/07/16 05:00'],"['2003/07/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Allergy. 2003 Jul;33(7):930-5. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2222.2003.01625.x.,,"['1625 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2222.2003.01625.x [doi]']",,,,,,['Clin Exp Allergy. 2003 Jul;33(7):859-60.

A retrospective study at Srinagarind Hospital revealed 60 cases of splenic abscess between 1992 and 2001. The causative organisms were identified in 41 cases (68.3%). Gram negative bacilli were commonly isolated and Burkholderia pseudomallei was the most predominant. Diabetes mellitus and leukemia were common underlying diseases found in 46.3 per cent and 9.7 per cent of culture confirmed cases, respectively. The patients usually presented with fever, left upper quadrant pain, tenderness and splenomegaly. Multiple abscesses were more commonly found in the melioidosis than in the non-melioidosis group (p = 0.032), but a single abscess was more commonly found in the non-melioidosis than in the melioidosis group (p = 0.032). Concurrent liver abscesses, often multiple, were not different in both groups. Antimicrobials alone were given in 66.7 per cent of cases with melioidosis and 64.7 per cent of non-melioidosis group.

The overall mortality rate of splenic abscess was only 4.9 per cent in the present series. In conclusion, splenic abscess is not uncommon. Burkholderia pseudomalleli is the most common causative agent found in the present series. Therefore, it should be targeted in the initial empirical antibiotic therapy before the culture results are available especially when multiple lesions in the spleen and concurrent multiple liver abscesses are seen. Prolonged treatment with appropriate antimicrobials alone is usually effective. Splenectomy and/or aspiration may be useful in selected patients.","['Sangchan, Apichat', 'Mootsikapun, Piroon', 'Mairiang, Pisaln']","['Sangchan A', 'Mootsikapun P', 'Mairiang P']","['Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen Universitiy, Khon Kaen 40002, Thailand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Thailand,J Med Assoc Thai,Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet,7507216,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Abscess/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/*microbiology/*therapy', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Splenectomy/methods', 'Splenic Diseases/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/*microbiology/*therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Thailand/epidemiology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ultrasonography']",2003/07/16 05:00,2003/08/15 05:00,['2003/07/16 05:00'],"['2003/07/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Assoc Thai. 2003 May;86(5):436-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They were manifested by decreased body weight, including clear involution of thymic tissue and pronounced anaemia. Microscopically, thymuses of infected animals displayed lymphatic depletion, clearly visible in the lobular cortex. Similarly, in the bursa Fabricii follicles, a marked reduction of the cortical layer and a decrease in folicullar centres was revealed. A decrease in the antibody response correlated with bursa Fabricii atrophy. The clear signs of anaemia were confirmed by haematological measurements, red blood cell count, haematocrit value and haemoglobin included.

Differential patterns of HCMV replication were found in HTLV-I-carrying cell lines. HCMV gene expression was restricted to the immediate-early genes in MT-2 and MT-4 cells, whereas full replication cycle of the virus was observed in C8166-45 cells. Productive HCMV infection induced a cytopathic effect resulting in the lysis of infected cells. The results of electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed high levels of NF-kappaB-, CREB/ATF-1-, and SRF-specific DNA binding activity in all Tax-positive cell lines. In contrast, SP1 activity could be detected only in C8166-45 cells. Using an inducible system (Jurkat cell line JPX-9), a dramatic increase in NF-kappaB, CREB/ATF-1, SRF, and SP1 binding activity, as well as productive HCMV infection, were observed upon Tax expression. Overexpression of SP1 in MT-2 and MT-4 cells converted HCMV infection from an abortive to a productive one. These data suggest that the stimulatory effect of Tax protein on HCMV in T cells is accomplished through at least five host-related transcription factor pathways. The results of this study provide possible mechanisms whereby HCMV infections might imply suppression of adult T-cell leukemia.","['Beck, Zoltan', 'Bacsi, Attila', 'Liu, Xiangdong', 'Ebbesen, Peter', 'Andirko, Istvan', 'Csoma, Eszter', 'Konya, Jozsef', 'Nagy, Etelka', 'Toth, Ferenc D']","['Beck Z', 'Bacsi A', 'Liu X', 'Ebbesen P', 'Andirko I', 'Csoma E', 'Konya J', 'Nagy E', 'Toth FD']","['Institute of Medical Microbiology, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'J6K4F9V3BA (Cadmium Chloride)']",IM,"['Cadmium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Cytomegalovirus/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Serum Response Factor/metabolism', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",2003/07/15 05:00,2003/10/08 05:00,['2003/07/15 05:00'],"['2003/07/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/15 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Virol. 2003 Sep;71(1):94-104. doi: 10.1002/jmv.10447.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/jmv.10447 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of treatment with Idarubicin (IDA) and Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), used alone or in combination, on the activation of Caspase-3 in canine Chronic Lymphatic Leukaemia (CLL) cells was investigated, in order to clarify the mechanism of chemo- and hormone-therapy mediated apoptosis. Caspase activity was determined by a quantitative fluorimetric assay. Apoptosis was monitored by propidium iodide (PI) and nucleosomes assay. Treatment of CLL cells for 24 h with MPA 5 microM did not significantly activate caspase-3 but its activity was increased almost 5-fold more with IDA 1 microM (P < 0.05) than control. Treatment of CLL cells with IDA 1 microM in equimolecular association with MPA was able to increase the activation of caspase-3 induced by IDA of the 61.2% (P < 0.05) in comparison with IDA alone. The activation of caspase-3 was confirmed evaluating apoptosis by PI and nucleosomes assay. Furthermore, both caspase-3 activation and apoptosis triggered by IDA alone or in combination with MPA were significantly inhibited by specific caspase-3 inhibitor AC-DEVD-CMK.

From September 1995 to June 2001, 28 consecutive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients underwent unrelated bone marrow transplants: 21 were in chronic phase (CP) and seven in advanced phase (AP). Median age was 35.5 years (range 20-50). HLA typing was based on high-resolution molecular techniques; in eight cases there were one or more allele mismatches. The preparative regimen consisted of TBI, EDX 120 mg/kg and rabbit ATG 15 mg/kg. All patients engrafted and no rejection occurred. Acute GVHD grade III-IV occurred in six patients (21%). Chronic GVHD occurred in 10 (40%) and it was extensive in one. Four out of seven patients transplanted in AP had a hematological relapse. Of 21 in CP, there was one cytogenetic and one molecular relapse: these two patients are now in complete remission with imatinib mesylate. With a median follow-up of 45.7 months, the 5-year survival is 76.2% for those transplanted in CP.

The neutral-SMase activity in the cells treated for 1 h at 42(o)C was slightly increased but decreased in the cells treated at 43(o)C or 44(o)C for the same period whereas the acid SMase activity was slightly increased after heating the cells at 42(o)C and 43(o)C and markedly increased at 44(o)C for 1 h. Treatment of cells with inhibitors of SMase activation and ceramide formation significantly reduced the heat-induced apoptosis. Three major families of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), i.e. ERK1/2, p38 and JNK, were activated by the hyperthermic treatment of cells. Inhibition of ERK1/2 with PD98059 exerted little effect on the heat-induced apoptosis and p38 inhibition with SB203580 slightly lessened apoptosis whereas, inhibition of JNK with SP600125 markedly suppressed the heat-induced apoptosis.

We have shown tht pre-BCR complex components Igalpha and Igbeta are critical to allowing the pre-B cell to move through this transition, but may not be required for allelic exclusion. Pre-BCR expression also directly affects the response of leukemic cells to steroid treatment, suggesting that signals initiated by the pre-BCR complex may present therapeutic targets in acute leukemia. Additionally, interleukin-7 may also modulate the response of leukemic cells arising from early B-cell stages to treatment.

Asparagine 232, valine 233, tyrosine 235, and glutamic acid 237 in the third extracellular domain (EL3) of the receptor are critical determinants of the host range difference between mice and humans. However, placing these residues in the human homolog confers only partial binding, indicating that other divergent sequences are involved. We sought to determine if the other sequences lie within or outside EL3. Here we report the identification of lysine 234 as another critical residue that influences virus binding and infection, as well as evidence that the unidentified sequences lie outside EL3. Each of the four basic residues in the third extracellular domain were changed to an acidic residue and initially examined in combination with a change at position 235 or position 237. Substitution of lysine 211, 215, or 222 combined with substitution of the critical tyrosine 235 or glutamic acid 237 did not affect virus infection. However, combined substitution of lysine 234, a conserved residue between mice and humans, and tyrosine 235 resulted in a marked decrease in virus infection and binding. A lysine 234 change alone reduced virus binding, contrary to previous observations that at least two of the other four residues must be changed before binding is reduced. Interestingly, there was no decrease in infection when lysine 234 was replaced in combination with glutamic acid 237. This result suggests that residue 234 may act by influencing the local structure of residues 233 to 235, whereas the presence of a glycine at position 236 may prevent this influence from extending to residue 237. With this report, the involvement of all the residues divergent between mice and humans in the third extracellular domain has been ruled out, suggesting that as yet unidentified determinants lie in other extracellular domains.","['Qian, Zhaohui', 'Donald, Robin', 'Wang, Hongzhe', 'Chen, Qianmin', 'Albritton, Lorraine M']","['Qian Z', 'Donald R', 'Wang H', 'Chen Q', 'Albritton LM']","['Department of Molecular Sciences, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee 38163, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Virus/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism']",2003/07/15 05:00,2003/08/20 05:00,['2003/07/15 05:00'],"['2003/07/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/15 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Aug;77(15):8596-601. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.15.8596-8601.2003.,,['10.1128/jvi.77.15.8596-8601.2003 [doi]'],,,"['R01 AI033410/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI33410/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,PMC165247,,,,,,,

Recently, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) were shown to require components of the cellular vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) machinery for efficient viral release. HIV-1 interacts with the VPS pathway via an association of HIV-1 Gag with TSG101, a component of the cellular complexes involved in VPS. Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is unique among enveloped viruses studied to date because it utilizes a novel motif, YPDL in Gag, as a late domain. Our analysis of EIAV assembly demonstrates that EIAV Gag release is blocked by inhibition of the VPS pathway. However, in contrast to HIV-1, EIAV Gag release is insensitive to TSG101 depletion and EIAV particles do not contain significant levels of TSG101. Finally, we demonstrate that fusing EIAV Gag directly with another cellular component of the VPS machinery, VPS28, can restore efficient release of an EIAV Gag late-domain mutant.

Here we describe the case of an elderly Italian woman, with no apparent risk factors, affected by a rapidly fatal ATLL who presented with an abdominal lymphomatous mass and circulating leukemic cells. The simultaneous presence of different T-cell clones in the tumor mass and in the blood was demonstrated by T-cell receptor gene rearrangement analysis and HTLV-1 integration pattern studies. After surgery, all the T-cell clones were present in the blood, indicating that tumor cells had spread from the mass.

We studied the relationship between hematopoietic chimerism and several prognostic variables on the outcome of SCT in patients with acute leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Chimerism was determined by a semiquantitative method, based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) minisatellites, in 133 consecutive patients who underwent allogeneic SCT for acute leukemia (68 myeloid, 58 lymphoid and 7 biphenotypic), all receiving a myeloablative conditioning regimen. RESULTS: The median follow-up for the surviving patients was 44.8 months (range: 12.0-129.0). Recipient hematopoiesis (mixed chimerism, MC) was detected in 40 cases (30.1%). Two types of patients could be distinguished in this MC group: 29 with increasing MC and 9 with decreasing MC. The remaining 93 cases maintained complete donor chimerism (CC) over the whole follow-up period. Patients with increasing MC showed a significantly higher (p<0.001) rate of relapse (93.1%) and death (89.7%) in comparison to both those with CC (26.9% relapse, 44.1% dead) or decreasing MC (11.1% relapse, 44.4% dead). The detection of increasing MC preceded relapse by a median of 74 days (range: 5-434) and was significantly related with the absence of chronic graft-versus-host disease. Univariate and multivariate analysis confirmed that chimerism was the most significant variable involved in relapse, leukemia-free survival and overall survival after SCT. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that sequential determination of chimerism allows the prediction of relapse and death after SCT for acute leukemia. The interval between detection of increasing MC and relapse may permit timely implementation of therapeutic measures.","['Barrios, Manuel', 'Jimenez-Velasco, Antonio', 'Roman-Gomez, Jose', 'Madrigal, Maria Elena', 'Castillejo, Juan Antonio', 'Torres, Antonio', 'Heiniger, Anabel']","['Barrios M', 'Jimenez-Velasco A', 'Roman-Gomez J', 'Madrigal ME', 'Castillejo JA', 'Torres A', 'Heiniger A']","['Hematology Department, Carlos Haya Hospital, Avda Carlos Haya, 29010 Malaga, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*diagnosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/07/15 05:00,2003/09/10 05:00,['2003/07/15 05:00'],"['2003/07/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/15 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Jul;88(7):801-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite its homogeneity at cellular level, B-CLL is clinically heterogeneous. Clinical studies indicate that CD38+ B-CLL are characterized by a more aggressive clinical course than are CD38- B-CLL. On the basis of these studies and considering the established correlation between specific chromosome aberrations and the clinical course of B-CLL, it is possible that CD38+ B-CLL cases are also characterized by specific subsets of chromosomal alterations. DESIGN AND METHODS: Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was performed on purified B-cells from peripheral blood of 52 patients with B-CLL in order to detect chromosome imbalance. The immunophenotype of the patients, including CD38 expression, was also determined by flow cytometry. The results of CGH experiments were then compared with CD38 expression. RESULTS: We found a clear correlation between the presence of chromosomal imbalances and CD38 expression: 13/16 CD38+ cases had chromosome imbalances, most of them (12/13) correlated with a poor prognosis. Among the CD38- B-CLL patients, only 8/36 displayed chromosome imbalances; the only three cases with loss in 13q as a single aberration, considered a good prognostic marker, were in this group. Moreover, we found that cytogenetic alterations were also more complex in the CD38+ B-CLL subset, since 9/10 with two or more aberrations were in the CD38+ group. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the data reinforce the value of CD38 as a prognostic factor and indicate that genotypic/phenotypic features distinguish B-CLL subsets.","['Ottaggio, Laura', 'Viaggi, Silvia', 'Zunino, Annalisa', 'Zupo, Simona', 'Rossi, Edoardo', 'Spriano, Mauro', 'Abbondandolo, Angelo', 'Ferrarini, Manlio']","['Ottaggio L', 'Viaggi S', 'Zunino A', 'Zupo S', 'Rossi E', 'Spriano M', 'Abbondandolo A', 'Ferrarini M']","['Mutagenesis Laboratory, National Cancer Research Institute, largo Rosanna Benzi 10, 16132 Genoa, Italy. laura.ottaggio@istge.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/*metabolism', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human/ultrastructure', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Prognosis']",2003/07/15 05:00,2003/09/10 05:00,['2003/07/15 05:00'],"['2003/07/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/15 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Jul;88(7):769-77.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This protein serves a complex role in cell cycling and is important in lymphopoiesis. We describe the immunologic findings in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia resistant to or intolerant of interferon (IFN) a who were treated with imatinib. This aspect could be of interest since patients with these characteristics may be exposed to this treatment for long periods. DESIGN AND METHODS: Immunologic and hematologic evaluation (including immunoglobulin levels and parameters of autoimmunity), immunophenotyping analysis of peripheral blood and bone marrow, and cytogenetic bone marrow analysis were performed at sequential time points of the treatment (0, 3, 6, and 9 and 12 months). The relationships among immunologic variables, and between the immunologic findings and response, were investigated. RESULTS: Hypogammaglobulinemia IgG, IgA and IgM developed in 28%, 14% and 22% of the patients, respectively. Lymphocyte counts decreased significantly along the treatment. No correlation was found between Ig levels and lymphocyte counts or CD4, CD8 or CD19 subpopulations in peripheral blood, nor between Ig levels and bone marrow B-lineage precursors. No autoimmune phenomena were detected. Hypogammaglobulinemia had no clinical repercussions in patients who developed it. The percentage reductions of IgG, IgA and IgM levels were higher in patients with major genetic response to imatinib. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Hypogammaglobulinemia can develop in as many as 20-25% of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia previously exposed to IFN a and who are then treated with imatinib. The reduction of Ig is greater in patients with a better cytogenetic response, perhaps reflecting that the efficacy of imatinib in blocking BCR-ABL kinase activity runs in parallel with ABL inhibition, leading to a dysregulation of B-lymphocyte function. Close immunologic evaluation is recommended in these patients.","['Steegmann, Juan Luis', 'Moreno, Gemma', 'Alaez, Concepcion', 'Osorio, Santiago', 'Granda, Asuncion', 'de la Camara, Rafael', 'Arranz, Eva', 'Reino, Fernando Gomez', 'Salvanes, Francisco Rodriguez', 'Fernandez-Ranada, Jose Maria', 'Munoz, Cecilia']","['Steegmann JL', 'Moreno G', 'Alaez C', 'Osorio S', 'Granda A', 'de la Camara R', 'Arranz E', 'Reino FG', 'Salvanes FR', 'Fernandez-Ranada JM', 'Munoz C']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain. jlsteegmann@wanadoo.es']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agammaglobulinemia/*etiology/immunology', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Autoimmunity', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoglobulins/blood', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/*drug therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/classification', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/07/15 05:00,2003/09/10 05:00,['2003/07/15 05:00'],"['2003/07/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/15 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Jul;88(7):762-8.,,,,,,,,['Haematologica. 2003 Jul;88(7):732.

T helper cells of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), analyzed as part of mononuclear cell fractions, show a loss of signaling molecules, a compromised Th1 cytokine production and a shift towards a non-productive Th2 state. The underlying mechanism is unknown and may involve intrinsic T cell defects as well as indirect effects mediated by leukemia or antigen-presenting cells. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the intrinsic cytokine-producing capacity of purified CML T helper cells in the absence of other cell types. DESIGN AND METHODS: Untouched CD4+ T cells with a purity of more than 90% were isolated from 10 patients with Ph+ chronic phase CML on maintenance treatment with hydroxyurea. The cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation followed by immunomagnetic depletion of leukemia and accessory cells. The ex vivo cytokine-producing capacity of CML T helper cells in response to polyclonal stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 was then compared to that of cells purified from matched healthy volunteers. RESULTS: T helper cells purified from CML patients produced comparable amounts of the Th1 cytokines interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon (IFN)-g as cells purified from healthy volunteers. Likewise, no difference between CML and control T helper cells was found with respect to the Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13, as well as the immunomodulatory cytokine, IL-10. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of leukemia and accessory cells, the intrinsic cytokine-producing capacity of CML T helper cells is normal. A Th2 shift was not detected, and the predominant presence of an IL-10-producing, immunosuppressive T helper cell subset could be excluded.","['Kiani, Alexander', 'Habermann, Ivonne', 'Schake, Knut', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Rogge, Lars', 'Ehninger, Gerhard']","['Kiani A', 'Habermann I', 'Schake K', 'Neubauer A', 'Rogge L', 'Ehninger G']","['Dept. of Medicine, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany. kiani@mk1.med.tu-dresden.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Th1 Cells/*immunology', 'Th2 Cells/*immunology']",2003/07/15 05:00,2003/09/10 05:00,['2003/07/15 05:00'],"['2003/07/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/15 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Jul;88(7):754-61.,,,,,,,,['Haematologica. 2003 Jul;88(7):732.

The incidence and main risk factors for symptomatic ON have been investigated in a large group of children treated with high-dose steroids, prednisone and dexamethasone for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). DESIGN AND METHODS: From May 1995 to December 1999, 1421 patients <18 years old, with newly diagnosed non-B ALL, were registered in the AIEOP-ALL 95 study. Their data were reviewed to identify patients who developed symptomatic ON. For those who were positively identified additional data were requested concerning ON-related symptoms, treatment and outcome. RESULTS: Overall, 15 of the 1421 patients developed symptomatic ON (1.1%) in a total of 29 sites. The estimated 5-year cumulative risk for clinically diagnosed ON was 1.6% (SE 0.4). The incidence was significantly higher among females (p=0.01) and older patients, with a peak rate of 7.4% (2.3) among those aged 10 to 17 years (p<0.0001). When the two factors, i.e. age and gender were combined, there was a striking increase in the risk among female patients aged 10 to 17 years. The median time between the diagnosis of ALL and that of ON was 17 months (range 8-45). The hip was the most frequently involved (19/29) site. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic ON occurred in only 1.1% of patients treated with BFM-type, intensive chemotherapy for childhood ALL. Female adolescents appear to be the subset of patients with the highest risk of ON, especially when categorized as having high risk leukemia and thus administered higher cumulative doses of dexamethasone.","['Arico, Maurizio', 'Boccalatte, Marie France Pinta', 'Silvestri, Daniela', 'Barisone, Elena', 'Messina, Chiara', 'Chiesa, Robert', 'Santoro, Nicola', 'Tamaro, Paolo', 'Lippi, Alma', 'Gallisai, Domenico', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'De Rossi, Giulio']","['Arico M', 'Boccalatte MF', 'Silvestri D', 'Barisone E', 'Messina C', 'Chiesa R', 'Santoro N', 'Tamaro P', 'Lippi A', 'Gallisai D', 'Basso G', 'De Rossi G']","['OncoEmatologia Pediatrica, Ospedale dei Bambini G.

Nevertheless, instability of these targets during the course of the disease has important implications for PCR-based MRD monitoring and may lead to false negative results. DESIGN AND METHODS: Several studies have shown that Ig and TCR targets are reasonably stable in ALL between diagnosis and first relapse, but up to now, there are no data on the stability of these targets between first and second relapse. We, therefore, performed a PCR-study on bone marrow samples from 49 children with precursor B-ALL at first and second relapse. Homo-heteroduplex PCR analyses were used for identification of clonal IGH, IGK-Kde, TCRG and TCRD gene rearrangements. Clonal targets were studied by sequencing and/or comparative homo-heteroduplex analysis. RESULTS: In 52% (25/48) of the patients, all PCR targets identified at first relapse were preserved at second relapse; in 92% (44/48) of the patients at least one target and in 73% (35/48) at least two targets remained stable. Best stability was found for IGH and TCRG gene rearrangements. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Based on these first data about clonal stability of Ig and TCR targets between first and second relapse of childhood precursor B-ALL, we developed a stepwise strategy for appropriate selection of stable PCR targets for MRD monitoring. This strategy was applicable in 84% of the relapsed patients and resulted in at least one stable MRD-PCR target per patient in 98% of these children.","['Guggemos, Andreas', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'Szczepanski, Tomasz', 'Hanel, Claudia', 'Taube, Tillmann', 'van der Velden, Vincent H J', 'Graf-Einsiedel, Hagen', 'Henze, Gunter', 'Seeger, Karlheinz']","['Guggemos A', 'Eckert C', 'Szczepanski T', 'Hanel C', 'Taube T', 'van der Velden VH', 'Graf-Einsiedel H', 'Henze G', 'Seeger K']","['Charite Medical Centre, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clone Cells', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/pathology']",2003/07/15 05:00,2003/09/10 05:00,['2003/07/15 05:00'],"['2003/07/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/15 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Jul;88(7):737-46.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the majority of patients lack HLA-identical sibling donors (SD), unrelated donor (UD) transplantation is performed increasingly. In this retrospective analysis, we have reviewed our experience with reduced-intensity conditioning regimens, comparing related and unrelated donors. From November, 1997, to February, 2002, 51 patients with hematological malignancies received allogeneic SCT after various RIC regimens. A total of 31 had a related donor, and the remaining 20 had an unrelated donor (UD). Both groups were comparable with respect to age and gender. We observed a trend toward higher rate of graft failure in the unrelated donor group with 11% compared to 3% in the related donor group (p = 0.55). The rate of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) II-IV was 36% in the RD group versus 44% for the UD group; severe GVHD III-IV occurred in 26% and 22%, respectively. There were more serious infections in the unrelated donor group with 25% compared to 16%. Transplant-related mortality was 13% (RD group) versus 30% (UD group). At 21 months, progression-free survival was 30% in both groups. The Kaplan Meier estimate of overall survival was 40% (RD) and 30% (UD group). In summary, we found no statistically significant difference regarding progression free and overall survival, despite a trend for more graft failure and increased transplant-related complications associated with the use of stem cells from unrelated donors.","['Hoepfner, Sabine', 'Goerner, Martin', 'Benner, Axel', 'Henning, Peter', 'Ho, Anthony D']","['Hoepfner S', 'Goerner M', 'Benner A', 'Henning P', 'Ho AD']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, Univeristy of Heidelberg, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Hematother Stem Cell Res,Journal of hematotherapy & stem cell research,100892915,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cause of Death', 'Family', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Living Donors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Siblings', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*physiology', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2003/07/15 05:00,2004/02/12 05:00,['2003/07/15 05:00'],"['2003/07/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/15 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Hematother Stem Cell Res. 2003 Jun;12(3):331-9. doi: 10.1089/152581603322023061.,,['10.1089/152581603322023061 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T cell depletion of the graft has decreased incidence and severity of GVHD but has resulted in a higher incidence of graft failure and relapse. To reduce the risk of severe GVHD, but at the same time to maintain the graft-versus-tumor effect, we administered a fixed low number of 1 x 10(5) donor T cells per kilogram of body weight to recipients of CD34(+) cell-enriched allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs). Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) were then given in incremental doses when mixed chimerism persisted or signs of relapse occurred. A total of 23 patients receiving allografts from related and unrelated donors were treated according to this protocol after myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning. One patient did not engraft and 3/20 evaluable patients developed acute (a) GVHD > or = grade II, with a corresponding estimated cumulative incidence of 15.6% (95% CI 0-30.5%). DLI (n = 13) induced aGVHD > or = II in 6 patients, but the severity of the syndrome was reduced. Overall GVHD-related mortality was low (13%). The probability of disease-free survival and overall survival at 2 years was 0.40 (95% CI 0.21-0.75) and 0.36 (95% CI 0.21-0.63). Progression-free survival and overall survival was significantly better in patients with acute or chronic myelogenous leukemia compared to patients with lymphoproliferative disorders (p = 0.002; p = 0.02). We conclude that the combination of allografts with a T cell content of about 1 x 10(5)/kg and escalating doses of DLI is a viable transplant strategy in patients with myeloid leukemias, which results in stable engraftment and a reduction of mortality from aGVHD.","['Goerner, Martin', 'Weber-Nordt, Renate', 'Hoepfner, Sabine', 'Benner, Axel', 'Luft, Thomas', 'Ho, A D']","['Goerner M', 'Weber-Nordt R', 'Hoepfner S', 'Benner A', 'Luft T', 'Ho AD']","['German Cancer Research Center, Clinical Cooperation Unit, Molecular Hematology/Oncology, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany. martin_goerner@med.uni-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Hematother Stem Cell Res,Journal of hematotherapy & stem cell research,100892915,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*blood', 'Antigens, CD34/*blood', 'CD3 Complex/*blood', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/classification/mortality/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/mortality/therapy', 'Mycophenolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', '*Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*physiology']",2003/07/15 05:00,2004/02/12 05:00,['2003/07/15 05:00'],"['2003/07/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/15 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Hematother Stem Cell Res. 2003 Jun;12(3):309-20. doi: 10.1089/152581603322023043.,,['10.1089/152581603322023043 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gab1 is tyrosine phosphorylated and associates with protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 and p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase on stimulation with various cytokines and growth factors, including interleukin-6. We previously demonstrated that interleukin-6-related cytokine, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), induced cardiac hypertrophy through gp130. In this study, we report the role of Gab1 in gp130-mediated cardiac hypertrophy. Stimulation with LIF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1, and phosphorylated Gab1 interacted with SHP2 and p85 in cultured cardiomyocytes. We constructed three kinds of adenovirus vectors, those carrying wild-type Gab1 (AdGab1WT), mutated Gab1 lacking SHP2 binding site (AdGab1F627/659), and beta-galactosidase (Adbeta-gal). Compared with cardiomyocytes infected with Adbeta-gal, longitudinal elongation of cardiomyocytes induced by LIF was enhanced in cardiomyocytes infected with AdGab1WT but inhibited in cardiomyocytes infected with AdGab1F627/659. Upregulation of BNP mRNA expression by LIF was evoked in cardiomyocytes infected with Adbeta-gal and AdGab1WT but not in cardiomyocytes infected with AdGab1F627/659. In contrast, Gab1 repressed skeletal alpha-actin mRNA expression through interaction with SHP2. Furthermore, activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) was enhanced in cardiomyocytes infected with AdGab1WT compared with cardiomyocytes infected with Adbeta-gal but repressed in cardiomyocytes infected with AdGab1F627/659. Coinfection of AdGab1WT with adenovirus vector carrying dominant-negative ERK5 abrogated longitudinal elongation of cardiomyocytes induced by LIF. Taken together, these findings indicate that Gab1-SHP2 interaction plays a crucial role in gp130-dependent longitudinal elongation of cardiomyoctes through activation of ERK5.","['Nakaoka, Yoshikazu', 'Nishida, Keigo', 'Fujio, Yasushi', 'Izumi, Masahiro', 'Terai, Kazuo', 'Oshima, Yuichi', 'Sugiyama, Shoko', 'Matsuda, Satoshi', 'Koyasu, Shigeo', 'Yamauchi-Takihara, Keiko', 'Hirano, Toshio', 'Kawase, Ichiro', 'Hirota, Hisao']","['Nakaoka Y', 'Nishida K', 'Fujio Y', 'Izumi M', 'Terai K', 'Oshima Y', 'Sugiyama S', 'Matsuda S', 'Koyasu S', 'Yamauchi-Takihara K', 'Hirano T', 'Kawase I', 'Hirota H']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-2, Yamadaoka, Suita City, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Circ Res,Circulation research,0047103,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Gab1 protein, rat)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Il6st protein, rat)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '114471-18-0 (Natriuretic Peptide, Brain)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '85637-73-6 (Atrial Natriuretic Factor)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 7)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, rat)']",IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Atrial Natriuretic Factor/genetics', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cardiomegaly/etiology/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 7', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Natriuretic Peptide, Brain', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Binding/drug effects/physiology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transfection']",2003/07/12 05:00,2003/09/25 05:00,['2003/07/12 05:00'],"['2003/07/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Circ Res. 2003 Aug 8;93(3):221-9. doi: 10.1161/01.RES.0000085562.48906.4A.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We have determined the activity spectrum of irofulven toward a human tumor cell panel comprised of 10 different tumor types in comparison with cisplatin and ET-743. We have also evaluated the influence of major resistance mechanisms, such as expression of multidrug resistance-associated drug efflux pumps, cisplatin resistance, loss of p53 function, and absence of mismatch repair on the cytotoxic activity of irofulven. RESULTS: The activity spectrum of irofulven is clearly different from that of ET-743 and cisplatin. Irofulven shows excellent cytotoxicity toward the majority of human carcinoma cell lines tested, but lesser activity toward sarcoma and leukemia cell lines. The cytotoxic activity of irofulven was particularly pronounced toward head and neck, non-small cell lung, colon, and ovary carcinoma cells, as well as toward malignant glioma cell lines. In addition, irofulven displayed good activity toward poorly differentiated, androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and cell lines expressing high levels of the detoxifying enzymes glutathione S-transferase and gamma-glutamyl cysteine synthetase. The cytotoxicity of irofulven was not affected by loss of p53 or mismatch repair function, and the drug was not a substrate for multidrug transporters, such as the P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance protein 1. CONCLUSIONS: Irofulven has an unusual activity spectrum with strong activity toward tumor cells of epithelial origin. Furthermore, irofulven is not or only marginally affected by resistance mechanisms limiting the efficacy of other alkylating agents.","['Poindessous, Virginie', 'Koeppel, Florence', 'Raymond, Eric', 'Comisso, Martine', 'Waters, Stephen J', 'Larsen, Annette K']","['Poindessous V', 'Koeppel F', 'Raymond E', 'Comisso M', 'Waters SJ', 'Larsen AK']","['Laboratory of Biology and Pharmacogenetics of Human Tumors, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique Unite Mixte de Recherche, Ecole Normale Superieure, Cachan and Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif 94805 cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Dioxoles)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Polycyclic Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Tetrahydroisoquinolines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '6B799IH05A (irofulven)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 6.3.2.2 (Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase)', 'EWJ0GY2H7X (illudin S)', 'ID0YZQ2TCP (Trabectedin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Dioxoles/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase/biosynthesis', 'Glutathione Transferase/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Models, Chemical', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'Polycyclic Sesquiterpenes', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Tetrahydroisoquinolines', 'Time Factors', 'Trabectedin', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism']",2003/07/12 05:00,2004/04/21 05:00,['2003/07/12 05:00'],"['2003/07/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Jul;9(7):2817-25.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CDDO-Im is highly active in suppressing cellular proliferation of human leukemia and breast cancer cell lines (IC(50), approximately 10-30 nM). In U937 leukemia cells, CDDO-Im also induces monocytic differentiation as measured by increased cell surface expression of CD11b and CD36. In each of these assays, CDDO-Im is several-fold more active than CDDO. Although CDDO and CDDO-Im both bind and transactivate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma, the irreversible PPARgamma antagonist GW9662 does not block the ability of either CDDO or CDDO-Im to induce differentiation; moreover, PPARgamma-null fibroblasts are still sensitive to the growth-suppressive effects of CDDO. Thus, CDDO-Im has significant actions independent of PPARgamma transactivation. In addition, the rexinoid LG100268 and the deltanoid ILX23-7553 (ILX7553) synergize with CDDO and CDDO-Im to induce differentiation. In vivo, CDDO-Im is a potent inhibitor of de novo inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in primary mouse macrophages.

Incorporation of membrane fusion capability into an oncolytic HSV, either by screening for a syncytial HSV mutant after random mutagenesis or by inserting a hyperfusogenic glycoprotein from gibbon ape leukemia virus into the viral genome, can significantly enhance the antitumor effects of the virus (X. Fu and X. Zhang, Cancer Res., 62: 2306-2312, 2002; X. Fu et al., Mol. Ther., in press, 2003). We reasoned that both fusogenic strategies, incorporated into a single oncolytic HSV, might significantly improve virotherapy for ovarian cancer. RESULTS: In vitro characterization of a doubly fusogenic oncolytic HSV (Synco-2D) showed that this virus produces a distinctive syncytial phenotype, leading to a significantly increased tumor cell killing ability, compared with that of a nonfusogenic virus. When injected directly into the abdominal cavity of mice bearing human ovarian cancer xenografts, Synco-2D eradicated all tumor masses in 75% of the animals, whereas no animals in the conventional oncolytic HSV-treated group were tumor free. CONCLUSIONS: This newly generated fusogenic oncolytic HSV is a promising candidate for clinical testing against advanced ovarian cancer.","['Nakamori, Mikihito', 'Fu, Xinping', 'Meng, Feng', 'Jin, Aiwu', 'Tao, Lihua', 'Bast, Robert C Jr', 'Zhang, Xiaoliu']","['Nakamori M', 'Fu X', 'Meng F', 'Jin A', 'Tao L', 'Bast RC Jr', 'Zhang X']","['Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,['0 (Glycoproteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Female', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Genome, Viral', 'Glycoproteins/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*pathology/*therapy', 'Phenotype', 'Simplexvirus/*genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Vero Cells']",2003/07/12 05:00,2004/04/21 05:00,['2003/07/12 05:00'],"['2003/07/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Jul;9(7):2727-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CD11a promoter directs CD11a/CD18 integrin expression, and its activity in lymphoid cells depends on a functional RUNX1/AML-1-binding site (AML-110) within the MS7 sequence. We now report that MS7 contains a C/EBP-binding site (C/EBP-100), which overlaps with AML-110 and is bound by C/EBP factors in myeloid cells. C/EBP and RUNX/AML factors compete for binding to their respective cognate elements and bind to the CD11a promoter MS7 sequence in a cell lineage- and differentiation-dependent manner. In myeloid cells MS7 is primarily recognized by C/EBP factors in proliferating cells whereas RUNX/AML factors (especially RUNX3/AML-2) bind to MS7 in differentiated cells. RUNX3/AML-2 binding to the CD11a promoter correlates with increased RUNX3/AML-2 protein levels and enhanced CD11a/CD18 cell surface expression. The relevance of the AML-110 element is underscored by the ability of AML-1/ETO to inhibit CD11a promoter activity, thus explaining the low CD11a/CD18 expression in t(8;21)-containing myeloid leukemia cells. Therefore, the expression of the CD11a/CD18 integrin in myeloid cells is determined through the differential occupancy of the CD11a proximal promoter by transcription factors implicated in the pathogenesis of myeloid leukemia.","['Puig-Kroger, Amaya', 'Sanchez-Elsner, Tilman', 'Ruiz, Natividad', 'Andreu, Enrique J', 'Prosper, Felipe', 'Jensen, Uffe B', 'Gil, Juana', 'Erickson, Paul', 'Drabkin, Harry', 'Groner, Yoram', 'Corbi, Angel L']","['Puig-Kroger A', 'Sanchez-Elsner T', 'Ruiz N', 'Andreu EJ', 'Prosper F', 'Jensen UB', 'Gil J', 'Erickson P', 'Drabkin H', 'Groner Y', 'Corbi AL']","['Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Velazquez 144, 28006 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CD11a Antigen)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/metabolism/physiology', 'CD11a Antigen/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Regulator/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Myeloid Cells/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism/*physiology']",2003/07/12 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/07/12 05:00'],"['2003/07/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Nov 1;102(9):3252-61. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-02-0618.

In these cell lines, both c-myc mRNA and c-Myc protein stability were not affected by GM-CSF and IL-3, suggesting a regulation of c-Myc protein at the translational level. However, rapamycin, an inhibitor of cap-dependent translation, did not block c-myc induction by GM-CSF and IL-3. Thus, we studied the cap-independent translation, the internal ribosome entry site (IRES), during c-Myc protein synthesis using dicistronic reporter gene plasmids and found that GM-CSF and IL-3 activated c-myc IRES to initiate translation. c-myc IRES activation, c-Myc protein expression, and cell cycle progression were all blocked by a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY294002. In another factor-dependent cell line, UT7, we observed the cell cycle progression and up-regulation of c-Myc protein, c-myc mRNA, and c-myc IRES simultaneously, which were all inhibited by LY294002. Results indicate that hematopoietic growth factors induce cell cycle progression via IRES-mediated translation of c-myc though the PI3K pathway in human factor-dependent leukemic cells.","['Kobayashi, Norihiko', 'Saeki, Kumiko', 'Yuo, Akira']","['Kobayashi N', 'Saeki K', 'Yuo A']","['Department of Hematology, Research Institute, International Medical Center of Japan, 1-21-1 Toyama, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 162-8655, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational/drug effects', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Ribosomes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2003/07/12 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/07/12 05:00'],"['2003/07/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Nov 1;102(9):3186-95. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-02-0567.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins play a central role in B-lymphocyte growth and function and are aberrantly phosphorylated on serine residues in CLL cells. To determine whether STAT transcription factors are important in Bryostatin 1-induced differentiation of CLL cells, primary CLL cells were examined for signaling events following exposure to Bryostatin 1 in vitro. Western analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that Bryostatin 1 induced tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding of STAT1, yet there was no effect on constitutive serine phosphorylation of STAT1. Bryostatin 1-induced STAT1 activation occurred in a manner that was dependent on protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) activation. Evidence indicates that Bryostatin 1 induces STAT1 activation through an interferon gamma (IFN gamma) autocrine loop. However, STAT1 activation by IFN gamma stimulation alone was not sufficient to induce differentiation. This insufficiency is due to the broader effect on gene expression caused by Bryostatin 1 compared with IFN gamma, as demonstrated by microarray analysis. Both up-regulation of CD22 expression and immunoglobulin M (IgM) production, markers of CLL differentiation, were inhibited by a decoy oligonucleotide for STAT1, indicating that STAT1 is necessary for Bryostatin 1-induced differentiation of CLL cells. This study implicates STAT transcription factors as important mediators of Bryostatin 1-induced differentiation of CLL cells and could possibly lead to improved therapeutic approaches for the treatment of CLL.","['Battle, Traci E', 'Frank, David A']","['Battle TE', 'Frank DA']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Lactones/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Models, Biological', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2003/07/12 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/07/12 05:00'],"['2003/07/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Oct 15;102(8):3016-24. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-09-2972.

Patients given nonmyeloablative conditioning were older than those given conventional conditioning (median ages, 53 vs 41 years; P =.001). The cumulative incidence of IPS was significantly lower at 120 days after nonmyeloablative conditioning than conventional conditioning (2.2% vs 8.4%; P =.003). In addition, greater patient age (older than 40 years), diagnosis of acute leukemia or myelodys-plastic syndrome, and severe acute graft-versus-host disease were associated with significantly increased risks for IPS. Among older patients (older than 40 years) given conventional conditioning, high-dose total body irradiation (TBI) was associated with an increased risk for IPS than were non-TBI-based regimens (16% vs 5.8%; P =.001). IPS occurred early after transplantation, progressed rapidly, and was associated with a high mortality rate (75%) despite aggressive support. Initiation of mechanical ventilation and the presence of renal insufficiency at IPS onset were associated with increased risks for death after IPS.

Furthermore, some B-CLL cells continue to acquire Ig V gene mutations after the transforming event. Because activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is an essential component of the canonical somatic hypermutation process in healthy B cells, its expression in B-CLL is potentially relevant to the disease. We detected full-length AID transcripts and 3 splice variants by conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in approximately 40% of the cases examined. More sensitive real-time quantitative PCR detected AID transcripts in virtually all B-CLL samples tested, although the range of transcript levels was very large between different cases and varied within individual cases over time. Limiting dilution assays revealed that AID expression was restricted to a small fraction of the leukemic cells in the blood. However, this small fraction is not unique in its ability to express AID, because in vitro stimulation of B-CLL cells with appropriate stimuli significantly increased the fraction of AID-expressing cells.

FA is genetically heterogeneous, however; the proteins encoded by different FA loci interact functionally with each other and with the BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM gene products. Although patients with FA are highly predisposed to the development of myeloid leukemia and solid tumors, the alterations in biochemical pathways responsible for the progression of tumorigenesis in these patients remain unknown. FA cells are hypersensitive to a range of genotoxic and cellular stresses that activate signaling pathways mediating apoptosis. Here we show that ionizing radiation (IR) induces modestly elevated levels of p53 in cells from FA type C (Fancc) mutant mice and that inactivation of Trp53 rescues tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced apoptosis in myeloid cells from Fancc-/- mice. Further, whereas Fancc-/- mice failed to form hematopoietic or solid malignancies, mice mutant at both Fancc and Trp53 developed tumors more rapidly than mice mutant at Trp53 alone. This shortened latency was associated with the appearance of tumor types that are found in patients with FA but not in mice mutant at Trp53 only. Collectively, these data demonstrate that p53 and Fancc interact functionally to regulate apoptosis and tumorigenesis in Fancc-deficient cells.","['Freie, Brian', 'Li, Xiaxin', 'Ciccone, Samantha L M', 'Nawa, Kathy', 'Cooper, Scott', 'Vogelweid, Catherine', 'Schantz, Laurel', 'Haneline, Laura S', 'Orazi, Attilio', 'Broxmeyer, Hal E', 'Lee, Suk-Hee', 'Clapp, D Wade']","['Freie B', 'Li X', 'Ciccone SL', 'Nawa K', 'Cooper S', 'Vogelweid C', 'Schantz L', 'Haneline LS', 'Orazi A', 'Broxmeyer HE', 'Lee SH', 'Clapp DW']","['Cancer Research Institute, 1044 W Walnut St, R4/408, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fancc protein, mouse)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Fanconi Anemia/complications/*pathology', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins', 'Fibroblasts/pathology', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Inheritance Patterns', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Neoplasms/*etiology/genetics/pathology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*physiology/radiation effects']",2003/07/12 05:00,2004/01/15 05:00,['2003/07/12 05:00'],"['2003/07/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Dec 1;102(12):4146-52. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-03-0971.

Here we show that cotreatment with mevalonate or geranylgeranyl moieties, but not farnesyl groups, rescued myeloma cells from lovastatin-induced apoptosis. In addition, the inhibition of geranylgeranylation by specific inhibition of geranylgeranyl transferase I (GGTase I) induced the apoptosis of myeloma cells. Apoptosis triggered by the inhibition of geranylgeranylation was associated with reduction of Mcl-1 protein expression, collapse of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, expression of the mitochondrial membrane protein 7A6, cytochrome c release from mitochondria into the cytosol, and stimulation of caspase-3 activity. These results imply that protein geranylgeranylation is critical for regulating myeloma tumor cell survival, possibly through regulating Mcl-1 expression.

Here, we describe a new model of an inducible BCR/ABL disease by directing the expression of the oncogene to megakaryocytic progenitor cells within the murine bone marrow using the tetracycline-responsive expression system under the control of human CD34 regulatory elements. The predominant feature was the development of a chronic thrombocytosis. The condition progressed with the development of splenomegaly accompanied by lymphadenopathy in some mice. Affected animals demonstrated a dramatic increase in the number of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow and the spleen. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the reporter gene was expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), common myeloid progenitor (CMP) cells, as well as in megakaryocytic/erythroid progenitor cells (MEPs). Although these mice did not display the increase in granulopoiesis commonly found in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the phenotype closely resembles a myeloproliferative disorder affecting the megakaryocytic lineage observed in some patients with the BCR/ABL P210 translocation.","['Huettner, Claudia S', 'Koschmieder, Steffen', 'Iwasaki, Hiromi', 'Iwasaki-Arai, Junko', 'Radomska, Hanna S', 'Akashi, Koichi', 'Tenen, Daniel G']","['Huettner CS', 'Koschmieder S', 'Iwasaki H', 'Iwasaki-Arai J', 'Radomska HS', 'Akashi K', 'Tenen DG']","['Harvard Institutes of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F8VB5M810T (Tetracycline)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Genes, Regulator/*physiology', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Diseases', 'Megakaryocytes/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Splenomegaly', 'Tetracycline/pharmacology', 'Thrombocytosis']",2003/07/12 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/07/12 05:00'],"['2003/07/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Nov 1;102(9):3363-70. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-03-0768.

The role of CNTF in mammalian development remains unknown. We recently reported the specific expression of CNTF in the pineal gland and eyes. To further examine the expression pattern and role of CNTF in development, we prepared a polyclonal antibody against rat CNTF, performed western blotting with this antibody, and confirmed a strong and specific expression of the CNTF protein in pineal glands and a moderate expression in the eyes among the various tissues examined in newborn rats. In pineal organ cultures of newborn rats, exogenously added recombinant rat CNTF potently inhibited the differentiation of photoreceptor-like cells in a dose-dependent manner, while CNTF did not influence the survival of pineal cells. Among several cell growth factors known to have a similar effect in retinal cultures examined, strong inhibitory effects were seen only with CNTF and the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), both of which belong to the IL-6 cytokine family. This inhibitory effect was the strongest during three to 6 days of culture when CNTF was added to these cultures. These results suggest that CNTF plays an inhibitory role in the development of photoreceptor-like cells in early postnatal rat pineal glands.","['Hata, Katsusuke', 'Araki, Masasuke', 'Yamamori, Tetsuo']","['Hata K', 'Araki M', 'Yamamori T']","['Laboratory for Speciation Mechanisms, National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki 444-8585, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Brain Res Dev Brain Res,Brain research.

In ALL pts the level of TNF-alpha positively correlated with blast cell count in peripheral blood (R = +0.432; P = 0.008); negatively correlated with percentages of S-phase leukemic cells (R = -0.446; P = 0.042) and culture-induced apoptotic cells (R = -0.411; P = 0.057).

No significant association of the level of TNF-alpha with treatment response at days 8 and 15 or 3-year overall survival was defined.

In the present study, a child with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) was given HDMP (30 mg/kg/day) orally in a single dose for the first 4 days of induction therapy. A marked decrease in peripheral blood blast cells and an increase in platelet count associated with a striking change in bone marrow (BM) morphology was observed following a short-course of HDMP treatment alone. BM cells developed distinct morphology characterized by cytoplasmic blebbing and some appeared as platelet producing micromegakaryocytes. Flow cytometric analysis of the BM cells 4 days after HDMP treatment demonstrated a decrease in the percentage of cells co-expressing CD34 and CD117 antigens and a marked increase in CD42a antigen. These changes in BM morphology and immunophenotype may suggest maturation effect of HDMP on megakaryocytic leukemic cells. In addition ultrastructural analysis of BM cells cultured with methylprednisolone (10(-3) and 10(-6) M) for 24 and 48 h showed numerous apoptotic cells. This was coincident with a significant increase in the percentage of annexin positive cells. These results suggest that HDMP treatment may induce differentiation and apoptosis of leukemic cells in a child with AMKL and it could be a promising agent for remission induction of patients with AMKL.","['Hicsonmez, Gonul', 'Cetin, Mualla', 'Okur, Hamza', 'Erdemli, Esra', 'Gurgey, Aytemiz']","['Hicsonmez G', 'Cetin M', 'Okur H', 'Erdemli E', 'Gurgey A']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Ihsan Dogramaci Children's Hospital, Hacettepe University, 06100, Ankara, Turkey. gsonmez@hacettepe.edu.tr""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/*therapeutic use', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/07/12 05:00,2003/10/24 05:00,['2003/07/12 05:00'],"['2003/07/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Jun;44(6):1037-42. doi: 10.1080/1042819031000067954.,,['10.1080/1042819031000067954 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In several IFN sensitive established cell lines, a rapid upregulation of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21 occurs following IFN-alpha treatment, and is thought to play a major role as an effector for this phenomenon by triggering further events. The aim of this study was to investigate how these previous findings in established cells lines correlate with clinical material. We therefore, analyzed how IFN-alpha influences the cell cycle distribution, by analysis of cellular DNA content, and the level of various cell cycle regulatory proteins by Western blot analysis, in primary leukemic cells. In 5 of 10 examined acute myeloid leukemia samples and in 1 of 6 chronic lymphocytic leukemia sample a clear increase in p21 protein levels was detected following treatment with IFN-alpha, while p21 protein levels were unaffected by IFN treatment in any of the examined acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples. In our total material consisting of 21 patient samples all other cell cycle regulatory proteins studied (p27, Cyclin E, Cdk2), were largely unaffected by IFN treatment. These results confirm that IFN-alpha can act as a potent regulator of Cdk-inhibitor expression, and that the induction of p21 seems to be a primary event in IFN-alpha mediated cell cycle regulation.","['Szeps, Michael', 'Erickson, Sven', 'Gruber, Astrid', 'Castro, Juan', 'Einhorn, Stefan', 'Grander, Dan']","['Szeps M', 'Erickson S', 'Gruber A', 'Castro J', 'Einhorn S', 'Grander D']","['Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Hospital and Institute, 171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/07/12 05:00,2003/10/24 05:00,['2003/07/12 05:00'],"['2003/07/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Jun;44(6):1019-25. doi: 10.1080/1042819031000077133.,,['10.1080/1042819031000077133 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of BTK protein and mRNA expression in the infant patient cells (N = 14) showed variable levels of BTK expression with the majority of samples having reduced to absent BTK expression. Sequence analysis of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) products of Btk mRNA from infant leukemia cells revealed the presence of aberrant transcripts. These Btk transcripts were characterized by either deletion of exon 16 (delta16) alone or deletion of both exons 15 and 16 (delta15 and 16). These deletions involve exact exon skipping and encode BTK proteins with either a deleted (delta16), or truncated (delta15 and 16) kinase domain. Extension of these Btk transcript sequencing studies to 15 pediatric B-lineage ALL patients revealed expression of exon 16 deleted Btk transcripts in several pediatric patients, however, none of these pediatric patients expressed transcripts with the exon 15 and 16 deletion. Both reduced expression of Btk message and expression of aberrant deleted Btk transcripts would contribute to reduced BTK protein expression and function in B-lineage leukemia cells. Since BTK is required for radiation induced apoptosis, reduced to absent expression of functional BTK in infant ALL cells could contribute to their radiation resistance.","['Goodman, Patricia A', 'Wood, Carla M', 'Vassilev, Alexei O', 'Mao, Chen', 'Uckun, Fatih M']","['Goodman PA', 'Wood CM', 'Vassilev AO', 'Mao C', 'Uckun FM']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Parker Hughes Institute, 2699 Patton Road, St. Paul, MN 55113, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Models, Molecular', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*genetics', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2003/07/12 05:00,2003/10/24 05:00,['2003/07/12 05:00'],"['2003/07/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Jun;44(6):1011-8. doi: 10.1080/1042819031000067576.,,['10.1080/1042819031000067576 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At McGill University, a combination of high dose VP-16 and cyclophosphamide (VP-CY) is commonly used as a salvage regimen. In recent years, cytogenetic abnormalities of the long arm of chromosome 11 at band 23 (11q23) have been linked to the use of VP-16, and may be associated with secondary myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukemia. Therapy related 11q23 anomalies have not been widely studied in lymphoma patients. We have identified and reviewed the course of 107 patients who have been treated with VP-CY. Thirty-five patients remain alive and 21 consented to participate in our study. Patient bone marrows were studied morphologically, cytogenetically and molecularly, to identify any new changes that may have developed over the course of their treatment, with a special emphasis on the search for 11q23 rearrangements. Mean time between VP-CY treatment and marrow evaluation was 3.6 years. Of the 21 patients, 5 had Hodgkin's disease (HD) and 16 had non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). They received a total of 30 cycles of VP-CY. Response rate was 100%, with 16 complete and 5 partial responses. Eighteen patients later underwent autologous stem cell transplantation. At the time of study, 19 of the patients were disease free and 2 were in relapse. On morphological analysis, 12 marrows appeared normal and 6 showed mild dyserythropoiesis. Standard cytogenetics was done to examine for any new chromosomal translocations or deletions. All cytogenetic studies yielded normal results. Molecular analysis by Southern blot was done on 15 patients in a search for 11q23 rearrangements, including the partial tandem duplication of ALL-1. All molecular studies were normal. We conclude that the use of VP-CY, given in our treatment schedule, does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of developing 11q23 rearrangements.","['Mangel, Joy', 'Duncan, Alessandra', 'Lachance, Silvy']","['Mangel J', 'Duncan A', 'Lachance S']","['Division of Hematology, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Que., Canada. joy.mangel@tsrcc.on.ca']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Exons', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Salvage Therapy']",2003/07/12 05:00,2003/10/24 05:00,['2003/07/12 05:00'],"['2003/07/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Jun;44(6):1001-9. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000046994.,,['10.1080/1042819021000046994 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study aimed to evaluate the relative contribution of expression of CD38 and/or myeloid-associated markers (CD11b, CD13, CD15 and CD33) by flow cytometry (FCM) on the clinical course of 24 B-CLL patients. B-CLL patients with high levels of CD38 expression, defined as greater than or equal to 30% of neoplastic lymphocytes expressing CD38, had a significantly poorer OS than those with low levels of CD38 expression (54% cumulative survival: 51 months vs. 103 months, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, p < 0.005, Logrank test). High levels of expression of myeloid-associated markers showed no statistically significant impact on OS in these patients. Ten of 11 patients (91%) with high levels of CD38 expression required chemotherapy. In contrast, only 5 of 13 patients (38%) with low levels of CD38 expression required chemotherapy (p < 0.009, Chi Square).

Twenty-five patients with previously untreated advanced stage indolent NHL were enrolled: follicular lymphoma, grade 1 (11 patients) and grade 2 (8 patients); small lymphocytic lymphoma (5 patients); and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (1 patient). All patients were treated as clinically indicated. The median age was 47 years (21-70). There were 15 males, and 10 females.

METHODS: Report of two cases. Case 1, a 62-year-old woman, developed bilateral optic neuritis with decreased sensation of vibration and increased deep tendon reflex in the lower extremities after a seven-month use of recombinant interferon alpha-2a for chronic active hepatitis C. Case 2, a 29-year-old woman, developed bilateral optic neuritis combined with numbness of the lower extremities as well as bowel and bladder dysfunction after a 22-month use of recombinant interferon alpha-2b for chronic myelogenous leukemia. After a two-month interruption of interferon administration, natural interferon alpha was given but followed by another episode of the same neurological manifestations. RESULTS: In both cases, magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated multiple small high-intensity areas in the cerebral white matter and spinal cord, while cerebrospinal fluid examination disclosed mononuclear cell increase and protein elevation including myelin basic protein, all of which simulated the features of multiple sclerosis. The two patients underwent several courses of pulse corticosteroid therapy, each course consisting of three days of methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily, resulting in visual recovery to some extent.

The pyrimidine analogue cytosine arabinoside (araC) is among the most effective agents used in the treatment of acute leukemia, and we demonstrate in this study that its chemotherapeutic activity may be mediated by its inhibition of NF-kappaB. We found that in Jurkat cells, although tumor necrosis factor (TNF), araC, or ceramide induced NF-kappaB, the induction was only transient in the case of araC. In both HuT-78 and serum-activated LPS-stimulated Jurkat (SA-LPS/Jkt) cells that expressed NF-kappaB, TNF or ceramide treatments did not affect the NF-kappaB expression whereas araC downregulated it. AraC, but not TNF or ceramide was able to induce apoptosis in these cells as detected by assays for lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen intermediates generation, caspase activation, cytotoxicity, Bcl-2 degradation, and DNA fragmentation. AraC also potentiated apoptosis mediated by cis-platin, etoposide, or taxol in these cells. AraC was able to induce protein phosphatases (PP) 2A and 2B-A, and phosphorylation of p65 subunit of NF-kappaB in the HuT-78 and SA-LPS/Jkt cells was downregulated by araC treatment. Furthermore, calyculin A, a specific phospho-serine/phospho-threonine phosphatase inhibitor, protected HuT-78 and SA-LPS/Jkt cells from araC-mediated NF-kappaB downregulation and apoptosis. These observations collectively suggest that araC induces apoptosis in NF-kappaB-expressing cells by dephosphorylating the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB.","['Sreenivasan, Yashin', 'Sarkar, Abira', 'Manna, Sunil K']","['Sreenivasan Y', 'Sarkar A', 'Manna SK']","['Laboratory of Immunology, Centre for DNA Fingerprinting & Diagnostics, Nacharam, Hyderabad 500 076, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Ceramides/pharmacology', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/biosynthesis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Transcription Factor RelA', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",2003/07/11 05:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2003/07/11 05:00'],"['2003/07/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/11 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Jul 10;22(28):4356-69. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206486.,,"['10.1038/sj.onc.1206486 [doi]', '1206486 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whilst tafluposide appeared to show weak (p<0.05) cross-resistance with the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), there did not appear to be any correlation with the effect of the topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan (p>0.05) in either hematological or solid malignancies. True synergism was identified when combining tafluposide with cisplatin in ovarian cancer [combination index (CI)=0.14, 0.79] and with etoposide in AML (CI=0.49, 0.63 and 0.78). Our results suggest that tafluposide is a strong candidate for inclusion in clinical trials, particularly in hematological malignancies.","['Sargent, Jean M', 'Elgie, Alena W', 'Williamson, Christine J', 'Hill, Bridget T']","['Sargent JM', 'Elgie AW', 'Williamson CJ', 'Hill BT']","['Haematology Research, Pembury Hospital, Pembury, UK. jean.sargent@btinternet.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Pyrans)', '0 (Topoisomerase Inhibitors)', 'QN043X3ZDW (tafluposide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Naphthalenes/*therapeutic use', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Pyrans/*therapeutic use', '*Topoisomerase Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/07/11 05:00,2003/11/06 05:00,['2003/07/11 05:00'],"['2003/07/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/11 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2003 Jul;14(6):467-73. doi: 10.1097/00001813-200307000-00013.,,['10.1097/00001813-200307000-00013 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An analysis of risk factors.,138-45,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To assess the risk of bleeding after percutaneous liver biopsy, we retrospectively analyzed 629 procedures with particular respect to patients with an increased a priori bleeding risk. METHODS: Factors possibly related to the risk of bleeding were analyzed by univariate analysis. Those variables which were significant in the univariate analysis were then entered into a forward conditional logistic regression model. RESULTS: Biopsy-related bleeding events defined as clinically overt complication (n = 10; 1.6%), an otherwise unexplained drop in serum hemoglobin concentration of greater than 2 g/dl (n = 45; 7.1%) or intra- or extrahepatic hematoma assessed by ultrasound (n = 17; 2.7%) were identified in 72 patients. 58% of the bleeding events occurred in patients with particular risk factors for bleeding. Biopsy-related mortality in the study cohort was 0.48%. Logistic regression analysis indicated mycobacterial infection [odds ratio (OR) 24.0], pre-biopsy prophylactic platelet substitution (OR 9.9), acute liver failure (OR 9.1), heparin administration on the day of biopsy (OR 8.7), advanced liver cirrhosis (OR 5.1), therapy with corticosteroids (OR 3.5) or metamizole (OR 2.8) and leukemia or lymphoma (OR 2.8) as significant (p < or = 0.05) independent risk factors. Delayed bleeding (>24 h after biopsy) was identified in 70% of the bleeding events. CONCLUSIONS: In our study cohort which comprised a high proportion of patients with particular risk factors for bleeding, biopsy-related bleeding occurred more frequently and later than commonly observed and was associated with only a few prognostic factors. Considering these predictors before liver biopsy will aid to reduce the rate of bleeding complications.","['Terjung, Birgit', 'Lemnitzer, Isabelle', 'Dumoulin, Franz Ludwig', 'Effenberger, Wolfgang', 'Brackmann, Hans Hermann', 'Sauerbruch, Tilman', 'Spengler, Ulrich']","['Terjung B', 'Lemnitzer I', 'Dumoulin FL', 'Effenberger W', 'Brackmann HH', 'Sauerbruch T', 'Spengler U']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Digestion,Digestion,0150472,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liver/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Hemorrhage/*etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2003/07/11 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/07/11 05:00'],"['2002/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2003/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/07/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/11 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Digestion. 2003;67(3):138-45. doi: 10.1159/000071293.,"['Copyright 2003 S.

However, curative therapy is usually a challenge to the physicians treating this disease. Several publications are available discussing the efficacy of steroids, cyclophosphamide and cyclosporin A. Recently, a report of the successful use of rituximab was also published. However, the use of cyclosporin A is controversial in the case of B cell malignancies, as there are reports showing the cytotoxic effect of this drug on B cells. However, other authors report no effect, or even unwanted effects resulting in B cell proliferation. We report the case of a 50-year-old Caucasian male. He developed a B cell lymphoma consisting of CD5/CD20-double-positive cells, and 2 months later, it was followed by a very severe paraneoplastic pemphigus affecting the mucosa and the skin. The lymphoma was well managed with CHOP and CVP polychemotherapy, followed by oral chlorambucil; however, the bullous eruptions did not disappear. Oral steroids, cyclophosphamide, plasmapheresis and IVIG therapy were only partially successful, so we decided to use oral cyclosporin A. Starting with 7 mg/kg and maintaining a steady plasma level of no less then 110 ng/l, the bullae completely disappeared within 6 weeks, and the patient has been in remission for 17 months now, taking the oral cyclosporin A continuously. The underlying B cell disorder did not relapse during the therapy.","['Gergely, Lajos', 'Varoczy, Laszlo', 'Vadasz, Gyorgyi', 'Remenyik, Eva', 'Illes, Arpad']","['Gergely L', 'Varoczy L', 'Vadasz G', 'Remenyik E', 'Illes A']","['3rd Department of Medicine, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary. gergely@iiibel.dote.hu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)', 'CHOP protocol', 'COP protocol 2']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cyclosporine/*therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/etiology/therapy', 'Pemphigus/*drug therapy/etiology/therapy', 'Plasma Exchange', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2003/07/11 05:00,2003/08/27 05:00,['2003/07/11 05:00'],"['2002/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2003/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/07/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/11 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2003;109(4):202-5. doi: 10.1159/000070972.,"['Copyright 2003 S.

To evaluate the lineage-restricted MCh more explicitly in 10 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a quantitative analysis was performed on bone marrow biopsies following a sex-mismatched host/donor constellation. Techniques included immunophenotyping (antiglycophorin C, CD61) for the identification of erythro- and megakaryopoiesis and a simultaneously conducted genotyping with x- and y-chromosome-specific DNA probes. Normal bone marrow and specimens taken before BMT served as controls. Contrasting a total gender-dependent sex-typing in the latter samples in the early and late posttransplant period (up to 586 days), 3-9% erythroid precursors and about 16% megakaryocytes revealed a host-type origin. This significantly higher number of host megakaryocytes is explained by their polyploidy generating an increased probability to detect positive signals at a certain section level of the corresponding biopsies. A striking conversion of MCh to a recipient cell type was found in leukemic relapse with a more than 90% host-derived erythroid and megakaryocytic cell population in 4 patients approximately 643 days after BMT.","['Thiele, J', 'Wickenhauser, C', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Varus, E', 'Schneider, C', 'Muller, H', 'Beelen, D W']","['Thiele J', 'Wickenhauser C', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Varus E', 'Schneider C', 'Muller H', 'Beelen DW']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany. j.thiele@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,['0 (Integrin beta3)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Examination', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Survival', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/chemistry/*cytology', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Integrin beta3/analysis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/chemistry/*cytology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/*pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Chromosomes', 'Tissue Donors', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation Conditioning', '*Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/07/11 05:00,2003/08/27 05:00,['2003/07/11 05:00'],"['2002/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2002/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/07/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/11 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2003;109(4):176-83. doi: 10.1159/000070966.,"['Copyright 2003 S.

Here, we report a strategy to hinder mitochondrial electron transport and increase superoxide O2. radical generation in human leukemia cells as a novel mechanism to enhance apoptosis induced by anticancer agents. This strategy was first tested in a proof-of-principle study using rotenone, a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial electron transport complex I. Partial inhibition of mitochondrial respiration enhances electron leakage from the transport chain, leading to an increase in O2. generation and sensitization of the leukemia cells to anticancer agents whose action involve free radical generation. Using leukemia cells with genetic alterations in mitochondrial DNA and biochemical approaches, we further demonstrated that As2O3, a clinically active anti-leukemia agent, inhibits mitochondrial respiratory function, increases free radical generation, and enhances the activity of another O2.-generating agent against cultured leukemia cells and primary leukemia cells isolated from patients. Our study shows that interfering mitochondrial respiration is a novel mechanism by which As2O3 increases generation of free radicals.

The aim of this study was to determine the two distinct antiapoptotic signals-survivin and aven-in acute leukemias and compare them with clinical and hematological findings and response to therapy. Real-time quantitative PCR was used and survivin and aven were detected at the messenger (m)RNA level. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-five patients with acute leukemia [37 with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and 28 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)] were used as the study group and 10 healthy subjects were used as the control group. RESULTS: Survivin was between 0.0 and 0.829 copy number/cell (median 0.0721, mean 0.5424301909 +/- 0.139799488589) and aven was between 0.0 and 0.853 copy number/cell (median 0.0124, mean 0.070335542 +/- 0.1524685709). We found an important association between survivin and aven (P = 0.000). Both survivin and aven were higher in the study group than in the controls (P = 0.001 and 0.035, respectively). When we compared survivin and aven with other clinical and hematological parameters, there was an important association between survivin and extramedullary involvement (P = 0.033), survivin and alkaline phosphatase (P = 0.06), white blood cell (WBC) count and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P = 0.000), WBC count and uric acid (P = 0.074), hemoglobin level and LDH (P = 0.072), LDH and uric acid (P = 0.057), CD7 expression and survivin (P = 0.097), and CD34 expression and aven (P = 0.058). Response to therapy was evaluated according to the survivin and aven levels. Survivin level was lower in refractory patients as compared with complete responders (P = 0.085). Aven level was higher in patients with relapse as compared with non-relapse patients (P = 0.04). There was no important association between survivin or aven and performance status, lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. CONCLUSIONS: Both survivin and aven are important antiapoptotic signals in acute leukemias, and the association between extramedullary involvement, CD7 expression and CD34 expression, which are important poor prognostic indicators in acute leukemias, suggests that survivin and/or aven may be novel prognostic indicators in acute leukemias. Further studies with a higher number of patients will be more informative.","['Paydas, S', 'Tanriverdi, K', 'Yavuz, S', 'Disel, U', 'Sahin, B', 'Burgut, R']","['Paydas S', 'Tanriverdi K', 'Yavuz S', 'Disel U', 'Sahin B', 'Burgut R']","['Department of Oncology, Cukurova University Faculty of Medicine, Adana, Turkey. sepay@cu.edu.tr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, CD7/biosynthesis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Prognosis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survivin']",2003/07/11 05:00,2003/11/13 05:00,['2003/07/11 05:00'],"['2003/07/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/11 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2003 Jul;14(7):1045-50. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdg277.,,"['10.1093/annonc/mdg277 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(20)30996-0 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that murine leukemia virus (MLV) RNAs are transported on lysosomes and transferrin-positive endosomes. Transport on transferrin-positive vesicles requires both Gag and Env polyproteins. In the presence of Env, Gag is rerouted from lysosomes to transferrin-positive endosomes, and virion production becomes highly sensitive to drugs poisoning vesicular and endosomal traffic. Vesicular transport of the RNA does not require prior endocytosis, indicating that it is recruited directly from the cytosol. Viral prebudding complexes containing Env, Gag, and retroviral RNAs are thus formed on endosomes, and subsequently routed to the plasma membrane. This may allow retroviruses to hijack the endosomal machinery as part of their biosynthetic pathway. More generally, tethering to vesicles may provide an efficient mechanism for directed RNA transport.","['Basyuk, Eugenia', 'Galli, Thierry', 'Mougel, Marylene', 'Blanchard, Jean-Marie', 'Sitbon, Marc', 'Bertrand, Edouard']","['Basyuk E', 'Galli T', 'Mougel M', 'Blanchard JM', 'Sitbon M', 'Bertrand E']","['IGMM-CNRS UMR5535, Universite Montpellier II, IFR 24, 1919, route de Mende, 34293 Cedex 5, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dev Cell,Developmental cell,101120028,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Endocytosis', 'Endosomes/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, env/metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",2003/07/11 05:00,2003/09/03 05:00,['2003/07/11 05:00'],"['2003/07/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/11 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Dev Cell. 2003 Jul;5(1):161-74. doi: 10.1016/s1534-5807(03)00188-6.,,"['S1534-5807(03)00188-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s1534-5807(03)00188-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The probes were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence dyes individually, hybridized with cDNA microarray representing 1003 different human genes, and their fluorescent intensities were scanned. The genes were screened through the analysis of the difference in two gene expression profiles. RESULTS: The analysis of gene expression profiles indicated that after the treatment of arsenic trioxide (0.5 micromol/L) 3 genes were up-regulated, among which, PSMB6 gene was involved in proteasome degradation pathway, and 18 genes related to RNA processing, protein synthesis, and signal transduction were down-regulated.

The 3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzylidene analogue 9h was found to be the most active compound (IC(50) K562: 20 nM). Structure-activity relationships are also considered. The highly active compound 9h and the 2,4-dimethoxy-3-hydroxybenzylidene analogue 9l were tested against five tumor cell lines using the XTT assay, including multidrug resistant phenotypes. Induction of cell death in a variety of tumor cell lines was determined in a monolayer assay using propidium iodide. Noteworthy, all compounds within the series induced elongations in K562 cells similar to vinblastine-treated cells. The effect of the lead compound 9h on K562 cell growth was associated with cell cycle arrest in G2/M. Concentrations for 50% KB/HeLa cells arrested in G2/M after treatment with 9h and 9l were determined and found to be in the range of 0.2 microM. Additionally, we monitored the dose dependent caspase-3-like protease activity in K562 cells and MCF-7/Casp-3 cells treated with 9h, indicating induction of apoptosis. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that 9h caused a shift in tubulin concentration from the polymerized state found in the cell pellet to the unpolymerized state found in the cell supernatant. Seven compounds strongly inhibited tubulin polymerization with activities higher or comparable to those of the reference compounds such as colchicine, podophyllotoxin, and nocodazole. In general, the antiproliferative activity correlated with inhibition of tubulin polymerization. The most active compounds strongly displaced [(3)H]colchicine from its binding site in the tubulin, yielding IC(50) values 3- to 4-fold lower than that of colchicine.

The most comprehensive epidemiologic study is of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors and their children, which found little evidence for inherited defects attributable to parental radiation. Studies of workers exposed to occupational radiation or of populations exposed to environmental radiation appear too small and exposures too low to convincingly detect inherited genetic damage. In contrast, survivors of childhood cancer form the largest group of people exposed to high doses of ionizing radiation before reproduction and offer unique advantages for studying trans-generation effects. A wide range of gonadal doses are possible, several comparison groups are readily available (including siblings), and there is a strong willingness among cancer survivors to participate in health studies. Cancer patients also have detailed medical records that facilitate both the accurate estimation of gonadal doses and the assessment of potentially confounding factors, such as intercurrent illness, personal and family medical histories, lifestyle characteristics such as tobacco use, and circumstances at delivery. An international study is nearing completion of over 25,000 survivors of childhood cancer in the United States and Denmark who gave birth to or fathered over 6,000 children. Doses to gonads are being reconstructed from radiotherapy records with 46% over 100 mSv and 16% over 1,000 mSv. Adverse pregnancy outcomes being evaluated include major congenital malformations, cytogenetic abnormalities, stillbirths, miscarriages, neonatal deaths, total deaths, leukemia and childhood cancers, altered sex ratio, and birth weight. The main analyses are based on dose-response evaluations. Blood studies of trios (cancer survivor, spouse or partner and offspring) have been initiated to evaluate mechanistic evidence for the transmission of any radiation-induced genetic damage such as minisatellite mutations. Markers of cancer susceptibility such as chromosomal radiosensitivity and genotype profile will also be examined. In the United States series to date, 4,214 children were born to cancer survivors among whom 157 (3.7%) genetic diseases were reported in contrast to 95 (4.1%) reported conditions among 2,339 children born to sibling controls. In the Denmark series the comparable figures were 82 (6.1%) birth defects among 1,345 children of cancer survivors and 211 (5.0%) among 4,225 children of sibling controls. Coupled with prior studies, these preliminary findings, if sustained by ongoing dose-response analyses, provide reassurance that cancer treatments including radiotherapy do not carry much if any risk for inherited genetic disease in offspring conceived after exposure.","['Boice, John D Jr', 'Tawn, E Janet', 'Winther, Jeanette F', 'Donaldson, Sarah S', 'Green, Daniel M', 'Mertens, Ann C', 'Mulvihill, John J', 'Olsen, Jorgen H', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Stovall, Marilyn']","['Boice JD Jr', 'Tawn EJ', 'Winther JF', 'Donaldson SS', 'Green DM', 'Mertens AC', 'Mulvihill JJ', 'Olsen JH', 'Robison LL', 'Stovall M']","['International Epidemiology Institute, 1455 Research Blvd. Ste 550, Rockville, MD 20850, USA. boicej@compuserve.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,,IM,"['Abnormalities, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure/adverse effects', 'Neoplasms/radiotherapy', 'Paternal Exposure/adverse effects', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome/*genetics', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Radiometry/methods', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Risk Factors', '*Survivors']",2003/07/11 05:00,2003/09/26 05:00,['2003/07/11 05:00'],"['2003/07/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/11 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Health Phys. 2003 Jul;85(1):65-80. doi: 10.1097/00004032-200307000-00013.,,['10.1097/00004032-200307000-00013 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Possible causal mechanisms for leukemias are environmental factors such as ionizing radiation from x rays and inherited susceptibility from polymorphisms in DNA repair genes. We performed a case-control study of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia measuring reported postnatal x rays in 701 cases aged 0-14 y and in as many population-based controls matched on age and sex. In addition we performed a case-only study in 207 cases to evaluate the interaction between x ray exposure and polymorphisms in DNA repair genes. There was an increase in risk of leukemia with number of x rays: the adjusted odds ratio for two or more x rays vs. none was 1.48 (95% confidence interval: 1.11-1.97). That risk was slightly higher among girls (odds ratio = 1.67). A polymorphism in the APE gene (ex 5) involved in the base excision repair system was suggestive of an increased risk among boys and a reduced risk among girls. HMLH1 (ex 8), a mismatch repair gene, was associated with reduction of risk among girls. Results from the genetic data are still preliminary and must be interpreted with caution especially because of the relatively small number of genotyped cases.

Of the approximately 3 mSv annual global per caput effective dose estimated for the year 2000, 2.4 mSv is from natural background and 0.4 mSv from diagnostic medical exams. Diagnostic and therapeutic radiation was used in patients as early as 1896. Since then, continual improvements in diagnostic imaging and radiotherapy as well as the aging of our population have led to greater use of medical radiation. Temporal trends indicate that worldwide population exposure from medical radiation is increasing. In the United States, there has been a steady rise in the use of diagnostic radiologic procedures, especially x rays. Radiotherapy also has increased so that today about 40% of cancer patients receive some treatment with radiation. Epidemiologic data on medically irradiated populations are an important complement to the atomic-bomb survivors' studies. Significant improvement in cancer treatment over the last few decades has resulted in longer survival and a growing number of radiation-related second cancers. Following high-dose radiotherapy for malignant diseases, elevated risks of a variety of radiation-related second cancers have been observed. Risks have been particularly high following treatment for childhood cancer. Radiation treatment for benign disease was relatively common from the 1940's to the 1960's. While these treatments generally were effective, some resulted in enhanced cancer risks. As more was learned about radiation-associated cancer risks and new treatments became available, the use of radiotherapy for benign disease has declined. At moderate doses, such as those used to treat benign diseases, radiation-related cancers occur in or near the radiation field. Cancers of the thyroid, salivary gland, central nervous system, skin, and breast as well as leukemia have been associated with radiotherapy for tinea capitis, enlarged tonsils or thymus gland, other benign conditions of the head and neck, or benign breast diseases. Because doses from diagnostic examinations typically are low, they are difficult to study using epidemiologic methods, unless multiple examinations are performed. An excess risk of breast cancer has been reported among women with tuberculosis who had multiple chest fluoroscopies as well as among scoliosis patients who had frequent diagnostic x rays during late childhood and adolescence. Dental and medical diagnostic x rays performed many years ago, when doses were presumed to be high, also have been linked to increased cancer risks. The carcinogenic effects of diagnostic and therapeutic radionuclides are less well characterized. High risks of liver cancer and leukemia have been demonstrated following thorotrast injections, and patients treated with radium appear to have an elevated risk of bone sarcomas and possibly cancers of the breast, liver, kidney, thyroid, and bladder.","['Ron, Elaine']",['Ron E'],"['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, EPS 7048, 6120 Executive Boulevard, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. eron@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,['0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)'],IM,"['Humans', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiography/*statistics & numerical data', 'Radiometry/methods', 'Radionuclide Imaging/*statistics & numerical data', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/therapeutic use', 'Radiotherapy/*statistics & numerical data', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Risk Factors']",2003/07/11 05:00,2003/09/26 05:00,['2003/07/11 05:00'],"['2003/07/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/11 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Health Phys. 2003 Jul;85(1):47-59. doi: 10.1097/00004032-200307000-00011.,,['10.1097/00004032-200307000-00011 [doi]'],,,,96,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, chemotherapy agents have proven effective in the adjuvant treatment of solid tumors, such as osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, transitional cell carcinoma, and others. Unfortunately, chemotherapy resistance in these situations is the most significant cause of treatment failure. Therefore, the ability to predict, treat, or circumvent resistance is extremely likely to improve clinical outcomes. This article has reviewed the most widely investigated forms of chemotherapy resistance, such as reduced drug accumulation, increased DNA damage repair, decreased apoptosis, and others; however, new mechanisms are being found at an alarming pace. In addition, investigations to date have routinely centered on single-cell mechanisms of drug resistance, and cancer is truly a three dimensional disease. The elucidation of mechanisms surrounding (1) how tumors interact with their normal microenvironment, (2) how tumors interact in a three-dimensional environment, and (3) a better understanding of basic tumor physiology and biology may supersede in importance those previously elucidated single-cell mechanisms of chemoresistance.","['Bergman, Philip J']",['Bergman PJ'],"['Donaldson-Atwood Cancer Clinic, Flaherty Comparative Oncology Laboratory, Animal Medical Center, 510 East 62nd Street, New York, NY 10021, USA. philip.bergman@amcny.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Vet Clin North Am Small Anim Pract,The Veterinary clinics of North America.

B-CLL is an example of human malignancy caused by alternations in the pathways of programmed cell death--apoptosis. Recent investigations showed a probable role of apoptosis as a prognostic parameter in B-CLL patients. Since the introduction of chlorambucil in the therapy in 1952, besides all the achievements in modern oncology, chlorambucil remained the most common antineoplastic agent in the treatment of CLL. Numerous experimental studies, both in vitro and in vivo, showed the capability of antineoplastic agents to induce the process of apoptosis of neoplastically transformed cells. In this study the effect of chlorambucil on B lymphocytes was monitored in 16 samples of peripheral blood taken from B-CLL diagnosed patients. According to the investigations performed in this study by ultrastructure analysis of B-CLL cells, it was concluded that chlorambucil either induced apoptosis in B-CLL cells, or activated cell response to the stress.","['Brajuskovic, Goran', 'Marjanovic, Slobodan', 'Skaro-Milic, Andelija']","['Brajuskovic G', 'Marjanovic S', 'Skaro-Milic A']","['Vojnomedicinska akademija, ZPSM-Institut za patologiju, Beograd.']",['srp'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Serbia,Vojnosanit Pregl,Vojnosanitetski pregled,21530700R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*ultrastructure', 'Chlorambucil/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy', 'Microscopy, Electron']",2003/07/11 05:00,2003/07/26 05:00,['2003/07/11 05:00'],"['2003/07/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/11 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vojnosanit Pregl. 2003 Mar-Apr;60(2):175-80. doi: 10.2298/vsp0302175b.,,['10.2298/vsp0302175b [doi]'],,,,,,,,Dejstvo hlorambucila na limfocite B periferne krvi bolesnika sa hronicnom limfocitnom leukemijom--ispitivanje ultrastrukture celija.,,,,,,,,,

A current study shows that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a homologue of OSM, can prevent photoreceptor cell death when expressed in the lens of transgenic mice. We determined the efforts of lens-specific overexpression of OSM on the development of eye. METHODS: A truncated mouse OSM cDNA (-660 bp) was linked to the alpha A-crytallin promoter, and injected into single-cell embryos with microinjection. Then, transgenic mice were established. The mRNA expression of transgene OSM was detected by in situ hybridization. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of syntaxin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), synaptophysin in the retinas of transgenic mice. RESULTS: At embryonic day (E 17.5), the expression of the syntaxin at the inner and mid portion of the retinas of transgenic mice was much higher than that of the retinas of non-transgenic mice. The expression of GFAP was detected in the retinas of transgenic mice, while no expression in non-transgenic normal FVB (FVB/N) mice was detected in this stage. At postnatal day one (P1), the expression of synaptophysin was detected in the retinas of transgenic mice, but there was no such expression in FVB/N mice.

The effects of proteasome inhibitors on cell cycle progression, cell growth, and apoptosis were determined. METHODS: MTT-assay was used to examine the cytotoxicity, and annexin-V staining to quantify apoptosis. Cell cycle analyses were performed using 7-ADD and Ki-67 staining by flow cytometry. RESULTS: PSI was the most potent proteasome inhibitor among those tested with a half maximal cytotoxicity (IC(50)) of 5.7 nM, followed by MG-262, MG-132, and lactacystin. Growth inhibition occurred irrespective of chromosome 13 status. Cell cycle arrest occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Low, subapoptotic dosages led to a partial loss of Ki-67 antigen, whereas apoptotic dosages led to reduced Ki-67 levels. Apoptosis was partially dependent on activation of caspase-3, since Ac-DEVD-cho, a caspase-3 inhibitor, could reduce apoptosis significantly. The cytotoxicity of the four proteasome inhibitors tested was significantly lower in human hematopoietic stem cells than in myeloma cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that proteasome inhibitors induce time- and dose-dependent cell cycle alterations, growth inhibition, and apoptosis in human myeloma cells irrespective of chromosome 13 deletion.","['Zavrski, Ivana', 'Naujokat, Cord', 'Niemoller, Kathrin', 'Jakob, Christian', 'Heider, Ulrike', 'Langelotz, Corinna', 'Fleissner, Claudia', 'Eucker, Jan', 'Possinger, Kurt', 'Sezer, Orhan']","['Zavrski I', 'Naujokat C', 'Niemoller K', 'Jakob C', 'Heider U', 'Langelotz C', 'Fleissner C', 'Eucker J', 'Possinger K', 'Sezer O']","['Department of Oncology and Hematology, Universitatsklinikum Charite, Humboldt-Universitat Berlin, 10098, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 7', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/*physiology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Multiple Myeloma/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/07/10 05:00,2003/12/12 05:00,['2003/07/10 05:00'],"['2003/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2003/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/07/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2003 Jul;129(7):383-91. doi: 10.1007/s00432-003-0454-6.

In the current study, we have examined the expression and activation of mitochondrial calpain in Jurkat T leukemia cells, MCF-7 breast carcinoma and LNCaP prostate cancer cells during apoptosis induced by an anticancer drug (VP-16, tamoxifen) or the specific p38 kinase inhibitor PD-169316.

In contrast, there were no correlations observed between the early calpain activation and changes in levels of mitochondrial calpain large subunit and the endogenous calpain inhibitor calpastatin. Furthermore, pretreatment with the specific pharmacological calpain inhibitor calpeptin blocked the drug-induced calpain small subunit autolysis and calpain activation in mitochondria and inhibited apoptosis-associated caspase-3 activation, demonstrating that mitochondrial calpain activation through small subunit cleavage is an essential step for inducing tumor cell apoptosis by various anticancer drugs.","['Daniel, Kenyon G', 'Anderson, Johnathan S', 'Zhong, Qing', 'Kazi, Aslamuzzaman', 'Gupta, Puja', 'Dou, Q Ping']","['Daniel KG', 'Anderson JS', 'Zhong Q', 'Kazi A', 'Gupta P', 'Dou QP']","['Drug Discovery Program, H.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have been detected in the MDR1 gene. The C3435T polymorphism in this gene seems to have functional and clinical consequences. In the present investigation, we have analyzed the role of the C3435T SNP for drug resistance and prognosis of human ALL. The C3435T SNP was analyzed in 20 T-ALL cell lines and in blood samples from 53 ALL patients and 7 healthy donors. The cell line panel consisted of cell lines not prior exposed in vitro to cytostatic drugs as well as of drug-resistant lines which were selected in vitro by exposure to doxorubicin, vincristine, methotrexate, or hydroxyurea. We have developed a highly sensitive matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS)-based genotyping approach to survey the C3435T SNP. Furthermore, mRNA expression was determined by real time reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction and doxorubicin sensitivity by a growth inhibition assay. Surprisingly, we did not find a significant correlation between C3435T homo- or heterozygote genotypes and MDR1 mRNA expression of cell lines or blood samples from patients and healthy donors. Furthermore, there was no relationship between the response of the cell lines to doxorubicin and the C3435T genotypes. Homo- or heterozygosity did not correlate to survival of patients in the Kaplan-Meier analysis. In conclusion, we do not have reason to assume that the C3435T SNP contributes to drug resistance of ALL and prognosis of ALL patients.","['Efferth, Thomas', 'Sauerbrey, Axel', 'Steinbach, Daniel', 'Gebhart, Erich', 'Drexler, Hans-Gunther', 'Miyachi, Hayato', 'Chitambar, Christopher R', 'Becker, Cord-Michael', 'Zintl, Felix', 'Humeny, Andreas']","['Efferth T', 'Sauerbrey A', 'Steinbach D', 'Gebhart E', 'Drexler HG', 'Miyachi H', 'Chitambar CR', 'Becker CM', 'Zintl F', 'Humeny A']","['Virtual Campus Rhineland-Palatinate, D-55126 Mainz, Germany. thomas.efferth@web.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'AIEOP acute lymphoblastic leukemia protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Genes, MDR/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/pharmacology']",2003/07/10 05:00,2004/03/05 05:00,['2003/07/10 05:00'],"['2003/07/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2003 Aug;23(2):509-17.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown to up-regulate the expression of MMP-9 in vascular smooth muscle cells. We recently reported that hemoglobin (Hb) enhances the expression of tissue factor (TF) and VEGF on TF-positive human malignant cells. Therefore, to explore the relationship between tumor cell angiogenic protein VEGF and MMP-9, we studied the effect of Hb on MMP-9 production in human A375 malignant melanoma and J82 bladder carcinoma (TF+) cells and in KG1 myeloid leukemia (TF-) cells. Malignant cells were incubated with varying concentrations (0-1.0 mg/ml) of Hb and analyzed for released MMP-9 by gelatin zymography, dot immunoblotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blotting. Hb (0.50 mg/ml) induced an almost two-fold increase of MMP-9 in both A375 malignant melanoma (398 +/- 62 versus 233 +/- 61.0 ng/ml, P = 0.027) and J82 bladder carcinoma cells (1.55 +/- 0.12 versus 0.80 +/- 0.004 ng/ml, P = 0.004), compared with cells incubated without Hb. This release of MMP-9 was significantly inhibited by cycloheximide (95%) and by the specific inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinase, genistein (70 +/- 3.0%, P = 0.00027 and 67 +/- 1.0%, P = 0.00005) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP)-kinase, PD98059 (56 +/- 2.0%, P = 0.0001 and 62 +/- 1.0%, P = 0.00003) in A375 and J82 cells, respectively. In contrast, Hb (2.0 mg/ml) did not increase MMP-9 in KG1 cells. We conclude that Hb-induced synthesis of active MMP-9 in TF-bearing malignant cells is due to de novo synthesis of newly formed protein and is mediated by protein tyrosine kinase and by mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.","['Siddiqui, Farooq A', 'Siddiqui, Tazeen F', 'Francis, John L']","['Siddiqui FA', 'Siddiqui TF', 'Francis JL']","['Center for Hemostasis and Thrombosis, Clinical and Research Laboratories, Florida Hospital Cancer Institute, Orlando, USA. farooq.siddiqui@flhosp.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis,Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis,9102551,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Carcinoma/pathology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Genistein/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/physiology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Melanoma/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/pathology']",2003/07/10 05:00,2004/04/16 05:00,['2003/07/10 05:00'],"['2003/07/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis. 2003 Jul;14(5):449-55. doi: 10.1097/00001721-200307000-00004.,,['10.1097/00001721-200307000-00004 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that ATO induces apoptosis in myeloma cells in two different modes depending on p53 status in the cells. In cells expressing mutated p53, ATO induced, G2/M arrest and activation caspase 8 and 3 and rapid and extensive apoptosis. Myeloma cells expressing w.t. p53, ATO induced G1 arrest and delayed apoptosis with activation of caspase 9 and 3. APO2/TRAIL receptor expression was induced in both cell types and APO2/TRAIL synergized with ATO in the induction of apoptosis. Here we tested the effect of ATO on mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in myeloma cells expressing mutated or w.t. p53. In myeloma cells expressing mutated p53, depolarization of MMP occurred early, concomitant with induction of APO2/TRAIL, activation of BID and release of AIF, preceding apoptosis. However, in cells expressing w.t. p53, APO2/TRAIL is not induced, BID is not cleaved and depolarization of MMP occurs concurrently with cytochrome c release and apoptosis. These results explain the greater sensitivity to ATO of cells with mutated p53 and suggest perhaps a general mechanism for ATO-induced apoptosis.","['Akay, Cagla', 'Gazitt, Yair']","['Akay C', 'Gazitt Y']","['Department of Medicine/Hematology, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, Texas 78284, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (AIFM1 protein, human)', '0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Flavoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Flavoproteins/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, p53/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/physiology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Oxides/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2003/07/10 05:00,2004/05/12 05:00,['2003/07/10 05:00'],"['2003/07/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2003 Jul-Aug;2(4):358-68.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their synthesis is increased during cellular stress by p53-mediated activation of transcription. Overexpression of these isoforms induces apoptosis, suggesting an involvement of TP53INP1s in p53-mediated cell death. It was recently shown that p53-dependent apoptosis is promoted by homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 (HIPK2), which is known to bind p53 and induce its phosphorylation in promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). In this work we show that TP53INP1s localize with p53, PML-IV, and HIPK2 into the PML-NBs. In addition, we show that TP53INP1s interact physically with HIPK2 and p53. In agreement with these results we demonstrate that TP53INP1s, in association with HIPK2, regulate p53 transcriptional activity on p21, mdm2, pig3, and bax promoters. Furthermore, TP53INP1s overexpression induces G1 arrest and increases p53-mediated apoptosis. Although a TP53INP1s and HIPK2 additive effect was observed on apoptosis, G1 arrest was weaker when HIPK2 was transfected together with TP53INP1.

Remission induction in these patients is often hindered by drug resistance. Thus, intensifying chemotherapy strategies are required. Application of hyperthermia enhances efficacy of certain anti-neoplastic drugs such as ifosfamide. In this study, effects and molecular mechanisms of ifosfamide - and hyperthermia-induced apoptosis are investigated in a B cell precursor leukaemia cell line (REH) and in primary patient-derived B cell progenitor leukaemic blasts. Both 4OOH-IFA and hyperthermia are able to induce cell death in leukaemic cells, mainly by induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis. However, completely different kinetics of caspase-3, -8 and -9 activation are found for both stimuli. In addition, activation of caspase-1 is only observed following stimulation with hyperthermia. Combined application of ifosfamide and hyperthermia reveals increased cytotoxicity in both the leukaemia cell line and in 5/8 of the patient-derived leukaemic blast samples. In conclusion, hyperthermia and ifosfamide mediate cytotoxicity in B precursor leukaemic blasts by different kinetics of caspase activation. This might explain the additive effects of 4OOH-IFA and heat on leukaemic cell death. Therefore, whole body thermochemotherapy could be considered as a treatment option in relapsed leukaemic patients.","['Mauz-Korholz, C', 'Dietzsch, S', 'Banning, U', 'Trobs, R-B', 'Korholz, D']","['Mauz-Korholz C', 'Dietzsch S', 'Banning U', 'Trobs RB', 'Korholz D']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Oststr 21-25, D-04317 Leipzig, Germany. mauc@medizin.uni-leipzig.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Hyperthermia,"International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",8508395,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '39800-28-7 (hydroperoxyisophosphamide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Intracellular Membranes/enzymology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/enzymology/*physiopathology', 'Precancerous Conditions/*physiopathology']",2003/07/10 05:00,2004/02/11 05:00,['2003/07/10 05:00'],"['2003/07/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hyperthermia. 2003 Jul-Aug;19(4):444-60. doi: 10.1080/0265673031000063864.,,"['10.1080/0265673031000063864 [doi]', 'WQ8MKPG1V80UVAK5 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the soluble hepatocyte growth factor (sHGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (sVEGF) levels in newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and to correlate these levels with the clinico-pathological features. Sixty-three patients with AML and 15 normal controls were included in this study. The levels of sHGF and sVEGF were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay at diagnosis and after remission induction chemotherapy. Our results revealed significantly increased plasma levels of sHGF and sVEGF at diagnosis when compared to both control and remission levels (P=0.000 for both). The sHGF and sVEGF levels differed between AML FAB subtypes (P=0.000). The highest concentrations were found in M5 followed by M4. SHGF and sVEGF were directly correlated with peripheral white cell counts (WBC) (r=0.836, P=0.000, r=0.718; P=0.000, respectively), but inversely correlated with blast cell distribution ratio (BCDR) (r=-0.785, P=0.000, r=-0.664, P=0.000, respectively). Moreover, both sHGF and sVEGF levels were significantly elevated in AML patients with extra-medullary infiltration as compared to those without (P=0.000, 0.006, respectively). The sHGF but not sVEGF levels were significantly elevated in patients who died compared to those who relapsed and to patients in complete remission (P=0.02, 0.08, respectively). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the sHGF level at diagnoses is a powerful predictor of the patient outcome, compared to sVEGF. IN CONCLUSION: our data support the hypothesis that angiogenic factors play a functional role in blast cell movement from the bone marrow to peripheral tissues. Assessment of sHGF at AML diagnosis is likely to be helpful in predicting patient outcome and selecting optimal therapeutic regimen.","['Aref, S', 'Mabed, M', 'Sakrana, M', 'Goda, T', 'El-Sherbiny, M']","['Aref S', 'Mabed M', 'Sakrana M', 'Goda T', 'El-Sherbiny M']","['Clinical Pathology Department, Hematology Unit, Mansoura Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*blood', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/*blood', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/diagnosis/mortality', 'Lymphokines/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Solubility', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2003/07/10 05:00,2003/08/09 05:00,['2003/07/10 05:00'],"['2003/07/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2002 Oct;7(5):273-9. doi: 10.1080/1024533021000037207.,,"['10.1080/1024533021000037207 [doi]', 'XVU7N7MX8ULE4JV3 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the last 3 decades there has been a marked improvement in survival, with 5-year survival rates approaching 80%. With this improvement in survival, increasing attention is now being focused on issues relating to long-term morbidity and mortality associated with the treatments responsible for that increased survival. Because of the young age of these cancer survivors, and thus the potential longevity, the delayed consequences of therapy may have a significant impact on their lives. Long-term sequelae of treatment, such as impaired intellectual and psychomotor functioning, neuroendocrine abnormalities, impaired reproductive capacity, cardiotoxicity, and second malignant neoplasms, are now being reported with increasing frequency in this growing cohort of survivors and knowledge of the late -effects associated with cancer in children and adolescents continues to increase through ongoing research efforts. However, much of the available information relates to outcomes within the first decade following treatment, although information about the longer term outcomes that may occur later in adulthood is emerging as a result of well-conducted, large cohort studies. Through a multi-disciplinary approach to the diagnosis, treatment, and long-term follow-up of pediatric leukemia patients, we can achieve the goal of cure while minimizing the occurrence of long-term adverse outcomes.

ELISPOT assay, cytokine flow cytometry, and tetramer binding were recently compared by us in the context of monitoring of a dendritic cell-based multi-peptide vaccination trial in patients with metastatic melanoma. These single-cell assays were not found to be concordant in measurements of the frequency of peptide-specific T cells or in detecting pre- to post-vaccine changes in the frequency of these T cells. Implications of the results for monitoring of genetically modified vaccines are discussed, and the plan for a rational approach to monitoring and for selection of monitoring assays is proposed. Monitoring of human gene therapy or vaccination trials in patients with advanced cancers, who are often immunocompromised and thus poorly responsive, is a challenge.

Pre-clinical evaluation of this approach in murine models has demonstrated efficient anti-leukemic responses with the expression of immunomodulators, in particular GM-CSF and CD80, in irradiated cell vaccines. We have previously shown efficient insertion of GM-CSF and CD80 genes into primary human leukemia cells with the use of second and third generation self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vectors (Blood 96 (2000), 1317; Leukemia 16 (2002), 1645). The advantages of lentiviral vectors for development of autologous leukemia cell vaccines include: (1) efficient and consistent gene delivery; (2) high levels of transgene expression; (3) persistent expression of the transduced gene; (4) no viral proteins, as only the transduced gene is expressed; (5) no undesirable cytotoxic effects, and; (6) simplicity of use [leukemia cells are exposed to vector(s) only once]. In this work, we evaluated the insertion of the central polypurine tract and the central termination sequence into a SIN lentiviral vector encoding for GM-CSF and CD80, which significantly enhanced the transduction efficiency of primary leukemia cells and provided higher levels of GM-CSF and CD80 co-expression. We also demonstrate a methodology to deliver simultaneously a combination of immunomodulatory molecules (GM-CSF, CD80, IL-4, and CD40L) to activate different pathways of immune stimulation. Therefore, lentiviral vectors offer a simple, versatile, and reliable approach for engineering leukemic cells for use as cell vaccines.","['Stripecke, Renata', 'Koya, Richard C', 'Ta, Huy Q', 'Kasahara, Nori', 'Levine, Alexandra M']","['Stripecke R', 'Koya RC', 'Ta HQ', 'Kasahara N', 'Levine AM']","['Institute for Genetic Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA. stripeck@usc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*administration & dosage/genetics', 'B7-1 Antigen/genetics', 'CD40 Ligand/administration & dosage/genetics', 'Drug Combinations', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/administration & dosage/genetics', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/*therapy', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2003/07/10 05:00,2004/05/01 05:00,['2003/07/10 05:00'],"['2003/07/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/01 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2003 Jul-Aug;31(1):28-37. doi: 10.1016/s1079-9796(03)00062-7.,,"['S1079979603000627 [pii]', '10.1016/s1079-9796(03)00062-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and Akt kinase are constitutively active in the chronic phase of CML, blast crisis of CML, and the CML-derived K562 cell line. Both interferon-alpha and STI571 suppressed ERK1/2 activity in K562 cells. In contrast, Akt kinase activity was inhibited only by STI571. K562 cell proliferation was markedly suppressed by LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI3K/Akt kinase, and STI571 but not by PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK1/2. In addition, caspase-3 was activated by treatment of cells with STI571 and LY294002 but not with PD98059. These data indicate that Akt kinase may play a role in the proliferation of CML leukemia cells and the action of STI571. Primary leukemia cells from patients with CML blast crisis did not show inhibition of ERK1/2 or Akt kinase activity and were resistant to caspase-3-associated apoptosis after treatment with STI571. These findings suggest that STI571 does not effectively block signaling molecules downstream of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase in some cases of CML blast crisis.","['Kawauchi, Kiyotaka', 'Ogasawara, Toshie', 'Yasuyama, Masako', 'Ohkawa, Shin ichiro']","['Kawauchi K', 'Ogasawara T', 'Yasuyama M', 'Ohkawa Si']","[""Department of Medicine, Tokyo Women's Medical University Daini Hospital, 2-1-10 Nishiogu, Arakawa-ku, 116-8567, Tokyo, Japan.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/*etiology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/07/10 05:00,2004/05/01 05:00,['2003/07/10 05:00'],"['2003/07/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/01 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2003 Jul-Aug;31(1):11-7. doi: 10.1016/s1079-9796(03)00070-6.,,"['S1079979603000706 [pii]', '10.1016/s1079-9796(03)00070-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although conventional chemotherapy induces clinical remissions in most patients with AML, recurrent leukemia represents the major obstacle to cure. Conventional chemotherapy reinduction is associated with limited efficacy and substantial toxicity. Chemotherapy specifically targeted to leukemic cells by monoclonal antibodies might enable patients to achieve remissions more safely than conventional approaches. After evaluating a series of phase II studies, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) for the treatment of patients with CD33-positive AML in first relapse who are 60 years of age or older and who are not considered candidates for other types of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Among 277 adult patients with CD33-positive AML in first relapse, 26% experienced an overall response after Mylotarg monotherapy. Despite the fact that myelosuppression, hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated hepatic transaminases were commonly observed, the incidences of severe infections and mucositis were relatively low in comparison with conventional chemotherapeutic treatment. Preliminary reports in pediatric patients also report Mylotarg to be reasonably well tolerated. Recently, data from study regimens combining Mylotarg and conventional chemotherapy suggest an unusually high remission induction rate in de novo AML patients.

A deletion of the untranslocated TEL was observed in 36.3% of the ALL with the TEL-AML1 fusion. The coexpression of myelocytic and B-lymphoid antigens was found in 3 of the 11 of TEL-AML1 fusion positive-ALL. Our results (frequency of TEL-AML1 fusion in children and of the deletion of the untranslocated TEL allele, mean age of the patients and white blood cell count) are within the range observed by others. Structural chromosomal abnormalities other than the t(12;21) are frequent and may play a role in the prognosis of these patients.","['Douet-Guilbert, Nathalie', 'Morel, Frederic', 'Le Bris, Marie Josee', 'Herry, Angele', 'Le Calvez, Genevieve', 'Marion, Veronique', 'Abgrall, Jean Francois', 'Berthou, Christian', 'De Braekeleer, Marc']","['Douet-Guilbert N', 'Morel F', 'Le Bris MJ', 'Herry A', 'Le Calvez G', 'Marion V', 'Abgrall JF', 'Berthou C', 'De Braekeleer M']","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Institut d'Hematologie et de Cancerologie, CHU Morvan, Brest, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics']",2003/07/10 05:00,2003/08/13 05:00,['2003/07/10 05:00'],"['2003/07/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2003 Jul 15;144(2):143-7. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(02)00932-9.,,"['S0165460802009329 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(02)00932-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Golub et al. study acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We used a simulated annealing-based method in learning a system of perceptrons, each obtained by resampling of the training set. Our results are comparable to those of Khan et al. and Golub et al., indicating that there is a role for perceptrons in the classification of tumours based on gene-expression data. We also show that it is critical to perform feature selection in this type of models, i.e. we propose a method for identifying genes that might be significant for the particular tumour types. For SRBCTs, zero error on test data has been obtained for only 13 out of 2308 genes; for the ALL/AML problem, we have zero error for 9 out of 7129 genes that are used for the classification procedure.

We purified and characterized two proteins from mouse leukemic splenocytes that interact with IDE and inhibit its insulin-degrading activity. A protein of 14 kDa was similar to a competitive IDE inhibitor reported previously. The major inhibitor was identified by amino acid sequencing as ubiquitin, a protein that is post-translationally covalently attached to other intracellular proteins and regulates diverse cellular processes. Ubiquitin inhibited insulin-degrading activity of IDE and diminished crosslinking of 125I-insulin to IDE in a specific, concentration-dependent, reversible, and ATP-independent manner. Ubiquitin did not affect the crosslinking of 125I-insulin to insulin receptors or of 125I-atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) to its receptor guanylate cyclase-A.

A retrospective multicentric study was conducted over a five-year period to evaluate the clinical and laboratory characteristics and outcome of patients with proven Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) complicating hematologic malignancies.Results. The study included 60 HIV-negative patients with 18 non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphoma (30%), 13 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (21.7%), 10 acute leukemia (16.6%), 5 multiple myeloma (8.3%), 4 Waldenstrom's diseases (6.6%), 4 chronic myeloid leukemia (6.6%), 3 myelodysplasia (5%), 2 Hodgkin's diseases (3.3%) and 1 thrombopenia. Bronchoalveolar lavage was diagnostic in all patients. Forty-nine patients received cytotoxic drugs (81.7%), 25 (41.7%) a long-term corticotherapy and 15 (25%) underwent bone marrow transplantation. Twenty-seven patients (45%) required admission in the intensive care unit, 35 (58.3%) received an adjunctive corticotherapy and 18 mechanical ventilation (30%). Twenty patients (33.3%) died of PCP. A previous long-term corticotherapy (p=0.04), high respiratory (p=0.05) and pulse rates (p=0.02), elevated C reactive protein (p=0.01) and mechanical ventilation (OR=13.37; IC: 1.9-50) were associated with a poor prognosis. Adjunctive corticotherapy did not modify the prognosis.Conclusions. These results suggest that PCP can occur during the course of various hematologic malignancies, not only lymphoproliferative disorders. Prognosis remains poor. The diagnosis should be advocated more frequently and earlier to improve the prognosis.","['Roblot, F', 'Le Moal, G', 'Godet, C', 'Hutin, P', 'Texereau, M', 'Boyer, E', 'Prazuck, T', 'Lacroix, C', 'Souala, M Faouzi', 'Raffi, F', 'Weinbreck, P', 'Besnier, J M', 'Garo, B', 'de Gentile, L', 'Becq-Giraudon, B']","['Roblot F', 'Le Moal G', 'Godet C', 'Hutin P', 'Texereau M', 'Boyer E', 'Prazuck T', 'Lacroix C', 'Souala MF', 'Raffi F', 'Weinbreck P', 'Besnier JM', 'Garo B', 'de Gentile L', 'Becq-Giraudon B']","['Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Poitiers, France. f.roblot@chu-poitiers.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,J Infect,The Journal of infection,7908424,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/*complications/*epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",2003/07/10 05:00,2003/10/28 05:00,['2003/07/10 05:00'],"['2003/07/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Infect. 2003 Jul;47(1):19-27. doi: 10.1016/s0163-4453(03)00038-0.,,"['S0163445303000380 [pii]', '10.1016/s0163-4453(03)00038-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Donor and acceptor template homology facilitates both replicative and recombinogenic transfers, but homology-independent determinants may also contribute. Here, improved murine leukemia virus-based assays were established and the effects of varying extents of mismatches and complementarity between primer and acceptor template regions were assessed. Template switch accuracy was addressed by examining provirus structures, and efficiency was measured using a competitive titer assay. The results demonstrated that limited mismatch extension occurred readily during both minus and plus strand transfer. A strong bias for correct targeting to the U3/R junction and against use of alternate regions of homology was observed during minus strand transfer. Transfer to the U3/R junction was as accurate with five bases of complementarity as it was with an intact R, and as few as 3nt targeted transfer to a limited extent. In contrast, 12 base recombinogenic acceptors were utilized poorly and no accurate switch was observed when recombination acceptors retained only five bases of complementarity. These findings confirm that murine leukemia virus replicative and recombinogenic template switches differ in homology requirements, and support the notion that factors other than primer-template complementarity may contribute to strong stop acceptor template recognition.","['Marr, Sharon Fodor', 'Telesnitsky, Alice']","['Marr SF', 'Telesnitsky A']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Michigan Medical School, 2 Medical Center Drive, 5641 Medical Sciences Bldg., Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0620, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,,IM,"['*Base Pair Mismatch', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Repair', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/genetics', '*Virus Replication']",2003/07/10 05:00,2003/08/07 05:00,['2003/07/10 05:00'],"['2003/07/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2003 Jul 18;330(4):657-74. doi: 10.1016/s0022-2836(03)00597-7.,,"['S0022283603005977 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-2836(03)00597-7 [doi]']",,,"['R01 CA069300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA069300-06A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA069300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA69300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,PMC7173232,,,,,,,

Moreover, the produced data are so many that their full interpretation needs an expert; often these new parameters are not exploited. The new challenge of the hematology laboratory consists in the translation of numerical data and new parameters into clinical meaningful information also offering, when possible, a pre-diagnostic guideline, maintaining similar high quality level also in these new aspects. METHODS: Since the first development of automated cytochemistry for leukocyte differential count, a new efficient pre-microscopic approach to leukemia diagnosis and classification, was made possible at the time of the automated blood cell count. This original method, used by the Bayer hematological H* series and ADVIA120 analyzers, is based on a light assessment of basic cell properties: volume and peroxidase activity (P) in the Perox channel, which is used to differentiate the main leukocyte types according to the different enzyme content and Nuclear density (ND) in the basophil channel, which is used to count basophils and blast cells according the chromatin pattern and to flag the presence of abnormal or immature cells. The simple observation of P and ND two-dimensional cytograms can be used to include any single case in a separate and distinct diagnostic category correlated to FAB and WHO classifications of hematological malignancies. Moreover, on the RBC map, it is possible to obtain some information about the pathological cluster. The simultaneous observation of these three cytograms and the introduction of a simple and quick score provide objective informations on blast lineage, level of myeloid differentiation, chronic versus acute leukemias. Using a simple visual score system, we have reached in a previous study a pre-diagnostic efficiency in 91% of the analyzed samples. ADVIA120 provides cytogram cell distribution at the end of the analytical processes that include the evaluation of 492 signals, the so-called raw data. The working hypothesis is to create a knowledge-based system, an Artificial Neural Network able to directly handle these raw-data for producing classes of diagnostic probability with a high level of efficiency. The Bayer R&D team in Tarrytown has created an ANN software for connecting a set of input data to output through weighted ""hidden layers"" (i) assessing the 84 ADVIA120 parameter sets to be used, (ii) defining the interim analysis tool for fitting to standard ""normal archetypes"", (iii) finding a discriminant function normal vs. pathological. We have collected from 22 Italian hematological centers data from peripheral blood of 1000 patients having mainly hematopoietic disorders at diagnosis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The ANN has been trained with labeled samples. Same analysis has been performed for constructing the ""pathological archetypes"". Finally, we have tested the ANN model with a small selected set of the collected pathological samples. The preliminary encouraging results show the high capability of this ANN of clustering signals according to the pre-defined normal as well as pathological archetypes. The next big step is to create an application for discriminating different types of anemia, simply using data from patient's peripheral blood.","['Zini, Gina', ""d'Onofrio, Giuseppe""]","['Zini G', ""d'Onofrio G""]","['Researcher Center for Clinical Evaluation of Automated Method in Hematology, Hematology Department, Catholic University of Sacred Heart, Policlinico Gemelli, Laboratorio di Ematologia, L.go A.

The 7H9D6 antibody bound to the hyaluronic acid binding domain of CD44 and inhibited cell adhesion to immobilized hyaluronic acid. However, the expression of the 7H9D6 epitope was not sufficient for hyaluronic acid binding. Immunofluorescent staining with 7H9D6 revealed a punctate surface staining pattern, suggesting that CD44 molecules recognized by 7H9D6 are located in clusters on the cell surface. In contrast, other CD44 antibodies produced a uniform staining pattern. Early bone marrow B cells were negative for 7H9D6 but reactive with other CD44 monoclonal antibodies. In contrast, leukaemic cells from 65% of patients (28 of 43) with B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia bound 7H9D6. Patients expressing the 7H9D6 epitope on their leukaemic cells had an increased risk of death (HR 3.5 95% CI 1.1-10.9, P = 0.029) and of disease relapse (HR 3.2 95% CI 1.2-8.5, P = 0.017) when corrected for white cell count.

Recent studies pointed out the need to obtain normal residual levels of IgG (i.e. 8 g/L) in order to reduce the number and severity of bacterial infections in these patients. The IVIg are also prescribed for the substitutive therapy of secondary immunodeficiencies such as chronic lymphoid leukemia and multiple myeloma with hypogammaglobulinemia and severe and/or recurrent infections, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children with recurrent bacterial infections before the era of highly active antiretroviral agents. However, in the latter situation, no recent study has evaluated IVIg therapy in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) children receiving highly active antiretroviral agents (HAART), and the use of IVIg must probably be restricted to the currently rare clinical situation in Western Europe of children with AIDS who develop recurrent infections despite the administration of HAART and prophylactic cotrimoxazole. IVIg have also been reported to prevent infections, interstitial pneumonia and graft-vs. host disease during the first 90 days post-transplant in allogeneic bone-marrow transplant recipients. However, this result was not confirmed by two recent studies and IVIg therapy should probably only be proposed for a subgroup of bone-marrow allografted patients such as those with hypogammaglobulinemia and sepsis.

This profile has been selected from R&D Insight, a pharmaceutical intelligence database produced by Adis International Ltd. It is a member of a novel class of nucleoside analogues discovered by BioChem Pharma and is the first example of a synthetic L-nucleoside analogue to have shown anticancer activity in animal models. On 11 May 2001, BioChem Pharma was acquired by, and integrated into, Shire Pharmaceuticals Group. In February 2002 Shire announced that it intended to pursue development of troxacitabine as a treatment for solid tumours. In addition, Shire indicated that it would pursue the drug's development for acute myeloid leukaemia. In March 1999, phase II trials were initiated to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of troxacitabine in a variety of solid tumours including pancreas, prostate, colorectal, renal and non-small cell lung cancers and melanoma. The trials were conducted throughout North America and were closed to patient accrual in 2000. Two phase I combination chemotherapy trials in solid tumours (one with cisplatin and another with paclitaxel) have been initiated. One of these trials is in patients with pancreatic cancer. A phase III trial in patients with pancreatic cancer is expected to begin during the second or third quarter of 2003. In addition, further clinical development was initiated in May 2000, in the form of a combination chemotherapy trial in patients with acute leukaemia. A phase II trial in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukaemia-blast phase (CML-BP) has reported that troxacitabine demonstrated significant activity in these cancers. However, Shire indicated that no further development for CML-BP will be conducted. The company indicated that it would focus future development in the haematological malignancy area on AML and has initiated an exploratory phase III trial of troxacitabine in previously untreated patients with poor prognosis AML. The study will compare troxacitabine in combination with either cytarabine or idarubicin, with a control drug regimen. The aim is to identify the most promising treatment regimens in a relatively small number of patients before commencing the larger pivotal trial. A pivotal phase III trial is expected to begin in the first half of 2003.

The serum level of NM23-H1 protein was clinically useful as a prognostic factor in malignant lymphoma and acute myelogeneous leukemia (AML). The level of NM23-H1 protein in all of the normal serum samples examined was lower than 10 ng/mL, while those in the tumors varied from about 0 to 1000 ng/mL.

The case records and bone marrow results were reviewed, along with a review of the literature. RESULTS: Three patients developed secondary myelodysplasia/leukemia, at 7, 11, and 12 months following 131I-MIBG therapy. Cytogenetic abnormalities included -7q/-5, -7/+2q37, -11 and +12. Three additional cases were found in literature review of 509 reported patients treated with 131I-MIBG for neuroblastoma. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with 131I-MIBG may contribute to the risk of secondary leukemia in patients who have received intensive chemotherapy, thought the risk of this complication is far lower than the risk of disease progression.

Practically, however, failure to detect these abnormalities is frequent and usually attributed to poor marrow sampling, inadequate metaphases, and/or a preponderant mitotic activity among nonleukemic cells. The authors applied fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques to re-examine 30 cases of karyotypically ""normal"" childhood ALL to explore the role of preponderant mitotic activities of nonleukemic cells in failures to detect clonal abnormalities. The FISH test were performed using TEL/AML1 fusion gene probe and the centromere probes for chromosome 8 and 10 to detect the t(12;21) translocation and/or hyperdiploidy. Half of the karyotypically ""normal"" ALL cases examined have been found to have abnormal clones with t(12;21) rearrangement and/or hyperdiploidy by this specially designed FISH assay. Contrary to expectation, the authors found a higher incidence (52%) of clonal abnormalities in cases where over 20 metaphases had been examined than in cases (44%) where fewer than 20 metaphases had been analyzed. These findings suggest that a preponderant mitotic activity of nonleukemic cells plays an important role in failures to detect an abnormal clone by conventional cytogenetic studies. Therefore, karyotypically ""normal"" childhood ALL patients should undergo FISH studies to rule out the presence of t(12;21) and/or hyperdiploid clone.","['Wu, Shi Qi', 'Weinberg, Kenneth I', 'Joo, Wan Jong', 'Quinn, John J', 'Franklin, Janet', 'Siegel, Stuart E', 'Gaynon, Paul S']","['Wu SQ', 'Weinberg KI', 'Joo WJ', 'Quinn JJ', 'Franklin J', 'Siegel SE', 'Gaynon PS']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, 4650 Sunset Blvd., Mailstop 11, Los Angeles, CA 90027, U.S.A. swu@chla.usc.edu""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology']",2003/07/09 05:00,2003/08/21 05:00,['2003/07/09 05:00'],"['2003/07/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/09 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2003 Jul;25(7):520-5. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200307000-00004.,,['10.1097/00043426-200307000-00004 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we describe the identification of ligands for TREM-2 on both bacteria and mammalian cells. First, by using a TREM-2A/IgG1-Fc fusion protein, we demonstrate specific binding to a number of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and to yeast. Furthermore, we show that fluorescently labeled Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus bind specifically to TREM-2-transfected cells. The binding of TREM-2A/Ig fusion protein to E. coli can be inhibited by the bacterial products LPS, lipoteichoic acid, and peptidoglycan. Additionally, binding can be inhibited by a number of other anionic carbohydrate molecules, including dextran sulfate, suggesting that ligand recognition is based partly on charge. Using a sensitive reporter assay, we demonstrate activation of a TREM-2A/CD3zeta chimeric receptor by both bacteria and dextran sulfate. Finally, we demonstrate binding of TREM-2A/Ig fusion to a series of human astrocytoma lines but not to a variety of other cell lines. The binding to astrocytomas, like binding to bacteria, is inhibited by anionic bacterial products, suggesting either a similar charge-based ligand recognition method or overlapping binding sites for recognition of self- and pathogen-expressed ligands.","['Daws, Michael R', 'Sullam, Paul M', 'Niemi, Erene C', 'Chen, Thomas T', 'Tchao, Nadia K', 'Seaman, William E']","['Daws MR', 'Sullam PM', 'Niemi EC', 'Chen TT', 'Tchao NK', 'Seaman WE']","['Department of Immunology and Division of Infectious Diseases, Veterans Affairs Medical Center and University of California, San Francisco, CA 94121, USA. mdaws@itsa.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Anions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Peptidoglycan)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TREM-2a receptor)', '0 (TREM-2b receptor)', '0 (Teichoic Acids)', '0 (Trem3 protein, mouse)', '56411-57-5 (lipoteichoic acid)', '9042-14-2 (Dextran Sulfate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anions', 'Astrocytoma/metabolism/microbiology', 'Bacterial Adhesion/drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Binding, Competitive/genetics/immunology', 'Dextran Sulfate/pharmacology', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria/physiology', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments/genetics/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia P388', 'Ligands', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Peptidoglycan/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Teichoic Acids/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/07/09 05:00,2003/10/24 05:00,['2003/07/09 05:00'],"['2003/07/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/09 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2003 Jul 15;171(2):594-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.171.2.594.,,['10.4049/jimmunol.171.2.594 [doi]'],,,"['AI41513/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA87922-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of p16 mRNA in p16-gene-positive patients varied greatly, and cells from some patients showed up to several hundredfold higher expression than normal lymphocytes. Surprisingly, among 17 patients examined for p16 protein expression, all four patients with unusually high mRNA lacked p16 protein expression, indicating that p16 protein production in these patients was interrupted at the translational level. Moreover, these patients showed significantly shorter survival than p16-protein-positive patients.

This may decrease hGR-alpha-mediated transcriptional activation. The importance of hGR-gamma expression in childhood ALL is unknown. To evaluate hGR-gamma mRNA expression levels, a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approach, allowing the selective amplification of hGR-gamma, was developed and optimized. We were able to demonstrate target selectivity of hGR-gamma amplification using sequence-specific primers. Studying the structure of the 3' end of hGR-gamma, a combination of this isoform with other hGR isoforms could be demonstrated. Using analysis of hGR-gamma-specific amplification in comparison with the expression of hGR-total (all isoforms) in leukaemic blasts from patients with either a good response to prednisone (PGR) or poor-prednisone response (PPR) in vivo, relative hGR-gamma expression was observed to be lower in cells from patients with PGR compared with PPR, in particular after 10 h of dexamethasone stimulation.

We evaluated whether SNPs in the cytochrome P450 3A family (CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A5*3 and CYP3A5*6) were associated with relapse risk on a national Children's Cancer Group (CCG) paediatric ALL trial (CCG-1891).

CYP3A variants were not associated with an increased risk of relapse.

In this study, we examined the chromosomal arm 1p for allelic loss in the progression of MDS to AML, using 17 microsatellite markers spanning chromosome 1 in 20 patients who progressed from MDS to AML. DNA was extracted from slides of bone marrow smears. In each patient, DNA from MDS was analysed alongside DNA from AML. Allelic loss on 1p was observed in six of the 20 individuals (30%). Serial cytogenetic information was available in five of the six patients with LOH on 1p; no deletions in this region were detected. Three samples showed LOH at all informative loci on 1p. The other three samples showed LOH on at least one but not all loci on 1p with consensus regions of LOH located distal to D1S253 (1p36.3) and probably proximal to D1S496 (1p32-).

The EGIL guidelines defined MPO positivity in FC, by the presence of this enzyme in 10% or more of the blast cells. We studied 136 adult patients with the systematic use of both EC and FC, using a 3% threshold for positivity for EC, and 10% and 3% consecutively for FC. FC was less sensitive than EC using the currently recommended threshold of 10%, but a 3% cut-off showed more sensitivity and was superior to EC. The joint use of both techniques identified 14 discordant patients (positive in FC/negative in EC or vice versa), all of whom displayed at least one poor-prognosis biological factor, which correlated with a mediocre clinical result.

The differential peptide copy number resulted in an immunodominant cytotoxic T cells (CTL) response directed against H4b while the anti-B6 response directed against H4a was easily dominated. These results provide a molecular mechanism for the H4 minor H antigen and suggest a novel mechanism by which alloantigenic disparity caused by conservative amino acid changes can be augmented by posttranslational antigen processing events.","['Luedtke, Brianna', 'Pooler, Laura M', 'Choi, Eun Young', 'Tranchita, Angela M', 'Reinbold, Corbett J A', 'Brown, Aaron C', 'Shaffer, Daniel J', 'Roopenian, Derry C', 'Malarkannan, Subramaniam']","['Luedtke B', 'Pooler LM', 'Choi EY', 'Tranchita AM', 'Reinbold CJ', 'Brown AC', 'Shaffer DJ', 'Roopenian DC', 'Malarkannan S']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, Blood Research Institute, Blood Center of South-eastern Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226-2178, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Immunogenetics,Immunogenetics,0420404,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (EMP3 protein, human)', '0 (Emp3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Emp3 protein, rat)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Epitopes', 'Isoantigens/genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",2003/07/08 05:00,2003/11/05 05:00,['2003/07/08 05:00'],"['2003/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2003/05/12 00:00 [revised]', '2003/07/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/08 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunogenetics. 2003 Aug;55(5):284-95. doi: 10.1007/s00251-003-0581-x.

The development of RIT with alpha emitters is attractive because of the high linear energy transfer (LET) and short path length, allowing higher tumour cell kill and lower toxicity to healthy tissues. We assessed the relative biological efficacy (RBE) of alpha RIT (in vitro) compared to external gamma irradiation with respect to induction of apoptosis in B chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) and induction of chromosomal damage in healthy donor B and T lymphocytes. The latter was measured by a micronucleus assay. 213Bi was eluted from a 225Ac generator and conjugated to CD20 antibody (rituximab) with CHX-A""-DTPA as a chelator. B-CLL cells from five patients were cultured for 24 h in RPMI/10% FCS while exposed to 213Bi conjugated to CD20 antibody or after external 60Co gamma irradiation. Binding assays were performed in samples of all patients to calculate the total absorbed dose. Apoptosis was scored by flow cytometric analyses of the cells stained with annexin V-FITC and 7-AAD. Apoptosis was expressed as % excess over spontaneous apoptosis in control. Full dose range experiments demonstrated 213Bi-conjugated CD20 antibody to be more effective than equivalent doses of external gamma irradiation, but showed that similar plateau values were reached at 10 Gy. The RBE for induction of apoptosis in B-CLL was 2 between 1.5 and 7 Gy. The micronucleus yield in lymphocytes of healthy volunteers was measured to assess the late toxicity caused by induction of chromosomal instability. While gamma radiation induced a steady increase in micronucleus yields in B and T cells, the damage induced by 213Bi was more dramatic, with RBE ranging from 5 to 2 between 0.1 Gy and 2 Gy respectively. In contrast to gamma irradiation, 213Bi inhibited mitogen-stimulated mitosis almost completely at 2 Gy. In conclusion, high-LET targeted alpha particle exposure killed B-CLL cells more effectively than did external gamma irradiation at a low dose (RBE=2), while a plateau was reached at a high dose. Long-term toxicity on healthy B and T lymphocytes was systematically higher for the alpha emitter (RBE=5 to 2).","['Vandenbulcke, Katia', 'De Vos, Filip', 'Offner, Fritz', 'Philippe, Jan', 'Apostolidis, Christos', 'Molinet, Roger', 'Nikula, Tuomo K', 'Bacher, Klaus', 'de Gelder, Virginie', 'Vral, Anne', 'Lahorte, Christophe', 'Thierens, Hubert', 'Dierckx, Rudi A', 'Slegers, Guido']","['Vandenbulcke K', 'De Vos F', 'Offner F', 'Philippe J', 'Apostolidis C', 'Molinet R', 'Nikula TK', 'Bacher K', 'de Gelder V', 'Vral A', 'Lahorte C', 'Thierens H', 'Dierckx RA', 'Slegers G']","['Department of Radiopharmacy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ghent University, Gent, Belgium. katia.vandenbulcke@rug.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,101140988,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'U015TT5I8H (Bismuth)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Bismuth/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Gamma Rays/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/*radiotherapy', 'Lymphocytes/*radiation effects', 'Male', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radioisotopes/*therapeutic use', 'Reference Values', 'Relative Biological Effectiveness', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/07/08 05:00,2004/07/03 05:00,['2003/07/08 05:00'],"['2002/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2003/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/07/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/08 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. 2003 Oct;30(10):1357-64. doi: 10.1007/s00259-003-1228-8.

In contrast, leukemia is rare. A 23-year-old NBS patient presented with anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hyperlymphocytosis. The diagnosis of T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) was confirmed by cytological and immunological assays (TdT(-), CD2(+), CD5(+), CD3m, and CD7(+)). Biological assays also showed a hemolytic anemia and a clotting factor V decrease. The patient was first treated by methylprednisone for 3 weeks. During this period the lymphocyte count decreased. The simultaneous normalization of the hemolysis and of factor V suggested that both could be related to T-PLL. Since T-PLL is refractory to conventional therapies with a poor prognosis, an intensive chemotherapy such as 2'-deoxycoformycin with anti-CDw52 monoclonal antibodies is usually favored. In the present case, however, because of the specific context (i.e., NBS-induced immunodepression, severe hemolytic anemia, and acquired factor V deficiency), he received pentostatin weekly during 1 month and in maintenance during 6 months.

The ability to perform chromosome analysis of cryopreserved malignant marrow or peripheral blast cells is important for retrospective studies. In the present study, we compared the karyotype of fresh bone marrow cells (20 metaphases) to that of cells stored with a simplified cryopreservation method, evaluated the effect of the use of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as an in vitro mitotic index stimulator, and compared the cell viability and chromosome morphology of fresh and cryopreserved cells whenever possible (sufficient metaphases for analysis). Twenty-five bone marrow samples from 24 patients with hematological disorders such as acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myeloid leukemia, megaloblastic anemia and lymphoma (8, 3, 3, 8, 1, and 1 patients, respectively) were selected at diagnosis, at relapse or during routine follow-up and one sample was obtained from a bone marrow donor after informed consent. Average cell viability before and after freezing was 98.8 and 78.5%, respectively (P < 0.05). Cytogenetic analysis was successful in 76% of fresh cell cultures, as opposed to 52% of cryopreserved samples (P < 0.05). GM-CSF had no proliferative effect before or after freezing. The morphological aspects of the chromosomes in fresh and cryopreserved cells were subjectively the same. The present study shows that cytogenetic analysis of cryopreserved bone marrow cells can be a reliable alternative when fresh cell analysis cannot be done, notwithstanding the reduced viability and lower percent of successful analysis that are associated with freezing.","['Chauffaille, M L L F', 'Pinheiro, R F', 'Stefano, J T', 'Kerbauy, J']","['Chauffaille ML', 'Pinheiro RF', 'Stefano JT', 'Kerbauy J']","['Disciplina de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil. chauffaille@hemato.epm.br']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,['83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects', '*Cryopreservation', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping/*methods', '*Tissue Preservation']",2003/07/08 05:00,2004/01/21 05:00,['2003/07/08 05:00'],"['2003/07/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/08 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2003 Jul;36(7):845-50. doi: 10.1590/s0100-879x2003000700004.

The results showed that under an effector-target ratio of 25:1, the cytotoxic activity of CIK + CLA-DC, CIK + DC, CIK and CIK + CLA groups against autologous CML cells was (68.8 +/- 14.2)%, (52.5 +/- 9.4)%, (20.6 +/- 7.5)% and (24.2 +/- 8.7)%, respectively. CIK + CLA-DC group displayed a strongest cytotoxic activity. When K562 and Raji cells acted as target cells and CIK as effectors, the cytotoxic activity against autologous CML cells in CIK + CLA-DC group (68.8 +/- 14.2)% was much higher than that against K562 cells (14.6 +/- 6.2)% and Raji cells (12.7 +/- 10.2)%, respectively. In conclusion, coculture of CIK cells with DC led to a significant increase in cytotoxic activity. The cytotoxicity could be further increased by DC pulse with CML cell lysate antigen, and cytotoxicity mediated by CML lysate antigen possess stronger specificity.","['Zhu, Hong-Hu', 'Xu, Kai-Lin', 'Pan, Xiu-Ying', 'Liu, Jun-Quan', 'Chen, Fu-Xing', 'Huang, Yi-Hong']","['Zhu HH', 'Xu KL', 'Pan XY', 'Liu JQ', 'Chen FX', 'Huang YH']","['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou 221002, China. zhuhh6@msn.com']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'CD56 Antigen/analysis', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/cytology/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/07/08 05:00,2003/09/10 05:00,['2003/07/08 05:00'],"['2003/07/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/08 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2003 Jun;11(3):278-81.,,['1009-2137(2003)03-0278-04 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that the expression of Fas and FasL of CD34(+) cells significantly increased in all types of MDS patients compared with control group (P < 0.01). The expression of Bcl-2 on CD34(+) cells in RAEB and RAEB-t patients was much higher as compared with that in control group (P < 0.01), but there was no significant difference between RA/RAS patients and control group (P > 0.05). The expression rates of Fas on CD34(+) cells were almost identical in all kinds of MDS, but there was significant difference on the expression of Bcl-2 (RA/RAS < RAEB < RAEB-t).

IFN-alpha is a well-known effective treatment in chronic phase CML. The cytogenetic response and the prognostic factors in 128 CML patients treated with IFN-alpha were retrospectively studied. IFN-alpha administered singly at a dose of 3 million U/day for 2 - 3 times a week or in combination with either hydroxyurea (Hu), busulfan (Bu), low dose Ara-C or harringtonine. Karyotyping was examined by G-banding before and after IFN-alpha-based treatment. The results showed that all patients achieved complete hematological remission. Cytogenetic response occurred in 36 of 118 patients with standard t (9;22) translocation; 3 of these 36 patients had a complete cytogenetic response (Ph = 0), 13 had major cytogenetic responses (Ph < 35%) and 20 had minimal response (Ph > 35%). The total cytogenetic effectiveness was 13.6% (16/118). Four of seven patients with complicated variant translocation also achieved cytogenetic response, 2 of them had a major cytogenetic response and 2 had minimal response. Factors influenced the prognosis associated with cytogenetic response included sex, patient status at diagnosis and IFN-alpha administered singly or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. IFN-alpha could not prevent the progression of CML. It is concluded that Ph(+)CML patients with both standard and variant translocation had major cytogenetic response to IFN-alpha treatment at a dose of 6 - 9 million U/week in single or combination with Hu/Bu, however, IFN-alpha treatment could not prevent disease progression. Long term survival was also observed in patients with variant translocation treated with IFN-alpha. Regular cytogenesis examination in CML patients is necessary during IFN-alpha therapy, which is useful to reflect curative effect and progression of the disease.","['Hong, Hong', 'Qiu, Jing-Ying', 'Lai, Yue-Yun', 'Shi, Yan', 'He, Qi', 'Dang, Hui', 'Lu, Dao-Pei']","['Hong H', 'Qiu JY', 'Lai YY', 'Shi Y', 'He Q', 'Dang H', 'Lu DP']","[""Department of Cytogenetics, Institute of Hematology and People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/07/08 05:00,2003/09/10 05:00,['2003/07/08 05:00'],"['2003/07/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/08 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2003 Jun;11(3):269-73.,,['1009-2137(2003)03-0269-05 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that the expression ratios of NF-kappaB, P21, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in untreated AL group were significantly higher than those in remission and normal control groups (P < 0.05), and no obvious difference was seen between remission and normal control groups. The expression of NF-kappaB was correlated with that of P21, MMP-2 and MMP-9 (r = 0.767, 0.729 and 0.803, respectively, P < 0.05).

In conclusion, after activation by Ras, NF-kappaB combined with the kappaB sequences of MMP-2 and MMP-9 genes, then upregulated their expression. MMP might enhance the degradative function of leukemic cell, thus to make cells easier to cross through the bone marrow barrier and release into blood.","['Hu, Hai-Yan', 'Sun, Hui', 'Zou, Dian-Bin', 'Sun, Ling', 'Zhang, Lin', 'Jia, Ying-Lan']","['Hu HY', 'Sun H', 'Zou DB', 'Sun L', 'Zhang L', 'Jia YL']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/*biosynthesis', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*biosynthesis', 'NF-kappa B/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*biosynthesis', 'Remission Induction']",2003/07/08 05:00,2003/09/10 05:00,['2003/07/08 05:00'],"['2003/07/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/08 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2003 Jun;11(3):243-5.,,['1009-2137(2003)03-0243-03 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resistance may concern all, or just selected, GC effects, it may be absolute or just reflect a state of reduced sensitivity and, clinically relevant, be reversible or irreversible. Numerous molecular mechanisms can be envisaged acting either 'upstream' in the GC-triggered signaling pathway, i.e. at the level of the GC receptor (GR), or 'downstream' at the level of the GC-regulated genes responsible for individual GC effects. In lymphoid malignancies, GCs have anti-leukemic effects through the induction of apoptosis and/or cell cycle arrest. In this condition evidence for only a small number of mechanisms for GC resistance has been provided, mostly at the level of the GR.

Cattle, horses, and sheep that ingest these plants succumb to their toxic effects. Riddelliine residues have been found in meat, milk, and honey, and the plants may contaminate human food sources. Riddelliine was nominated for study by the Food and Drug Administration because of its potential for human exposure and its economic impact on the livestock industry and because the toxicity of other pyrrolizidine alkaloids suggests riddelliine may be carcinogenic. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice received riddelliine (approximately 92% pure) by gavage. Female rats and male and female mice were dosed for 2 years; due to high mortality, the study in male rats was terminated at week 72. In vitro genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium and in cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In addition, riddelliine was evaluated in vivo for induction of micronuclei in mouse bone marrow and peripheral blood erythrocytes and for induction of S-phase DNA synthesis and unscheduled DNA synthesis in the liver of rats and mice. Riddelliine-induced DNA adduct levels were determined in liver tissue obtained from female rats admininstered riddelliine for 3 or 6 months. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were administered 0 or 1 mg riddelliine/kg body weight in sodium phosphate buffer by gavage 5 days per week; additional groups of 50 female rats received 0.01, 0.033, 0.1, or 0.33 mg/kg. A wide dose range was used in female rats to better characterize the dose-response curve. Females were dosed for 105 weeks; due to high mortality, male rats were terminated at week 72. All but three 1 mg/kg males died before week 70, and all 1 mg/kg females died before week 97. Mean body weights of 1 mg/kg males and females were less than those of the vehicle controls throughout most of the study. The only clinical finding related to riddelliine administration was a general debilitation of the animals prior to death. Hemangiosarcomas were present in the liver of 86% of males and 76% of females in the 1 mg/kg groups, and this neoplasm was considered the cause of the large number of early deaths in these groups. The incidences of hepatocellular adenoma and mononuclear cell leukemia in 1 mg/kg males and females were significantly increased. Nonneoplastic lesions related to riddelliine treatment occurred in the liver and kidney of males and females. Analyses of liver tissue from female rats treated with riddelliine for 3 or 6 months yielded eight DNA adducts; these were the same as DNA adducts formed in vitro by the metabolism of riddelliine by human liver microsomes in the presence of calf thymus DNA. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were administered riddelliine in sodium phosphate buffer by gavage at doses of 0 or 3 mg/kg, 5 days per week, for 105 weeks; additional groups of 50 male mice received 0.1, 0.3, or 1 mg/kg for 105 weeks. A wide dose range was used in male mice to better characterize the dose-response curve. Survival of males and females administered 3 mg/kg was significantly less than that of the vehicle controls. Mean body weights of 3 mg/kg mice were less than those of the vehicle controls throughout most of the study. Hemangiosarcomas of the liver were present in 62% of males in the 3 mg/kg group. The incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms occurred with negative trends in male mice and were significantly decreased in 3 mg/kg females. The incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar neoplasms in 3 mg/kg females were significantly increased. Nonneoplastic lesions related to riddelliine administration occurred in the liver and kidney of males and females and in the lung and arteries (multiple tissues) of females. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Riddelliine was mutagenic in S. typhimurium strain TA100 with, but not without, S9 activation; no significant mutagenic activity was detected in strain TA98 or TA1535,ed in strain TA98 or TA1535, with or without S9. A small, dose-related increase in mutant colonies seen in strain TA97 with S9 was judged to be equivocal. Riddelliine induced sister chromatid exchanges in cultured CHO cells with and without S9. Chromosomal aberrations were induced in CHO cells only in the presence of S9. Following 4 or 13 weeks of daily gavage treatment with riddelliine, no increases in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes were noted in the peripheral blood of male or female B6C3F1 mice. Use of a single intraperitoneal injection protocol, however, produced a small but significant increase in the frequency of micronucleated eryth-rocytes in peripheral blood of male Swiss mice 48 hours after injection; bone marrow analysis 24 hours after injection demonstrated a small but insignificant increase in the frequency of micronuclei. Unscheduled DNA synthesis was detected in cultured hepatocytes from male and female rats and mice following 5 or 30 days of riddelliine treatment by gavage. In addition, an S-phase DNA synthesis was observed in cultured hepatocytes of male and female rats treated for either time period. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of riddelliine in male and female F344/N rats based primarily on increased incidences of hemangiosarcoma in the liver. The increased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma and mononuclear cell leukemia in male and female rats were also considered to be treatment related. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of riddelliine in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hemangiosarcoma in the liver. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar neoplasms. Administration of riddelliine by gavage resulted in nonneoplastic lesions in the liver and kidney of male and female rats; the liver and kidney of male and female mice; and the lung and arteries (multiple tissues) of female mice.

Groups of 24 rats of each sex were administered lasiocarpine at one of three doses, either 7, 15, or 30 ppm, for 104 weeks. Matched controls consisted of groups of 24 untreated rats of each sex. All surviving rats were killed at 104 weeks. Mean body weights of the high-dose male and female rats were lower than those of the matched-control groups throughout most of the study, while weights of the mid-dose rats were lower only during the second year, and weights of the low-dose groups were unaffected. There was a positive dose-related trend in mortality for both sexes, with none of the high-dose animals, only five of the mid-dose animals, 23 of the low-dose animals, and 43 of the matched controls surviving to termination of the study. In spite of these early deaths, all male rats except one low-dose animal and one high-dose animal developed tumors, and among the females, 23 low-dose and 22 mid-dose animals developed tumors. Time-adjusted analysis of the incidence of tumors was performed in the female rats. In male rats, there was a positive dose-related trend (P<0.001) in the incidence of angiosarcoma of the liver; furthermore, the incidences in the mid- and high-dose groups, but not that in the low-dose, were significantly higher (P<0.001, both groups) than that in the controls (controls 0/24, low-dose 5/24, mid-dose 11/24, high-dose 13/24). In females, the incidences in both the low- and mid-dose groups, but not that in the high-dose, were significantly higher (P=0.002 and P=0.005, respectively) than that in the controls (controls 0/24, low-dose 8/24, mid-dose 7/24, high-dose 2/9). Metastatic angiosarcomas were present in the lungs from a few of the rats in all three treated groups of both sexes. In both male and female rats, there was a positive dose-related trend in the combined incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and adenoma of the liver (males, P=0.003; females, P<0.001); furthermore, the combined incidence of these tumors in the high-dose females, but not those in the low- and mid-dose, was significantly higher (P<0.001) than that in the controls (controls 0/24, low-dose 5/24, mid-dose 1/24, high-dose 7/9). The P-value of the combined incidence in the high-dose males (P=0.025) is above the 0.016 level required by the Bonferroni inequality criterion, when multiple comparison is considered (controls 0/24, low-dose 0/24, mid-dose 3/24, high-dose 5/24). Nodular hyperplasia was observed in additional animals of each treated group of each sex. Thus, lasiocarpine was associated with proliferative lesions of hepatocytes as well as with angiosarcomas arising from endothelial cells of the liver. The combined incidence of lymphoma or leukemia was significant in both the low- and mid-dose female groups (P</= 0.018), but not in the high-dose group, perhaps because of the early deaths in this group (controls 2/24, low-dose 9/24, mid-dose 11/24, high-dose 1/23). The incidences of these tumors in the males were not significant.

There has been little attention to possible effects of maternal occupational exposure to extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) during pregnancy. METHODS: We conducted a population-based, case-control study of 491 incident cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children 0-9 years of age, matched on age and sex to 491 healthy controls. Cases were diagnosed in the Province of Quebec between 1980 and 1993. Mothers were interviewed to obtain detailed prenatal occupational history; individual exposure to ELF-MF was estimated based on a method we recently developed. We used 3 metrics for analyzing exposure: cumulative, average and maximum levels. Analyses were carried out among all study women and among working women only. RESULTS: Comparing the highest 10% of exposed mothers to the others, the risk of leukemia among offspring was moderately increased by using any metric, in all women and among working women only. The highest odds ratio of 2.5 (95% confidence interval = 1.2-5.0) was found for maximum exposure attained in an occupation (>/=0.4 microtesla).

The next level of susceptible cells included J774.1, having a macrophage function, HL-60 premyelocytic leukemia cells, MOLT-4, an acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell, and Jurkat, a T-cell leukemia. U937 (expressing many monocyte-like characteristics), K562 erythroleukemia and K562/DXR (a multidrug-resistant clone derived from K562) were almost unaffected by DDTC. P388 was also highly susceptible to H(2)O(2), a most useful exogenous reactive oxygen species generator, and was lower in intracellular total GSH content than other leukemia cells. DDTC-induced cytotoxicity was closely related to intracellular GSH, but the level of cellular GSH did not always correlate with H(2)O(2)-induced cytotoxicity in this experiment. K562 had a higher intracellular total GSH content and showed lower susceptibility to DDTC and H(2)O(2), but with the combination of DDTC and DL-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO), cytotoxicity increased significantly. The ratio of GSH/GSSG in P388 was reduced by DDTC or H(2)O(2). H(2)O(2)-induced cytotoxicity was completely blocked by catalase (CAT), while it was enhanced by superoxide dismutase (SOD). CAT or SOD did not affect DDTC-induced cytotoxicity. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC: 1 mM), a vanguard substance of GSH, and aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA: 100 microM), an endonuclease inhibitor, ameliorated DDTC-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis. In conclusion, we suggest that DDTC-induced cytotoxicity was via an oxidative shift in the intracellular redox state, and accompanied the activation of endonuclease through apoptosis in leukemia cell lines.","['Kanno, Syu-ichi', 'Matsukawa, Emi', 'Miura, Ai', 'Shouji, Ai', 'Asou, Keiko', 'Ishikawa, Masaaki']","['Kanno S', 'Matsukawa E', 'Miura A', 'Shouji A', 'Asou K', 'Ishikawa M']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Cancer Research Institute, Tohoku Pharmaceutical University, Sendai, Japan. syu-kan@tohoku-pharm.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,['99Z2744345 (Ditiocarb)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Ditiocarb/*toxicity', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2003/07/05 05:00,2004/03/05 05:00,['2003/07/05 05:00'],"['2003/07/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2003 Jul;26(7):964-8. doi: 10.1248/bpb.26.964.,,['10.1248/bpb.26.964 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blastocyst injection chimera experiments show that ES cells are similar to early-stage ICM cells in that they contribute to the primitive ectoderm and endoderm derivatives (1). However, it is probably not possible to equate these two cell types, as ES cells appear to be produced by the cell culture environment and have no exact counterpart in the blastocyst. Instead, ES cells could be thought of as being ICM cells that, instead of undergoing rapid differentiation as they would in vivo, are abnormally locked into continuing cycles of division in the undifferentiated state by virtue of the action of exogenous factors. Leukemia inhibitory factor, LIF, is one such factor (2,3) and is indispensable for the propagation of mouse ES cells at least when primary embryo fibroblasts (PEFs) are used as feeder layers (4).","['Mann, J R']",['Mann JR'],"['Division of Biology, Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,,IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/cytology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Line', 'Embryo Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Genomic Imprinting/*physiology', 'Mice']",2003/07/05 05:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2003/07/05 05:00'],"['2003/07/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2003/07/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2001;181:21-39. doi: 10.1385/1-59259-211-2:21.,,"['1-59259-211-2-21 [pii]', '10.1385/1-59259-211-2:21 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CNTF and its receptor, CNTFRalpha, are strongly upregulated in activated astrocytes. Application of CNTF upregulates GFAP expression in cultured astrocytes and induces various aspects of gliosis in the intact brain. Here we examined whether inactivation of the CNTF gene results in the expected changes in glial reactivity by analyzing gliosis in the superior colliculus (SC) after optic nerve crush. Basal expression levels of GFAP and vimentin in unlesioned CNTF-deficient mice were reduced by 66 and 37%, respectively. Absolute numbers of astrocytes were found not to be different. Surprisingly, however, lesion induced robust activation of astrocytes in CNTF-deficient mice; the time course of activation was even accelerated as compared with wild-type animals. At later time points, activation reached the same level. With respect to microglial cells, basal expression of microglial markers was unaltered in CNTF-knock-out animals. Lesion-induced upregulation of Iba-1, ICAM-1, and F4/80 in microglial cells was unaffected in CNTF-deficient animals. Differences were observed with respect to the time course of microglial activation, different markers being affected differentially. We further demonstrate that lesion induces upregulation of CNTF-related cytokines (LIF, NNT-1) and, interestingly, a more pronounced upregulation of cytokine receptor components (LIF receptor beta, gp130) and TGFbeta in CNTF-deficient animals. Our results thus indicate that CNTF is required for the development and maintenance of the mature astrocyte phenotype and provide evidence that CNTF is part of the complex regulatory network modulating lesional glial reactivity after lesion.","['Martin, Aliki', 'Hofmann, Hans-Dieter', 'Kirsch, Matthias']","['Martin A', 'Hofmann HD', 'Kirsch M']","['Institute of Anatomy, University of Freiburg, D-79001 Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/biosynthesis', 'Astrocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/*deficiency/genetics', 'Cytokines/genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Gliosis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nerve Crush', 'Neuroglia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Optic Nerve/*metabolism/pathology', 'Optic Nerve Injuries/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/metabolism', 'Superior Colliculi/metabolism/pathology']",2003/07/05 05:00,2003/08/15 05:00,['2003/07/05 05:00'],"['2003/07/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2003 Jul 2;23(13):5416-24.,,['23/13/5416 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,PMC6741243,,,,,,,

CD19 is highly expressed (CD19(+)) on ALL cells and is an attractive target for antibody-based therapies. CLB-CD19 is an IgG1kappa murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against an epitope on the CD19 antigen. METHODS: Radiolabeled CLB-CD19 antibody was evaluated for targeting ALL in a severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model engrafted with primary human leukemia cells. Lodgment of CD19(+) ALL cells in spleen and liver was confirmed using immunohistochemistry analyses. Circulating CD19(+) ALL cells in blood were also detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Antibody was labeled directly with the radiohalogen (125)I and radiometal (111)In via the bifunctional metal ion chelate CHX-A""-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) with retention of immunoreactivities. After intravenous injection of radioconjugates, biodistribution studies showed rapid localization of the (111)In-conjugate to leukemia-infiltrated spleen, reaching a maximum (mean +/- SD) of 72.78 +/- 13.67 % injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g) by 24 h after injection. In contrast, peak localization of coinjected (125)I-CLB-CD19 occurred by 4 h and was significantly lower (11.41 +/- 12.79 %ID/g) (P < 0.001). Uptake of (111)In-conjugate in the liver containing tumor was also evident but not in other normal tissues. Uptake of radiolabeled CLB-CD19 in tumor-bearing organs was specific, as uptake of radiolabeled isotype-matched antibody control was low. Gamma-camera imaging detected the uptake of (111)In-CHX-A""-DTPA CLB-CD19 in enlarged tumor-bearing spleen of engrafted mice. A single injection of 32 micro g CLB-CD19 mAb had a delayed suppressive effect on the level of circulatory leukemia cells in surviving mice and extended the median survival from 48.5 to 58 d (n = 8; P = 0.03).

TG is converted into TGN in fewer steps and has been shown to be more cytotoxic in equimolar doses in vitro compared with 6-MP. Therefore, a higher effectiveness of TG in maintenance treatment was postulated. Of 521 patients enrolled into the protocol, 474 were randomized to receive either MP or TG during maintenance therapy in a daily oral dose. After a median observation time of 6.6 years, the probability of event-free survival was 79% +/- 3% for the MP group (238 children) and 78% +/- 3% in the TG group (236 patients). In spite of TGN levels, exceeding those of the MP group 7 times, treatment with TG did not improve the outcome but was more complicated to handle due to a specific toxicity profile of prolonged myelosuppression with marked thrombocytopenia. Therefore, MP should remain the preferred drug for maintenance treatment of ALL, unless other studies demonstrate superiority of TG in larger trials or selected patient groups.","['Harms, Dorthe O', 'Gobel, Ulrich', 'Spaar, Hans J', 'Graubner, Ulrike B', 'Jorch, Norbert', 'Gutjahr, Peter', 'Janka-Schaub, Gritta E']","['Harms DO', 'Gobel U', 'Spaar HJ', 'Graubner UB', 'Jorch N', 'Gutjahr P', 'Janka-Schaub GE']","[""Children's University Hospital, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Martinistrasse 20, 20246 Hamburg, Germany. doerthe.harms@tele2.ch""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Prodrugs)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prodrugs/pharmacology', 'Risk', 'Thioguanine/*therapeutic use', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Time Factors']",2003/07/05 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/07/05 05:00'],"['2003/07/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Oct 15;102(8):2736-40. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-08-2372.

Therefore, development of additional treatment modalities to eliminate residual tumor cells is needed. Active immunotherapy using dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with tumor-associated antigens is a promising approach to induce specific T-cell immunity in patients with cancer. In previous studies, we described HB-1 as a B-cell lineage-specific antigen that is recognized by donor-derived cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) on allogeneic B-ALL tumor cells. Here, we investigated the potential use of the HB-1 antigen as an autologous T-cell vaccine target. To determine whether HB-1-specific CTL precursors are present within the T-cell repertoire, we induced expansion of CD8+ T cells using mature monocyte-derived DCs pulsed with the previously identified HB-1.B44 antigenic peptide. In 6 of 8 donors, CD8+ CTL lines have been generated that exert cytotoxicity against target cells exogenously pulsed with peptide or endogenously expressing the HB-1 antigen. From one of these HB-1-specific T-cell lines, we isolated a CD8+ CTL that produces interferon-gamma on stimulation with B-ALL tumor cells. Interestingly, the HB-1 antigen also induced CD4+ T-helper responses on activation with protein-loaded mature monocyte-derived DCs. We identified 2 novel epitopes recognized in the context of HLA-DR4 and HLA-DR11 with the use of HB-1-specific CD4+ T-cell clones generated from different donors. These present data, that HB-1 induces both helper and cytotoxic T-cell responses, indicate that the HB-1 antigen is a candidate target to induce T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity in patients.","['de Rijke, Bjorn', 'Fredrix, Hanny', 'Zoetbrood, Agnes', 'Scherpen, Frank', 'Witteveen, Henry', 'de Witte, Theo', 'van de Wiel-Van Kemenade, Elly', 'Dolstra, Harry']","['de Rijke B', 'Fredrix H', 'Zoetbrood A', 'Scherpen F', 'Witteveen H', 'de Witte T', 'van de Wiel-Van Kemenade E', 'Dolstra H']","['Central Hematology Laboratory and Department of Hematology, University Medical Center St Radboud, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Serological Subtypes)', '0 (HLA-DR11 antigen)', '0 (HLA-DR4 Antigen)', '0 (HMHB1 protein, human)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Peptides)', '0R0008Q3JB (Chromium)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'CD8 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Chromium/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epitopes/metabolism', 'HLA-B Antigens/*metabolism', 'HLA-DR Antigens/metabolism', 'HLA-DR Serological Subtypes', 'HLA-DR4 Antigen/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Peptides/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*metabolism']",2003/07/05 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/07/05 05:00'],"['2003/07/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Oct 15;102(8):2885-91. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-11-3584.

Here, we compared the antiapoptotic effects of wild-type FLT3 (WtFLT3) and FLT3/ITD in terms of the regulation of Bcl-2 family members. In a murine myeloid cell line, 32D, interleukin-3 (IL-3) deprivation induced apoptosis following the down-regulation of Bcl-XL and the dephosphorylation of Bad. However, the expression levels of Bcl-2, Bax, Bak, and Mcl-1 were unchanged. In WtFLT3-transfected 32D (WtFLT3-32D) cells, FLT3 ligand (FL) stimulation did not restore the down-regulation of Bcl-XL but maintained the phosphorylation of Bad. Combined treatment with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY294002, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD98059, dephosphorylated Bad and induced apoptosis in WtFLT3-32D cells stimulated with FL. Induction of nonphosphorylated Bad induced remarkable apoptosis. These findings suggest that the FL stimulation is associated with antiapoptosis through Bad phosphorylation. On the other hand, FLT3/ITD-transfected 32D (FLT3/ITD-32D) cells survived in an IL-3-or FL-deprived state. Furthermore, the dephosphorylation of Bad using LY294002 and PD98059 was insufficient for apoptosis, and the down-regulation of Bcl-XL using antisense treatment was needed to induce apoptosis. FLT3 kinase inhibitor, AG1296, alone not only dephosphorylated Bad but also down-regulated Bcl-XL, leading FLT3/ITD-32D cells into apoptosis. These findings suggest that the antiapoptotic pathways from FLT3/ITD are more divergent than those from WtFLT3 and may represent targets for drug discovery with the potential of inducing selective cell death of human leukemia cells.","['Minami, Yosuke', 'Yamamoto, Kazuhito', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Ueda, Ryuzo', 'Saito, Hidehiko', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Minami Y', 'Yamamoto K', 'Kiyoi H', 'Ueda R', 'Saito H', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Hematology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsurumai-cho 65, Showa-ku, Nagoya 466-8550, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*pathology', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', '*Mutation', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'bcl-X Protein']",2003/07/05 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/07/05 05:00'],"['2003/07/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Oct 15;102(8):2969-75. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-12-3813.

Eight patients showed increasing levels of expression during follow-up and all had relapse. In conclusion, patients at high risk for treatment failure can be identified by high levels of fusion gene expression at diagnosis or less than 3 logs of tumor reduction during the first 3 to 4 months of therapy.

We exploit this difference to assess the effect of PBBs at the time of CR-MDA on relapse-free survival (RFS) time. Eighty percent of the 533 patients with newly diagnosed AML or refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) entering CR-MDA from 1995 to 2000 had no PBBs at time of CR-MDA. Ninety-three percent of the remaining patients, who thus had CR-MDA but not standard CR, had 1% to 5% PBBs at this time. Multivariate analyses, using both conventional and Bayesian approaches, indicated that PBBs had no effect on RFS. For all patients and for the subgroups given and not given granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), the 95% credible interval for the relative risk of failure in the PBB group was nearly centered at 1.0. Thus, our data do not support use of PBBs in defining CR in newly diagnosed AML.","['Estey, Elihu H', 'Thall, Peter F', 'Wang, Xuemei', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Estey EH', 'Thall PF', 'Wang X', 'Verstovsek S', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Box 428, Houston, TX 77030, USA. ehestey@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/diagnosis/pathology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies']",2003/07/05 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/07/05 05:00'],"['2003/07/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Nov 1;102(9):3097-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-04-1309.

The exact mechanism by which this protein contributes to the oncogenic process is not known. However, it has been hypothesized that Tax induces genomic instability via repression of cellular DNA repair. We examined the effect of de novo Tax expression upon the cell cycle, because appropriate activation of cell cycle checkpoints is essential to a robust damage-repair response. Upon induction of tax expression, Jurkat T-cells displayed a pronounced accumulation in G2/M that was reversible by caffeine. We examined the G2-specific checkpoint signaling response in these cells and found activation of the ATM/chk2-mediated pathway, whereas the ATR/chk1-mediated response was unaffected. Immunoprecipitation with anti-chk2 antibody results in co-precipitation of Tax demonstrating a direct interaction of Tax with a chk2-containing complex. We also show that Tax targets a discrete nuclear site and co-localizes with chk2 and not chk1. This nuclear site, previously identified as Tax Speckled Structures (TSS), also contains the early damage response factor 53BP1. The recruitment of 53BP1 to TSS is dependent upon ATM signaling and requires expression of Tax. Specifically, Tax expression induces redistribution of diffuse nuclear 53BP1 to the TSS foci. Taken together these data suggest that the TSS describe a unique nuclear site involved in DNA damage recognition, repair response, and cell cycle checkpoint activation. We suggest that association of Tax with this multifunctional subnuclear site results in disruption of a subset of the site-specific activities and contributes to cellular genomic instability.","['Haoudi, Abdelali', 'Daniels, Rodney C', 'Wong, Eric', 'Kupfer, Gary', 'Semmes, O John']","['Haoudi A', 'Daniels RC', 'Wong E', 'Kupfer G', 'Semmes OJ']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Biology, Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, Virginia 23501, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TP53BP1 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Checkpoint Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2', '*DNA Damage', 'Enzyme Activation', 'G2 Phase', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Phosphoproteins', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1']",2003/07/05 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/07/05 05:00'],"['2003/07/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Sep 26;278(39):37736-44. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M301649200.

Here, we identify AN34 as an N-terminally truncated form of human AP endonuclease (Ape1) lacking residues 1-35 (delta35-Ape1). Although Ape1 has hitherto been considered specific for damaged DNA (specific to AP site), recombinant AN34 (delta35-Ape1) possesses significant endonuclease activity on undamaged (normal) DNA and in chromatin. AN34 also displays enhanced 3'-5' exonuclease activity. Caspase-3 activates AN34 in a cell-free system, although caspase-3 cannot cleave Ape1 directly in vitro. We also found that Ape1 itself preferentially cleaves damaged chromatin DNA isolated from cells treated with apoptotic stimuli and that silencing of Ape1 expression decreases apoptotic DNA fragmentation in DFF40/CAD-deficient cells.

Forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator, induced an anion-selective channel with a linear current-voltage relationship and a single-channel conductance of 11 pS. This cAMP-activated channel had a Pgluconate/PCl or PF/PCl perm-selectivity ratio of 0.35 and 0.30, respectively, and was inhibited by the CFTR blocker glibenclamide and the anti-CFTR antibody MAb 13-1, when added to the cytoplasmatic side of the patch. Glibenclamide decreased the open probability increasing the frequency of open-to-closed transitions. Addition of 200 microM DIDS caused an irreversible block of the channels when added to the cytosolic side of inside-out patches.

We studied the effects of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) on a novel STI571-resistant CML cell line and its molecular mechanisms in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: KT-1 is a unique CML cell line that remains sensitive to the therapeutic IFN-alpha concentration. We developed novel STI571-resistant KT-1 cells (designated KTR cells) by gradually increasing the concentration of STI571. RESULTS: All seven KTR clones became more sensitive to IFN-alpha than KT-1 cells. IFN-alpha induced more prolonged phosphorylation of Stat1 for 24 hours in all seven KTR clones than in KT-1cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 in KTR cells was not prolonged compared to KT-1cells. T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP) was down-regulated in all KTR clones, and SH-PTP1 phosphatase also was down-regulated in some KTR clones. The transient transduction of TC-PTP cDNA into the KTR subline prevented the IFN-alpha-induced prolonged phosphorylation of Stat1 and recovered the sensitivity against IFN-alpha. These results indicated that the loss of TC-PTP is involved in the IFN-alpha-induced prolonged phosphorylation of Stat1 and in the higher sensitivity to IFN-alpha in KTR cells. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that STI571-resistance does not confer cross-resistance to IFN-alphain KT-1 cells. The loss of TC-PTP contributed to the IFN-alpha-induced prolonged phosphorylation of Stat1 and the higher sensitivity to IFN-alpha in KTR cells.","['Shimizu, Takatsune', 'Miyakawa, Yoshitaka', 'Oda, Atsushi', 'Kizaki, Masahiro', 'Ikeda, Yasuo']","['Shimizu T', 'Miyakawa Y', 'Oda A', 'Kizaki M', 'Ikeda Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",2003/07/05 05:00,2003/08/14 05:00,['2003/07/05 05:00'],"['2003/07/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Jul;31(7):601-8. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00089-4.,,"['S0301472X03000894 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00089-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of the use of two new Hb F-inducing nitrosourea analogues, 2-[3-(2-methyl, 2-nitroso) ureido]-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose (MNGU) and 2-[3-(2-chloroethyl) ureido]-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose (CGU), in combination with HU in K562 cells or erythroid progenitors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After K562 cells were cultured with different concentrations of HU with CGU or MNGU, aliquots of the cells were obtained to determine the total (benzidine-positive) hemoglobin level, number of F cells, and Hb F level. Erythroid progenitor cells of SCD patients and healthy donors were cultured with the optimal drug concentrations, and the number of BFU-E and Hb F level were determined. RESULTS: Our results showed that the combined use of HU with CGU or MNGU increased the number of both benzidine-positive normoblasts and F cells in a synergistic manner. Further, a lower concentration of HU was required to induce a significant level of Hb F synthesis when combined with either of the two compounds in comparison with treatment with HU alone. On day 4, the number of benzidine-positive cells was 4.5- to 6.5-fold and the number of F cells was 5.0- to 8.0-fold higher than the respective numbers in the untreated K562 cells. Similarly, a 3.2- to 14.3-fold induction of Hb F was obtained when human erythroid progenitors from SCD patients were treated with the same drug combinations. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, the use of CGU or MNGU in combination with HU might offer substantial benefits to patients with SCD and other hemoglobinopathies.","['Iyamu, Efemwonkiekie W', 'Adunyah, Samuel E', 'Fasold, Hugo', 'Horiuchi, Kazumi', 'Baliga, Surendra', 'Ohene-Frempong, Kwaku', 'Turner, Ernest A', 'Asakura, Toshio']","['Iyamu EW', 'Adunyah SE', 'Fasold H', 'Horiuchi K', 'Baliga S', 'Ohene-Frempong K', 'Turner EA', 'Asakura T']","[""Division of Hematology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104-4399, USA. iyamu@email.chop.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (2-(3-(2-chloroethyl) ureido)-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose)', '0 (2-(3-(2-methyl, 2-nitroso) ureido)-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose)', '0 (Monosaccharides)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Monosaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Urea/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",2003/07/05 05:00,2003/08/14 05:00,['2003/07/05 05:00'],"['2003/07/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Jul;31(7):592-600. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00105-x.,,"['S0301472X0300105X [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00105-x [doi]']",,,"['2P60 H13832/PHS HHS/United States', 'U24 HL 58930/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor eradication is attributed to a graft-versus-leukemia reaction by the donor-derived cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), but the same cell population may cause severe graft-versus-host disease. One strategy to suppress harmful CTL activity is to incorporate a suicide gene into the donor lymphocytes prior to infusion, and to destroy these cells when they aggressively attack nonmalignant host tissues. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using a Fas-estrogen receptor fusion protein (MfasER) to control T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, based on our previous finding that the chimera transmits a Fas-mediated death signal through activation by estrogen binding. A murine CTL line CTLL-2 was transfected with a vector encoding MfasER, and the growth, viability and cytotoxic activity of the transfected cells (CTLL/MfasER) were analyzed. The expression of apoptosis-related proteins such as Fas ligand and perforin was also investigated. In the absence of estrogen, CTLL/MfasER showed similar growth to parental CTLL-2, and the killing activity was preserved. Addition of 10 (-7) M estrogen induced a rapid apoptosis of CTLL/MfasER, and the cytotoxicity was severely impaired. A decrease of Fas ligand and perforin in the estrogen-treated CTLL/MfasER was seen in an immunoblot analysis. These functional and biochemical analyses showed that the estrogen-inducible apoptosis in MfasER-expressing CTLs rapidly terminated their target cell killing.

Sensitivity to Fas-mediated cell death did not correlate with the expression of Fas in neuroblastoma cells, but was directly associated with the pattern of caspase 8 protein expression. We found that the majority of neuroblastoma cell lines we evaluated lacked caspase 8 expression, and these cell lines were invariably resistant to Fas-mediated cell death. In contrast, cell lines expressing normal caspase 8 protein were quite sensitive to Fas-mediated cell death. More interestingly, a group of cell lines expressing a distinct short form of caspase 8 with splicing out of exon 3 consistently showed moderate sensitivity to Fas-mediated cell death. These results indicate that the profile of caspase 8 expression is an important determinant of the response of neuroblastoma cells to Fas-mediated cell death.","['Kisenge, Rodrick R', 'Toyoda, Hidemi', 'Kang, Jian', 'Tanaka, Shigeki', 'Yamamoto, Hatsumi', 'Azuma, Eiichi', 'Komada, Yoshihiro']","['Kisenge RR', 'Toyoda H', 'Kang J', 'Tanaka S', 'Yamamoto H', 'Azuma E', 'Komada Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",2003/07/05 05:00,2004/01/07 05:00,['2003/07/05 05:00'],"['2003/07/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2003 Jul;94(7):598-605. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2003.tb01489.x.,,['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2003.tb01489.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE SUMMARY: A 2-year-old white boy with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia underwent a bone marrow transplant and developed graft-versus-host disease, which was treated with methylprednisolone. Within 24 hours of initiation of the methylprednisolone, the patient developed symptoms associated with steroid-induced psychosis including mania, head-banging, and excessive crying. Because the corticosteroid could not be discontinued, promethazine, a phenothiazine derivative, was used to treat the psychotic symptoms. Symptoms resolved with use of promethazine. DISCUSSION: A number of published reports describe the appearance of psychological symptoms with corticosteroid use. While the mechanism is unclear, the reaction is usually reversible with dose reduction or discontinuation of the corticosteroid. In cases where this cannot be done, typical treatment involves an antipsychotic medication. Most antipsychotic medications, such as the phenothiazine class, have not been evaluated in very young children. Promethazine is a phenothiazine derivative that has been used in children for a number of nonpsychiatric indications. CONCLUSIONS: Promethazine may be effective in treating steroid-induced psychosis in pediatric patients.","['Ingram, Dena G', 'Hagemann, Tracy M']","['Ingram DG', 'Hagemann TM']","['College of Pharmacy, University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Histamine H1 Antagonists)', 'FF28EJQ494 (Promethazine)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy', 'Histamine H1 Antagonists/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Promethazine/*therapeutic use', 'Psychoses, Substance-Induced/*drug therapy']",2003/07/05 05:00,2003/09/04 05:00,['2003/07/05 05:00'],"['2003/07/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2003 Jul-Aug;37(7-8):1036-9. doi: 10.1345/aph.1A271.,,['10.1345/aph.1A271 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 62 cases of AML, the positive coincidence rate was 73% with MTT test and the negative coincidence rate was 70%. In 3 commonly used drugs, if one drug showed sensitivity, the coincidence remission rate reached 71%. In 51 cases of AML, there were 31 patients in the group of complete remission (CR), in which CFU-L of 29 patients showed independent growth. CFU-L of 2 patients showed no growth. However, there were 20 patients in the group of non-remission (NR), in which CFU-L of 14 patients showed independent growth. CFU-L of 6 patients showed non-growth pattern. Statistical analysis showed significant difference (P < 0.05). In 32 cases of AML, the expression rate of Bcl-2 was 59.55% +/- 19.56% in drug-sensitive group, and one was 77.36% +/- 11.91% in drug-resistant group, respectively (P < 0.05).

Meanwhile, 1 patient showed right-shift of main peak (RSMP) in 3 patients. They were diagnosed as re-growth drug resistance. It is concluded that MTT and CFU-L might be used for prediction of drug sensitivity or resistance when patients were on treatment. Bcl-2 and ratio of Bcl-2/Bax might be associated with the prognosis.

Our results showed that the clonal growth of K562 cells in semi-solid culture was dependent on exogenous serum. The K562 could be grown in SFC supplemented with 4 major replacing substances. The multifactor and multilevel orthogonal experiment demonstrated that the colony formation was statistically influenced by the 4 replacing substances at various concentrations (P < 0.01). Among them, bovine serum albumin had greatest effect on clonal growth of K562 cells with the optimal concentration being 15 mg/L, followed by transferring, cholesterol and insulin with their optimal concentrations being of 150 mg/L, 7.8 mg/L and 7.0 mg/L respectively. SFC system was formed with the 4 substances at their optimal concentrations. Colony formation of the blast cells in 10 patients with acute myeloid leukemia was observed in this SFC system. There was a heterogeneity of acute myeloid leukemia cells among the 10 patients in response to the growth substances. In SFC system, there was a linear relationship between the number of the clonal formation and the count of the added cells, indicating the colony growth of the cells. Primary acute leukemia cells maintained in SFC system in 10 cases could completely form clones. The colony formation number in some cases in SFC system was more than that of the serum-containing culture.

High-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation has been reported to be effective in the adjuvant setting for patients at high risk for relapse. METHODS: We randomly assigned 540 female patients with primary breast cancer and at least 10 involved ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes to receive either six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) or the same adjuvant chemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and thiotepa and autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. RESULTS: Among the 511 eligible patients, there was no significant difference in disease-free survival, overall survival, or the time to recurrence between those who received CAF alone and those who received CAF plus high-dose chemotherapy and stem-cell transplantation. Among 417 patients fulfilling strict eligibility criteria, the time to recurrence was longer for patients who underwent stem-cell transplantation than for those who received CAF alone. In the transplantation group, nine patients died of transplantation-related complications and a myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia developed in nine. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation to six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with CAF may reduce the risk of relapse but does not improve the outcome among patients with primary breast cancer and at least 10 involved axillary lymph nodes. Conventional-dose adjuvant chemotherapy remains the standard of care for such patients.","['Tallman, Martin S', 'Gray, Robert', 'Robert, Nicholas J', 'LeMaistre, Charles F', 'Osborne, C Kent', 'Vaughan, William P', 'Gradishar, William J', 'Pisansky, Thomas M', 'Fetting, John', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Lazarus, Hillard M']","['Tallman MS', 'Gray R', 'Robert NJ', 'LeMaistre CF', 'Osborne CK', 'Vaughan WP', 'Gradishar WJ', 'Pisansky TM', 'Fetting J', 'Paietta E', 'Lazarus HM']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Robert H.

Three subtypes of HP1, namely HP1alpha, beta, and gamma, have been identified in humans. In this study, using yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusion constructs, we examined the intracellular localization of human HP1 subtypes during the cell cycle. During interphase, all three HP1 subtypes were localized to centromeric heterochromatin and to promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies. Different preferences, however, were observed among the subtypes: during interphase HP1beta localized most preferentially to centromeric heterochromatin, whereas HP1alpha and gamma were more preferentially localized to PML nuclear bodies. During metaphase, only HP1alpha, was localized to the centromere. We thus determined which molecular domains of HP1 were necessary for their intracellular localization. Our results showed that the C-terminal fragment (amino acid residues 101-180) of HP1alpha was necessary for localization to the metaphase centromere and the N-terminal fragment (amino acid residues 1-76) of HP1beta was necessary for localization to the interphase centromere. Interestingly, simultaneous observations of residues 101-180 of HP1alpha and residues 1-76 of HP1beta in living HeLa cells revealed that during late prophase, the HP1beta fragment dissociated from centromeric regions and the HP1alpha fragment accumulated in centromeric regions. These results indicate that different specific regions of human HP1alpha and HP1beta mediate localization to metaphase and interphase centromeric regions resulting in association of different subtypes of HP1 with the centromere at different times during the cell cycle.","['Hayakawa, Tomohiro', 'Haraguchi, Tokuko', 'Masumoto, Hiroshi', 'Hiraoka, Yasushi']","['Hayakawa T', 'Haraguchi T', 'Masumoto H', 'Hiraoka Y']","['CREST Research Project, Kansai Advanced Research Center, Communications Research Laboratory, 588-2 Iwaoka, Iwaoka-cho, Nishi-ku, Kobe 651-2492, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (CBX1 protein, human)', '0 (CBX5 protein, human)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Heterochromatin)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '107283-02-3 (Chromobox Protein Homolog 5)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Centromere/*metabolism', 'Chromobox Protein Homolog 5', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*metabolism', 'Chromosomes/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'HeLa Cells', 'Heterochromatin/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interphase/*physiology', 'Metaphase/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",2003/07/04 05:00,2004/05/20 05:00,['2003/07/04 05:00'],"['2003/07/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/04 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2003 Aug 15;116(Pt 16):3327-38. doi: 10.1242/jcs.00635.

Donor T cells that accompany stem cell grafts cause GVHD by attacking recipient tissues; therefore, all patients receive GVHD prophylaxis by depletion of T cells from the allograft or through immunosuppressant drugs. In addition to providing a graft-versus-leukemia effect, donor T cells are critical for reconstituting T cell-mediated immunity. Ideally, immunity to infectious agents would be transferred from donor to host without GVHD. Most donors have been exposed to common pathogens and have an increased precursor frequency of memory T cells against pathogenic antigens. We therefore asked whether memory CD62L-CD44+ CD4+ T cells would induce less GVHD than unfractionated or naive CD4+ T cells. Strikingly, we found that memory CD4 cells induced neither clinical nor histologic GVHD. This effect was not due to the increased number of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells found in the CD62L-CD44+ fraction because memory T cells depletion of these cells did not cause GVHD. Memory CD4 cells engrafted and responded to antigen both in vivo and in vitro. If these murine results are applicable to human alloSCT, selective administration of memory T cells could greatly improve post-transplant immune reconstitution.","['Anderson, Britt E', 'McNiff, Jennifer', 'Yan, Jun', 'Doyle, Hester', 'Mamula, Mark', 'Shlomchik, Mark J', 'Shlomchik, Warren D']","['Anderson BE', 'McNiff J', 'Yan J', 'Doyle H', 'Mamula M', 'Shlomchik MJ', 'Shlomchik WD']","['Sections of Immunobiology,Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/analysis', '*Immunologic Memory', 'L-Selectin/analysis', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis']",2003/07/04 05:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2003/07/04 05:00'],"['2003/07/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/04 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2003 Jul;112(1):101-8. doi: 10.1172/JCI17601.,,"['10.1172/JCI17601 [doi]', '112/1/101 [pii]']",,,"['R01 HL066279/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HL03979-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL66279/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI07109-23-25/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,['J Clin Invest. 2003 Jul;112(1):25-7.

MS-275 displayed dose-dependent effects in each of the cell lines. When administered at a low concentration (e.g., 1 micro M), MS-275 exhibited potent antiproliferative activity, inducing p21(CIP1/WAF1)-mediated growth arrest and expression of differentiation markers (CD11b) in U937 cells. These events were accompanied by an increase in hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein and down-regulation of cell cycle-related proteins including cyclin D1. However, at higher concentrations (e.g., 5 micro M), MS-275 potently induced cell death, triggering apoptosis in approximately 70% of cells at 48 h. In contrast to other HDAC inhibitors such as apicidin, the extrinsic, receptor-mediated pathway played a minimal role in MS-275 lethality. However, MS-275 potently induced a very early (e.g., within 2 h) increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), followed by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi(m)) and cytosolic release of cytochrome c. These events culminated in activation of the caspase cascade, manifested by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, p21(CIP1/WAF1), p27(KIP), Bcl-2, and retinoblastoma protein degradation. MS-275 exposure also resulted in diminished expression of cyclin D1 and the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and XIAP. Administration of the free radical scavenger L-N-acetylcysteine blocked MS-275-mediated mitochondrial injury and apoptosis, suggesting a primary role for ROS generation in MS-275-associated lethality. Lastly, U937 cells stably expressing a p21(CIP1/WAF1) antisense construct were significantly more sensitive to MS-275-mediated apoptosis than controls, but they were impaired in their differentiation response. Together, these findings demonstrate that MS-275 exerts dose-dependent effects in human leukemia cells, i.e., p21(CIP1/WAF1)-dependent growth arrest and differentiation at low drug concentrations and a marked induction of ROS, mitochondrial damage, caspase activation, and apoptosis at higher concentrations.","['Rosato, Roberto R', 'Almenara, Jorge A', 'Grant, Steven']","['Rosato RR', 'Almenara JA', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '1ZNY4FKK9H (entinostat)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",2003/07/04 05:00,2003/08/26 05:00,['2003/07/04 05:00'],"['2003/07/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/04 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 Jul 1;63(13):3637-45.,,,,,"['CA 63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 93798/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 98 children, aged 1.3-17.3 y, with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) were studied on day 1 of induction therapy. Plasma samples were drawn before and 10, 30, 360 and 1380 min after injection of vincristine 2.0 mg/m2 (maximum dose 2.0 mg) and analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The median value (and range) for distribution half-life was 6.4 min (0.8-11.8), elimination half-life 1014 min (258-2570), volume of distribution 445 L/m2 (137-1241) and total body clearance 362 ml/min/m2 (134-2553). No correlation was found between age and any of these pharmacokinetic parameters. The area under the concentration time curve (AUC) was significantly correlated to age (p = 0.002; p - 0.31), as expected from the dosage of vincristine. The lower AUC in children with a body surface area > 1 m2, which is reached at 8-9 y of age, indicates that they received a less intense treatment because of the capping of the vincristine dose at 2.0 mg. CONCLUSIONS: Vincristine pharmacokinetics were not age dependent in this paediatric population. Thus, we found no pharmacokinetic rationale for dose reduction in adolescents. The common practice of limiting the vincristine dose to 2.0 mg should be carefully reconsidered.","['Frost, B M', 'Lonnerholm, G', 'Koopmans, P', 'Abrahamsson, J', 'Behrendtz, M', 'Castor, A', 'Forestier, E', 'Uges, D R A', 'de Graaf, S S N']","['Frost BM', 'Lonnerholm G', 'Koopmans P', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Behrendtz M', 'Castor A', 'Forestier E', 'Uges DR', 'de Graaf SS']","[""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University Children's Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Norway,Acta Paediatr,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",9205968,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Area Under Curve', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",2003/07/04 05:00,2003/12/12 05:00,['2003/07/04 05:00'],"['2003/07/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/04 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Paediatr. 2003 May;92(5):551-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cumulative 5-year incidences of relapse and transplant-related mortality were 37 and 17%, respectively. The actuarial 5-year probability of disease-free survival (DFS) was 46%. In Cox analysis, favorable karyotypes, increasing numbers of consolidation cycles (0 vs > or =1 or 1 vs >1), and higher nucleated cell doses were associated with lower relapse rates and higher DFS. Patients with favorable karyotypes benefited from every additional cycle of consolidation therapy (0 vs > or =1 as well as 1 vs >1). Among patients with other karyotypes, while the benefit of one cycle of consolidation was clear (0 vs > or =1), there was no obvious beneficial impact of further consolidation therapy (1 vs >1). Administration of consolidation chemotherapy prior to harvest is essential in AML. While it is possible to enhance the benefit of consolidation with favorable karyotypes by delivering two cycles, its usefulness is limited in others. In them, it may be worthwhile exploring alternatives not normally used in AML (eg high-dose cyclophosphamide) that could have antileukemic effects while permitting mobilization of stem cells.","['Mehta, J', 'Powles, R', 'Sirohi, B', 'Treleaven, J', 'Swansbury, G J', 'Kulkarni, S', 'Saso, R', 'Singhal, S']","['Mehta J', 'Powles R', 'Sirohi B', 'Treleaven J', 'Swansbury GJ', 'Kulkarni S', 'Saso R', 'Singhal S']","['The Royal Marsden Hospital and the Institute for Cancer Research, Downs Road, Sutton, Surrey SM2 5PT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods/mortality', '*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/methods/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', '*Transplantation, Homologous/methods/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/07/03 05:00,2004/03/25 05:00,['2003/07/03 05:00'],"['2003/07/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2003 Jul;32(2):157-64. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1704119.,,"['10.1038/sj.bmt.1704119 [doi]', '1704119 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conditioning was with fludarabine, antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and busulfan for the first 11 patients, whereas fludarabine, busulfan and TBI were used for the remaining six patients. Engraftment was prompt in most of the cases. Complications and need for supportive therapy in the immediate post-transplant period were reduced drastically. Only two patients (both in the TBI group) died within the first 100 days. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade II-IV was seen in seven patients. Complications occurred later on. Chronic GVHD was observed in 11/17 patients. Lung infection and GVHD were the major killers. In surviving patients, after a median follow-up of 30 months (range 37-21 months), 6/17 (35.3%) are alive. Five are disease free and one patient is still in relapse even after a second donor lymphocyte infusion. Total treatment time and cost were more than with conventional transplants.

The growth inhibitory effect of PB-2 was more pronounced in leukemia cell lines K562 and U937, the GI(50) concentrations being about 12.5 microM established after 48 h incubation differed significantly (P<0.05) from those of LN229 and normal human astrocytes (103.1 and 96.7 microM), respectively. Further, HP and hypericin (HY) (a naphthodianthrone from St John's wort) acted synergistically in their inhibitory effect on leukemic (K562, U937) cell growth. Cell death occurred after 24 h treatment with HP and PB-2 by apoptosis. A dose-dependent loss of membrane phospholipid asymmetry associated with apoptosis was induced in all cell lines as evidenced by the externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) and morphological changes in cell size and granulosity by scatter characteristics. In leukemia U937 cells, HP increased the activity of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and in K562 cells caspase-8 and caspase-3. In addition, the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk inhibited both the appearance of PS exposure and the activation of caspases, illustrating the functional relevance of caspase activation during HP-induced apoptosis. Cytocidal effects of HP and its cooperation with HY on tumor growth inhibition in a synergistic manner make the St John's wort an interesting option in cancer warranting further in vitro and in vivo investigation.","['Hostanska, Katarina', 'Reichling, Juergen', 'Bommer, Silvia', 'Weber, Michel', 'Saller, Reinhard']","['Hostanska K', 'Reichling J', 'Bommer S', 'Weber M', 'Saller R']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. katarina.hostanska@access.unizh.ch']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharm Biopharm,European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,9109778,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Biflavonoids)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proanthocyanidins)', '0 (Terpenes)', '29106-49-8 (procyanidin B2)', '4852-22-6 (procyanidin)', '5QD5427UN7 (Perylene)', '7V2F1075HD (hypericin)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'DHD7FFG6YS (Phloroglucinol)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'RM741E34FP (hyperforin)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/pharmacology', 'Anthracenes', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Astrocytes/drug effects', '*Biflavonoids', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Catechin/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hypericum/*chemistry', 'Perylene/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Phloroglucinol/analogs & derivatives', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', '*Proanthocyanidins', 'Terpenes/*pharmacology']",2003/07/03 05:00,2004/02/26 05:00,['2003/07/03 05:00'],"['2003/07/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharm Biopharm. 2003 Jul;56(1):121-32. doi: 10.1016/s0939-6411(03)00046-8.,,"['S0939641103000468 [pii]', '10.1016/s0939-6411(03)00046-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RING finger proteins have been implicated in a variety of functions including oncogenesis, viral replication, and developmental processes. Since no germ cell line is presently available to study the function of RNF36, in this research, we expressed RNF36 truncated and full-length proteins in COS-7 and HEK-293 cell lines to study the effect of RNF36 in somatic cells. The full-length RNF36 protein in both cell lines showed a speckled pattern in the nucleus. Truncated RNF36-1 protein with its putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) remained within the nucleus but lost the speckled pattern. The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, another RING finger protein, was previously identified as present in the nucleus with a speckled pattern. Double-staining and coimmunoprecipitation analyses suggested that RNF36 colocalizes and interacts with PML. In vitro phosphorylation analysis further suggested that RNF36 nuclear localization is under the control of phosphorylation, which might be mediated by p38. Treatment with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 resulted in the cytoplasmic translocation of RNF36. Overexpression of full-length RNF36 in cells induced about half of the transfected cells to undergo cell death. The results of DNA fragmentation assays, flow cytometry assay, and TUNEL staining suggest that the death of RNF36-transfected cells was caused by apoptosis. Following further characterization of the molecular mechanism of RNF36-induced apoptosis, we found that the expression of Bax, caspase-2, and receptor-interacting protein were elevated upon RNF36 induction in test cells. These results suggest that RNF36 may interact with PML and induce cell apoptosis. We suspect that RNF36 may play a role in germ cell homeostasis during spermatogenesis.","['Shyu, Huey-Wen', 'Hsu, Shih-Hsien', 'Hsieh-Li, Hsiu-Mei', 'Li, Hung']","['Shyu HW', 'Hsu SH', 'Hsieh-Li HM', 'Li H']","['Graduate Institute of Life Science, National Defense Medical Center, National Defense University, and Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM69 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Trim69 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'COS Cells', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Inclusion Bodies/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics/*physiology', 'Zinc Fingers/*genetics', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2003/07/03 05:00,2003/08/16 05:00,['2003/07/03 05:00'],"['2003/07/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2003 Jul 15;287(2):301-13. doi: 10.1016/s0014-4827(03)00110-1.,,"['S0014482703001101 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-4827(03)00110-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular and biological bases for these physiological phenomena are not well understood. The findings that viruses transcribe their genomes adjacent to PML bodies and that nascent RNA accumulates at their periphery have suggested that PML bodies are transcription-permissible domains. To investigate the role of PML bodies in regulation of cell transformation and apoptosis-related gene transcription, we employed the immuno-FISH method to examine the relationship between PML bodies and the TP53 and BCL2 gene loci. PML bodies were found to localize specifically with the TP53 locus in about 50% of Jurkat interphase nuclei, but never in proximity with the BCL2 locus. We speculate that PML bodies may interact directly with the TP53 DNA sequence to regulate TP53 gene expression.","['Sun, Yujie', 'Durrin, Linda K', 'Krontiris, Theodore G']","['Sun Y', 'Durrin LK', 'Krontiris TG']","['Division of Molecular Medicine, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope National Medical Center, 1500 E.

The discovery that some of these genes were located at the breakpoints of chromosome rearrangements in human malignancies, such as the MYC gene in Burkitt's lymphoma and the ABL gene in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has suggested that chromosome abnormalities were causally implicated in the pathogenesis of human diseases. Numerous nonrandom somatically acquired chromosomal translocations or inversions have been identified in human leukemias. The molecular cloning of the genes located at the breakpoints of these rearrangements allowed to identify more than 100 new oncogenes, the products of which affect normal programs of cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Chromosome translocations can lead to the deregulated expression of a normal gene product, but in most cases of leukemia, chromosome rearrangements result in the expression of a chimeric fusion protein. Oncogene products associated with acute leukemias are often transcription factors while tyrosine kinases and antiapoptotic proteins are more commonly activated or overexpressed in chronic leukemias and in lymphomas. Recent data indicated that gene rearrangements were not the sole gene alterations occurring in human leukemia since point mutations could also affect the function of transcription factors playing a key role in hematopoiesis such as C/EBP alpha, GATA1 and AML1. But the most exciting finding was the discovery of activating point mutations in tyrosine kinase receptors such as FLT3 and c-KIT in acute leukemia. Treatment of leukemia could therefore benefit from new therapeutic approaches targeting the function of specific oncogene products as already demonstrated for CML and acute promyelocytic leukemia.","['Gisselbrecht, Sylvie']",['Gisselbrecht S'],"[""Departement d'Hematologie de l'Institut Cochin, Inserm U.567, Cnrs UMR 8104, Batiment Gustave Roussy, 27, rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques, 75014 Paris, France. gisselbrecht@cochin.inserm.fr""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",France,Med Sci (Paris),Medecine sciences : M/S,8710980,,IM,"['Cytogenetics/*history', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*history', '*Oncogenes']",2003/07/03 05:00,2003/07/16 05:00,['2003/07/03 05:00'],"['2003/07/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Sci (Paris). 2003 Feb;19(2):201-10. doi: 10.1051/medsci/2003192201.,,"['000689ar [pii]', '10.1051/medsci/2003192201 [doi]']",,,,45,,,,Oncogenes et leucemies: historique et perspectives.,,,,,,,,,

Our aim was to study the utility of sTfR under 'everyday conditions' as seen in a geriatric hospital in the following groups of patients: First, in a pilot group of 99 multimorbid geriatric patients (85 women, 14 men; 82.00 +/- 6.32 years) admitted for rehabilitation after recent surgical treatment of a bone fracture; second, in 677 geriatric patients (506 women, 171 men; 79.17 +/- 11.47 years) with different diagnoses admitted to a department of internal medicine; third, in some remarkable clinical cases in order to illustrate the diagnostic limits of sTfR. In general, both genders showed a remarkable age-dependent decrease in erythropoiesis. In patients with haemoglobin levels below 12.0 mg/dL, this parameter correlated significantly with sTfR. However, this was seen only in women, not in men. Moreover, an age-dependent increase in sTfR was seen in women, while in men it remained almost constant. Based on these findings, we conclude that there is a different, gender-specific aetiology of iron deficiency in the elderly. About 30% of patients of both genders simultaneously had low haemoglobin levels and low sTfR. This was interpreted as 'adaptation' or 'tolerance' to the iron deficiency. This was illustrated by a clinical case of megaloblastic anaemia: Initially low sTfR rose only during the vitamin B12 substitution and normalized after recovery. We conclude that sTfR provides an insight into the 'dynamics' of iron metabolism: A rise in sTfR indicates an 'acute readiness to refill iron stores', while a low (non-stimulated) sTfR level corresponds to the quite frequent adaptation to iron deficiency and/or inhibition of resorption. Finally, extremely high sTfR levels were observed in some cases of malignancy such as in acute leukaemia and in hypernephroma. Thus, increased sTfR levels can be caused by paraneoplastic effects.","['Bohmer, Franz', 'Fruhwald, Thomas', 'Lapin, Alexander']","['Bohmer F', 'Fruhwald T', 'Lapin A']","['Centre of Social Medicine, Sophienspital, Apollogasse 19, A-1070 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Austria,Wien Med Wochenschr,Wiener medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),8708475,"['0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Adaptation, Physiological/physiology', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Iron-Deficiency/blood/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Erythropoiesis/physiology', 'Female', 'Hemoglobinometry', 'Humans', 'Iron/*blood', 'Male', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*blood', 'Reference Values', 'Sex Factors']",2003/07/03 05:00,2003/11/05 05:00,['2003/07/03 05:00'],"['2003/07/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Wien Med Wochenschr. 2003;153(9-10):232-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1563-258x.2003.02104.x.,,['10.1046/j.1563-258x.2003.02104.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The review is based on human experimental and epidemiological studies investigating the effects of radiation in the frequency range between 100 kHz and 10 GHz. The relevant studies were identified via systematic searches of the databases Medline and ISI Web of Science. The review concludes that the existing scientific knowledge base is too limited to draw final conclusions on the health risk from exposure in the low-dose range. Only few studies have investigated the effect of long-term exposure on the general population in the normal environment. Accordingly, little can be predicted regarding long-term health risks. Various studies observed an increased risk for tumours in the hematopoietic and lymphatic tissue of people living in the proximity of TV and radio broadcast transmitters. However, methodological limitations to these studies have been identified and their findings are controversial. In studies of a possible association between brain tumours and mobile phone use, the average period mobile phones use was short compared to the known latency period of brain tumours. Although these studies did not establish an overall increased risk of brain tumours associated with mobile phone use, there were some indications of an association. Immediate effects associated with mobile phone use have been observed in human experimental studies that cannot be explained by conventional thermal mechanisms. The observed effects are within the normal physiological range and are therefore hard to interpret with respect to an increased risk to health. However, it can be concluded that mechanisms other than the established thermal mechanisms exist. Because of the present fragmentary scientific database, a precautionary approach when dealing with radio and microwave frequency radiation is recommended for the individual and the general population.","['Roosli, M', 'Rapp, R', 'Braun-Fahrlander, C']","['Roosli M', 'Rapp R', 'Braun-Fahrlander C']","['Institut fur Sozial- und Praventivmedizin der Universitat Basel, Switzerland.

Between August 1997 and October 1998, 12 consecutive adult patients (>18 years) with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (four patients in first early relapse, seven patients with secondary AML, and one patient with de novo AML concomitant to a lymphoproliferative disorder) were enrolled to receive a single course of HY (100 mg/kg per day) until bone marrow aplasia or for a maximum of 30 days. Of the 12 patients, 5 (41.6%) achieved complete remission (CR), 1 achieved partial remission (PR), 4 were resistant to treatment, and 2 died during induction from infection. No patient with relapsed AML achieved CR, while it was achieved by five of eight patients with secondary AML at diagnosis; five of six MDR1+ patients achieved CR. As concerns follow-up of the CR patients, one did not receive any further treatment and died in CR from pulmonary aspergillosis, and one with a concomitant chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) received two courses of FLAG (fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) regimen with disappearance of the clonal Ig rearrangement, but relapsed after 11 months and died from pneumonia. The remaining three patients were consolidated with two courses of high-dose cytosine arabinoside (AraC), followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) in one patient. One of them relapsed after 3 months, while the other two are still in continuous complete remission (CCR) after 16 and 28 months, respectively. This study has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of HHY in inducing CR in AML patients with unfavorable prognosis. Despite the small number of patients, these encouraging results warrant further studies.","['Petti, M C', 'Tafuri, A', 'Latagliata, R', 'Aloe Spiriti, M A', 'Montefusco, E', 'Mancini, M', 'Meloni, G', 'Petrucci, M T', 'Spadea, A', 'Redi, R', 'Alimena, G', 'Mandelli, F']","['Petti MC', 'Tafuri A', 'Latagliata R', 'Aloe Spiriti MA', 'Montefusco E', 'Mancini M', 'Meloni G', 'Petrucci MT', 'Spadea A', 'Redi R', 'Alimena G', 'Mandelli F']","['Sezione di Ematologia, Istituto Regina Elena, IFO, Italy. rob.lati@libero.it.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita ""La Sapienza"", Rome, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita ""La Sapienza"", Rome, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita ""La Sapienza"", Rome, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita ""La Sapienza"", Rome, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita ""La Sapienza"", Rome, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita ""La Sapienza"", Rome, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita ""La Sapienza"", Rome, Italy.', 'Sezione di Ematologia, Istituto Regina Elena, IFO, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita ""La Sapienza"", Rome, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita ""La Sapienza"", Rome, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita ""La Sapienza"", Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, MDR', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/drug therapy/etiology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/07/02 05:00,2003/10/01 05:00,['2003/07/02 05:00'],"['2003/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2003/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/01 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2003 Aug;82(8):476-480. doi: 10.1007/s00277-003-0693-2.

Toward this end, we have developed a two-stage multiplexing assay of broad applicability, which combines multiplex polymerase chain reaction with multiplex detection on spectrally addressable liquid bead microarrays. Using pediatric lymphoblastic leukemia as a model system, we demonstrate that all seven of the fusion transcripts resulting from risk-stratifying chromosomal translocations can be assayed in a single well of a 96-well multiplate with 100% specificity and sensitivity, within 6 h of specimen collection. The assay is automatic and high throughput and represents a significant improvement over previously available assays targeting the same genetic changes.

Consequently, they are detected in precursor-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias both at diagnosis and relapse. Incomplete DJH rearrangements have also been occasionally reported in mature B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, but their frequency and immunobiological characteristics have not been studied in detail. We have investigated the frequency and characteristics of incomplete DJH as well as complete VDJH rearrangements in a series of 84 untreated multiple myeloma (MM) patients. The overall detection rate of clonality by amplifying VDJH and DJH rearrangements using family-specific primers was 94%. Interestingly, we found a high frequency (60%) of DJH rearrangements in this group. As expected from an immunological point of view, the vast majority of DJH rearrangements (88%) were unmutated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study describing the incidence of incomplete DJH rearrangements in a series of unselected MM patients. These results strongly support the use of DJH rearrangements as PCR targets for clonality studies and, particularly, for quantification of minimal residual disease by real-time quantitative PCR using consensus JH probes in MM patients. The finding of hypermutation in a small proportion of incomplete DJH rearrangements (six out of 50) suggests important biological implications concerning the process of somatic hypermutation. Moreover, our data offer a new insight in the regulatory development model of IGH rearrangements.","['Gonzalez, D', 'Balanzategui, A', 'Garcia-Sanz, R', 'Gutierrez, N', 'Seabra, C', 'van Dongen, J J M', 'Gonzalez, M', 'San Miguel, J F']","['Gonzalez D', 'Balanzategui A', 'Garcia-Sanz R', 'Gutierrez N', 'Seabra C', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Gonzalez M', 'San Miguel JF']","['1Hematology Department, University Hospital of Salamanca, Paseo San Vicente, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['EC 3.1.- (Exonucleases)'],IM,"['Clone Cells', 'Exonucleases/metabolism', 'Gene Frequency', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/immunology', 'Mutation', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin']",2003/07/02 05:00,2003/08/09 05:00,['2003/07/02 05:00'],"['2003/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jul;17(7):1398-403. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402964.,,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2402964 [doi]', '2402964 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These translocations occur in the nontranslated region of the BCL6 gene, juxtaposing regulatory sequences of the diverse partner genes to the open reading frame of the BCL6 gene and thus are thought to deregulate BCL6 gene expression. The levels of expression of the BCL6 gene and protein have been demonstrated to predict the clinical outcome of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. By contrast, the prognostic significance of BCL6 gene translocations is unclear. In this study we have sought an explanation for this apparent discrepancy. We examined tumors with a variety of different BCL6 translocations and therefore with a variety of potentially substituted promoters. We found no increase in total BCL6 mRNA levels in the NHL specimens harboring BCL6 gene translocation. Indeed, some of these tumors expressed relatively low quantities of the BCL6 mRNA. We also sought to determine whether BCL6 transcription occurs from the rearranged or from the normal untranslocated allele in these tumors. We demonstrate that lymphoma cell lines and majority of NHL tumor specimens expressed BCL6 mRNA predominantly from the rearranged allele that may come under the control of various partner gene promoters. However, few NHL tumors with BCL6 gene translocations expressed BCL6 mRNA equally from the rearranged and the nonrearranged alleles. Neither the nature of the substituted promoters nor the presence of activating mutations in the BCL6 regulatory sequences correlated with the allelic expression of the BCL6 gene in these tumors.","['Lossos, I S', 'Akasaka, T', 'Martinez-Climent, J A', 'Siebert, R', 'Levy, R']","['Lossos IS', 'Akasaka T', 'Martinez-Climent JA', 'Siebert R', 'Levy R']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA 94305-5151, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Alleles', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Repressor Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/07/02 05:00,2003/08/09 05:00,['2003/07/02 05:00'],"['2003/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jul;17(7):1390-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402997.,,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2402997 [doi]', '2402997 [pii]']",,,"['CA33399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In conjunction with other diagnostic determinants, immunophenotypic analysis of differentially expressed cell surface markers, such as CD5, CD20, CD23 and FMC7, is useful in the subclassification of lymphomas and leukemias arising from the B-cell lineage. Recent evidence suggesting that CD20 predicts FMC7 expression has prompted reappraisal of the utility of monitoring both markers. Here, we report that the FMC7 monoclonal antibody (mAb) specifically and strongly recognized CD20 ectopically expressed in hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell lines. The reactivity of FMC7 was abolished by mutations in the extracellular domain of CD20. These data confirm the CD20 specificity of FMC7. Like other CD20 mAbs, FMC7 binding was temperature dependent and induced detergent insolubility of CD20. Of significant interest, the CD20 epitope recognized by FMC7 was unusual in that it was exceptionally sensitive to membrane cholesterol. Cholesterol depletion profoundly reduced expression of the FMC7 epitope, whereas cholesterol enrichment enhanced its expression. FMC7 mAb binding thus appears to be a sensitive indicator of the level of plasma membrane cholesterol and reveals a conformational state of CD20 that is regulated by cholesterol.","['Polyak, M J', 'Ayer, L M', 'Szczepek, A J', 'Deans, J P']","['Polyak MJ', 'Ayer LM', 'Szczepek AJ', 'Deans JP']","['Immunology Research Group, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (MS4A1 protein, human)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens, CD20/*analysis/genetics/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Cholesterol/*pharmacology', '*Epitopes/analysis', 'Glycoproteins/*analysis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/07/02 05:00,2003/08/09 05:00,['2003/07/02 05:00'],"['2003/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jul;17(7):1384-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402978.,,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2402978 [doi]', '2402978 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human Jurkat and Molt-4 cell lines were used to optimize the purging process in umbilical cord blood (UCB) mononuclear cells. The Jurkat cell line was TRAIL sensitive and TRAIL-resistant Molt-4 cell line became sensitive after being treated with TRAIL and a low dose of doxorubicin (0.1 micro M), but UCB mononuclear cells remained resistant. DR4 expression was increased when Jurkat cells were treated with TRAIL, and DR5 expression increased after exposing Molt-4 cells to TRAIL plus a low dose of doxorubicin for 24 h. The expression of DR4 and DR5 in UCB mononuclear cells was unchanged after treatment with TRAIL, a low-dose doxorubicin, or TRAIL plus a low dose of doxorubicin. In TRAIL-sensitive Jurkat cells, caspases 8, 9, 3, and 7 were activated by TRAIL treatment and activation of caspases was augmented by TRAIL plus a low dose of doxorubicin than TRAIL or a low dose of doxorubicin alone in Molt-4 cells. Experiments involving mixture of UCB mononuclear cells and Jurkat or Molt-4 cells showed a marked eradication of leukemia cells and the limiting dilution assay demonstrated an eradication rate of more than 4 logs after 24 h incubation with 100 ng/ml of TRAIL in Jurkat cells.

Here, we compare Notch expression and the effects of Jagged-1 treatment on highly purified subfractions of primitive CD34+ and CD34- human hematopoietic cells. Unlike response of cultured CD34+ cells, Jagged-1 treatment did not enhance the proliferation of CD34- cells, or promote differentiation of CD34- cells into CD34+ cells. While CD34+ and AC133-CD34- cells were shown to express all known forms of Notch receptors, Notch-3 and Notch-4 were not detected in AC133+CD34- cells. Similarly, CD34+ progeny of differentiated CD34- cells did not upregulate Notch-3 or Notch-4 upon differentiation, although transcripts for these genes were expressed in CD34+ arising from CD34+ CD38- parents, suggesting that the Notch receptor expression is tightly and differentially controlled. Fringe, known to inhibit Notch signaling in response to specific Notch ligands, was expressed in parent CD34- and CD34+ cells as well as their CD34+ progeny. We suggest that the inability of primitive CD34- cells to positively respond to Jagged-1 may be due in part to the absence of Notch-3 and Notch-4. Taken together, our study illustrates functional distinctiveness of the primitive CD34- subsets to CD34+ counterparts in relation to Jagged-1 response, and represents the first demonstration of a molecular difference among de novo isolated CD34+ compared to in vitro generated CD34+ cells arising from primitive CD34- or CD34+ parents.","['Karanu, F N', 'Yuefei, L', 'Gallacher, L', 'Sakano, S', 'Bhatia, M']","['Karanu FN', 'Yuefei L', 'Gallacher L', 'Sakano S', 'Bhatia M']","['Robarts Research Institute, Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, London, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (JAG1 protein, human)', '0 (Jagged-1 Protein)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH4 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Notch4)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Ser protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Serrate-Jagged Proteins)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.222 (fng protein, Drosophila)']",IM,"['*Antigens, CD34', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drosophila Proteins', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Jagged-1 Protein', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Proteins/*physiology', 'N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases/analysis', 'Proteins/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptor, Notch4', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Notch', 'Serrate-Jagged Proteins']",2003/07/02 05:00,2003/08/09 05:00,['2003/07/02 05:00'],"['2003/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jul;17(7):1366-74. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402973.,,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2402973 [doi]', '2402973 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study further characterizes the biochemical mechanism for HLA-DR-mediated programmed cell death of tumor cells. Phosphatidylserine exposure on the plasma membrane and propidium iodide incorporation occur with very rapid kinetics and are observed as early as 10 min after the induction of cell death with anti-HLA-DR. In striking contrast to anti-CD95, we observe no activation of caspase-3, -8, or -9 upon anti-HLA-DR addition. Furthermore, the irreversible caspase inhibitor Z-VAD.fmk also failed to inhibit anti-HLA-DR-mediated cell death, further supporting the conclusion that HLA-DR induces cell death via a caspase-independent mechanism. We demonstrate that anti-HLA-DR-induced cell death is instead associated with a rapid disruption of the inner mitochondrial transmembrane potential, DeltaPsi(m), a process that is significantly inhibited by Bcl-2 overexpression. Furthermore, we find that DeltaPsi(m) disruption results in the selective release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondria.

Bcl-2 promoter analysis showed multiple putative NF-kappaB binding sites. Transfection assays of bcl-2 promoter constructs in HCT116 cells showed that NF-kappaB can indeed transactivate bcl-2. We identified a kappaB site located at position -180 that can only be bound and transactivated by p50 or p52 homodimers. As p50 and p52 homodimers are devoid of any transactivating domains, we showed that they can transactivate the bcl-2 promoter through association with Bcl-3. We also observed that stable overexpression of p100 and its processed product p52 can induce endogenous Bcl-2 expression in MCF7AZ breast cancer cells.

Aplidin cytotoxicity in vitro was not different when initial and relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or initial ALL and initial acute myeloid leukemia were compared. However, normal BM (n=19) and PB (n=13) cells were more resistant to aplidin than leukemic cells (median two- to seven-fold, P=0.001 and median four- to 11-fold, P&<0.0001, respectively).

We have also made the following new discoveries: (1) 0.5 micro M As(2)O(3) that fails to induce apoptosis has no effects on cell cycle distribution. (2) With inhibition of As(2)O(3)-induced Deltavarphi(m) collapse and apoptosis, dithiothreitol also effectively inhibits As(2)O(3)-induced mitotic arrest, suggesting that both As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis and mitotic arrest involve proteins with thiol groups.

Here, we review the considerations and infrastructure for microarray experiments. These considerations are illustrated via a microarray-based comparison of gene expression profiles of paired diagnosis-relapse samples from patients with precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), who relapsed during therapy or after completion of treatment. Initial experiments showed that several seemingly differentially expressed genes were actually derived from contaminating non-leukemic cells, particularly myeloid cells and T-lymphocytes. Therefore, we purified the ALL cells of the diagnosis and relapse samples if their frequency was lower than 95%. Furthermore, we observed in earlier studies that extra RNA amplification leads to skewing of particular gene transcripts. Sufficient (non-amplified) RNA of purified and paired diagnosis-relapse samples was obtained from only seven cases. The gene expression profiles were evaluated with Affymetrix U95A chips containing 12 600 human genes. These diagnosis-relapse comparisons revealed only a small number of genes (n=6) that differed significantly in expression: mostly signaling molecules and transcription factors involved in cell proliferation and cell survival were highly upregulated at relapse, but we did not observe any increase in drug-resistance markers. This finding fits with the observation that tumors with a high proliferation index have a poor prognosis.

FISH studies using large commercial genomic probes have previously suggested that haploinsufficiency of sequences flanking either ABL or BCR modify the disease process of CML and lead to an unfavorable prognosis. In this present study, real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) analysis was used to identify and map much smaller hemizygous microdeletions in a subset of CML patients that were not deleted using large genomic FISH probes. Microdeletions were identified by Q-PCR in 25 of 71 patients selected based on less favorable outcome (chronic phase duration of less than 96 months and a survival time of less than 84 months). In contrast, no microdeletion was detected in any of 18 CML samples selected from a group with a more favorable outcome. Detailed mapping of the 25 Q-PCR microdeletions showed that the minimal deleted region extended approximately 120 kb from the 5' end of the ABL gene in the centromeric direction on the derivative chromosome 9, and the region 3' to BCR on chromosome 22 was excluded. Of the four ESTs and/or genes that map to the 120 kb region, the putative tumor suppressor PRDM12 is the strongest candidate gene.

Almost a decade ago, overexpression of Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) was observed in adult acute leukemia. Subsequent studies indicated that WT1 overexpression occurs in most cases of acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Limited tissue expression of WT1 in adults suggests that WT1 can be a target for leukemia/MDS therapy. WT1 expression in stem/progenitor cells remains unsettled. However, lack of progenitor cell suppression by WT1 antisense or WT1-specific cytotoxic T cells provide some assurance that WT1 expression in progenitor cells is minimal or absent. Immunotherapy-based WT1 approaches are furthest along in preclinical development. WT1-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes can be generated from normals and leukemic patients. In mice, WT1 vaccines elicit specific immune responses without evidence of tissue damage. In this paper, we review studies validating the immunogenicity of WT1 and propose that leukemia and MDS may be a good clinical model to test the efficacy of a WT1 vaccine.","['Rosenfeld, C', 'Cheever, M A', 'Gaiger, A']","['Rosenfeld C', 'Cheever MA', 'Gaiger A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'WT1 Proteins/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology']",2003/07/02 05:00,2003/08/09 05:00,['2003/07/02 05:00'],"['2003/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jul;17(7):1301-12. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402988.,,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2402988 [doi]', '2402988 [pii]']",,,,121,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is possible that inhibiting SDF-1-driven processes in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may have therapeutic implications. In this study, we examined the ability of SDF-1 inhibitors to modulate pre-B ALL cell responses to SDF-1, including chemotaxis, migration into bone marrow stroma, and stroma-supported survival and proliferation on human bone marrow stromal layers. The polyphemusin II-derived inhibitors, T140, TC140012, and T134, and the bicyclam AMD3100, effectively inhibited binding of the anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody 12G5 on the pre-B ALL cell line NALM6, with IC(50) values of 0.9, 0.9, 0.9, and 1.9 nM, respectively. Similar results were obtained with ALL samples. T140 (0.1 micro M) and AMD3100 (1 micro M) completely blocked SDF-1-induced chemotaxis and attenuated the migration of pre-B ALL cells into bone marrow stromal layers. AMD3100 and TC140012 at a concentration of 50 micro M significantly inhibited stroma-dependent proliferation of six and four of the eight cases tested, respectively, without reducing the cell viability. In addition, AMD3100 and TC140012 enhanced the cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects of the cytotoxic agents vincristine and dexamethasone.

Depending upon the stimulus and cell type, this pathway can transmit signals, which result in the prevention or induction of apoptosis or cell cycle progression. Thus, it is an appropriate pathway to target for therapeutic intervention. This pathway becomes more complex daily, as there are multiple members of the kinase and transcription factor families, which can be activated or inactivated by protein phosphorylation. The diversity of signals transduced by this pathway is increased, as different family members heterodimerize to transmit different signals. Furthermore, additional signal transduction pathways interact with the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway to regulate positively or negatively its activity, or to alter the phosphorylation status of downstream targets. Abnormal activation of this pathway occurs in leukemia because of mutations at Ras as well as genes in other pathways (eg PI3K, PTEN, Akt), which serve to regulate its activity. Dysregulation of this pathway can result in autocrine transformation of hematopoietic cells since cytokine genes such as interleukin-3 and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor contain the transacting binding sites for the transcription factors regulated by this pathway. Inhibitors of Ras, Raf, MEK and some downstream targets have been developed and many are currently in clinical trials. This review will summarize our current understanding of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signal transduction pathway and the downstream transcription factors.

CML is an excellent target for the development of selective treatment because of its highly consistent genetic abnormality and qualitatively different fusion gene product, p210(bcr-abl). It is likely that the multiple signaling pathways dysregulated by p210(bcr-abl) are sufficient to explain all the initial manifestations of the chronic phase of the disease, although understanding of the circuitry is still very incomplete. Evidence is presented that the signaling pathways that are constitutively activated in CML stem cells and primitive progenitors cooperate with cytokines to increase the proportion of stem cells that are activated and thereby increase recruitment into the committed progenitor cell pool, and that this increased activation is probably the primary cause of the massive myeloid expansion in CML. The cooperative interactions between Bcr-Abl and cytokine-activated pathways interfere with the synergistic interactions between multiple cytokines that are normally required for the activation of stem cells, while at the same time causing numerous subtle biochemical and functional abnormalities in the later progenitors and precursor cells. The committed CML progenitors have discordant maturation and reduced proliferative capacity compared to normal committed progenitors, and like them, are destined to die after a limited number of divisions. Thus, the primary goal of any curative strategy must be to eliminate all Philadelphia positive (Ph+) primitive cells that are capable of symmetric division and thereby able to expand the Ph+ stem cell pool and recreate the disease. Several highly potent and moderately selective inhibitors of Bcr-Abl kinase have recently been discovered that are capable of killing the majority of actively proliferating early CML progenitors with minimal effects on normal progenitors. However, like their normal counterparts, most of the CML primitive stem cells are quiescent at any given time and are relatively invulnerable to the Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors as well as other drugs. We propose that survival of dormant Ph+ stem cells may be the most important reason for the inability to cure the disease during initial treatment, while resistance to the inhibitors and other drugs becomes increasingly important later. An outline of a possible curative strategy is presented that attempts to take advantage of the subtle differences in the proliferative behavior of normal and Ph+ stem cells and the newly discovered selective inhibitors of Bcr-Abl.

Mice deficient for one of these signaling proteins have an incomplete block in B cell development at the stage of large cycling pre-BCR+CD43+ pre-B cells. Our recent findings of defective SLP-65 expression in approximately 50% of childhood pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemias and spontaneous pre-B cell lymphoma development in SLP-65-/- mice demonstrate that SLP-65 acts as a tumor suppressor. To investigate cooperation between Btk and SLP-65, we characterized the pre-B cell compartment in single and double mutant mice, and found that the two proteins have a synergistic role in the developmental progression of large cycling into small resting pre-B cells. We show that Btk/SLP-65 double mutant mice have a dramatically increased pre-B cell tumor incidence ( approximately 75% at 16 wk of age), as compared with SLP-65 single deficient mice (<10%). These findings demonstrate that Btk cooperates with SLP-65 as a tumor suppressor in pre-B cells. Furthermore, transgenic low-level expression of a constitutive active form of Btk, the E41K-Y223F mutant, prevented tumor formation in Btk/SLP-65 double mutant mice, indicating that constitutive active Btk can substitute for SLP-65 as a tumor suppressor.","['Kersseboom, Rogier', 'Middendorp, Sabine', 'Dingjan, Gemma M', 'Dahlenborg, Katarina', 'Reth, Michael', 'Jumaa, Hassan', 'Hendriks, Rudolf W']","['Kersseboom R', 'Middendorp S', 'Dingjan GM', 'Dahlenborg K', 'Reth M', 'Jumaa H', 'Hendriks RW']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, PO Box 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B cell linker protein)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Btk protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Carrier Proteins/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phosphoproteins/*physiology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*prevention & control', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*physiology']",2003/07/02 05:00,2003/10/03 05:00,['2003/07/02 05:00'],"['2003/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2003 Jul 7;198(1):91-8. doi: 10.1084/jem.20030615.

Permutation methods are often recommended and used, in place of their parametric counterparts, due to the small sample sizes of microarray experiments and possible non-normality of the data. The recommendations, however, are based on classical knowledge in the hypothesis test setting. RESULTS: We explore the relationship between hypothesis testing and gene ranking. We indicate that the permutation method does not provide a metric for the distance between two underlying distributions. In our simulation studies permutation methods tend to be equally or less accurate than parametric methods in ranking genes. This is partially due to the discreteness of the permutation distributions, as well as the non-metric property. In data analysis the variability in ranking genes can be assessed by bootstrap. It turns out that the variability is much lower for permutation than parametric methods, which agrees with the known robustness of permutation methods to individual outliers in the data.","['Xu, Ronghui', 'Li, Xiaochun']","['Xu R', 'Li X']","['Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney Street, Boston, MA 02115, USA. rxu@jimmy.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",England,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Leukemia/classification/*genetics', '*Models, Genetic', 'Models, Statistical', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Sequence Alignment/*methods', 'Sequence Analysis/*methods']",2003/07/02 05:00,2004/04/09 05:00,['2003/07/02 05:00'],"['2003/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bioinformatics. 2003 Jul 1;19(10):1284-9. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btg155.,,['10.1093/bioinformatics/btg155 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most current methods select genes based on known phenotype information. However, certain set of genes may correspond to new phenotypes which are yet unknown, and it is important to develop novel effective selection methods for their discovery without using any prior phenotype information. RESULTS: We propose and study a new method to select relevant genes based on their similarity information only. The method relies on a mechanism for discarding irrelevant genes. A two-way ordering of gene expression data can force irrelevant genes towards the middle in the ordering and thus can be discarded. Mechanisms based on variance and principal component analysis are also studied. When applied to expression profiles of colon cancer and leukemia, the unsupervised method outperforms the baseline algorithm that simply uses all genes, and it also selects relevant genes close to those selected using supervised methods.

The choice of therapy often depends on the mortality risk of allogeneic SCT. Delaying SCT until the disease demonstrates resistance to other strategies (e.g., imatinib mesylate or interferon-alpha) entails the risk of the development of a sudden blastic phase, which may not permit enough time to perform a SCT. METHODS: The current study was performed to define the incidence and patterns of sudden-onset blastic-phase CML in relation to the risk inherent in delaying allogeneic SCT. Of a study group of 1286 patients who were referred in early chronic-phase CML between 1981-2001 and who received therapies other than allogeneic SCT, 1093 patients had regular follow-up at the study institution. A sudden onset of blastic phase was defined as having its onset within 3 months from a previously documented complete hematologic response. RESULTS: Among the 1093 patients, 183 patients developed blastic-phase disease, which was of sudden onset in 46 patients (25%; 4% of the total). The incidence of sudden blastic phase was 0.4% in the first year, 1.8% in the second year, and 2.6% in the third year. Patients with sudden blastic-phase disease were found to have more often low-risk features at the time of presentation, including low incidences of blasts and thrombocytosis. Sudden blastic-phase CML was found to be associated with a higher incidence of lymphoid blastic morphology (67% vs. 22%; P < 0.0001), which resulted in a higher response rate to blastic-phase therapy (70% vs. 29%; P < 0.0001) and significantly longer survival from the onset of blastic-phase disease (median of 12 months vs. 6 months; P < 0.01). Twenty-four of the 42 patients with sudden blastic-phase disease who were treated at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center were able to undergo allogeneic SCT in second chronic phrase (n = 13) or transformed phase (n = 11); at the time of last follow-up, 6 patients were alive without evidence of disease at a median of 18 months. CONCLUSIONS: The low rates of sudden blastic transformation in the first 3 years of the course of disease for CML and the salvage rate of these patients with allogeneic SCT should be considered in relation to the transplantation mortality in patients with early chronic-phase disease and the early promising results with imatinib mesylate therapy.","['Kantarjian, Hagop', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Giles, Francis', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Kornblau, Steven', 'Shan, Jianquin', 'Beth Rios, Mary', 'Keating, Michael', 'Freireich, Emil', 'Talpaz, Moshe']","['Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Cortes J', 'Giles F', 'Thomas D', 'Kornblau S', 'Shan J', 'Beth Rios M', 'Keating M', 'Freireich E', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

The leukemic T-cells, interacting with SBA, were removed by N-acetyl-D-galactosamine or low-concentration acetic acid. The type and viability of the separated cell fractions were analyzed by flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy, using adequate fluorescent antibodies. The interaction of leukemic T-cells with free SBA, as well as with SBA-conjugated Sepharose beads, was examined fluorimetrically and visualized by fluorescent microscopy, using FITC-SBA as a marker. The rate of cell elution on SBA-affinity column decreased in order: normal > leukemic T-cells. Both normal lymphocytes and leukemic T-cells were removed in a mixture from SBA-free Sepharose 6MB by PBS(-) and were not fractionated discretely. The leukemic T-cells specifically interacted with SBA as well as with SBA-affinity adsorbent. In contrast, the normal lymphocytes did not interact with free SBA as well as with SBA-conjugated Sepharose beads in the concentrations applied. The method potentially combines a discrete cell fractionation with manifestation of a specific target cytotoxicity of SBA against leukemic T-cells, without any influence on normal lymphocytes.","['Bakalova, R', 'Ohba, H']","['Bakalova R', 'Ohba H']","['Natural Substance-Composed Materials Group, Institute for Structural and Engineering Materials, Kyushu, 807-1 Shuku-machi, Tosu, Saga-ken 841-0052, Japan. r.bakalova-zheleva@aist.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biomed Chromatogr,Biomedical chromatography : BMC,8610241,"['0 (Lectins)', '0 (Plant Lectins)', '0 (Soybean Proteins)', '0 (soybean lectin)', '9012-36-6 (Sepharose)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lectins', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Plant Lectins/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Sepharose', 'Soybean Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology']",2003/07/02 05:00,2004/02/24 05:00,['2003/07/02 05:00'],"['2003/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biomed Chromatogr. 2003 Jun;17(4):239-49. doi: 10.1002/bmc.218.,"['Copyright 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",['10.1002/bmc.218 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied murine leukemia L1210 cells sensitive and resistant to the cytotoxic action of cisplatin and showed that cisplatin-resistant leukemia cells were also refractory to TGF beta1-dependent growth inhibition and apoptosis. Addressing the question about the mechanisms responsible for the cross-resistance to cisplatin and TGF beta1, we found that cisplatin- and TGF beta1-resistant L1210 cells possessed a decreased expression of type I TGF beta1 receptor, while the expression of type II TGF beta1 receptor was not affected. Western blot analysis of Smad proteins 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7, which participate in signal transduction pathway down-stream of the TGF beta1 receptors, revealed an increased expression of Smad 6, inhibiting TGF beta1 action, only in cisplatin- and TGF beta1-resistant L1210 cells. TGF beta1 and especially the cytotoxic mistletoe agglutinin increased Smad 6 expression in TGF beta1-sensitive but not in TGF beta1-resistant L1210 cells. TGF beta1-resistant L1210 cells also differed from TGF beta1-sensitive cells by the lack of expression of the pro-apoptotic p53 protein and higher level of expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein. Thus, the described co-expression of tumor cell refractoriness to an anti-cancer drug and to the inhibitory cytokine TGF beta1 is accompanied by multiple changes in the TGF beta1 signal transduction pathway and in other regulatory systems of the target cells. Besides, we found that various anti-tumor drugs and cytotoxic plant lectins increased the level of TGF beta1 expression in both TGFbeta1-sensitive and -resistant L1210 cells. A hypothesis is proposed that TGFbeta1 can at least partly mediate the effect of cell-stressing agents and, thus, the development of TGF beta1 resistance may be responsible for the appearance of tumor cell refractoriness to the action of some anti-cancer drugs.","['Stoika, Rostyslav', 'Yakymovych, Mariya', 'Souchelnytskyi, Serhiy', 'Yakymovych, Ihor']","['Stoika R', 'Yakymovych M', 'Souchelnytskyi S', 'Yakymovych I']","['Department of Regulation of Cell Proliferation, Institute of Cell Biology, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Drahomanov Str. 14/16, 79005 Lviv, Ukraine. stoika@biochem.lviv.ua']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Poland,Acta Biochim Pol,Acta biochimica Polonica,14520300R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Smad Proteins)', '0 (Tgfb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Lectins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smad Proteins', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/biosynthesis', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis']",2003/07/02 05:00,2004/06/02 05:00,['2003/07/02 05:00'],"['2002/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2003/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2003/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Biochim Pol. 2003;50(2):497-508. doi: 035002497.,,['035002497 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many tumor cells exhibit both uncontrolled proliferation and a block to terminal differentiation. To understand the mechanisms coordinating these two processes, we have investigated the relation between cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activities and the block to differentiation in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. We found that CDK6 (but not CDK4) is rapidly downregulated as MEL cells are induced to re-enter erythroid differentiation and that maintenance of CDK6 (but not CDK4) activity by transfection blocks differentiation. Moreover, we found that PU.1, an Ets transcription factor that is oncogenic in erythroid cells and also can block their differentiation, controls the synthesis of CDK6 mRNA. These results suggest a mechanism for coupling proliferation and the block to differentiation in these leukemic cells through the action of an oncogenic transcription factor (PU.1) on a key cell cycle regulator (CDK6). Our findings suggest that studying the relative roles of CDK6 and CDK4 in other types of malignant cells will be important in designing approaches for cell cycle inhibition and differentiation therapy in cancer.","['Matushansky, Igor', 'Radparvar, Farshid', 'Skoultchi, Arthur I']","['Matushansky I', 'Radparvar F', 'Skoultchi AI']","['Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk4 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/07/02 05:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2003/07/02 05:00'],"['2003/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Jul 3;22(27):4143-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206484.,,"['10.1038/sj.onc.1206484 [doi]', '1206484 [pii]']",,,"['2P30CA13330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R37CA16368/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32AG00194/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', '5T32GM07288-25/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A major side effect of these immunotherapies is the development of graft-versus-host diseases (GVHD). One promising approach to prevent GVHD is to genetically modify donor T cells with a suicide mechanism that can be induced in the case of GVHD. Here we report on a retroviral vector containing the death effector domain (DED) of the human Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD). The DED was fused to two copies of an FKBP506-binding protein and a truncated version of the human low-affinity receptor for nerve growth factor (LNGFR). Activation of the death signal pathway can be triggered upon the addition of chemical inducers of dimerization. This construct was functionally compared to an optimized HSV-TK vector in which a hypersensitive mutant of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (TK39) was fused to a cytoplasmic truncated version of the cell surface antigen CD34. A direct comparison between both vectors in primary T lymphocytes showed that the number of T cells transduced with vectors containing the DED was significantly reduced within 24 h of drug administration whereas ganciclovir treatment of TK39-transduced T cells showed a delay in cell death of approximately 3-4 days. Our results indicate that constructs containing the DED may prove to be the most efficient mechanism to quickly eliminate alloreactive T cells.,"['Junker, K', 'Koehl, U', 'Zimmerman, S', 'Stein, S', 'Schwabe, D', 'Klingebiel, T', 'Grez, M']","['Junker K', 'Koehl U', 'Zimmerman S', 'Stein S', 'Schwabe D', 'Klingebiel T', 'Grez M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital, Johann-Wolfgang von Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Tacrolimus Binding Proteins)', 'EC 6.2.1.- (Coenzyme A Ligases)', 'EC 6.2.1.- (acyl-coenzyme A synthetase, E coli)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cell Death/genetics', 'Coenzyme A Ligases/*genetics', 'Escherichia coli Proteins/*genetics', 'Ganciclovir/therapeutic use', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/administration & dosage/genetics', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/*adverse effects', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/administration & dosage/genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Simplexvirus/enzymology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tacrolimus Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics']",2003/07/02 05:00,2003/08/13 05:00,['2003/07/02 05:00'],"['2003/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2003 Jul;10(14):1189-97. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3301977.,,"['10.1038/sj.gt.3301977 [doi]', '3301977 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we examined the effects of NG on H2O2-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in mouse leukemia P388 cells. Cytotoxicity was determined by mitochondrial activity (MTT assay). Apoptosis and DNA damage were analyzed by measuring chromatin condensation and Comet assay (alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis), respectively. H2O2-induced cytotoxicity was significantly attenuated by NG or the reduced form of glutathione (GSH), a typical intracellular antioxidant. NG suppressed chromatin condensation and DNA damage induced by H2O2.

METHODS: Ovarian morphology and function were studied in reproductive age women 12-24 months after allogeneic SCT (n = 23) received from an HLA identical sibling, or autologous SCT (n = 22). Thirteen allo-transplanted women were suffering from chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). RESULTS: Menstrual cycles recovered in two and four women in the allo- and auto-SCT groups respectively, being associated with younger age and longer period elapsed from transplant. There was no difference in previous use of alkylating agents between allo- and auto-transplantation, while corticosteroid treatment was longer and more recent in the allo-SCT group. Significantly higher gonadotrophin levels and lower estradiol were seen in the combined group of patients than in controls. In allo-transplanted women, androgens were also significantly lower than in controls. Ovarian and uterine volumes were lower in patients than in controls, and in the allo- than in the auto-transplanted women. Within the allo-SCT group, endocrine function and ovarian and uterine volumes were significantly lower in the patients suffering from cGVHD. CONCLUSIONS: Ovarian failure in SCT recipients is likely to be caused principally by myelo-ablative treatments, but the condition of gonadal and androgen insufficiency can be worsened by an altered immunomodulation in allogeneic setting.","['Tauchmanova, Libuse', 'Selleri, Carmine', 'De Rosa, Gennaro', 'Esposito, Mariarosaria', 'Orio, Francesco Jr', 'Palomba, Stefano', 'Bifulco, Giuseppe', 'Nappi, Carmine', 'Lombardi, Gaetano', 'Rotoli, Bruno', 'Colao, Annamaria']","['Tauchmanova L', 'Selleri C', 'De Rosa G', 'Esposito M', 'Orio F Jr', 'Palomba S', 'Bifulco G', 'Nappi C', 'Lombardi G', 'Rotoli B', 'Colao A']","['Department of Molecular and Clinical Endocrinology and Oncology, Federico II University of Naples, via S.Pansini 5, 80131 Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Gonadal Steroid Hormones)', '0 (Gonadotropins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones/blood', 'Gonadotropins/blood', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*complications', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Menstrual Cycle', 'Middle Aged', 'Ovarian Follicle/physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Primary Ovarian Insufficiency/diagnostic imaging/*etiology/immunology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Ultrasonography']",2003/07/02 05:00,2004/03/09 05:00,['2003/07/02 05:00'],"['2003/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2003 Jul;18(7):1410-6. doi: 10.1093/humrep/deg295.,,['10.1093/humrep/deg295 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies indicated that mutations of E45K in the first transmembrane domain (TMD), and K404L in the 11th TMD, produce selective and opposite alterations in binding of natural folate substrates to murine RFC. The former mutation is frequently associated with antifolate resistance. The current study was designed to determine whether there might be an interaction between these sites by comparing the transport properties of RFC-null cell lines stably transfected with K404E, E45K, or E45K/K404E carriers. These studies demonstrated that: (1) All mutant carriers were inserted into the plasma membrane. (2) In the K404E mutant, the influx K(t)'s for 5-formyltetrahydrofolate and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate were markedly increased, and to a much smaller extent folic acid, as compared to L1210 cells. However, with introduction of a second E45K mutation the influx K(t) for these folates reverted to those of the E45K cells which retained wild-type binding for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and enhanced binding of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate and folic acid. (3) The influx V(max) of the E45K mutant was markedly reduced. Introduction of the second K404E mutation doubled this parameter and the ratio of V(max) to K(t) for 5-formytetrahydrofolate was restored to approximately 50% that of the wild-type carrier consistent with a substantial increase in function. (4) Chloride inhibits wild-type RFC but the E45K mutant requires chloride for activity. The K404E mutant is also suppressed by chloride but introduction of the K404E mutation decreased the chloride-dependence of E45K. The results suggest that there is an interaction between the E45 and K404 residues in the first and 11th TMDs, respectively, but that the E45 residue appears to be the more dominant determinant of binding and anion sensitivity.","['Zhao, Rongbao', 'Wang, Yanhua', 'Gao, Feng', 'Goldman, I David']","['Zhao R', 'Wang Y', 'Gao F', 'Goldman ID']","['Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine Cancer Center, Chanin 2, 1300 Morris Park Avenue, Bronx, NY 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (Slc19a1 protein, mouse)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/pharmacokinetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/07/02 05:00,2003/08/23 05:00,['2003/07/02 05:00'],"['2003/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2003 Jun 27;1613(1-2):49-56. doi: 10.1016/s0005-2736(03)00136-6.,,"['S0005273603001366 [pii]', '10.1016/s0005-2736(03)00136-6 [doi]']",,,['CA 82621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we have shown that, at noncholinergic doses (1 to 10 nM), POX (the bioactive metabolite of parathion) causes apoptotic cell death in murine EL4 T-lymphocytic leukemia cell line through activation of caspase-3. In this study, by employing caspase-specific inhibitors, we extend our observations to elucidate the sequence of events involved in POX-stimulated apoptosis. Pretreatment of EL4 cells with the caspase-9-specific inhibitor zLEHD-fmk attenuated POX-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the caspase-8 inhibitor zIETD-fmk had no effect. Furthermore, the activation of caspase-9, -8, and -3 in response to POX treatment was completely inhibited in the presence of zLEHD-fmk, implicating the involvement of caspase 9-dependent mitochondrial pathways in POX-stimulated apoptosis. Indeed, under both in vitro and in vivo conditions, POX triggered a dose- and time-dependent translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, as assessed by Western blot analysis. Investigation of the mechanism of cytochrome c release revealed that POX disrupted mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Neither this effect nor cytchrome c release was dependent on caspase activation, since the general inhibitor of the caspase family zVAD-fmk did not influence both processes. Finally, POX treatment also resulted in a time-dependent up-regulation and translocation of the proapoptotic molecule Bax to mitochondria. Inhibition of this event by zVAD-fmk suggests that the activation and translocation of Bax to mitochondria is subsequent to activation of the caspase cascades. The results indicate that POX induces apoptosis in EL4 cells through a direct effect on mitochondria by disrupting its transmembrane potential, causing the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol and subsequent activation of caspase-9. Inhibition of this specific pathway might provide a useful strategy to minimize organophosphate-induced poisoning.","['Saleh, A M', 'Vijayasarathy, C', 'Masoud, L', 'Kumar, L', 'Shahin, A', 'Kambal, A']","['Saleh AM', 'Vijayasarathy C', 'Masoud L', 'Kumar L', 'Shahin A', 'Kambal A']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, PO Box 17 666, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates. asaleh@uaeu.ac.ae']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Apaf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1)', '0 (Cholinesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Insecticides)', '0 (Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp9 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'Q9CX8P80JW (Paraoxon)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cholinesterase Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Cytosol/enzymology/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Insecticides/*toxicity', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Paraoxon/*toxicity', 'Proteins/genetics']",2003/07/02 05:00,2003/07/25 05:00,['2003/07/02 05:00'],"['2003/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2003 Jul 1;190(1):47-57. doi: 10.1016/s0041-008x(03)00126-1.,,"['S0041008X03001261 [pii]', '10.1016/s0041-008x(03)00126-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: 1. BMI2 SDS values increased in relation to BMI1 SDS (p=0.0000001) and BMI3 SDS values insignificantly decreased, but they were higher than at the time of diagnosis. 2. We affirmed increase of BMI2 SDS in the group of boys directly after the treatment (p=0.00006) and later decrease (p=0.04), so there were no differences between BMI1 SDS and BMI3 SDS. 3.

We affirmed increase of BMI SDS after the treatment completed in the group of children treated with only cytostatics. The increase of BMI SDS (p=0.02) and next decrease of BMI3 SDS (p=0.007) was noticed in the group with CNS prophylaxis, there were no differences between BMI1 SDS and BMI3 SDS. 6. We observed increase of BMI2 SDS and BMI3 SDS in comparison with BMI1 SDS (p=0.00001 and p=0.0004) in the group treated with 5 g/m(2) methotrexate. BMI3 SDS values were decreased in comparison with BMI2 SDS (p=0.01) and BMI1 SDS (p=0.006) in the group treated with 1 g/m(2) methotrexate. 7. There were no significant changes in the growth rate during the treatment and after therapy. CONCLUSIONS: 1. ALL treatment contributes to the increase of body mass, which is kept until therapy completed, especially in the group of girls. 2. Growth rate including children with CNS prophylaxis does not submit significantly disturbances.","['Krawczuk-Rybak, Maryna', 'Kaliszewski, Jacek', 'Kitszel, Anna']","['Krawczuk-Rybak M', 'Kaliszewski J', 'Kitszel A']","['Klinika Onkologii Dzieciecej Samodzielnego Publicznego Dzieciecego Szpitala Klinicznego AM w Bialymstoku, Bialystok, Poland.']",['pol'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Endokrynol Diabetol Chor Przemiany Materii Wieku Rozw,"Endokrynologia, diabetologia i choroby przemiany materii wieku rozwojowego : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Endokrynologow Dzieciecych",100892008,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', '*Growth', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*physiopathology/*therapy', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2003/07/02 05:00,2003/12/05 05:00,['2003/07/02 05:00'],"['2003/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Endokrynol Diabetol Chor Przemiany Materii Wieku Rozw. 2003;9(1):41-7.,,,,,,,,,,"Wplyw wieku, plci oraz modyfikacji protokolow leczniczych na rozwoj fizyczny dzieci i mlodziezy po zakonczonym leczeniu ostrej bialaczki limfoblastycznej.",,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was the assessment of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 plasma concentrations in children after intensive therapy of ALL completed according to age, weight, height and therapy protocols (Methotrexate dose, Central Nervous System - CNS prophylaxis). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 63 children (43 boys) were involved in this study with mean age 10.95+/-4.73 years after ALL therapy according to BFM protocols. 35 patients were in maintenance therapy and 28 completely finished the therapy. 20 children had cranial irradiation as CNS prophylaxis (12 Gy). We assessed plasma levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 in radioimmunoassay method and the obtained results were related to mean age values (SDScore). RESULTS: 1. A) IGF-1 mean plasma levels in children (n=30) before puberty (Tanner I) was 151.48+/-75.75 ng/ml and was lower than compared to value in the puberty group (n=16, Tanner II-IV) - 222.06+/-96.61 ng/ml p=0.000008. After puberty (Tanner V) IGF-1 was 332.03+/-75.66 ng/ml. b) IGFBP-3 was highest after puberty (3837.4 ng/ml +/-598.49); before puberty it was 2899.68+/-656.57 ng/ml, and in puberty it was 3593.14+/-598,49 ng/ml. 2. IGF-1 SDS values were lower than mean age values. 3. IGFBP-3 SDS were insignificantly higher than mean age values. 4. There were no differences between IGF-1 SDS and IGFBP-3 SDS according to gender, prior CNS prophylaxis, methotrexate dose and phase of maintenance therapy and completed therapy. 5. IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 correlated to each other and to body mass index, height but IGF-1 SDS and IGFBP-3 SDS was independent on age, CNS prophylaxis, BMI SDS and height SDS. CONCLUSIONS: 1. IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 values are dependent on puberty degree, body mass index and height. 2. IGF-1 SDS are lower and IGFBP-3 values higher, independent on gender, therapy protocol and CNS prophylaxis (12 Gy).","['Krawczuk-Rybak, Maryna', 'Kitszel, Anna', 'Kaliszewski, Jacek', 'Wolczynski, Slawomir']","['Krawczuk-Rybak M', 'Kitszel A', 'Kaliszewski J', 'Wolczynski S']","['Klinika Onkologii Dzieciecej AM w Bialymstoku, Bialystok, Poland.']",['pol'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Endokrynol Diabetol Chor Przemiany Materii Wieku Rozw,"Endokrynologia, diabetologia i choroby przemiany materii wieku rozwojowego : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Endokrynologow Dzieciecych",100892008,"['0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Body Height', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/*blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Puberty/blood/physiology', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Remission Induction', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2003/07/02 05:00,2003/12/05 05:00,['2003/07/02 05:00'],"['2003/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Endokrynol Diabetol Chor Przemiany Materii Wieku Rozw. 2003;9(1):35-40.,,,,,,,,,,Ocena wartosci insulinopodobnego czynnika wzrostu (IGF-I) i bialka wiazacego (IGFBP-3) w czasie leczenia podtrzymujacego remisje i po zakonczeniu leczenia ostrej bialaczki limfoblastycznej (ALL).,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: By using the same method we isolated additional candidate genes that were specifically down- or up-regulated in W/WV mice. Novel transcripts were designated as DDWMEST. RESULTS: We isolated seven candidates that were specifically down- or up-regulated in W/WV mice. Two novel transcripts, DDWMEST 1 and -91 were increased in both fed and fasted W/WV mice. Expression of another five genes was suppressed in W/WV mice: ARG2 (Arginase II), ONZIN (encoding leukemia inhibitory factor regulated protein), and three novel transcripts: DDWMEST62, -84, and -100. Together with the previous report, we identified fifteen differentially expressed genes in total in the small intestines of W/WV mice. Eight of these genes were reduced in the jejunums of W/WV mice compared to age matched wild type mice, whereas the other seven genes showed an increase in expression. Differential expression was the same in fasted and fed animals, suggesting that the differences were independent of the dietetic state of the animal. CONCLUSIONS: Several known and novel genes are differentially expressed in the small intestines of W/WV mice. Differential gene comparison might contribute to our understanding of motility disorders associated with the loss of the interstitial cells of Cajal.","['Daigo, Yataro', 'Takayama, Ichiro', 'Ponder, Bruce A J', 'Caldas, Carlos', 'Ward, Sean M', 'Sanders, Kenton M', 'Fujino, Masayuki A']","['Daigo Y', 'Takayama I', 'Ponder BA', 'Caldas C', 'Ward SM', 'Sanders KM', 'Fujino MA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Faculty of Medicine, Japan. yd206@cam.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,BMC Gastroenterol,BMC gastroenterology,100968547,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.3.1 (Arg2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.3.1 (Arginase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arginase/genetics', 'Gastrointestinal Motility/genetics', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Interleukin-6/genetics', 'Jejunum/cytology/injuries/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Models, Animal', 'Muscle, Smooth/cytology/metabolism', 'Myenteric Plexus/cytology/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2003/07/02 05:00,2004/06/02 05:00,['2003/07/02 05:00'],"['2003/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2003/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']",epublish,BMC Gastroenterol. 2003 Jun 29;3:17. doi: 10.1186/1471-230X-3-17.,,['10.1186/1471-230X-3-17 [doi]'],20030629,,"['P01 DK041315/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK057236/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK41315/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK57236/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,PMC198276,,,,,,,

Folate receptor (FR) type beta is selectively expressed on the surface of approximately 70% of AMLs. Increased FR-beta expression in these cells can be induced by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and other retinoid compounds in the absence of terminal differentiation or cell growth inhibition. An apparent post-transcriptional modification prevents FR-beta in normal haematopoietic cells from binding folate, in contrast to AML cells. FR-beta may, therefore, be used as a target for the selective delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to AML cells; this treatment modality appears to be particularly efficacious when administered in conjunction with retinoid-induction of FR-beta. FR-targeted liposomal drug delivery can also bypass the P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated drug efflux pump commonly associated with multiple drug resistance in AML. The rationale and merits of this novel experimental treatment for AML and the current status of this research are provided.","['Ratnam, Manohar', 'Hao, Hong', 'Zheng, Xuan', 'Wang, Hui', 'Qi, Huiling', 'Lee, Robert', 'Pan, Xing']","['Ratnam M', 'Hao H', 'Zheng X', 'Wang H', 'Qi H', 'Lee R', 'Pan X']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Ohio, 3035 Arlington Ave, Toledo, OH 43614-5804, USA. mratnam@mco.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Carrier Proteins/*drug effects/genetics', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*drug effects/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2003/07/02 05:00,2004/07/14 05:00,['2003/07/02 05:00'],"['2003/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2003 Jul;3(4):563-74. doi: 10.1517/14712598.3.4.563.,,['10.1517/14712598.3.4.563 [doi]'],,,"['R01 CA 92890/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA80183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",132,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bullous dermatoses are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Bullous dermatoses result from autoimmune responses to one or more components of the basement membrane or desmosomes. Pemphigoid results from autoimmunity to hemidesmosomal proteins present in the basement membrane of stratified squamous epithelia. Patients present with tense blisters in flexural areas of the skin. Mild or moderate bullous pemphigoid may be treated with potent topical corticosteroids while extensive disease usually requires systemic corticosteroids or systemic immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine. Mucosal pemphigoid affects one or more mucous membranes that are lined by stratified squamous epithelia. The two most commonly involved sites are the eye and the oral cavity. Lesions frequently result in scar formation, which may cause blindness. Patients with severe disease or ocular involvement require aggressive therapy with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita results from autoimmunity to type VII collagen in the anchoring fibrils of the basement membrane area. Lesions may either arise on an inflammatory base or be non-inflammatory and result primarily from trauma. The inflammatory type of the disease is more responsive to therapy than the non-inflammatory type. Treatment options include corticosteroids, dapsone, cyclosporin, plasmapheresis and immunoglobulin G. Paraneoplastic pemphigus results from autoimmunity to multiple antigens within the desmosomes.

In this study we examined the role of relationships with parents as a possible mediating factor. METHOD: One hundred and two adult survivors (82% of those eligible, 35 female and 57 male) of childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia and Wilms' Tumour, and 102 matched controls (74% of those eligible) aged 19-30 were interviewed. Interpersonal and social role functioning, and current relationships with each parent were assessed in standardised investigator-based interviews with subjects. RESULTS: Adult survivors were more likely than controls to have impaired close relationships (love relationships and friendships), and poorer day-to-day coping. Lower encouragement from fathers and greater involvement with mothers were each independently associated with impaired close relationships outside the family. This association was evident across the sample and in the cancer survivor group. It was much stronger in young adult females. Lower paternal encouragement was also associated with poor day-to-day coping, and this association was stronger in young men. There was, however, little evidence that quality of relationships with parents mediated the link between childhood cancer and adult psychosocial functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Within this cross-sectional design we could not determine the direction of influence, nor exclude third variable effects. However, the findings indicate that mothers and fathers have different roles in the transition to adult life, and understanding these may assist the development of interventions designed to improve adult psychosocial functioning.","['Hill, Jonathan', 'Kondryn, Helena', 'Mackie, Erica', 'McNally, Richard', 'Eden, Tim']","['Hill J', 'Kondryn H', 'Mackie E', 'McNally R', 'Eden T']","[""Department of Psychiatry, University of Liverpool, and Royal Liverpool Children's Hospital, Alder Hey, UK. jonathan.hill@liverpool.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Child Psychol Psychiatry,"Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines",0375361,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Father-Child Relations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Male', '*Mother-Child Relations', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Psychology', '*Social Behavior', 'Survivors/*psychology']",2003/07/02 05:00,2003/11/05 05:00,['2003/07/02 05:00'],"['2003/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Child Psychol Psychiatry. 2003 Jul;44(5):752-62. doi: 10.1111/1469-7610.00161.,,['10.1111/1469-7610.00161 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is variation in anatomic classification systems, but most studies have divided lymphoma into four groups: alimentary, mediastinal, multicentric, or extranodal. Clinical signs and common differential diagnoses for each of the forms are described. Staging allows for evaluation of the extent of disease. As in the dog, lymphoma is a systemic disease in the cat, and chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for most forms. Exceptions are described. In contrast to canine lymphoma, feline lymphoma is generally more challenging and frustrating to treat than canine lymphoma. Response rates are lower, and remission duration is shorter. Fortunately, cats treated with chemotherapy tend to have less toxicity than dogs. Positive prognostic factors are feline leukemia virus-negative, clinically well at time of diagnosis, and response to therapy. Achieving a complete remission is prognostic for survival.

In bone marrow-selective radioimmunotherapy, beta-irradiation is applied using iodine-131, yttrium-90 or rhenium-188 labelled radioimmunoconjugates. However, the mechanisms by which beta-irradiation induces cell death are not understood at the molecular level. Here, we report that beta-irradiation induced apoptosis and activated apoptosis pathways in leukaemia cells depending on doses, time points and dose rates. After beta-irradiation, upregulation of CD95 ligand and CD95 receptor was detected and activation of caspases resulting in apoptosis was found. These effects were completely blocked by the broad-range caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk. In addition, irradiation-mediated mitochondrial damage resulted in perturbation of mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase-9 activation and cytochrome c release. Bax, a death-promoting protein, was upregulated and Bcl-x(L), a death-inhibiting protein, was downregulated. We also found higher apoptosis rates and earlier activation of apoptosis pathways after gamma-irradiation in comparison to beta-irradiation at the same dose rate. Furthermore, irradiation-resistant cells were cross-resistant to CD95 and CD95-resistant cells were cross-resistant to irradiation, indicating that CD95 and irradiation used, at least in part, identical effector pathways. These findings demonstrate that beta-irradiation induces apoptosis and activates apoptosis pathways in leukaemia cells using both mitochondrial and death receptor pathways. Understanding the timing, sequence and molecular pathways of beta-irradiation-mediated apoptosis may allow rational adjustment of chemo- and radiotherapeutic strategies.","['Friesen, Claudia', 'Lubatschofski, Annelie', 'Kotzerke, Jorg', 'Buchmann, Inga', 'Reske, Sven N', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael']","['Friesen C', 'Lubatschofski A', 'Kotzerke J', 'Buchmann I', 'Reske SN', 'Debatin KM']","[""University Children's Hospital, Prittwitzstrasse 43, 89075 Ulm, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Comment']",Germany,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,101140988,"['0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*radiation effects', '*Beta Particles', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Enzyme Activation/radiation effects', 'Gamma Rays', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radioimmunotherapy/methods', 'Radiometry/methods', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",2003/06/28 05:00,2004/06/02 05:00,['2003/06/28 05:00'],"['2003/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2003/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/06/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. 2003 Sep;30(9):1251-61. doi: 10.1007/s00259-003-1216-z.

Groups of 50 rats and 50 mice of each sex were fed 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole at one of the following doses, either 300 or 600 ppm for rats, and either 50 or 100 ppm for mice. The rats were dosed for 110 weeks, followed by 1 week of observation; the mice were dosed for 104 weeks. Matched controls consisted of 50 untreated rats and 50 untreated mice of each sex. All surviving rats were killed at week 111, all surviving mice at week 104. The mean body weights of the groups of rats and mice fed 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole in the diet were slightly lower than those of the controls throughout most of the period of administration. No other clinical signs related to administration of the chemical were noted. There was a dose-related trend in mortality only in the male rats; however, sufficient numbers of rats were at risk in all groups for development of late-appearing tumors. In male rats, there was a significant dose-related trend (P=0.044) in the incidences of malignant lymphomas, lymphocytic leukemias, or undifferentiated leukemias, although the results of direct comparisons of incidences in each of the dosed groups with those in the controls were not significant. There was also a significant dose-related trend in the incidence of granulocytic leukemia in the male rats (P=0.014) and a significantly increased incidence of this tumor (P=0.023) in the high-dose group (matched controls 2/50, low-dose 4/50, high-dose 9/49). When the incidences of all neoplasms of the hematopoietic system lymphomas and all leukemias) were combined, greater significance was attained for both the dose-related trend (P=0.001) and the direct comparison (P=0.002) of the incidence of the high-dose group with that in the matched controls (controls 13/50, low-dose 9/50, high-dose 28/49). The reliability of the incidence of hematopoietic tumors in the male controls was supported by that for male controls observed in a similar bioassay of another test chemical at the same laboratory (13/50). The incidences of the combined hematopoietic tumors in the dosed female rats were not significant when compared with the incidence in the matched controls. In female rats, there was a significant dose-related trend in the incidence of chromophobe adenomas of the pituitary (P=0.016) and a higher incidence (P=0.021) in the high-dose group than in the matched controls (controls 19/45, low-dose 29/47, high-dose 29/44). The incidence of this lesion in dosed male rats was much lower than that in dosed females, and the dose-related trend (P=0.048) was only marginally significant (controls 3/46, low-dose 3/45, high-dose 8/43). The incidences of chromophobe adenomas of the pituitary which were observed in control groups of rats used in a similar bioassay of another test chemical at the same laboratory were 13/49 (27%) for the males and 26/50 (52%) for the females. Because of the variability in incidences of the tumor among different control groups, the occurrence of chromophobe adenomas of the pituitary in the dosed female rats cannot be clearly associated with the administration of 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole. Also in female rats, there was a higher incidence of endometrial stromal polyps of the uterus in the low-dose group (P=0.023) than in the matched controls (controls 2/50, low-dose 9/49, high-dose 3/50). Since, however, only three high-dose animals had this tumor, the occurrence of uterine tumors in the low-dose group cannot be clearly associated with administration of the test chemical. In the mice, no neoplasms were observed at a statistically significant incidence in the dosed groups when compared with the controls. It is concluded that under the conditions of this bioassay, the occurrence of tumors of the hematopoietic system, i.e., lymphoma and granulocytic leukemia, in dosed male Fischer 344 rats was associated with administration of 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole. 2-Amino-5-nitrothiazole was not carcinogenic in female Fischer 344 rats or in male or female B6C3F1 mice.",,,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Natl Cancer Inst Carcinog Tech Rep Ser,National Cancer Institute carcinogenesis technical report series,7800375,,,,1978/01/01 00:00,2003/06/28 05:01,['1978/01/01 00:00'],"['1978/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/28 05:01 [medline]', '1978/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Natl Cancer Inst Carcinog Tech Rep Ser. 1978;53:1-126.,,,,,,,['National Toxicology Program'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Groups of 35 rats of each sex were administered b-TGdR in a buffered saline and polysorbate 80 vehicle at one of two doses, either 3.5 or 7 mg/kg body weight, three times per week for 52 weeks, then observed for an additional 26 weeks. Controls consisted of groups of 10 rats of each sex, which were either administered the vehicle alone (matched vehicle controls) or were untreated (matched untreated controls). Pooled controls consisted of the matched vehicle controls of each sex from the current bioassay, combined with 20 corresponding vehicle controls of each sex from similar bioassays of two other test chemicals. All surviving rats were killed at 78 or 79 weeks. Groups of 35 mice of each sex were administered the chemical in a buffered saline and polysorbate 80 vehicle at one of two doses, either 2 or 4 mg/kg, three times per week for 52 weeks, then observed for periods of up to 27 weeks, depending on length of survival. Because of severe toxicity at the high dose, resulting in loss of all mice by week 12 (males) or week 25 (females), additional groups of 35 mice of each sex were administered 1 mg/kg on the same schedule. Controls consisted of groups of 15 mice of each sex, which were either administered the vehicle or were untreated. Pooled controls consisted of groups of 15 vehicle-control animals of each sex from studies using the doses of 2 or 4 mg/kg, combined with corresponding groups of 15 vehicle-control animals of each sex from the study using the dose of 1 mg/kg. b-TGdR was toxic to rats at the doses used in this study. Mean body weights of the high- and low-dose rats of both sexes were lower than those of the corresponding vehicle controls throughout the study. There was also severe early mortality in the high-dose groups of both sexes and positive dose-related trends in mortality over the period of the bioassay. However, 66% of the low-dose males and 77% of the low-dose females survived until termination of the study. In mice, b-TGdR was toxic at the doses originally selected. Mean body weights were not consistently affected; however, at the high dose only three males and seven females lived past week 7, and all were dead by week 25. In the mid-dose group, only 14% of the males and 6% of the females survived until termination of the study at week 79; in the low-dose group, the survival rate was 31% for the males and 29% for the females. Because of the high mortality, time-adjusted statistical analyses were performed for both rats and mice. In rats, the incidence of carcinomas of the ear canal (combined carcinomas and squamous-cell carcinomas) was statistically significant in both sexes. In males, the results of the test for dose-related trend were significant using either matched vehicle (P=0.046) or pooled vehicle (P=0.014) controls, but direct comparisons of dosed male rats with matched vehicle or pooled vehicle controls did not show significant differences (matched vehicle controls 0/10, pooled vehicle controls 0/28, low-dose 1/31, high-dose 2/7). In females, the results of the test for dose-related trend were significant using either matched vehicle (P=0.002) or pooled vehicle (P<0.001) controls, and the incidence in the high-dose group was significantly higher than that in either the matched vehicle (P=0.023) or pooled vehicle (P<0.001) controls (matched vehicle controls 0/9, pooled vehicle controls 0/28, low-dose 2/32, high-dose 6/13). There were no such ear canal tumors among 165 historical vehicle controls of either sex or among 220 female untreated controls at the laboratory, and only two such tumors occurred among 215 male untreated controls. In mice, no tumors appeared in statistically significant incidences in the dosed groups compared with the matched vehicle controls, and there was no significant evidence of dose-related trend for any tumors. The incidences of the combination of lymphoma and leukemia were significantly higher in the matched vehicle controls of each sex than in the corresponding matched untreated controls (males: matched untreated controls 1/30, matched vehicle controls 19/29; females: matched untreated controls 2/30, matched vehicle controls 21/29). This high incidence in the matched vehicle controls may have been due to a systematic procedural problem associated with injection of the drug. It is concluded that under the conditions of this bioassay, the low survival of the dosed and vehicle-control groups of mice, as well as the possible procedural problem that may have affected the incidences of tumors in these groups, does not allow a determination to be made of the carcinogenic potential of b-TGdR in this species. b-TGdR in the vehicle of 0.05% polysorbate 80 was, however, carcinogenic in rats, producing carcinomas of the ear canal in the females and possibly also in the males.",,,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Natl Cancer Inst Carcinog Tech Rep Ser,National Cancer Institute carcinogenesis technical report series,7800375,,,,1978/01/01 00:00,2003/06/28 05:01,['1978/01/01 00:00'],"['1978/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/28 05:01 [medline]', '1978/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Natl Cancer Inst Carcinog Tech Rep Ser. 1978;57:1-122.,,,,,,,['National Toxicology Program'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Groups of 31-39 rats of each sex were administered thio-TEPA in phosphate-buffered saline at one of three doses, either 0.7, 1.4, or 2.8 mg/kg body weight, three times per week for a maximum of 52 weeks, then observed for additional periods of time. The maximum time on study (administration of chemical and observation) was 86 weeks. The groups at the low dose were started 69 weeks after those at the mid and high doses, because of high mortalities observed in the groups at the higher doses. Matched controls consisted of groups of 10 untreated rats and 10 vehicle-control rats of each sex. Pooled-control groups also were used. Surviving control rats were killed at 82-87 weeks; surviving dosed rats were killed at 81 or 82 weeks. Groups of 35 mice of each sex were administered thio-TEPA at one of two doses, either 1.15 or 2.3 mg/kg body weight, three times per week for a maximum of 52 weeks, then observed for a maximum additional period of 34 weeks. Matched controls consisted of groups of 15 untreated mice and 15 vehicle-control mice of each sex. Pooled controls also were used. Surviving control and dosed mice were killed at 86 or 87 weeks. Thio-TEPA was toxic to both rats and mice, causing decreased mean body weight gains and early deaths in the mid- and high-dose rats and in the high-dose mice. Because of the early deaths, statistical analyses were based only on time-adjusted incidences of tumors. Since all high-dose male and female rats had died by 21 weeks, microscopic evaluation of tissues was performed only on the low- and mid-dose animals. In rats, the incidence of combined neoplasms of the hematopoietic system (lymphoma, lymphocytic leukemia, or granulocytic leukemia) was significant in the males in both the low-dose (P=0.020) and mid-dose (P=0.001) groups, using pooled controls (pooled controls 0/29, low-dose 6/34; pooled controls 0/30, mid-dose 6/16). Squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin or ear canal occurred at a significant incidence in the male rats in both the low-dose (P=0.009) and mid-dose (P=0.023) groups, using pooled controls (pooled controls 0/29, low-dose 7/33; pooled controls 0/30, mid-dose 3/13) and in the mid-dose females (P<0.001), using pooled controls (pooled controls 0/28, mid-dose 8/21); in addition, two low-dose females had such tumors, with none occurring in the corresponding low-dose controls. The incidence of adenocarcinoma of the uterus was significant in the mid-dose female rats (P=0.001), using pooled controls (pooled controls 0/28, mid-dose 7/21); in addition, two low-dose females had adenocarcinoma of the uterus, with no such tumor occurring in the corresponding low-dose controls. In rats, neuroepitheliomas (neuroblastomas) or nasal carcinomas occurred in three low-dose males, two low-dose females, and two mid-dose females. Although these are not statistically significant incidences, these tumors did not occur among control animals and no such tumors have occurred in 380 Sprague-Dawley control rats of each sex in other bioassays at the same laboratory. Thus, they may be associated with administration of the chemical. In the high-dose groups of both male and female mice, but not in the low-dose groups, the incidences of lymphoma or lymphocytic leukemia were significantly higher (P<0.001) for each sex than those of either the vehicle or pooled controls (males: vehicle controls 1/8, pooled controls 1/18, low-dose 2/24, high-dose 26/28; females: vehicle controls 0/14, pooled controls 0/29, low-dose 5/26, high-dose 32/32). In the low-dose male mice squamous-cell carcinoma was found in the skin of seven animals, in the preputial glands of six animals, and in the ear canal of two animals. A carcinoma of the preputial gland was also found in a high-dose male. When the incidences of the tumors at the different sites were combined, the incidence in the low-dose group was statistically significant using either the vehicle (P=0.004) or the pooled (P<0.001) controls (vehicle controls 0/8, pooled controls 0/18, low-dose 14/24, high-dose 1/2). It is concluded that under the conditions of this bioassay, thio-TEPA was carcinogenic in both Sprague-Dawley rats and B6C3F1 mice.

Groups of 35 rats and 34-36 mice of each sex were administered estradiol mustard at one of the following doses, either 0.62 or 1.25 mg/kg body weight for rats and either 15 or 30 mg/kg body weight for mice. The vehicle used for the test chemical consisted of 0.05% polysorbate 80 in phosphate-buffered saline. The rats and mice were dosed three times per week for 52 weeks, then observed for an additional 30-34 weeks. Controls consisted of groups of 10 rats and 15 mice of each sex that were not administered the chemical (untreated controls) and also of groups of 10 rats of each sex, 14 male mice, and 16 female mice administered the vehicle alone (vehicle controls). Pooled controls were also used. All surviving rats were killed at 84-86 weeks and all surviving mice at 82-86 weeks. Mean body weights of male rats and male and female mice administered estradiol mustard were lower throughout the greater part of the study than those of corresponding vehicle or untreated controls; mean body weights of dosed female rats were unaffected. Administration of the test chemical had no significant effect on the survival of either male or female rats. A large number of dosed mice died prior to the end of the study. The numbers of dosed male mice which were at risk as long as 52 weeks were sufficient, however, for development of tumors appearing up to that time. Time-adjusted analysis and life-table analyses were applied to data obtained with the mice. In rats, no tumors were observed in a statistically significant incidence in the animals administered estradiol mustard. In mice, lymphoma or lymphocytic leukemia occurred at significant incidences in low-dose (P=0.018) and high-dose (P<0.001) groups of males compared with those in the pooled vehicle controls (controls 0/28, low-dose 6/32, high-dose 17/29) and at significant incidences in low-dose (P=0.020) and high-dose (P=0.002) groups of females compared with those in the corresponding vehicle controls (controls 0/14, low-dose 9/30, high-dose 11/23). In addition, the incidences of lymphoma were statistically significant for dose-related trend for both the males (P<0.001) and the females (P=0.003). Since lymphoma was observed in male mice as early as 25 weeks, life-table analyses of the incidence in each sex were performed. The results indicated a dose association (P=0.001) between the administration of estradiol mustard and the time of observation of lymphoma in either sex of mice. In mice, alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma occurred at a significant incidence (P=0.004) in the low-dose group of males compared with the pooled vehicle controls (controls 2/28, low-dose 12/30, high-dose 5/24) and at a significant incidence (P=0.022) in the low-dose group of females compared with the pooled vehicle controls (controls 1/28, low-dose 7/27, high-dose 1/18). Sarcoma of the myocardium similarly occurred at a significant incidence (P=0.015) in the low-dose group of males compared with the pooled vehicle controls (controls 0/28, low-dose 6/30, high-dose 2/24) and at a significant incidence (P=0.002) in the low-dose group of females compared with the pooled vehicle controls (controls 0/28, low-dose 8/27, high-dose 1/12). The survival of both high-dose males and high-dose females was slightly lower than that of the respective low-dose groups and may account for the higher numbers of pulmonary tumors and myocardial sarcomas among low-dose mice of both sexes. The association of myocardial sarcoma with administration of the chemical in both dosed groups of each sex is strengthened by the fact that these tumors of the myocardium have not occurred in the more than 500 male and 500 female historical-control mice of this strain at the laboratory. Squamous cell carcinoma of the stomach occurred in the dosed male mice (high-dose 2/29) and in the dosed female mice (low-dose 2/26, high-dose 2/14) but was absent in all controls. Although the incidences in this bioassay were too low to be statistically significant, the fact that no squamous-cell carcinomas of the stomach have occurred in the more than 500 male and 500 female historical-control mice of this strain at this laboratory indicates that these gastric tumors were related to the administration of the estradiol mustard. It is concluded that under the conditions of this bioassay, estradiol mustard administered in a buffered saline vehicle was not carcinogenic in Sprague-Dawley rats. Estradiol mustard was carcinogenic in both male and female B6C3F1 mice, inducing lymphoma, sarcoma of the myocardium, alveolar adenoma or carcinoma, and squamous-cell carcinoma of the stomach.

Groups of 35 rats of each sex were administered phenesterin at one of two doses, either 5 or 10 mg/kg body weight, three times per week for 52 weeks, then observed for an additional 32 or 33 weeks. The vehicle used was 0.05% polysorbate 80 in buffered saline. Controls consisted of groups of 10 rats of each sex which received the vehicle (vehicle control) and 10 rats of each sex which were untreated (untreated control). All surviving rats were killed at 84 or 85 weeks. Groups of 35 mice of each sex were administered the chemical at one of two doses, either 15 or 30 mg/kg body weight, three times per week for 52 weeks. The males receiving 15 mg/kg were observed for an additional period of 29 weeks, and those surviving to this time were then killed; the animals of the remaining groups were observed for additional periods of only 10-22 weeks, due to early deaths. Seventy-seven weeks after the foregoing groups were started, additional groups of 40 mice of each sex were started and were administered the chemical at 7 mg/kg body weight three times per week; administration of the chemical terminated at week 102 for the males and at week 88 for the females, due to deaths of all females at this time. Controls for the low-dose (7 mg/kg) groups of mice consisted of groups of 20 mice of each sex which received the vehicle (vehicle control) and 20 mice of each sex which were untreated (untreated control); controls for the mid-dose (15 mg/kg) and the high-dose (30 mg/kg) controls consisted of groups of 15 mice of each sex similarly receiving the vehicle or untreated. All surviving low-dose controls were killed at 104 weeks, and all surviving mid- and high-dose controls were killed at 81-84 weeks. Phenesterin was toxic to rats and mice at the doses used, as shown by reduced mean body weights and survival. Time-adjusted analyses were used for evaluation of incidences of tumors in the female mice. In female rats, a dose-related trend (P=0.019) was present in adenocarcinoma of the mammary gland, using the pooled controls, and the incidences of the tumor in the individual dosed groups were significant (P<0.009) when compared with those in the pooled controls (controls 1/18, low-dose 12/29, high-dose 12/30). In male mice, the incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas or combined alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas and carcinomas in the low-dose group (18/40) was significantly higher (P<0.020) than that in the low-dose vehicle-control group (0/16). In female mice, seven low-dose animals had alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas and eight other low-dose animals had alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas. When these tumors were combined, their time-adjusted incidence was significant (P=0.004) when compared with that in the low-dose vehicle controls (controls 1/18, low-dose 15/35). The lower and nonsignificant incidences of these tumors observed in the mid- and high-dose groups may be due to the earlier mortality in these groups compared with the low-dose groups. In each sex of mid- and high-dose mice, incidences of lymphoma and leukemia were dose related (P<0.005), using vehicle controls; they were also significant (P<0.018) in direct comparisons of mid- and high-dose groups of both sexes with respective vehicle controls (males: controls 0/14, mid-dose 9/29, high-dose 11/25; females, time-adjusted: controls 0/15, mid-dose 14/18, high-dose 17/19). The significance of the incidence of lymphoma and leukemia in the mid- and high-dose groups of males was increased (P<0.001) when the pooled-control group was used, both in the test for dose-related trend and in tests for direct comparisons of dosed groups with the controls. In each sex of mice, sarcomas of the myocardium were found in all groups of dosed animals, but in no control animals (males: low-dose 5/40, mid-dose 7/29, high-dose 2/25; females: low-dose 8/34, mid-dose 2/7, high-dose 3/7). In males, the incidence in the mid-dose group was significant when compared with that in the pooled controls (P=0.006); in females, the incidences in the low- and high-dose groups were significant (P<0.023).

METHODS: To address these, with particular emphasis on the impact of the use of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) in RIST, we compared 39 consecutively registered patients who underwent RIST from an HLA-matched related donor and 33 patients who underwent conventional marrow-ablative transplantation. RESULTS: The incidences of grades II to IV acute and chronic GVHD tended to be less in RIST with ATG than in either RIST without ATG or conventional marrow-ablative transplantation. In a multivariate analysis, the predictive factors for acute and chronic GVHD included, respectively, ATG and grades II to IV acute GVHD. In a chimerism analysis, the achievement of complete donor chimera in T-cell lineage was delayed in RIST without ATG compared with RIST with ATG (P=0.038), which might explain the observed delayed onset of acute GVHD in RIST with ATG compared with the other two regimens. The ratio of type 1 and 2 dendritic cells did not affect the development of GVHD, whereas the number of naive CD4+ T cells did. No difference was observed in the incidence of clinically definitive infection, including cytomegalovirus, among the three cohorts, regardless of the use of ATG. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the conditioning regimen and immunosuppressive strategy after RIST should be carefully balanced against the risk of GVHD and of relapse of the basic disorder caused by the lack of a graft-versus-leukemia benefit.","['Nakai, Kunihisa', 'Mineishi, Shin', 'Kami, Masahiro', 'Saito, Takeshi', 'Hori, Akiko', 'Kojima, Rie', 'Imataki, Osamu', 'Hamaki, Tamae', 'Yoshihara, Satoshi', 'Ohnishi, Mutsuko', 'Kim, Sung-Won', 'Ando, Toshihiko', 'Fumitoh, Arima', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Makimoto, Atsushi', 'Tanosaki, Ryuji', 'Kanai, Sachiyo', 'Heike, Yuji', 'Ohnishi, Toshihiro', 'Kawano, Yoshifumi', 'Wakasugi, Hiro', 'Takaue, Yoichi']","['Nakai K', 'Mineishi S', 'Kami M', 'Saito T', 'Hori A', 'Kojima R', 'Imataki O', 'Hamaki T', 'Yoshihara S', 'Ohnishi M', 'Kim SW', 'Ando T', 'Fumitoh A', 'Kanda Y', 'Makimoto A', 'Tanosaki R', 'Kanai S', 'Heike Y', 'Ohnishi T', 'Kawano Y', 'Wakasugi H', 'Takaue Y']","['Stem Cell Transplant Unit, National Cancer Center Hospital, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Filgrastim', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",2003/06/28 05:00,2003/08/30 05:00,['2003/06/28 05:00'],"['2003/06/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2003 Jun 27;75(12):2135-43. doi: 10.1097/01.TP.0000066453.32263.F7.,,['10.1097/01.TP.0000066453.32263.F7 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since Tax has been shown to be critical for cellular transformation in vitro and interacts with numerous cellular processes, we hypothesized that the viral determinant of transformation tropism is encoded by tax. Using molecular clones of HTLV-1 (Ach) and HTLV-2 (pH6neo), we constructed recombinants in which tax and overlapping rex genes of the two viruses were exchanged. p19 Gag expression from proviral clones transfected into 293T cells indicated that both recombinants contained functional Tax and Rex but with significantly altered activity compared to the wild-type clones. Stable transfectants expressing recombinant viruses were established, irradiated, and cocultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Both recombinants were competent to transform T lymphocytes with an efficiency similar to that of the parental viruses. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that HTLV-1 and HTLV-1/TR2 had a preferential tropism for CD4+ T cells and that HTLV-2 and HTLV-2/TR1 had a preferential tropism for CD8(+) T cells. Our results indicate that tax/rex in different genetic backgrounds display altered functional activity but ultimately do not contribute to the different in vitro transformation tropisms. This first study with recombinants between HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 is the initial step in elucidating the different pathobiologies of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2.","['Ye, Jianxin', 'Xie, Li', 'Green, Patrick L']","['Ye J', 'Xie L', 'Green PL']","['Department of Veterinary Bioscience, The Ohio State University, 1925 Coffey Road, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/virology', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Products, rex/*physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Genes, pX', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/genetics/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Virus Replication']",2003/06/28 05:00,2003/08/06 05:00,['2003/06/28 05:00'],"['2003/06/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Jul;77(14):7728-35. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.14.7728-7735.2003.,,['10.1128/jvi.77.14.7728-7735.2003 [doi]'],,,"['R01 CA077556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 77556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,PMC161933,,,,,,,

We previously identified a transcriptional repression domain in MLL, which contains a region with homology to DNA methyltransferase. In chromosomal translocations, the MLL repression domain is retained in the leukemogenic fusion protein and is required for transforming activity of MLL fusion proteins. We explored the mechanism of action of the MLL repression domain. Histone deacetylase 1 interacts with the MLL repression domain, partially mediating its activity; binding of Cyp33 to the adjacent MLL-PHD domain potentiates this binding. Because the MLL repression domain activity was only partially relieved with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, we explored other protein interactions with this domain. Polycomb group proteins HPC2 and BMI-1 and the corepressor C-terminal-binding protein also bind the MLL repression domain. Expression of exogenous BMI-1 potentiates MLL repression domain activity. Functional antagonism between Mll and Bmi-1 has been shown genetically in murine knockout models for Mll and Bmi-1. Our new data suggest a model whereby recruitment of BMI-1 to the MLL protein may be able to modulate its function. Furthermore, repression mediated by histone deacetylases and that mediated by polycomb group proteins may act either independently or together for MLL function in vivo.","['Xia, Zhen-Biao', 'Anderson, Melanie', 'Diaz, Manuel O', 'Zeleznik-Le, Nancy J']","['Xia ZB', 'Anderson M', 'Diaz MO', 'Zeleznik-Le NJ']","['Department of Medicine, Molecular Oncology Program, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, IL 60153, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 1.1.- (Alcohol Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (C-terminal binding protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Cyclophilins)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (PPIE protein, human)', 'EC 6.- (Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBX4 protein, human)']",IM,"['Alcohol Oxidoreductases', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Cell Line/metabolism', 'Cyclophilins/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase 1', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Kidney/cytology/embryology', 'Ligases', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2003/06/28 05:00,2003/09/05 05:00,['2003/06/28 05:00'],"['2003/06/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Jul 8;100(14):8342-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1436338100.

Parallel assays using cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65 tetramers demonstrated the IFN-gamma copy number to be linearly related to the frequency of tetramer-binding T cells, sensitive to frequencies of 1 responding CD8+ T cell/100 000 CD8+ T cells. Responses to WT1 and PR1 but not BCR-ABL were detected in 10 of 18 healthy donors. Responses to WT1, PR1, or BCR-ABL were observed in 9 of 14 patients with CML before SCT and 5 of 6 after SCT, often to multiple epitopes. Responses were higher in patients with CML compared with healthy donors and highest after SCT. These antigen-specific CD8+ T cells comprised central memory (CD45RO+CD27+CD57-) and effector memory (CD45RO-CD27-CD57+) T cells. In conclusion, leukemia-reactive CD8+ T cells derive from memory T cells and occur at low frequencies in healthy individuals and at higher frequencies in patients with CML.

In total, 53 B-CLPD cases with 2 or more B-cell clones were studied. Presence of 2 or more B-cell clones was suspected by immunophenotype and confirmed by molecular/genetic techniques in leukemic samples (n = 42) and purified B-cell subpopulations (n = 10).

Bach2-expressing cells show reduced proliferation and undergo spontaneous cell death. The inhibition of BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase activity by STI571 in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lines and CD34+ cells from patients with CML in lymphoid crisis results in induction of BACH2 expression. We show here that BACH2 modifies the in vitro cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs. The cytotoxic effects of commonly used anticancer agents were studied by overexpression of BACH2 in RAJI lymphoid cells, a cell line that does not express endogenous BACH2. Cell growth inhibition was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Clones overexpressing BACH2 were more sensitive to etoposide, doxorubicin, and cytarabine than control RAJI cells, whereas there were no significant differences in the sensitivity of either cells to methotrexate or vincristine. Interestingly, we found that the former drugs were oxidative stressors that induced the nuclear accumulation of BACH2. In contrast, methotrexate or vincristine did not induce production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nuclear accumulation of BACH2. These results, coupled with our previous data showing that BACH2 promotes oxidative stress-induced cell death, suggest that combination chemotherapy involving STI571 and anticancer drugs that produce ROS may be of benefit in the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome 1 (Ph1)-positive leukemia.","['Kamio, Takuya', 'Toki, Tsutomu', 'Kanezaki, Rika', 'Sasaki, Shinya', 'Tandai, Satoru', 'Terui, Kiminori', 'Ikebe, Dai', 'Igarashi, Kazuhiko', 'Ito, Etsuro']","['Kamio T', 'Toki T', 'Kanezaki R', 'Sasaki S', 'Tandai S', 'Terui K', 'Ikebe D', 'Igarashi K', 'Ito E']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hirosaki University School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Aomori 036-8563 Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (BACH2 protein, human)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Oxidative Stress/genetics', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/analysis/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/metabolism/*physiology']",2003/06/28 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/06/28 05:00'],"['2003/06/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Nov 1;102(9):3317-22. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-12-3656.

These stem cells can migrate from their bone marrow microenvironment and can be found at low levels in the peripheral blood. The factors that regulate egress or ingress of the stem cells from the marrow include cytokines and chemokines. This process of stem cell trafficking is fundamental to both stem cell biology and stem cell transplantation. We show that primitive hematopoietic cells with cobblestone area-forming cell activity express receptors for and display enhanced motility in response to a new class of stem cell agonists, namely lysophospholipids. These agents synergistically promote chemokine-stimulated cell chemotaxis, a process that is crucial in stem cell homing. The response to lysophospholipids is mediated by Rac, Rho, and Cdc42 G proteins and the hematopoietic-specific guanyl nucleotide exchange factor Vav 1. Inhibitor studies also show a critical role for phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K). Lipid mediators, therefore, regulate the critical process of primitive hematopoietic cell motility via a PI3K- and Vav-dependent mechanism and may govern stem cell movement in vivo.

To investigate this possibility, we first developed a new assay for quantitating transplantable multilineage leukemia-initiating cells (L-ICs) in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-enriched mouse bone marrow (BM) cells transduced with a BCR-ABL-GFP (green fluorescent protein) retrovirus. The frequency of L-ICs (1 of 430 Sca-1+lin- cells) was 7-fold lower than the frequency of HSCs in the Sca-1+lin- subset transduced with a control virus (1 of 65 cells). Forced BCRABL expression was also accompanied by a loss of regular HSC activity consistent with the acquisition of an increased probability of differentiation. Interestingly, the frequency and in vivo behavior of wild-type (+/+) and SHIP-/- L-ICs were indistinguishable, and in vitro, Sca-1+lin- BCR-ABL-transduced SHIP-/- cells showed a modestly reduced factor independence. Comparison of different populations of cells from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase and normal human BM showed that the reduced expression of full-length SHIP proteins seen in the more mature (CD34-lin+) leukemic cells is not mirrored in the more primitive (CD34+lin-) leukemic cells. Thus, SHIP expression appears to be differently altered in the early and late stages of differentiation of BCR-ABL-transformed cells, underscoring the importance of the cellular context in which its mechanistic effects are analyzed.","['Jiang, Xiaoyan', 'Stuible, Matthew', 'Chalandon, Yves', 'Li, Andra', 'Chan, Wing Yiu', 'Eisterer, Wolfgang', 'Krystal, Gerald', 'Eaves, Allen', 'Eaves, Connie']","['Jiang X', 'Stuible M', 'Chalandon Y', 'Li A', 'Chan WY', 'Eisterer W', 'Krystal G', 'Eaves A', 'Eaves C']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, 601 W 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada. xjiang@bccancer.bc.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (INPPL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cells', 'Time Factors']",2003/06/28 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/06/28 05:00'],"['2003/06/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Oct 15;102(8):2976-84. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-05-1550.

Virtually nothing is known about its formation or pathogenetic impact. We evaluated 10 patients with ALL using 38 microsatellite markers mapped to 18 of the 24 human chromosomes to investigate the mechanisms underlying hyperdiploidy and to ascertain the parental origin of the trisomies. Based on the results, doubling of a near-haploid clone and polyploidization with subsequent losses of chromosomes could be excluded. The finding of equal allele dosage for tetrasomy 21 suggests that hyperdiploidy originates in a single aberrant mitosis, though a sequential gain of chromosomes other than 21 in consecutive cell divisions remains a possibility. Our study, the first to address experimentally the parental origin of trisomies in ALL, revealed no preferential duplication of maternally or paternally inherited copies of X, 4, 6, 9, 10, 17, 18, and 21. Trisomy 8 was of paternal origin in 4 of 4 patients (P =.125), and +14 was of maternal origin in 7 of 8 patients (P =.0703). Thus, the present results indicate that imprinting is not pathogenetically important in hyperdiploid childhood ALL, with the possible exception of the observed parental skewness of +8 and +14.","['Paulsson, Kajsa', 'Panagopoulos, Ioannis', 'Knuutila, Sakari', 'Jee, Kowan Ja', 'Garwicz, Stanislaw', 'Fioretos, Thoas', 'Mitelman, Felix', 'Johansson, Bertil']","['Paulsson K', 'Panagopoulos I', 'Knuutila S', 'Jee KJ', 'Garwicz S', 'Fioretos T', 'Mitelman F', 'Johansson B']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University Hospital, SE-221 85 Lund, Sweden. kajsa.paulsson@klingen.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Diploidy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Mitosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Trisomy']",2003/06/28 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/06/28 05:00'],"['2003/06/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Oct 15;102(8):3010-5. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-05-1444.

Cytogenetic features may further refine this prognosis and identify patients with a poor outcome. We examined the effect of sex, age, individual trisomies, modal number, and structural abnormalities on survival among 700 children with HeH. Univariate analysis showed that age. sex, +4, +10, +18, and a high modal number were associated with survival. Multivariate analysis however, revealed that only age, sex, +4, and +18 were independent indicators. Hazard scores for predicting relapse and mortality were constructed. Three risk groups with 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rates of 86%, 75%, and 50% (P <.0001) were identified. The high-risk group comprised boys older than 9 years, boys aged 1 through 9 years without +18, and girls older than 9 years without +18, while girls aged 1 through 9 years with +18 had the best EFS. In terms of mortality, those younger than age 10 years with both +4 and +18 had an improved survival (96% vs 84% at 5 years, P <.0001).

The ABL kinase activity is blocked by the ABL kinase inhibitor STI571 which abrogates transformation by X-ABL. To investigate the role of oligomerization for the transformation potential of X-ABL and for the sensitivity to STI571, we constructed ABL chimeras with oligomerization interfaces of proteins involved in leukemia-associated translocations such as BCR, TEL, PML, and PLZF. We assessed the capacity of these chimeras to form high molecular weight (HMW) complexes as compared with p185(BCR-ABL). There was a direct relationship between the size of HMW complexes formed by these chimeras and their capacity to induce factor independence in Ba/F3 cells, whereas there was an inverse relationship between the size of the HMW complexes and the sensitivity to STI571. The targeting of the oligomerization interface of p185(BCR-ABL) by a peptide representing the coiled coil region of BCR reduced its potential to transform fibroblasts and increased sensitivity to STI571.

Although activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB/Rel has been demonstrated, mechanisms of NF-kappaB/Rel activation by Bcr-Abl remain obscure. In this paper we demonstrate activation of NF-kappaB/Rel by Bcr-Abl and for the first time by v-Abl. Furthermore, we investigated mechanisms of NF-kappaB/Rel induction by Bcr-Abl and v-Abl. Both Bcr-Abl and v-Abl induced NF-kappaB/Rel DNA binding in Ba/F3 cells. DNA binding was a result of nuclear translocation of p65/RelA, whereas p65/RelA expression was unaffected. Nuclear translocation of p65/RelA is at least partially due to increased IkappaBalpha degradation, which is independent of IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity. IKK activity is not deregulated by Bcr-Abl and v-Abl. NF-kappaB/Rel transactivation was dependent on abl kinase activity but independent of Grb2 and Grb10 binding tobcr sequences. In addition, NF-kappaB/Rel activation was dependent on Ras activity. Primary CML blasts showed constitutive p65/RelA NF-kappaB/Rel DNA binding activity. Thus NF-kappaB/Rel represents a potential target for molecular therapies in CML.","['Kirchner, Dieter', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Ottmann, Oliver', 'Schmid, Roland M', 'Bergmann, Lothar', 'Munzert, Gerd']","['Kirchner D', 'Duyster J', 'Ottmann O', 'Schmid RM', 'Bergmann L', 'Munzert G']","['Abteilung Innere Medizin III, Universitat Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Nfkbia protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-rel)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (Chuk protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKE protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (Ikbkb protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (Ikbke protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Mice', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins v-rel/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'ras Proteins']",2003/06/28 05:00,2003/08/09 05:00,['2003/06/28 05:00'],"['2003/06/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Jun;31(6):504-11. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00069-9.,,"['S0301472X03000699 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00069-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A differential expression of chemokines and chemokine receptors might account for some aspects of the pattern of invasion and accumulation of leukemic cells. We aimed at defining the pattern of chemokine and chemokine receptor expression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts in comparison with their putative normal cell counterparts. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five cases of AML were analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of several chemokine receptors and by RT-PCR for the expression of relevant chemokines. For selected chemokines, the production was confirmed by ELISA. AML blasts were also assessed for their migration capacity in response to autologous supernatants and recombinant chemokines. RESULTS: Undifferentiated AML (MO-M1 and some M2) express only CXCR4 on their surface and produce mainly inflammatory chemokines, resembling normal CD34+ progenitors. More differentiated AML (M4-M5 and some M2) have a more diversified receptor repertoire and, besides CXCR4, express the receptors for inflammatory chemokines and produce both constitutive and inflammatory chemokines, resembling resting and activated monocytes. In particular, M4-M5 blasts produce MCP-1 and MIP-3alpha and also express their specific receptors (CCR2 and, to a lesser extent, CCR6) and migrate in vitro in response to MCP-1 and MIP-3alpha and to their own supernatant. A significant correlation between extramedullary involvement and coexpression of MCP-1/CCR2 was found. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that chemokines and their receptors segregate within the different FAB subtypes and, by allowing cross-talk among members of the malignant clone, might help to explain some aspects of the pattern of invasion in AML with monocytic differentiation.","['Cignetti, Alessandro', 'Vallario, Antonella', 'Roato, Ilaria', 'Circosta, Paola', 'Strola, Giuliana', 'Scielzo, Cristina', 'Allione, Bernardino', 'Garetto, Lucia', 'Caligaris-Cappio, Federico', 'Ghia, Paolo']","['Cignetti A', 'Vallario A', 'Roato I', 'Circosta P', 'Strola G', 'Scielzo C', 'Allione B', 'Garetto L', 'Caligaris-Cappio F', 'Ghia P']","['University Division of Clinical Immunology and Hematology, Ospedale Mauriziano Umberto I, Turin, Italy. alex.cignetti@ircc.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (CCL20 protein, human)', '0 (CCR6 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Chemokine CCL20)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CCR6)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Movement', 'Chemokine CCL2/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Chemokine CCL20', 'Chemokines/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Chemokines, CC/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*pathology', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/metabolism/*pathology', '*Receptor Cross-Talk', 'Receptors, CCR6', 'Receptors, Chemokine/analysis/*biosynthesis']",2003/06/28 05:00,2003/08/09 05:00,['2003/06/28 05:00'],"['2003/06/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Jun;31(6):495-503. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00066-3.,,"['S0301472X03000663 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00066-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we describe for the first time the sequencing of the entire BM5eco viral genome as well as analysis of homology with two other previously sequenced and well-characterized MuLVs, Emv-11 and Emv-2, the latter constituting the parental virus for BM5eco. We propose that the detailed sequence comparisons herein provide cogent evidence that BM5eco utilizes variations in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes as an immune escape mechanism.

To identify ODN properties that would facilitate cellular uptake, we developed a repetitive selection procedure using an ODN library containing at least 10(14) different molecules and human B lymphoma cells as a target. Natural phosphodiester single-stranded DNA ODNs (R-aptamers) were obtained after 10 rounds of selection. A common feature in the R-aptamers was guanine-rich 3' terminal sequences, and many also contained potential immunostimulatory (ISS) CpG sequence motifs. Two R-aptamers (R10-60 and D-R15-8) with the predominant shared characteristics were selected for further study on primary human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells, which are well known to be difficult to transfect and activate. Flow cytometry analysis of the CLL cells demonstrated that the fluorochrome-labeled R-aptamers were internalized much more efficiently than nonselected random sequence ODN. Studies on sequence modifications indicated that efficient uptake required ODN multimerization, that was promoted by guanine-rich sequences at the 3' terminus. In addition, CLL cells that were exposed to the aggregating R-aptamers containing CpG motifs were strongly activated, as indicated by upregulation of CD40 levels as compared to cells treated with nonaggregating CpG R-aptamers. Together, these findings suggest that the sequence compositions in R-aptamers that promote multimerization and contain optimal ISS CpG motifs facilitate the delivery of ISS-ODN to CLL cells and enhance the activation of these cells.","['Wu, Christina C N', 'Castro, Januario E', 'Motta, Marina', 'Cottam, Howard B', 'Kyburz, Diego', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Corr, Maripat', 'Carson, Dennis A']","['Wu CC', 'Castro JE', 'Motta M', 'Cottam HB', 'Kyburz D', 'Kipps TJ', 'Corr M', 'Carson DA']","['Division of Rheumatology Allergy and Immunology, Department of Medicine, Sam and Rose Stein Institute for Research on Aging, University of California-San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093-0663, USA. c5wu@ucsd.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (CPG-oligonucleotide)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (TLR9 protein, human)', '0 (Tlr9 protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotides/*chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Permeability', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/analysis/immunology/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/06/28 05:00,2003/09/27 05:00,['2003/06/28 05:00'],"['2003/06/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2003 Jun 10;14(9):849-60. doi: 10.1089/104303403765701141.,,['10.1089/104303403765701141 [doi]'],,,"['AR 07567/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR 44850/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 23200/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: To determine the risk factors for developing histologically confirmed acute cutaneous GVHD in patients who underwent allogeneic SCT for different haematological disorders. METHODS: This retrospective study was based on review of clinical files and databases from 300 consecutive patients with several haematological disorders who received allogeneic SCT between 1 January 1984 and 31 December 1999 at Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain. Variables evaluated included diagnosis of haematological disorder, age and gender (donor and recipient), HLA matching, female donor to male recipient, donor and recipient viral serology (cytomegalovirus), conditioning regimen, GVHD prophylaxis, blood counts at day of engraftment, mortality, cause of death, and survival at 100 days, 5 years and 10 years following SCT. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, risk factors for acute cutaneous GVHD were type of haematological disease (P = 0.006), HLA disparity (P = 0.006), number of transplants per patient (P = 0.017), conditioning regimen (P = 0.001), and GVHD prophylaxis (P = 0.025). Survival rates did not differ significantly for cases and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for acute cutaneous GVHD were a diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukaemia, HLA disparity, receipt of more than one SCT, conditioning regimens including total body irradiation, and GVHD prophylaxis regimens other than ciclosporin plus methotrexate. Other common risk factors for acute GVHD without specific target organ involvement showed no significant association with the risk for developing acute GVHD affecting the skin as primary target organ.","['Vargas-Diez, E', 'Fernandez-Herrera, J', 'Marin, A', 'Camara, R', 'Garcia-Diez, A']","['Vargas-Diez E', 'Fernandez-Herrera J', 'Marin A', 'Camara R', 'Garcia-Diez A']","['Departments of Dermatology, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, C/Diego de Leon 62, 28006 Madrid, Spain. erichvargas@aedv.es']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Dermatol,The British journal of dermatology,0004041,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin Diseases/*etiology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/06/28 05:00,2003/09/17 05:00,['2003/06/28 05:00'],"['2003/06/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Dermatol. 2003 Jun;148(6):1129-34. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2133.2003.05336.x.,,"['5336 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2133.2003.05336.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with CLL are at an increased risk for the development of second malignant neoplasms, the most common of which is cuta-neous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Cutaneous infiltrates of CLL have been reported in association with primary cutaneous neoplasms, including SCC, basal cell carcinoma, and actinic keratosis. The finding of a dense lymphocytic infiltrate surrounding a cutaneous neoplasm should prompt consideration of possible underlying CLL. OBJECTIVE: To review the relationship of CLL to cutaneous SCC and to raise awareness of the possible coexistence of these two neoplasms. METHODS: The case report describes a patient with a SCC of the left cheek treated with Mohs micrographic surgery. A dense lymphocytic infiltrate was noted on the frozen sections, and a complete blood count was obtained. RESULTS: A lymphocytosis was detected, leading to the diagnosis of CLL, stage 0. CONCLUSION: Patients with CLL are at an increased risk for the development of cutaneous neoplasms. An infiltrate of leukemic cells in documented CLL patients can be associated with cutaneous neoplasms such as SCC. We present a patient with no known hematologic malignancy who demonstrated a dense lymphocytic infiltrate on Mohs sections. The diagnosis of CLL was considered based on the appearance of this infiltrate. Subsequently, a new case of CLL was confirmed with appropriate testing. The finding of a dense subcutaneous infiltrate of lymphocytes on Mohs frozen sections should raise the possibility of CLL and lead to appropriate screening tests.","['Padgett, Julia K', 'Parlette, Harry L 3rd', 'English, Joseph C 3rd']","['Padgett JK', 'Parlette HL 3rd', 'English JC 3rd']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22908-0718, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Dermatol Surg,Dermatologic surgery : official publication for American Society for Dermatologic Surgery [et al.],9504371,,IM,"['Aged', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*pathology/surgery', 'Facial Neoplasms/*pathology/surgery', 'Frozen Sections', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mohs Surgery']",2003/06/28 05:00,2003/09/05 05:00,['2003/06/28 05:00'],"['2003/06/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Dermatol Surg. 2003 Jul;29(7):769-71. doi: 10.1046/j.1524-4725.2003.29194.x.,,"['29194 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1524-4725.2003.29194.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have analyzed this translocation in an attempt to evaluate its incidence and to monitor minimal residual disease (MRD) with t (12; 21) rearrangement by detection of TEL-AML1 transcript in patients with childhood ALL. PROCEDURE: All cryopreserved bone marrow samples were analyzed using a nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. TEL-AML1 transcripts were searched for in 34 ALL patients, including six in relapse consecutively diagnosed at our institution between 1991 and 1997. RESULTS: TEL-AML1 transcripts were found in five (19%) of 27 patients with B precursor ALL. The patients with BCR-ABL, chromosome 11q23 rearrangement and T-ALL patients did not express TEL-AML1 transcripts. Moreover, MRD in five patients with TEL-AML1 transcripts were analyzed in serial samples. Although TEL-AML1 transcripts disappeared soon after the beginning of chemotherapy in three of the five patients, one patient continued to express them for up to 21 months without recurrence and remained in continuous complete remission for seven years after the cessation of chemotherapy. The remaining patient was admitted to our hospital after the second relapse but died following a failure to induce complete remission. CONCLUSION: For most patients, the presence of TEL-AML1 transcripts suggests excellent chemosensitivity and a favorable prognosis, but some patients with these transcripts have a different outcome.

METHODS: Provided by the KCBB, between February 1997 and September 2000, 12 patients had unrelated CBT as a second HSCT. Six patients were male and six female; nine patients were in malignant, and three were in non-malignant conditions. The median age of the patients was 7.9 years (range, 2.2-28.0), and the median bodyweight was 22.5 kg (12.0-55.0). The HLA-A and -B serological and DR genotypical disparities between the patients and CBT donors were as follows: one patient was a 0-mismatch, six were 1-mismatches, and five were 2-mismatches. RESULTS: The median time between first and second HSCT was 14.0 months (1.0-47.0). The overall survival rate was 25.0%, three years after CBT (Kaplan-Meier estimate). Mortality after CBT as a second HSCT accounted for nine cases, six from infection and three from treatment-related mortality other than infection. CONCLUSION: Cord blood transplantation offers the advantage of rapid availability, absence of donor risk, and possibly less HLA restriction. In these contexts, unrelated CBT should be considered as a source of HSCT for a second transplant.","['Isoyama, Keiichi', 'Ohnuma, Kei', 'Ikuta, Koichiro', 'Toyoda, Yasunori', 'Nakajima, Fumiaki', 'Yamada, Kouichiro', 'Nishihira, Hirokazu']","['Isoyama K', 'Ohnuma K', 'Ikuta K', 'Toyoda Y', 'Nakajima F', 'Yamada K', 'Nishihira H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,['EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)'],IM,"['Adrenoleukodystrophy/therapy', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Mucopolysaccharidosis II/therapy', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/deficiency', 'Recurrence', 'Retreatment']",2003/06/28 05:00,2003/10/15 05:00,['2003/06/28 05:00'],"['2003/06/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2003 Jun;45(3):268-74. doi: 10.1046/j.1442-200x.2003.01717.x.,,"['1717 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1442-200x.2003.01717.x [doi]']",,,,,['Kanagawa Cord Blood Bank'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations associated with neoplasia development and evolution are very valuable, and the related genes are classified as: oncogenes, tumor suppressing genes, DNA repairing genes and cell cycle regulator genes. The factability to determine and characterize these genes and relate them with one or several steps of tumorogenesis, makes them molecular markers that let us predict risk, make an early diagnosis, confirm a diagnosis, establish prognosis, guide the therapy and determine resistance to treatments.

The frequency of MTHFR genotype was insignificantly higher in ALL (7.7%) and ANLL (6.3%) than in controls (4.4%). Equal distribution of the GSTM1 null genotype was detected between ALL patients and controls (55%), while its incidence was slightly higher in ANLL patients (61.3%). Although GSTT1 null genotype was insignificantly lower in ALL patients (20.9%) than controls (22.7%), it was significantly underrepresented in ANLL patients (6.5%) (P = 0.05, OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.05-1.03). The homozygous frequency of GSTP1 genotype did not differ significantly between groups of ALL (3.7%), ANLL patients (9.1%) and controls (4.9%). Homozygous CYP1A1*2A genotype was underrepresented in ALL patients (1%) as compared to control (4.8%) but the differences did not reach to statistical significance (OR 0.21; 95% CI 0.03-1.72). Homozygosity for this genotype was not detected in ANLL patients. No particular association was noted between different combinations of combined genotypes and risk of development of childhood ALL and ANLL. These results suggested that there are no significant associations between the studied genotypes and the risk of developing either form of acute leukemia except GSTT1 null and homozygosity for CYP1A1 genotypes that may play protective roles in the development of ANLL in Turkish children.","['Balta, Gunay', 'Yuksek, Nazmiye', 'Ozyurek, Emel', 'Ertem, Ulya', 'Hicsonmez, Gonul', 'Altay, Cigdem', 'Gurgey, Aytemiz']","['Balta G', 'Yuksek N', 'Ozyurek E', 'Ertem U', 'Hicsonmez G', 'Altay C', 'Gurgey A']","['Hacettepe University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Institute of Child Health and Section of Pediatric Hematology, Ankara, Turkey. gbalta@hacettepe.edu.tr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)', 'EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/*genetics', '*Genotype', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/blood/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/enzymology/*genetics', 'Reference Values']",2003/06/27 05:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2003/06/27 05:00'],"['2003/06/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/27 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2003 Jul;73(3):154-60. doi: 10.1002/ajh.10339.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/ajh.10339 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of VEGF and other growth factors, including c-Abl, c-Kit, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF), or their receptors containing tyrosine kinase domains by antiangiogenesis drugs disrupts cell survival signal transduction pathways and may contribute to the proapoptotic pathways in malignant cells. However, clinical trials suggest that signal transduction inhibitors have considerable antitumor activity when used as single agents only for a short time, most likely due to the development of drug resistance by the host or by the tumor cells. In order to prevent this problem and to augment their antitumor efficacy, these agents could be administered in combination with cytotoxic antineoplastic drugs. We hypothesized that the combination of the antiangiogenesis tyrosine kinase inhibitors with cytotoxic drugs would produce synergistic drug regimens. Two human T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines that express VEGF-R1, CEM/0 (wild-type, WT) and the drug-resistant clone CEM/ara-C/I/ASNase-0.5-2, were utilized in the drug combination studies. NSC 680410, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor given at 0.1 to 1 microM for 72 h, inhibited VEGF secretion and leukemic cell growth at 90% of vehicle-treated control cultures with an IC50 value of less than 1 microM. The cytotoxic drugs idarubicin (IDA), fludarabine (Fludara), and cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) were used for the various drug combinations. One-, two-, three-, and four-drug treatments were tested. Cell viability was documented by the MTT assay and photomicrographic estimation of apoptotic cells. Both the combination index (CI) and isobologram evaluations demonstrated strong synergism between these drugs and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor. NSC 680410 was highly synergistic with IDA, IDA + ara-C, and IDA + Fludara + ara-C, over the respective cytotoxic drug regimens at concentrations easily achieved in patient plasma. NSC 680410 potentiated the activity of IDA in both leukemia cell lines by 17.8- and 221.4-fold in the WT and drug-resistant line, respectively. The activity of NSC 680410 + IDA + ara-C was also potentiated by 58.8-fold in the WT line, and the activity of NSC 680410 + IDA + Fludara + ara-C by 2.4- and 6.47x10(6)-fold in the WT and drug-resistant lines, respectively. The results suggest that IDA was not needed for optimal synergistic activity in the CEM/0 cells, but IDA was a necessary component to obtain drug synergism in the drug-resistant clone. Similarly, STI571 (imatinib mesylate, Gleevec), the p210(bcr/abl) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, demonstrated synergism with Fludara + ara-C or IDA + ara-C. Most importantly STI571 showed synergism with NSC 680410, suggesting that these drugs inhibit different tyrosine kinase domains in human leukemia cells. Lastly, pretreatment of leukemic cells with NSC 680410 showed additivity with gamma radiation in comparison to either treatment modality alone. The data, taken together, suggest that by inhibiting the pro-survival signal transduction pathway (VEGF-R1) and DNA replication by cytotoxic drugs, leukemic cells undergo apoptosis in a synergistic manner. In conclusion, the combinations of antiangiogenesis and DNA-damaging cytotoxic drugs are highly synergistic regimens in both WT and drug-resistant leukemic cell lines and they should be examined further.","['Avramis, Ioannis A', 'Laug, Walter E', 'Sausville, Edward A', 'Avramis, Vassilios I']","['Avramis IA', 'Laug WE', 'Sausville EA', 'Avramis VI']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, USC Keck School of Medicine, 4650 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (NSC 680410)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '1X9VK9O1SC (fludarabine phosphate)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'PJY633525U (Adamantane)']",IM,"['Adamantane/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*pharmacology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2003/06/27 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/06/27 05:00'],"['2003/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2003/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/06/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/27 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2003 Oct;52(4):307-18. doi: 10.1007/s00280-003-0668-y.

To examine the joint effects of leptin and LIF on embryonic development, we studied preimplantation development and activation of STAT3 signaling of mouse embryos after exposure to leptin and/or LIF in vitro. Two-cell mouse embryos (Day 2) were cultured in the presence of leptin and/or LIF. Significantly fewer leptin-exposed than control embryos hatched by Day 5 and by Day 6 of development. In addition, cells of leptin-exposed Day 5 blastocysts showed a higher rate of DNA fragmentation, which is a sign of apoptosis. Leukemia inhibitory factor alone had no effect on the rates of embryonic development or DNA fragmentation. Simultaneous exposure of embryos to leptin and LIF increased the proportion of hatching embryos and decreased the rate of apoptosis compared to embryos exposed to leptin only. Leptin treatment was associated with an increased phospho-STAT3-specific immunofluorescence in the cell membrane of blastocysts, which was not observed in LIF-exposed embryos. In conclusion, LIF modifies the effect of leptin during preimplantation embryo development in mice, presumably by interfering with activation of STAT3 signaling.","['Fedorcsak, Peter', 'Storeng, Ritsa']","['Fedorcsak P', 'Storeng R']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Oslo 0027, Norway. peter.fedorcsak@klinmed.uio.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Leptin)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (leptin receptor, mouse)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Blastocyst/*drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leptin/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/genetics', 'Receptors, Cytokine/drug effects/genetics', 'Receptors, Leptin', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology']",2003/06/27 05:00,2004/07/28 05:00,['2003/06/27 05:00'],"['2003/06/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/27 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Reprod. 2003 Nov;69(5):1531-8. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod.103.019034.

In our study, we modified previously described nonradioactive flow-cytometric T-cell activation assay measuring the expression of a CD69+ antigen on T-cell subsets and applied it to analysis of lymphocyte subsets activation/proliferation in children after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). We compared the percentage of spontaneously activated lymphocyte subpopulations (background) and the percentage of PHA-P, PWM, and SEB-stimulated cell subsets from two groups of patients: group 1, children with Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) and group 2, children without any signs of GvHD at the time of analysis. High rate of spontaneous T-cell subset activation was found in group 1 with CD3+CD8+Ts cells being the most affected cell population. High background activation of Th and B cells correlated with the occurrence of autoimmune phenomena posttransplant. Rapid quantification of CD69+ expression on unstimulated and stimulated T-cell subsets proved to be a valuable method for monitoring children after allogeneic HCT. High proportion of activated, unstimulated Ts cells observed in the GvHD group may underline the critical role of CD3+CD8+ cells in the pathogenesis of GvHD. Thus in future immunosuppressive therapy may be adjusted according to the proportion of activated Ts cells.","['Kalwak, K', 'Turkiewicz, D', 'Ussowicz, M', 'Gorczynska, E', 'Toporski, J', 'Ryczan, R', 'Rybka, B', 'Noworolska-Sauren, D', 'Chybicka, A']","['Kalwak K', 'Turkiewicz D', 'Ussowicz M', 'Gorczynska E', 'Toporski J', 'Ryczan R', 'Rybka B', 'Noworolska-Sauren D', 'Chybicka A']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland. kk@pedhemat.am.wroc.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplant Proc,Transplantation proceedings,0243532,"['10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'Child', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/surgery/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/surgery/therapy', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*immunology', 'Tritium']",2003/06/27 05:00,2004/02/12 05:00,['2003/06/27 05:00'],"['2003/06/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/27 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplant Proc. 2003 Jun;35(4):1559-62. doi: 10.1016/s0041-1345(03)00512-8.,,"['S0041134503005128 [pii]', '10.1016/s0041-1345(03)00512-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we examine the potential role of the interleukin-10 (IL-10) gene as a susceptibility gene in IBD. METHODS: We studied 17 sib-pairs with either Crohn disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis. After microsatellite analysis for allele-sharing, the IL-10 gene of sib-pairs who shared alleles was screened for nucleotide alterations in and around exons and the promoter region. The IL-10 promoter polymorphism at position -1082 was also determined. Function was evaluated by measuring IL-10 secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or phorbol ester. The activity of recombinant immature wild-type and mutated IL-10 was tested in a proliferation assay with a human monocytic leukaemia cell line (HL60 cells). RESULTS: DNA sequencing revealed a G --> A point mutation in exon 1 at base position 43 in one sib-pair, both affected with CD. It was also found in 2 of their healthy siblings, but not in 75 unrelated healthy controls. This mutation results in a glycine to arginine substitution at amino acid position 15 of the leader sequence (Gly15Arg). The in vitro IL-10 secretion by mononuclear cells of the IL-10 Gly15Arg carriers was about 50% of healthy controls, matched for the -1082 polymorphism in the IL-10 promoter region. Incubation of HL60 cells with recombinant mutated IL-10 showed a markedly reduced cell proliferation compared to wild-type IL-10.

To investigate the significance of these mechanisms on an early stage of human breast tumour growth, we studied the expression of EGFR (ErbB1), HER-2/neu (ErbB2), cyclin D1, p21 and p53 as well as oestrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) in paraffin sections of 45 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) by immunohistochemistry. Cell proliferation was assessed by immunohistochemical quantification of Ki-67. Five cases with cyclin D1 overexpression were analysed by FISH for CCND1 amplification. Increased proliferative activity was observed in 46% of DCIS. It was correlated with the expression of EGFR and HER-2/neu (p < 0.05), but neither with cyclin D1 and p21 overexpression nor with p53 accumulation. ErbB positive status was associated with p21 overexpression (p < 0.05). In addition we found a correlation between the overexpression of p21 and cyclin D1 restricted to ErbB-positive cases (p = 0.013). ErbB-negative tumours with increased proliferative activity were ER and cyclin D1 positive. No CCND1 amplification was detected in the analysed cases. In conclusion, our data support that EGFR and HER-2/neu play an important role in cell cycle control in DCIS. p21 appears to be a potential mediator of ErbB signalling. We propose that cyclin D1 could be indirectly induced by ErbB signalling through p21. Besides, ER-mediated upregulation of cyclin D1 seems to be a possible mechanism of maintaining cell proliferation in DCIS in case of EGFR- and HER-2/neu-negativity.","['Lebeau, Annette', 'Unholzer, Angela', 'Amann, Gudrun', 'Kronawitter, Michaela', 'Bauerfeind, Ingo', 'Sendelhofert, Andrea', 'Iff, Anette', 'Lohrs, Udo']","['Lebeau A', 'Unholzer A', 'Amann G', 'Kronawitter M', 'Bauerfeind I', 'Sendelhofert A', 'Iff A', 'Lohrs U']","['Pathologisches Institut, der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Germany.

The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of adrenal insufficiency and the time for children with ALL to recover after treatment with the glucorticoids prednisolone or dexamethasone. PROCEDURE: Seventeen children, 2-15 years, with ALL were studied after receiving prednisolone (60 mg/m(2)/day, n = 10) for 5 weeks during remission induction therapy or dexamethasone (10 mg/m(2)/day, n = 7) for 3 weeks during reinduction therapy. Both drugs were tapered over 9 days. The adrenal function was assessed by an ACTH stimulation test within 2 weeks after discontinuing glucocorticoid therapy. In case of adrenal insufficiency, the ACTH test was repeated at 3-5 weeks interval, and patients were put on hydrocortisone substitution therapy. RESULTS: Three out of ten patients had a normal adrenal function within the first 2 weeks after prednisolone therapy. Another three patients recovered within 7 weeks, whereas the remaining four patients still showed adrenal insufficiency at the end of follow-up after 2.5-4 months. For dexamethasone, two out of seven patients showed a normal adrenal function within the first 2 weeks. Of the remaining patients, two recovered within 7 weeks, whereas three patients still had a demonstrated adrenal insufficiency at the end of follow-up after 4-8 months. CONCLUSIONS: Adrenal insufficiency occurs and may persist for several months in children with ALL after treatment with high doses of prednisolone or dexamethasone.","['Petersen, Kamilla B', 'Muller, Jorn', 'Rasmussen, Mette', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld']","['Petersen KB', 'Muller J', 'Rasmussen M', 'Schmiegelow K']","['Department of Pharmaceutics, The Royal Danish School of Pharmacy, 2 Universitetsparken, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Glands/drug effects/physiopathology', 'Adrenal Insufficiency/*chemically induced', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage/*adverse effects']",2003/06/26 05:00,2003/08/13 05:00,['2003/06/26 05:00'],"['2003/06/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/26 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2003 Aug;41(2):110-4. doi: 10.1002/mpo.10316.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/mpo.10316 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Originally, this initiation-promotion protocol was established in Japan with the isogenic Fischer 344 male rat. Among the initiating agents used in that assay, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) rapidly induces malignant lymphoma and leukemia and early mortality of rats from different strains. This study was developed to evaluate whether the outbred Wistar rats are also similarly susceptible to MNU. Particularly, it aimed to evaluate the dose-response relationship and to register the MNU-induced pre-neoplasia and neoplasia that may develop in the lympho-hematopoietic system (LHS) of the Wistar rat within a medium-term period. Four groups of male Wistar rats were treated during 2 weeks with vehicle or with MNU (80, 160 or 240 mg/kg body weight, i.p.). After sacrifice at the 12th and 20th weeks, the thymus, spleen, bone marrow, cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes and liver were collected for analysis. At the 20th week, LHS malignant tumors and benign vascular tumors occurred only in the high- and intermediate-dose MNU-treated animals. Four animals treated with 240 mg/kg developed diffuse thymic lymphomas; two others, treated respectively with 240 mg/kg and 160 mg/kg, developed spleen hemangiomas. The present observations indicate that the Wistar strain is as susceptible as other strains to the early development of MNU-induced LHS (pre)neoplasia. Therefore, this strain seems suitable to be used as test system in bioassay protocols that adopt MNU as an initiating agent for carcinogenesis.","['da Silva Franchi, Carla Adriene', 'Bacchi, Maura Moscardi', 'Padovani, Carlos Roberto', 'de Camargo, Joao Lauro Viana']","['da Silva Franchi CA', 'Bacchi MM', 'Padovani CR', 'de Camargo JL']","['Center for Genotoxins and Carcinogens Evaluation (TOXICAN), Institute of BioSciences, UNESP, Botucatu, 18618-000, SP, Brasil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '684-93-5 (Methylnitrosourea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Male', 'Methylnitrosourea/*toxicity', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*chemically induced/*pathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Spleen/drug effects/pathology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*chemically induced/*pathology']",2003/06/26 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/06/26 05:00'],"['2003/06/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/26 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2003 Mar;94(3):240-3. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2003.tb01427.x.,,['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2003.tb01427.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT) is expressed by practically all GISTs, and gain-of-function mutations of KIT are present in most GISTs. Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) are the pacemaker of the peristaltic movement of the GI tract. Since signals through KIT are essential for development of ICC and since multiple GISTs develop from the hyperplastic lesion of ICCs in familial GIST patients with germline mutations of KIT, GISTs are considered to originate from ICC. Imatinib mesylate, which was developed for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), was found to be useful for treatment of GISTs. Imatinib mesylate inhibits BCR-ABL fused tyrosine kinase that causes CML. Imatinib mesylate also inhibits the mutated KIT observed in most GISTs, and this explains the effectiveness of Imatinib mesylate on GISTs.

K562/MDR cells that overexpress P-gp were 3.67 times more resistant to STI571 than the parental Philadelphia-chromosome-positive (Ph +) CML K562 cells, and this resistance was most effectively reversed by cepharanthine among the tested reversing agents. The concentration of STI571 required to completely inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation in K562/MDR cells was about 3 times higher than that in K562 cells, and cepharanthine abolished the difference. In KB-G2 cells that overexpress P-gp, but not Bcr-Abl, 2.5 micro M STI571 partly reversed the resistance to vincristine (VCR), paclitaxel, etoposide (VP-16) and actinomycin D (ACD) but not to Adriamycin (ADM) or colchicine. STI571 increased the accumulation of VCR, but not that of ADM in KB-G2 cells. STI571 did not reverse resistance to any agent in KB/MRP cells that overexpress MRP1. These findings suggest that STI571 is a substrate for P-gp, but is less efficiently transported by P-gp than VCR, and STI571 is not a substrate for MRP1. Among the tested reversing agents that interact with P-gp, cepharanthine was the most effective agent for the reversal of the resistance to STI571 in K562/MDR cells. Furthermore, STI571 itself was a potent reversing agent for MDR in P-gp-expressing KB-G2 cells.","['Mukai, Motoi', 'Che, Xiao-Fang', 'Furukawa, Tatsuhiko', 'Sumizawa, Tomoyuki', 'Aoki, Shunji', 'Ren, Xiao-Qin', 'Haraguchi, Misako', 'Sugimoto, Yoshikazu', 'Kobayashi, Motomasa', 'Takamatsu, Hideo', 'Akiyama, Shin-Ichi']","['Mukai M', 'Che XF', 'Furukawa T', 'Sumizawa T', 'Aoki S', 'Ren XQ', 'Haraguchi M', 'Sugimoto Y', 'Kobayashi M', 'Takamatsu H', 'Akiyama S']","['Department of Cancer Chemotherapy, Institute for Cancer Research, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima 890-8520, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Photoaffinity Labels)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Membrane', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'KB Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukotrienes/metabolism', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Photoaffinity Labels', 'Piperazines/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2003/06/26 05:00,2003/12/05 05:00,['2003/06/26 05:00'],"['2003/06/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/26 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2003 Jun;94(6):557-63. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2003.tb01482.x.,,['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2003.tb01482.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similar reactivity was evident in some antibodies with an unusually long (> 50 amino acids) third complementarity-determining region of the heavy chain. Electron microscopy of hybridomas demonstrated the presence of c-type virus particles consistent with polymerase chain reaction detection of BLV env gene. Some hybridomas contained dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum and cisternae filled with moderately electron-dense granular substance compatible with plasma cells at presecretory stage. The number of chromosomes in xenogeneic hybridomas corresponded to the sum total of mouse and bovine chromosomes. None of the hybridomas showed polyploidy. The immunochemical and genetic analysis of stable bovine immunoglobulin-secreting xenogeneic hybridomas confirms that BLV infection causes polyclonal B cell activation regardless of antigen specificity. Presence of c-type particles in hybridomas suggests that T cell-derived cytokines are not required for sustained BLV expression.,"['Saini, S S', 'Kaushik, A', 'Basrur, P K', 'Yamashiro, S']","['Saini SS', 'Kaushik A', 'Basrur PK', 'Yamashiro S']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario N1G 2W1, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Vet Pathol,Veterinary pathology,0312020,"['0 (Antibodies, Heterophile)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Heterophile/genetics/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/genetics/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Fusion', 'Hybridomas/*immunology/metabolism/*ultrastructure/virology', 'Immunoglobulin M/genetics/immunology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Mice']",2003/06/26 05:00,2003/10/15 05:00,['2003/06/26 05:00'],"['2003/06/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/26 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vet Pathol. 2003 Jul;40(4):460-4. doi: 10.1354/vp.40-4-460.,,"['10.1354/vp.40-4-460 [doi]', '40/4/460 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two previously unidentified ubiquitinated proteins with molecular masses of 10 and 17 kDa were found in 8 M urea-soluble extracts, obtained from Tris-buffer-insoluble materials, of acute myeloid leukemia OCI/AML 1a cells and the cells from the leukemia patients. Both proteins were successfully purified from the OCI/AML 1a cells and identified as monoubiquitin-truncated H2A conjugates, the 10 kDa ubiquitinated H2A(115-129) and the 17 kDa ubiquitinated H2A(54-129), suggesting that both proteins were produced by limited proteolysis of an intact form (23 kDa) of ubiquitinated H2A(1-129). The 17 kDa protein as well as the 23 kDa ubiquitinated histone H2A were localised in chromatin fractions of the OCI/AML cells and released by high concentrations of salt in a micrococcal nuclease-sensitive manner, suggesting their association with chromatin. In contrast, the 10 kDa protein remained insoluble even when the nuclei were treated with nuclease under high salt concentrations, presumably due to binding to the nuclear matrix. An antibody recognising H2A(70-81) also detected the 17 kDa protein in anti-ubiquitin immunoprecipitates obtained from the OCI/AML cell nuclei. In addition, the 17 kDa protein levels in THP-1 cells were transiently increased, concomitant with a decrease in the 23 kDa ubiquitinated H2A, by treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or all-trans-retinoic acid, both of which induce differentiation. This is the first report of probable proteolytic products of ubiquitinated H2A, which might have a role in nuclear functions.","['Okawa, Yutaka', 'Takada, Koji', 'Minami, Jiro', 'Aoki, Katsuhiko', 'Shibayama, Hirohiko', 'Ohkawa, Kiyoshi']","['Okawa Y', 'Takada K', 'Minami J', 'Aoki K', 'Shibayama H', 'Ohkawa K']","['Department of Biochemistry I, Jikei University School of Medicine, 3-25-8, Nishishinbashi, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105-8461, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,"['0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '0 (chromatin conjugate protein A24)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*chemistry', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Histones/chemistry/immunology/*isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/immunology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Ubiquitins/chemistry/immunology/*isolation & purification/*metabolism']",2003/06/26 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2003/06/26 05:00'],"['2003/06/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2003/06/26 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2003 Nov;35(11):1588-600. doi: 10.1016/s1357-2725(03)00140-7.,,"['S1357272503001407 [pii]', '10.1016/s1357-2725(03)00140-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Fv1 gene, which inhibits murine leukemia virus infection in mice, encodes one such resistance factor, and was long thought to be unique in that it restricts post-entry, pre-integration steps of retroviral replication. However, recent findings suggest the existence of similar restriction factors in primates, including humans. These factors, termed Lv1 and Ref1, can inhibit a range of retroviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and its relatives. Fv1, Lv1 and Ref1 target capsid determinants to block infection but can be saturated by incoming virions. Primate- and murine-retrovirus restriction factors have diverse and overlapping specificities, and some variants of Lv1, as well as Ref1, apparently recognize and inhibit infection by widely divergent retroviruses.","['Bieniasz, Paul D']",['Bieniasz PD'],"['Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, 455 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016, USA. pbienias@adarc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Trends Microbiol,Trends in microbiology,9310916,"['0 (Fv1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)', 'EC 4.2.- (Carbon-Oxygen Lyases)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (APEX1 protein, human)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (Apex1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Carbon-Oxygen Lyases/genetics', '*DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Mammals', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/growth & development', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/virology']",2003/06/26 05:00,2003/08/16 05:00,['2003/06/26 05:00'],"['2003/06/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/26 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Trends Microbiol. 2003 Jun;11(6):286-91. doi: 10.1016/s0966-842x(03)00123-9.,,"['S0966842X03001239 [pii]', '10.1016/s0966-842x(03)00123-9 [doi]']",,,,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because corticosterone is known to have a broad range of effects and LIF function has been associated with the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, this study was designed to determine the role for LIFR in the fetus when exposed to the elevated maternal glucocorticoid levels of late gestation. Uncovering a requirement for LIFR in appropriate glucocorticoid response will further understanding of control of glucocorticoid function. METHODS: Maternal adrenalectomy or RU486 administration were used to determine the impact of the maternal glucocorticoid surge on fetal development in the absence of LIFR. The mice were analyzed by a variety of histological techniques including immunolabeling and staining techniques (hematoxylin and eosin, Alizarin red S and alcian blue). Plasma corticosterone was assayed using radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Maternal adrenalectomy does not improve the prognosis for LIFR null pups and exacerbates the effects of LIFR loss. RU486 noticeably improves many of the tissues affected by LIFR loss: bone density, skeletal muscle integrity and glial cell formation. LIFR null pups exposed during late gestation to RU486 in utero survive natural delivery, unlike LIFR null pups from untreated litters. But RU486 treated LIFR null pups succumb within the first day after birth, presumably due to neural deficit resulting in an inability to suckle. CONCLUSION: LIFR plays an integral role in modulating the fetal response to elevated maternal glucocorticoids during late gestation. This role is likely to be mediated through the glucocorticoid receptor and has implications for adult homeostasis as a direct tie between immune, neural and hormone function.","['Ware, Carol B', 'Nelson, Angelique M', 'Liggitt, Denny']","['Ware CB', 'Nelson AM', 'Liggitt D']","['Department of Comparative Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-7190, USA. cware@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Reprod Biol Endocrinol,Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&E,101153627,"['0 (Hormone Antagonists)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', 'W980KJ009P (Corticosterone)']",IM,"['Abnormalities, Multiple/embryology/*genetics', 'Adrenalectomy', 'Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/analysis', 'Animals', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic/embryology/genetics/prevention & control', 'Corticosterone/blood', 'Female', 'Fetal Diseases/embryology/genetics/prevention & control', 'Fetus/*physiology', 'Genes, Lethal', 'Gestational Age', 'Homeostasis', 'Hormone Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/physiology', 'Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mifepristone/pharmacology', 'Muscle, Skeletal/embryology/pathology', 'Neuroglia/drug effects', 'Neuroimmunomodulation/physiology', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System/physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Proteins/*physiology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Spinal Cord/embryology/pathology']",2003/06/26 05:00,2004/09/09 05:00,['2003/06/26 05:00'],"['2003/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2003/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/06/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/26 05:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Reprod Biol Endocrinol. 2003 May 16;1:43. doi: 10.1186/1477-7827-1-43.,,['10.1186/1477-7827-1-43 [doi]'],20030516,,,,,,,,,PMC165445,,,,,,,

A hypothesis was developed that WBC reduction, by reducing the Th2 stimulus associated with transfusions, might reduce RBC alloimmunization. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The first retrospective cohort study involved determining the prevalence of newly detected alloimmunization in transfused patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in our hospital in the period before WBC reduction and after its introduction for this particular group of patients. The second study involved determining the incidence of newly detected RBC alloimmunization in all transfused hospital patients during three annual periods with WBC-reduction prevalences ranging from 0 to 100 percent. RESULTS: The alloimmunization prevalence rate in AML patients was 8.2 percent in those receiving non-WBC-reduced RBCs and platelets (n=195) and 2.8 percent in those receiving only WBC-reduced components (n=215) (p=0.016). In all patients, the alloimmunization incidence rate decreased from 3.47 per 1000 antibody screens in 1987 (no WBC reduction) to 2.97 per 1000 in 1999 (40% of transfusions WBC-reduced) to 2.38 per 1000 in 2001 (100% of transfusions WBC-reduced) (p=0.0298). A decrease in alloimmunization was observed in both males and females, with the decrease more clearly evident in males. CONCLUSION: These preliminary data support the hypothesis that WBC reduction may be associated with a reduced frequency of RBC alloimmunization. These findings require confirmation and further investigation.","['Blumberg, Neil', 'Heal, Joanna M', 'Gettings, Kelly F']","['Blumberg N', 'Heal JM', 'Gettings KF']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center and Strong Memorial Hospital, Rochester, New York 14642, USA.

Only seven patients (3.1%) were identified to have tMDS/tAML. Peripheral cytopenia was the first sign; diagnosis could be achieved by cytological analysis of bone marrow smears using World Health Organization criteria. All patients presented with bi- or trilineage dysplasia. Haematopoietic reconstitution was significantly delayed in patients progressing to tMDS/tAML compared with the control group. Typical cytogenetic abnormalities were observed in five of seven patients. The mean time interval between transplantation and cytological diagnosis, or detection of cytogenetic abnormalities, was 20.0 months and 31.2 months respectively. Pantelomeric fluorescence analysis using quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization enabled us to make two major observations: (i) the fluorescence intensity in metaphases of all autografted patients was weak, and highly variable between tMDS patients; (ii) a drastic reduction of the telomere fluorescence intensity was observed in two patients who rapidly evolved to acute leukaemia. In conclusion, early detection of tMDS/tAML could be achieved by close follow-up of the bone marrow repopulation, and confirmed by cytological bone marrow examination and cytogenetic study. Our results address the implication of several factors, such as the initial telomeric status, and the effect of cytogenetic abnormalities and clonal expansion on bone marrow repopulation.","['Beauchamp-Nicoud, Anne', 'Feneux, Danielle', 'Bayle, Chantal', 'Bernheim, Alain', 'Leonard, Claude', 'Koscielny, Serge', 'Tchernia, Gil', 'Bourhis, Jean-Henri']","['Beauchamp-Nicoud A', 'Feneux D', 'Bayle C', 'Bernheim A', 'Leonard C', 'Koscielny S', 'Tchernia G', 'Bourhis JH']","['Department of Haematology, Immunology and Cytogenetics, Hopital Bicetre, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Faculte de Medecine Paris Sud, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France. anne.beauchamp_nicoud@caramail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*etiology/genetics', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology/genetics', 'Prospective Studies', 'Telomere/ultrastructure']",2003/06/26 05:00,2003/09/17 05:00,['2003/06/26 05:00'],"['2003/06/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/26 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Jul;122(1):109-17. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04388.x.,,"['4388 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04388.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A chronic phase was achieved after acute myeloid leukaemia induction therapy. Then, treatment with imatinib mesylate (600 mg/d) was initiated and the effect was assessed clinically as well as genetically, including by repeated interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization studies. Until d 71 of imatinib mesylate therapy, stable improvements in the clinical and laboratory features were noted, and the frequency of ABL1-rearranged peripheral blood cells decreased from 56% to 11%. At d 92, an additional t(12;13)(p12;q13), with the 12p breakpoint proximal to ETV6, was found. The patient relapsed into BC 126 d after the start of the imatinib mesylate treatment and succumbed to the disease shortly afterwards. No mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of ABL1 of the ETV6/ABL1 fusion were identified in the second BC.

We have analysed dCK and 'high-Km' 5'-nucleotidase (cN-II) mRNA expression by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction at diagnosis in leukaemic blasts from 115 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients treated with ara-C. The prognostic value of these parameters as well as that of the cN-II/dCK ratio was determined. In univariate analyses: (1) low levels of dCK, high levels of cN-II and a high cN-II/dCK ratio predicted shorter disease-free survival (DFS); (2) low levels of dCK and cN-II/dCK ratio also predicted shorter overall survival (OS). In a multivariate analysis taking into account other clinical and laboratory variables: (1) high cN-II expression, a high cN-II/dCK ratio, age >/= 60 years and an unfavourable karyotype were independent prognostic factors for DFS; and (2) a high cN-II/dCK ratio, age >/= 60 years and an unfavourable karyotype predicted shorter OS. Age, karyotype and cN-II/dCK ratio were used to define a prognostic score that permitted the identification of high- and low-risk groups.

A model was developed to explore certain unanswered questions. The model assumes that all patients have MRD assessed after induction chemotherapy and children above a certain threshold are offered intensive chemotherapy. Using parameter estimates derived from published studies of MRD, the model predicted event-free survival (EFS) rates, relapse rates and treatment-related mortality for a cohort of children in the first presentation who were Philadelphia chromosome negative. Using the level of MRD after induction in order to decide on the use of intensive therapy resulted in an increase in EFS rates of up to 2.9 per 100 children, although if the error of the MRD measurement were too great, the benefit was almost nullified. Taking and analysing more than one marrow sample from the patient for the MRD measurement, in order to reduce sampling and measurement error, improved EFS by a further 1.1 patients per 100 treated, and decreased the number of patients offered intensive therapy by up to 2.6 per 100 treated. The optimal threshold for offering intensive therapy was in the range of 10-3.5- 10-4.5 cells if the intensive treatment-related mortality was 13-18% (allograft options), but 10-5- 10-6 cells if it was less than 8% (intensified chemotherapy). Using MRD to target patients at a high risk of relapse improved EFS rates, but the accuracy of measurements was of critical importance.","['Campbell, Peter J', 'Morley, Alexander A']","['Campbell PJ', 'Morley AA']","['Department of Haematology and Genetic Pathology, Flinders University and Medical Centre, Bedford Park, South Australia, Australia. ottie1234@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Patient Selection', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis']",2003/06/26 05:00,2003/09/17 05:00,['2003/06/26 05:00'],"['2003/06/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/26 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Jul;122(1):30-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04356.x.,,"['4356 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04356.x [doi]']",,,['088340/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two structured questionnaires were used, the Body Image Scale (part I, Cronbach's alpha = 0.82; part II, Kuder-Richardson-20 = 0.86) and Social Support Scale (family part, Cronbach's alpha = 0.88; nurses part, Cronbach's alpha = 0.91). Satisfaction with body image was significantly related to gender, age, education level, and the frequency of changes in appearance caused by chemotherapy. Girls felt more dissatisfied than boys. Satisfaction with body image was lower in older children, in children with a high level of education or in those with more frequent changes in appearance. Significant predictors of subjects' satisfaction with body image were gender, education level, and appearance-related side effects of chemotherapy, which accounted for 23.3% of total variance. These findings suggest that the family and nurses should pay more attention to teenagers who perceive changes in their appearance and help them to develop a positive body image. Furthermore, it is essential that a new scale to measure social support about body image is developed in future studies.","['Wu, Li-Min', 'Chin, Chi-Chun']","['Wu LM', 'Chin CC']","['Mei-Ho Institute of Technology, Ping-Tung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China (Republic : 1949- ),Kaohsiung J Med Sci,The Kaohsiung journal of medical sciences,100960562,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Body Image', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*psychology', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Social Support']",2003/06/26 05:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2003/06/26 05:00'],"['2003/06/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/26 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Kaohsiung J Med Sci. 2003 May;19(5):217-24. doi: 10.1016/S1607-551X(09)70427-9.,,"['S1607-551X(09)70427-9 [pii]', '10.1016/S1607-551X(09)70427-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate that administration of 32DTNF-alpha cells to the mice enhances the allo-stimulatory capacity of the splenic (CD11c+) and bone marrow-derived DCs in both mixed leukocyte response and CTL development. The enhanced allo-stimulatory capacity of splenic DCs from mice injected with 32DTNF-alpha cells correlated with increase in the cell-surface expression of the costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, CD86, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules (I-Ak), and production of interleukin-12 (IL-12). Furthermore, administration of 32DTNF-alpha cells during immunization with irradiated 32Dp210 leukemia cells augmented the capacity of splenic DCs to stimulate antileukemic CTL response in spleen cells.

Bone marrow aspiration showed the proliferation of myeloblasts (11.2%) and complex karyotypic abnormalities were detected including the long arm deletion of chromosome 7. The patient developed polyuria and polydipsia after admission and was diagnosed as having central diabetes insipidus. He was treated with DDAVP and the polyuria disappeared. In November, he underwent unrelated allogeneic bone marrow transplantation after conditioning with total body irradiation and cytarabine. After transplantation DDAVP was no longer required. Central diabetes insipidus has been reported as a rare complication of leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The complete remission of diabetes insipidus after bone marrow transplantation suggests that the infiltration of leukemic cells into the pituitary gland caused the diabetes insipidus in this case.","['Sato, Norihide', 'Takayama, Nobuyuki', 'Kizaki, Masahiro', 'Ikeda, Yasuo', 'Okamoto, Shinichiro']","['Sato N', 'Takayama N', 'Kizaki M', 'Ikeda Y', 'Okamoto S']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Diabetes Insipidus/*etiology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/06/26 05:00,2003/09/05 05:00,['2003/06/26 05:00'],"['2003/06/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/26 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2003 May;44(5):318-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the phenotypic effects of BCR-ABL in a clonal in vitro self-renewal and differentiation model, we have introduced BCR-ABL in the ES cell line CCE. The major effect of BCR-ABL expression was the persistence of primitive morphology of ES cells despite LIF deprivation, correlated with a constitutive activation of STAT3, the major self-renewal factor of ES cells, but no evidence of activation of STAT5. The enforced expression of BCR-ABL in an ES cell line, engineered to express a tetracycline-inducible dominant-negative form of a STAT3, triggered ES cell differentiation with an increased generation of hematopoietic cells expressing erythroid and megakaryocytic phenotypes. RT-PCR analysis for Oct4, Brachyury and beta-globin expression confirmed a delay of differentiation in BCR-ABL expressing clones, which could be entirely reversed upon activation of the dominant-negative form of STAT3. To study the possible relevance of STAT3 activation by BCR-ABL in human CML, Western blot analyses performed on the CD34+ cells, purified from CML patients at different stages of their disease, also demonstrated increased levels of STAT3 proteins phosphorylated both on tyrosine and serine residues. These results represent to our knowledge the first functional link between BCR-ABL oncogene and a self-renewal in the context of ES cells through constitutive activation of STAT3.

DeltaPML-RARalpha is not formed in ATRA differentiation resistant NB4 subclones. As(2)O(3) inhibits deltaPML-RARalpha formation and differentiation-induction when given in combination with ATRA. Treatment with hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) combined with ATRA enhances ATRA-induced differentiation in ATRA-insensitive NB4-CI and arsenic-resistant NB4/As cells, and is associated with stabilization of PML-RARalpha protein and increased deltaPML-RARalpha formation. Unlike forced expression of PML-RARalpha, forced deltaPML-RARalpha expression based on an estimated deletion of the N-terminal PML portion does not repress RARE-tk-luc reporter activity mediated by endogenous retinoic acid receptors. The cleavage of PML-RARalpha is blocked by RARalpha antagonist Ro-41-5253 and cycloheximide and therefore requires a RARalpha transactivation-dependent pathway. Proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK do not block ATRA-induced PML-RARalpha cleavage and differentiation. These data suggest that (a) ATRA treatment induces PML-RARalpha cleavage by induction of unknown enzymes independent of proteasome- and caspase-mediated pathways; (b) deltaPML-RARalpha might function differently from both PML-RARalpha and RARalpha; (c) failure to cleave PML-RARalpha and form deltaPML-RARalpha after ATRA treatment may contribute to ATRA resistance in APL cells.","['Jing, Yongkui', 'Xia, Lijuan', 'Lu, Min', 'Waxman, Samuel']","['Jing Y', 'Xia L', 'Lu M', 'Waxman S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA. yongkui.jing@mssm.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Arsenic/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Multienzyme Complexes/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/06/25 05:00,2003/07/19 05:00,['2003/06/25 05:00'],"['2003/06/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Jun 26;22(26):4083-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206568.,,"['10.1038/sj.onc.1206568 [doi]', '1206568 [pii]']",,,['CA93533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transfection of VDUP1 induced cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, indicating that VDUP1 possesses a tumor-suppressive activity. In addition, it was found that VDUP1 interacted with promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger, Fanconi anemia zinc-finger, and histone deacetylase 1, which are known to be transcriptional corepressors.

His skeletal radiographic survey had shown evidence of symmetrical metaphyseal sclerosis in the long bones, which has not been previously described as an isolated feature of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Following a good response to chemotherapy, partial resolution of the sclerosis occurred. This case illustrates that metaphyseal sclerosis can be one of the manifestations of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and delay in diagnosis can easily occur in the absence of classic features of the disease.

Viremia is undetectable, however, BLV is expressed readily once infected cells are cultured in vitro. A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (sELISA) was optimized, using murine monoclonal antibodies, to quantify the major internal structural protein (p24) produced in short-term cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Optimal production of BLV p24 was achieved utilizing RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), pH 7, and 5 x 10(6) cells per ml. Cultures were terminated at 24 h.

The JNKs are encoded by three separate genes (jnk1, jnk2, and jnk3), which are spliced alternatively to create 10 JNK isoforms that are either p46 or p54 in size. In this study, we found that the p52 form of JNK emerged in human leukemia MOLT-4 or U937 cells following X-irradiation or heat treatment. The accumulation of p52 coincided with the reduction of p54 JNK. On the other hand, the amounts of p46 JNK did not change by X-irradiation. Induction of the p52 form of JNK also paralleled the appearance of the active form of caspase-3 and was suppressed by a caspase-specific inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO, but not by Ac-YVAD-CHO. In vitro cleavage assays indicated that recombinant human JNK1beta2 and JNK2beta2 were cleaved by caspase-3, and that the mutation of aspartic acid at position 413 of JNK1beta2 or 410 of JNK2beta2 to alanine abolished the cleavage. Altogether, our results demonstrated that p54 JNKs, at least JNK1beta2 and JNK2beta2, were new selective targets of caspases in JNK splicing variants, and suggested that the p52 form could serve as a marker of apoptosis.","['Enomoto, Atsushi', 'Suzuki, Norio', 'Morita, Akinori', 'Ito, Michihiko', 'Liu, Chang Qing', 'Matsumoto, Yoshihisa', 'Yoshioka, Katsuji', 'Shiba, Tadayoshi', 'Hosoi, Yoshio']","['Enomoto A', 'Suzuki N', 'Morita A', 'Ito M', 'Liu CQ', 'Matsumoto Y', 'Yoshioka K', 'Shiba T', 'Hosoi Y']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan. aenomoto@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (acetyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartal)', '143313-51-3 (L 709049)', 'EC 2.7.1.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells', 'X-Rays']",2003/06/25 05:00,2003/08/12 05:00,['2003/06/25 05:00'],"['2003/06/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2003 Jul 11;306(4):837-42. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(03)01050-7.,,"['S0006291X03010507 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(03)01050-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical data of 149 patients with nosocomial fungal infections admitted in the PUMC hospital from Dec. 1981 to Nov. 2001, 67 males and 82 females with an average age of 52.32 years, including the manifestation, diagnosis, treatment and outcome, were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: 134 out of the 149 patients suffered from deep mycoses. All cases had underlying conditions, including primary pulmonary diseases (n = 29), rheumatic disease (n = 20), hematological disease such as leukemia or lymphoma (n = 18), HIV infection/AIDS (n = 13), major surgery (n = 10), and intracerebral hemorrhage or cerebral infarction (n = 24). The predisposing factors or risk factors for deep mycoses included use of high dose broad-spectrum antibiotics over a long period (n = 37), steroids/cytotoxic chemotherapy (n = 29), immunosuppressant (n = 17), chemotherapy (n = 10), intravenous lines and incubation (n = 36), and tracheotomy or endotracheal intubation (n = 12). The infectious sites were lung, meninges, cerebral parenchyma, blood, etc. in the order of prevalence. Depending on infectious site and type of fungus, the clinical manifestations included fever (63.76%), respiratory symptom such as cough (37.58%), leucocytosis (39.6%), chest X-ray images (24.49%) etc. CNS fungal infection included meningitis, brain abscess, and granuloma. Meningitis due to Cryptococcus resembled that due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The main pathogenic fungal species were Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. neoformans, and Aspergillus species. Amphotericin B, fluconazole, and flucytosine were used alone or in combination. The overall mortality rate was 29.53% (44/149). Out of the 149 patients 67 were cured, 29 made improvement. The incidence of fungal infection remarkably increased recently with 75 cases appearing in the past 5 years (50.34%). CONCLUSION: The incidence of fungal infection is increasing recently which is correlated with use of high dose broad-spectrum antibiotics over a long period, high dose steroids/cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunosuppressant, chemotherapy, and improvement of examination skills, etc. The main pathogens are still Candida albicans and non-albicans Candida species.

He was diagnosed as having acute myelogenous leukemia at the age of 18 years, and had bone marrow transplantation (BMT) two years after the onset of the disease. Cutaneous manifestation of acute GVHD appeared on the twelfth day following BMT, which responded to prednisolone. Thereafter, GVHD has been well-controlled except for mild liver dysfunction which was thought to be a sign of chronic GVHD. Eleven months after BMT, he enjoyed snowboarding for two days from morning till night. Two days later, he experienced muscle swelling with pain and fever, which gradually worsened for which he was admitted to our hospital. Neurological examination revealed severe proximal and distal muscle swelling with fever and tenderness in all extremities. Mild, symmetrical, proximal weakness was observed in all four limbs. Severity of muscle swelling and its generalized nature restricted the movements of shoulder-, elbow- and ankle-joints and he was unable to walk. Laboratory investigations revealed creatine kinase (CK) of 7,860 IU/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 21.5 mg/dL and raised biliary enzymes. MRI generated high intensity signals from the swollen muscles. Muscle biopsy examination of involved areas showed severe interstitial edema and mononuclear cells infiltration. Macrophages were scattered through out the perimysium and endomysium. On the other hand, T cells and B cells were localized to the endomysium. Although a lot of CD8 positive T cells were seen adjacent to non-necrotic fibers, none of them was obviously invading the non-necrotic fibers. Perifascicular atrophy was not seen. Symptoms gradually worsened over two weeks or so when prednisolone was started to which he responded rapidly. While tapering steroids, the symptoms relapsed on resuming aggressive exercise. Resumption of the treatment regime promptly controlled the symptoms. The cause of myositis as a manifestation of chronic GVHD is unclear. T-cell or B-cell dysfunction, collagen-vascular-like processes, viral infection and direct damage by radiation or chemotherapy have been supposed to involve in the disease process. Our case suggests that aggressive muscular exercise could play as a initiator of myositis as a manifestation of chronic GVHD.","['Kano, Satoko', 'Shimizu, Jun', 'Mikata, Takashi', 'Shinoe, Takashi', 'Ota, Hidetaka', 'Komeno, Yukiko', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Hirai, Hisamaru', 'Kanazawa, Ichiro']","['Kano S', 'Shimizu J', 'Mikata T', 'Shinoe T', 'Ota H', 'Komeno Y', 'Ogawa S', 'Hirai H', 'Kanazawa I']","['Department of Neurology, School of Medicine, University of Tokyo.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Shinkeigaku,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,0417466,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chronic Disease', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Myositis/diagnosis/*etiology/pathology']",2003/06/25 05:00,2003/07/26 05:00,['2003/06/25 05:00'],"['2003/06/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rinsho Shinkeigaku. 2003 Mar;43(3):93-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In promyelocytic leukemia cells HL-60, bupivacaine induced formation of apoptotic bodies and DNA fragmentation in a time- and dose-dependent manner similar to typical apoptosis inducers. Caspase-3, -8 and -9, which play a pivotal role in the initiation and execution of receptor- or mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, were all clearly activated by bupivacaine in good correlation with the degree of DNA fragmentation. However, bupivacaine did not induce either mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) or release of cytochrome c in experiments with isolated mitochondria. These results suggest that an indirect action of bupivacaine on mitochondria occurs and that other mechanisms may be involved in bupivacaine-induced apoptosis. To obtain additional information concerning the mechanism of action involved in bupivacaine-induced apoptosis, a microarray analysis of gene expression in bupivacaine-treated HL-60 cells was carried out. Several apoptosis-related genes were found to be transcriptionally regulated by bupivacaine using a high-density cDNA microarray. The expression levels of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), c-jun and c-fos genes were remarkably up-regulated and those of c-myc and poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) were down-regulated in bupivacaine-treated cells. These results are of value in developing a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of bupivacaine-induced apoptosis leading to neuro- or myotoxicity.","['Unami, Akira', 'Shinohara, Yasuo', 'Ichikawa, Tomokazu', 'Baba, Yoshinobu']","['Unami A', 'Shinohara Y', 'Ichikawa T', 'Baba Y']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokushima, 1 Shomachi, Tokushima 770-8505, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Toxicol Sci,The Journal of toxicological sciences,7805798,"['0 (Anesthetics, Local)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)', 'Y8335394RO (Bupivacaine)']",IM,"['Anesthetics, Local/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bupivacaine/*toxicity', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Male', 'Mitochondria, Liver/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Swelling/drug effects', 'Neurons/drug effects', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2003/06/25 05:00,2003/07/11 05:00,['2003/06/25 05:00'],"['2003/06/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Toxicol Sci. 2003 May;28(2):77-94. doi: 10.2131/jts.28.77.,,['10.2131/jts.28.77 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The post-BMT five-year survival rates were much better for patients in the MR donor group (p = 0.0008). The outcomes of patients in the MisR/UR donor group were significantly worse. This was not due to disease recurrence, but to a high incidence of fatal post-transplant infections (p = 0.004). Nine out of twelve patients who received transplants from MR donors have remained in complete remission for a median of 57 (range 27-78) months.

This study was performed in order to investigate if procainamide hydrochloride may influence the therapeutic index of cisplatin by inducing modifications of its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodymanics in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin administered either in the presence or absence of procainamide hydrochloride was investigated in BDF1 female mice bearing 6-day P388 leukemia. Procainamide hydrochloride was administered i.v. at the dose of 50 mg/kg, immediately before cisplatin which, in turn, was administered i.p. at the dose of 8 mg/kg. RESULTS: The combined administration of the antiarrhythmic drug and cisplatin caused significant differences in the pharmacokinetic profiles of Pt in plasma, ascites fluid and tissues. Filterable Pt was significantly increased both in plasma and ascites fluid in animals given the combined treatment. Similarly, a small increase was also found for total plasma Pt. These differences caused some changes of the pharmacokinetic parameters of filterable (plasma: AUC0-1 h = +16%, t1/2 alpha = +29%, t1/2b = +14%, K2p = -32%; ascites fluid: AUC0-1 h = +23%, t1/2 alpha = +78%, t1/2 beta = -49%, and total Pt (plasma: AUC0-1 h = +19%, t1/2 alpha = +27%, t1/2 beta = -22%; ascites fluid: AUC0-1 h = +6%, AUC0-infinity = +43%, t1/2 alpha = +30%). The analysis of tissue Pt content showed the general increase of Pt concentration in the main organs of animals treated with cisplatin and procainamide hydrochloride, with AUC0-24 h increased by 95%, 22%, 90% and 28% in kidney, liver, spleen and lung, respectively. The analysis of binding of Pt to DNA and percent interstrand cross-links (%ISCL) in P388 tumour cells showed that the % ISCL (10.44 +/- 3.81% vs. 3.51 +/- 0.01%) and the efficiency of ISCL formation (0.51 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.17 +/- 0.02 %ISCL.microgram DNA/pg Pt) were significantly greater when cisplatin was administered in association with procainamide hydrochloride. CONCLUSION: Our results show that procainamide hydrochloride may alter the pharmacodynamics and the pharmacokinetics and distribution of Pt in tumored mice treated with cisplatin.","['Vannozzi, Maria O', 'Ottone, Massimo', 'Mariggio, Maria A', 'Cafaggi, Sergio', 'Parodi, Brunella', 'Cilli, Michele', 'Lindup, Edward', 'Viale, Maurizio']","['Vannozzi MO', 'Ottone M', 'Mariggio MA', 'Cafaggi S', 'Parodi B', 'Cilli M', 'Lindup E', 'Viale M']","['Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Unita di Farmacologia Tossicologica, Lgo R.

As a result, methyl protoneogracillin was cytotoxic against all the test cell lines with GI(50) < 100 micro M, especially selectively against two leukemia lines (CCRF-CEM and RPMT-8226), one colon cancer line (KM12), two central nervous system (CNS) cancer lines (SF-539 and U251), one melanoma line (M14), one renal cancer line (786-0), one prostate cancer line (DU-145), and one breast cancer line (MDA-MB-435), with GI(50) < or = 2.0 micro M. Leukemia, CNS cancer, and prostate cancer were the most sensitive subpanels, while ovarian cancer was the least sensitive subpanels. The preliminary toxicity studies showed that the maximum tolerant dose was 600 mg/kg for methyl protoneogracillin to mice. Gracillin was cytotoxic against most cell lines with GI(50), TGI and LC(50) at micromolar levels, but no activity against EKVX (non-small cell lung cancer), HT29 (colon cancer), OVCAR-5 (ovarian cancer), and SN12C (renal cancer).

Most abnormalities occur due to hyperphosphorylation of the tumor suppressor gene Rb by the key regulators of the cell cycle, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Thus, a pharmacological CDK inhibitor may be useful in the prevention and/or treatment of human neoplasms. Flavopiridol is a flavonoid with interesting preclinical properties: (1) potent CDK inhibitory activity; (2) it depletes cyclin D1 and vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms, respectively; (3) it inhibits positive elongation factor B, leading to transcription ""halt""; and (4) it induces apoptosis in several preclinical models. The first phase I trial of a CDK inhibitor, flavopiridol, has been completed. Dose-limiting toxicities included secretory diarrhea and proinflammatory syndrome. Antitumor activity was observed in some patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and renal, colon, and prostate cancers. Concentrations between 300 and 500 n M-necessary to inhibit CDK-were achieved safely. Phase II trials with infusional flavopiridol and phase I infusional trials in combination with standard chemotherapy are being completed with encouraging results. A novel phase I trial of 1-h flavopiridol administration was recently completed. The maximum tolerated doses using flavopiridol daily for 5, 3, and 1 consecutive days are 37.5, 50, and 62.5 mg/m(2) per day. Dose-limiting toxicities include vomiting, neutropenia, proinflammatory syndrome, and diarrhea. Plasma flavopiridol concentrations achieved were in the range 1.5-3.5 MICRO M. Phase II/III trials using this 1-h schedule in several tumor types including non-small-cell lung cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, and head and neck cancer are being conducted worldwide. UCN-01, the second CDK modulator that has entered clinical trials, has unique preclinical properties: (1) it inhibits protein kinase C (PKC) activity; (2) it promotes cell-cycle arrest by accumulation in p21/p27; (3) it induces apoptosis in several preclinical models; and (4) it abrogates the G(2) checkpoint by inhibition of chk1. The last of these represents a novel strategy to combine UCN-01 with DNA-damaging agents. In the initial UCN-01 clinical trial (continuous infusion for 72 h), a prolonged half-life of about 600 h (100 times longer than in preclinical models) was observed. The maximum tolerated dose was 42.5 mg/m(2) per day for 3 days. Dose-limiting toxicities were nausea/vomiting, hypoxemia, and symptomatic hyperglycemia. One patient with melanoma achieved a partial response (8 months). Another patient with refractory anaplastic large-cell lymphoma had no evidence of disease at >4 years. Bone marrow and tumor samples obtained from some patients revealed loss in adducin phosphorylation, a substrate of PKC. Phase I trials with shorter infusions are being completed. In summary, the first two CDK modulators have shown encouraging results in early clinical trials. A question that remains unanswered is ""Which is the best schedule for combination with standard antitumor agents?"" Moreover, it is still unclear which pharmacodynamic endpoint reflects loss of CDK activity in tissue samples from patients in these trials. Despite these caveats, we feel that CDKs are sensible targets for cancer therapy and that there are several small-molecule CDK modulators in clinical trials with encouraging results.","['Senderowicz, Adrian M']",['Senderowicz AM'],"['Molecular Therapeutics Unit, Oral and Pharyngeal Cancer Branch, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Building 30, Room 211, Bethesda, MD 20892-4340, USA. adrian.senderowicz@nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/administration & dosage', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Flavonoids/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Piperidines/administration & dosage', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/06/24 05:00,2003/10/01 05:00,['2003/06/24 05:00'],"['2003/06/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/01 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/24 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2003 Jul;52 Suppl 1:S61-73. doi: 10.1007/s00280-003-0624-x.

In a phase II study, 90 patients with relapsed indolent B-NHL or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) were treated with infusions of rituximab 375 mg/m(2) once weekly for four doses. The overall response rate in indolent B-NHL and MCL was 61% (37/61, 95% CI 47-73%) and 46% (6/13, 95% CI 19-75%), respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was shorter in MCL patients, in those with extranodal disease, and in those who had received two or more prior chemotherapy regimens ( P<0.01). Rituximab retreatment was well tolerated in 13 patients with relapsed indolent B-NHL and there were no grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxicities. Partial response was observed in five (38%, 95% CI 14-68%) patients, and the median PFS after retreatment was 5.1 months.

In this situation, biological response modifiers (BRMs), which are not based on selective toxicity, could be expected to be useful. Several types of BRM exist, including retinoids, which act directly on cells at the level of gene expression, and thalidomide and related molecules, which modulate the production of various cytokines. We have been engaged in medicinal, chemical, and structural development studies based on these bioactive compounds. Retinoids include all- trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), a major active form of vitamin A (retinol), and its bioisosters, which elicit their biological effects by binding to their nuclear receptors, retinoic acid receptors (RARs). ATRA has been used in differentiation therapy, typically for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, and the treatment of dermatological diseases. Our structural development studies of retinoids, including computer-assisted molecular design, have yielded class/subtype-selective agonists, synergists, and antagonists of RARs and their partner nuclear receptors, retinoid X receptors. Among them, the benzanilide-type compounds, Am80 and TAC101, are under phase II and I/II clinical studies in Japan and the USA, respectively. Thalidomide is a hypnotic/sedative drug that was withdrawn from the market because of teratogenicity. However, thalidomide has been established to be useful in the treatment of various diseases including cancer. Thalidomide elicits a wide range of pharmacological effects, including anticachexia, anti-tumor-promoting, antiangiogenic, immunosuppressing, antiviral, hypoglycemic, and antimetastatic activities.

In addition to delivering systemic chemoradiotherapy, the therapeutic potential of allogeneic HCT relies on the graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) effect, which eradicates residual malignant cells by way of immunologic mechanisms. Unfortunately, GVL effects are closely associated with graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), the major complication of allogeneic HCT. Separation of the toxicity of acute GVHD from the beneficial GVL effects remains a major challenge to expanding the utility of this effective treatment modality. The pathophysiology of acute GVHD involves dysregulation of inflammatory cytokine cascades and donor T-cell responses to host alloantigens. Interleukin 18 (IL-18) is a recently discovered cytokine with potent immunomodulatory effects. This unique cytokine has the capacity to induce Th1 or Th2 polarization, depending on the immunologic context. The level of IL-18 is increased in acute GVHD, but this cytokine's role in the pathophysiology of acute GVHD is complex. It reduces the severity of acute GVHD as a T helper 1 (Th1)-inducing cytokine when administered early after bone-marrow transplant to the lethally irradiated recipients. When administered to the donor, it can also reduce the severity of acute GVHD, as a T helper 2 (Th2)-inducing cytokine. Despite reducing the severity of acute GVHD, IL-18 preserves the GVL effect after bone-marrow transplant. Thus IL-18 has the remarkable capacity to modulate acute GVHD when administered either to the donor or the recipient through distinct mechanisms.","['Reddy, Pavan', 'Ferrara, James L M']","['Reddy P', 'Ferrara JL']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, University of Michigan Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA. reddypr@umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Lab Clin Med,The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,0375375,['0 (Interleukin-18)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-18/*immunology/*therapeutic use']",2003/06/24 05:00,2003/07/25 05:00,['2003/06/24 05:00'],"['2003/06/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/24 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Lab Clin Med. 2003 Jun;141(6):365-71. doi: 10.1016/S0022-2143(03)00028-3.,,"['10.1016/S0022-2143(03)00028-3 [doi]', 'S0022214303000283 [pii]']",,,['HL-03565/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],57,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, despite these advances, the therapeutic strategies are still limited. Leukemias are often characterized by specific balanced translocations, with the t(8;21) balanced translocation being the most frequent chromosomal aberration in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This translocation produces the AML1-ETO fusion protein, which binds to AML1 target promoter sequences. Transcriptional repression of AML1-dependent genes by AML1-ETO and associated corepressors represents the pathogenetic mechanisms of t(8;21). Here, we show that targeting of AML1-ETO to essential, MYB-dependent gene promoters induces t(8;21)-restricted cell death. We constructed a chimeric protein that contained the MYB DNA-binding domain and the AML1-binding domain of myeloid Elf-1-like factor (MEF). This protein associated with AML1-ETO and directed the complex to MYB-responsive promoters in vitro and in vivo. In the presence of AML1-ETO, the chimeric protein repressed the activity of MYB-responsive promoters, rapidly induced apoptosis, and specifically inhibited colony growth. All these effects occurred only in AML1-ETO-positive cells, whereas no adverse effects were observed in cells not expressing AML1-ETO. Taken together, this study demonstrates that redirection of oncogenic proteins can be used as a strategy to dramatically influence their cellular effects, with the ultimate goal to design highly specific therapies for cancer.","['Steffen, Bjorn', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Agrawal, Shuchi', 'Linggi, Bryan', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Hiebert, Scott W', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten']","['Steffen B', 'Serve H', 'Berdel WE', 'Agrawal S', 'Linggi B', 'Buchner T', 'Hiebert SW', 'Muller-Tidow C']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University of Munster, 48129 Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ELF4 protein, human)', '0 (Elf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Binding Sites', 'COS Cells', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'Genes, myb', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/chemistry/physiology', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', '*Transcription, Genetic', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2003/06/24 05:00,2003/09/05 05:00,['2003/06/24 05:00'],"['2003/06/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/24 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Jul 8;100(14):8448-53. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1330293100.

However, this process is a regulated event and may be accelerated or inhibited by myriad signal transduction systems. For example, monocyte adherence at sites of inflammation or tissue injury is associated with inhibition of ARE-directed mRNA decay, which contributes to rapid increases in cytokine and inflammatory mediator production. Here, we show that acute exposure of THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells to the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate mimics several features of monocyte adherence, including rapid induction and stabilization of ARE-containing mRNAs encoding interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Additionally, TPA treatment alters the activity of cytoplasmic complexes that bind AREs, including complexes containing the ARE-specific, mRNA-destabilizing factor, AUF1. Analyses of AUF1 from control and TPA-treated cells indicated that post-translational modifications of the major cytoplasmic isoform, p40AUF1, are altered concomitant with changes in RNA binding activity and stabilization of ARE-containing mRNAs. In particular, p40AUF1 recovered from polysomes was phosphorylated on Ser83 and Ser87 in untreated cells but lost these modifications following TPA treatment. We propose that selected signal transduction pathways may regulate ARE-directed mRNA turnover by reversible phosphorylation of polysome-associated p40AUF1.","['Wilson, Gerald M', 'Lu, Jiebo', 'Sutphen, Kristina', 'Sun, Yue', 'Huynh, Yung', 'Brewer, Gary']","['Wilson GM', 'Lu J', 'Sutphen K', 'Sun Y', 'Huynh Y', 'Brewer G']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Center for Fluorescence Spectroscopy, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, USA. gwils001@umaryland.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (HNRNPD protein, human)', '0 (Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein D0)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein D)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein D0', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein D/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polyribosomes/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleases/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Serine/chemistry', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2003/06/24 05:00,2003/10/03 05:00,['2003/06/24 05:00'],"['2003/06/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/24 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Aug 29;278(35):33029-38. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M305772200.

Here, we report that phosphorylation of p40AUF1 influences its ARE-binding affinity as well as the RNA conformational dynamics and global structure of the p40AUF1-ARE ribonucleoprotein complex. Most notably, association of unphosphorylated p40AUF1 induces a condensed RNA conformation upon ARE substrates. By contrast, phosphorylation of p40AUF1 at Ser83 and Ser87 inhibits this RNA structural transition.

The present study evaluates whether DU alone at doses 2.5-15 microM or in combination with all trans retinoic acid (RA) or dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP) is effective against myelogenous leukemia. The data of this study indicate that DU induces dose-dependent cell death by apoptosis in myeloid leukemia cell lines HL-60, NB4, HEL and K562 as demonstrated by cell staining or flow cytometry and agarose gel electrophoresis. 24h-treatment with DU produced dose-dependent HL-60 cell growth inhibition and dose-independent S phase arrest that was not reversed upon removal of higher doses of DU (10-15 microM). Exposition to nontoxic dose of DU (2.5 microM) for 24h followed by RA or dbcAMP and 96 h-cotreatment with DU significantly enhanced RA- but not dbcAMP-mediated granulocytic differentiation. Cell maturation was paralleled with an increase in the proportion of cells in G1 or G2+M phase. We conclude that, depending on the dose or the sequence of administration with RA, an inhibitor of DNA replication, DU triggers a process of either differentiation or apoptosis in myeloid leukemia cells.","['Savickiene, J', 'Gineitis, A']","['Savickiene J', 'Gineitis A']","['Department of Developmental Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Mokslininku 12, 2600 Vilnius, Lithuania. savickiene@bchi.lt']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,"['263CU738ZY (3-Deazauridine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)']",IM,"['3-Deazauridine/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/pathology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2003/06/24 05:00,2004/05/12 05:00,['2003/06/24 05:00'],"['2003/06/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/24 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2003 Oct;35(10):1482-94. doi: 10.1016/s1357-2725(03)00130-4.,,"['S1357272503001304 [pii]', '10.1016/s1357-2725(03)00130-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phase I clinical trials using FTIs in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and other myeloid malignancies have been performed, demonstrating enzyme target inhibition, low toxicity, and promising response rates. These findings have prompted further development in phase II trials, in order to clarify the response rate and to identify the actual downstream signal transduction targets that may be modified by these agents. It is anticipated that such information will ultimately define the optimal roles of FTIs in patients with AML and other myeloid disorders, facilitate the incorporation of FTIs into current therapeutic strategies for myeloid malignancies, and provide insight into effective methods of combining FTIs with other signal transduction inhibitors.","['Lancet, Jeffrey E', 'Karp, Judith E']","['Lancet JE', 'Karp JE']","['University of Rochester, James P.

THE AIM OF STUDY: The aim of study was to evaluate growth in children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and Wilms' tumour who achieved complete continuous first remission following treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 52 children included in this study: 30 treated for ALL - group I and 22 with Wilms' tumour - group II since 1986 to 1996. Group I- all children received prophylactic cranial irradiation at the total dose 12 and 18 Gy and chemotherapy according to therapeutic course BFM 83 and BFM 90. Group II - all children received abdomen irradiation with total dose 15-35 Gy, chemotherapy according to therapeutic course SIOP 9 and SIOP 92. We analysed growth velocity from the time of diagnosis to the time of examination. Results were reported as standard deviation score (SDS) to allow for comparison of patients of different age and sex. RESULTS: We observed significant growth deceleration in the first year of treatment and catch-up after 12 months from completion of therapy in both groups. The greatest reduction in yearly decrements in height SDS occurred in the first year after diagnosis. Patients of group I treated with prophylactic cranial irradiation with total dose 12 Gy presented significantly higher catch-up growth than treated with dose 18 Gy one year from completion of cancer therapy (p=0.001). Growth hormone deficiency in children of both groups was not observed. Bone age deceleration was retarded one year or more in both groups (group I p=0.025, group II p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: 1) The chemotherapy and radiotherapy contribute to growth retardation in the first year of treatment in both groups 2) It seems that prophylactic cranial irradiation in children with ALL with total doses 12 and 18 Gy does not contribute to retardation of growth velocity after cancer treatment 3) Endocrine follow-up should be introduced in order to detect and treat complications as early as possible.","['Birkholz, Dorota', 'Balcrerska, Anna', 'Kaminska, Halina', 'Korpal-Szczyrska, Maria', 'Dorant, Bohdana']","['Birkholz D', 'Balcrerska A', 'Kaminska H', 'Korpal-Szczyrska M', 'Dorant B']",,['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Endokrynol Diabetol Chor Przemiany Materii Wieku Rozw,"Endokrynologia, diabetologia i choroby przemiany materii wieku rozwojowego : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Endokrynologow Dzieciecych",100892008,,,,2003/06/24 05:00,2003/06/24 05:01,['2003/06/24 05:00'],"['2003/06/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/24 05:01 [medline]', '2003/06/24 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Endokrynol Diabetol Chor Przemiany Materii Wieku Rozw. 2002;8(2):63-71.,,,,,,,,,,Przebieg wzrastania dzieci dotknietych choroba nowotworowa.,,,,,,,,,

Our previous studies in leukemia demonstrated that BP1 has oncogenic properties, including as a modulator of cell survival. Here BP1 expression was examined in breast cancer, and the relationship between BP1 expression and clinicopathological data was determined. METHODS: Total RNA was isolated from cell lines, tumors, and matched normal adjacent tissue or tissue from autopsy. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed to evaluate BP1 expression. Statistical analysis was accomplished with SAS. RESULTS: Analysis of 46 invasive ductal breast tumors demonstrated BP1 expression in 80% of them, compared with a lack of expression in six normal breast tissues and low-level expression in one normal breast tissue. Remarkably, 100% of tumors that were negative for the estrogen receptor (ER) were BP1-positive, whereas 73% of ER-positive tumors expressed BP1 (P = 0.03). BP1 expression was also associated with race: 89% of the tumors of African American women were BP1-positive, whereas 57% of those from Caucasian women expressed BP1 (P = 0.04). However, there was no significant difference in BP1 expression between grades I, II, and III tumors. Interestingly, BP1 mRNA expression was correlated with the ability of malignant cell lines to cause breast cancer in mice. CONCLUSION: Because BP1 is expressed abnormally in breast tumors, it could provide a useful target for therapy, particularly in patients with ER-negative tumors. The frequent expression of BP1 in all tumor grades suggests that activation of BP1 is an early event.","['Fu, Sidney W', 'Schwartz, Arnold', 'Stevenson, Holly', 'Pinzone, Joseph J', 'Davenport, Gregory J', 'Orenstein, Jan M', 'Gutierrez, Peter', 'Simmens, Samuel J', 'Abraham, Jessy', 'Poola, Indira', 'Stephan, Dietrich A', 'Berg, Patricia E']","['Fu SW', 'Schwartz A', 'Stevenson H', 'Pinzone JJ', 'Davenport GJ', 'Orenstein JM', 'Gutierrez P', 'Simmens SJ', 'Abraham J', 'Poola I', 'Stephan DA', 'Berg PE']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Breast Cancer Res,Breast cancer research : BCR,100927353,"['0 (DLX4 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Estrogen/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Progesterone/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/06/24 05:00,2003/08/09 05:00,['2003/06/24 05:00'],"['2002/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2003/03/13 00:00 [revised]', '2003/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/06/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/24 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Breast Cancer Res. 2003;5(4):R82-7. doi: 10.1186/bcr602.

By combining a pre-incubation of the cells with a relatively non-toxic, PMN-E-specific inhibitor, MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethylketone (MAAPVCK), the p-nitroaniline formed by the hydrolysis of the substrate MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-p-NA by PMN-E is quantified. Elastase-like activity was measured in 14 human cells lines: 13 cancer cell lines (HL-60, U-937, A-427, LCLC-103H, YAPC, DAN-G, PA-TU-8902, KYSE-70, -510, -520, 5637, SISO and MCF-7) and one immortalized epithelial cell line (hTert-RPE1). Activity was detected in all lines; the lowest was found in hTert-RPE1 cells while the highest was detected in a pancreas adenocarcinoma line (PA-TU-8902). When the results were normalized according to cell volume instead of cell number, the leukemia line HL-60 had the highest activity and PA-TU-8902 ranked second. A 1 h pre-incubation with 9.0 microM of the irreversible PMN-E inhibitor MAAPVCK led to varying degrees of enzyme inhibition depending on the cell line; the strongest inhibition was observed with the PA-TU-8902 pancreatic cancer cell line (90% inhibition) while the weakest was seen with the A-427 lung cancer cell line (52%).

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) combined with tyramide signal amplification was applied on the chromosome specimen of FT-1 cells and normal cat lymphocytes, with an entire FeLV-A genome used as a probe. Specific hybridization signals were detected from only the metaphases of the FT-1 cells, not from those of normal cat lymphocytes.

However, screening for multiple fusion gene transcripts is difficult with conventional PCR and state-of-the-art real-time PCR and high-density microarrays. METHODS: We developed a multiplex reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay for screening and quantification of fusion gene transcripts in human leukemia cells. Chimeric primers were used that contained gene-specific and universal sequences. PCR amplification of fusion and control gene transcripts was achieved with use of an excess of universal primers to allow the ratio of abundance of fusion gene to endogenous or exogenous controls to be maintained throughout PCR. Multiplex RT-PCR products analyzed by an ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer were consistent with those of duplex RT-PCR (single analytical sample plus control). In addition, multiplex RT-PCR results were analyzed by an assay using an oligonucleotide microarray that contained probes for the splice-junction sequences of various fusion transcripts. RESULTS: The multiplex RT-PCR assay enabled screening of >10 different fusion gene transcripts in a single reaction. RT-PCR followed by analysis with the ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer consistently detected 1 fusion-transcript-carrying leukemia cell in 100-10 000 cells. The assay covered a 1000-fold range. Preliminary results indicate that multiplex RT-PCR products can also be analyzed by hybridization-based microarray assay. CONCLUSIONS: The multiplex RT-PCR analyzed by either ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer or microarray provides a sensitive and specific assay for screening of multiple fusion transcripts in leukemia, with the latter an assay that is adaptable to a high-throughput system for clinical screening.","['Shi, Run Zhang', 'Morrissey, Joseph M', 'Rowley, Janet D']","['Shi RZ', 'Morrissey JM', 'Rowley JD']","['Motorola Corporate Laboratories, Ft.

In this study the expression of the MRP2, MRP3, MRP4, MRP5, and SMRP genes was measured using TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 103 children with previously untreated acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (precursor B-cell ALL [B-ALL], n = 71; T-cell ALL [T-ALL], n = 32). All 5 genes were expressed with a great variability. Only MRP3 expression was associated with a significantly worse prognosis (P =.008). The median expression of MRP3 was 10-fold higher in T-ALL than in precursor B-ALL (P <.001) and 4-fold higher in male patients than in female patients (P <.001). The prognostic impact of MRP3 was independent of immunophenotype or sex. Higher levels of MRP3 were found in patients with a poor in vivo response to prednisone, but this could not be confirmed in an independent case-control study (40 patients) for prednisone response. In healthy donors, the median expression of MRP4 was 4-fold higher in bone marrow and 8-fold higher in CD34+ stem cells compared with peripheral blood (P =.002). Our results suggest that MRP3 is involved in drug resistance in childhood ALL. It therefore represents an interesting target to overcome multidrug resistance. High levels of MRP3 could possibly be the reason for the poorer prognosis of male patients or patients who have T-ALL. Similar to other members of the family of ABC transporters, MRP4 seems to be a marker for immature stem cells.","['Steinbach, Daniel', 'Wittig, Susann', 'Cario, Gunnar', 'Viehmann, Susanne', 'Mueller, Angelika', 'Gruhn, Bernd', 'Haefer, Ralf', 'Zintl, Felix', 'Sauerbrey, Axel']","['Steinbach D', 'Wittig S', 'Cario G', 'Viehmann S', 'Mueller A', 'Gruhn B', 'Haefer R', 'Zintl F', 'Sauerbrey A']","['Klinikum der FSU Jena, Klinik fur Kinder-und Jugendmedizin, Postfach, 07740 Jena, Germany. daniel@steinba.ch']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '1YV0492L5Z (multidrug resistance-associated protein 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*blood/drug therapy/mortality', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Male', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*blood/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'RNA, Messenger/blood', 'RNA, Neoplasm/blood', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/06/21 05:00,2004/01/22 05:00,['2003/06/21 05:00'],"['2003/06/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/22 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Dec 15;102(13):4493-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-11-3461.

FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3/ITDs) are reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and predict poor clinical outcome. We found FLT3/ITDs in 11.5% of 234 children with de novo AML. FLT3/ITD-positive patients were significantly older and had higher percentages of normal cytogenetic findings or French-American-British (FAB) classification M1/M2 and lower percentages of 11q23 abnormalities or FAB M5. FLT3/ITD-positive patients had lower remission induction rates (70% vs 88%; P =.01) and lower 5-year probability rates of event-free survival (pEF) (29% vs 46%; P =.0046) and overall survival (32% vs 58%; P =.037). Patients with high ratios (higher than the median) between mutant and wild-type FLT3 had significantly worse 2-year EFS rates than FLT3/ITD-negative patients (pEFS 20% vs 61%; P =.037), whereas patients with ratios lower than the median did not (pEFS 44% vs 61%; P =.26). FLT3/ITD was the strongest independent predictor for pEFS, with an increase in relative risk for an event of 1.92 (P =.01). Using an MTT (methyl-thiazol-tetrazolium)-based assay, we studied cellular drug resistance on 15 FLT3/ITD-positive and 125 FLT3/ITD-negative AML samples, but we found no differences in cellular drug resistance that could explain the poor outcomes in FLT3/ITD-positive patients. We conclude that FLT3/ITD is less common in pediatric than in adult AML. FLT3/ITD is a strong and independent adverse prognostic factor, and high ratios between mutant and WT-FLT3 further compromise prognosis. However, poor outcomes in FLT3/ITD-positive patients could not be attributed to increased in vitro cellular drug resistance.","['Zwaan, Christian M', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Radich, Jerald P', 'Veerman, Anjo J P', 'Huismans, Dieuwke R', 'Munske, Leonhard', 'Podleschny, Martina', 'Hahlen, Karel', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Harbott, Jochen', 'Creutzig, Ursula', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Griesinger, Frank']","['Zwaan CM', 'Meshinchi S', 'Radich JP', 'Veerman AJ', 'Huismans DR', 'Munske L', 'Podleschny M', 'Hahlen K', 'Pieters R', 'Zimmermann M', 'Reinhardt D', 'Harbott J', 'Creutzig U', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Griesinger F']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, VU University Medical Center, PO Box 7057, 1007 MB Amsterdam, The Netherlands. cm.zwaan@vumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2003/06/21 05:00,2003/10/30 05:00,['2003/06/21 05:00'],"['2003/06/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Oct 1;102(7):2387-94. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-12-3627.

Here, we studied the structure, expression pattern, and function of MEL1 in leukemia cells. In this study, we have identified 3 transcription start sites, 1 in exon 1 and 2 in exon 2, and 2 kinds of translation products, 170 kDa (MEL1) and 150 kDa (MEL1S). Notably, the 150-kDa band of MEL1S was detected mainly in the t(1;3)(p36;q21)-positive AML cells. By immunoblot analysis and proteolytic mapping, it is suggested that the 150-kDa band of MEL1S in the leukemia cells is translated from the internal initiation codon ATG597 in exon 4 and is mostly lacking the amino-terminal PR domain of MEL1. By the cyclic amplification and selection of targets (CASTing) method for identifying consensus sequences, it was shown that the consensus sequences of MEL1 were included in 2 different consensus sequences for DNA-binding domain 1 and 2 (D1-CONS and D2-CONS) of EVI1. In reporter gene assays, MEL1S activated transcription via binding to D2-CONS; however, the fusion of MEL1 or MEL1S to GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) made them GAL4 binding site-dependent transcriptional repressors. Moreover, overexpression of MEL1S blocked granulocytic differentiation induced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent murine myeloid L-G3 cells, while MEL1 could not block the differentiation. Thus, it is likely that overexpression of the zinc finger protein lacking the PR domain (EVI1 and MEL1S) in the leukemia cells is one of the causative factors in the pathogenesis of myeloid leukemia.","['Nishikata, Ichiro', 'Sasaki, Hidenori', 'Iga, Mutsunori', 'Tateno, Yoko', 'Imayoshi, Suzuko', 'Asou, Norio', 'Nakamura, Takuro', 'Morishita, Kazuhiro']","['Nishikata I', 'Sasaki H', 'Iga M', 'Tateno Y', 'Imayoshi S', 'Asou N', 'Nakamura T', 'Morishita K']","['Department of Biochemistry, Miyazaki Medical College, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan. kmorishi@post.miyazaki-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (PRDM16 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2003/06/21 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/06/21 05:00'],"['2003/06/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Nov 1;102(9):3323-32. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-12-3944.

We molecularly analyzed the breakpoints of der(1;7)(q10;p10) by quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses using centromeric satellite DNAs mapped to chromosomes 1 and 7 as probes. We found that the signal intensities of 2 centromere alphoid probes, D1Z7 on chromosome 1 and D7Z1 on chromosome 7, were almost invariably reduced on the derivative chromosome compared with those on their normal counterparts. These results suggest that this translocation results from the recombination between the 2 alphoids, which was further confirmed by fiber FISH experiments. Because the relative reduction in the intensities of D1Z7 and D7Z1 signals on the derivative chromosomes was highly variable among patients, it was estimated that the breakpoints in these patients were randomly distributed over several megabase pairs within each alphoid cluster except for its extreme end to the short arm.

Expression of tal-1/scl or a DNA binding mutant of tal-1/scl induces arrest of thymocyte development, resulting in decreases in double-positive and single-positive CD4 thymocytes. Moreover, nuclear p65/p50 heterodimers are detected in premalignant tal-1/scl and mut tal-1/scl thymocytes, suggesting that E2A depletion may induce developmental arrest and stimulate NF-kappaB activation. Increased NF-kappaB activity is also observed in tal-1/scl tumors and bcl-2 is overexpressed. To examine the contribution of NF-kappaB to tal-1/scl tumor growth in vivo, we expressed a mutant form of IkappaBalpha in tal-1/scl tumor cells. Although expression of mutant IkappaBalpha inhibited the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced NF-kappaB response, it had no effect on tumor growth in mice. These data suggest that NF-kappaB activation is an early event in tal-1/scl-induced leukemogenesis, associated with arrest of thymocyte development, and does not appear to contribute to tal-1/scl-induced tumor growth.","[""O'Neil, Jennifer"", 'Ventura, Juan-Jose', 'Cusson, Nicole', 'Kelliher, Michelle']","[""O'Neil J"", 'Ventura JJ', 'Cusson N', 'Kelliher M']","['Department of Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit', 'Precancerous Conditions/genetics/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/*pathology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Transcription Factor RelA', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2003/06/21 05:00,2003/10/30 05:00,['2003/06/21 05:00'],"['2003/06/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Oct 1;102(7):2593-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-01-0090.

Acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL) develops in approximately 20% to 30% of the cases with TMD. Recently, acquired mutations in the N-terminal activation domain of the GATA-1 gene, encoding the erythroid/megakaryocytic transcription factor GATA-1, have been reported in Down syndrome-related AMKL (DS-AMKL). To understand the multistep leukemogenesis in Down syndrome, GATA-1 mutations were investigated in patients with TMD. We show here that mutations in the GATA-1 gene were detected in 21 of 22 cases with TMD. Most of the mutations in TMD were located in the regions including exon 2 and were essentially identical to those observed in DS-AMKL. In the DS-AMKL cell line, MGS, which itself expresses only a truncated mutant of GATA-1, expression of full-length GATA-1 induced the differentiation toward the erythroid lineage. However, expression of the short form of GATA-1 did not induce erythroid differentiation. These results indicate that expression of GATA-1 with a defective N-terminal activation domain contributes to the expansion of TMD blast cells and that other genetic changes contribute to the development of AMKL in Down syndrome.","['Xu, Gang', 'Nagano, Masumi', 'Kanezaki, Rika', 'Toki, Tsutomu', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide', 'Taketani, Takeshi', 'Taki, Tomohiko', 'Mitui, Tetsuo', 'Koike, Kenichi', 'Kato, Koji', 'Imaizumi, Masue', 'Sekine, Isao', 'Ikeda, Yasuhiko', 'Hanada, Ryoji', 'Sako, Masahiro', 'Kudo, Kazuko', 'Kojima, Seiji', 'Ohneda, Osamu', 'Yamamoto, Masayuki', 'Ito, Etsuro']","['Xu G', 'Nagano M', 'Kanezaki R', 'Toki T', 'Hayashi Y', 'Taketani T', 'Taki T', 'Mitui T', 'Koike K', 'Kato K', 'Imaizumi M', 'Sekine I', 'Ikeda Y', 'Hanada R', 'Sako M', 'Kudo K', 'Kojima S', 'Ohneda O', 'Yamamoto M', 'Ito E']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hirosaki University School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Aomori, 036-8563 Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Down Syndrome/complications/*genetics', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Infant, Newborn', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Male', 'Models, Genetic', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2003/06/21 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/06/21 05:00'],"['2003/06/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Oct 15;102(8):2960-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-02-0390.

METHODS: The proteins expression of cyclin B1, p170 was measured with flow cytometric analysis in 85 adult de novo acute leukemia patients (AL) and 17 normal control (NC). The expression of cyclin B1, multidrug resistance gene (mdr-1), topoisomerase IIalpha, beta (TOPOIIalpha, beta) and bcl-2 mRNA in these patients was measured with semi-quantify reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: (1) The expression of cyclin B1 protein (M = 12.3%) and mRNA (M = 0.217) in the treatment resistance group was significantly lower than the sensitive group cyclin B1 protein (M = 22.7%) and mRNA (M = 0.563) (P < 0.05), so was the mRNA of TOPOIIalpha (M = 0.236), TOPOIIbeta (M = 0.328) than the sensitive group TOPOIIalpha (M = 0.514), TOPOIIbeta (M = 0.635) (P < 0.01). Cyclin B1 protein expression was lower than 5% and there were no expression of cyclin B1, TOPOIIalpha, mdr-1 mRNA in the NC group under the same condition. (2) The p170 protein (M = 14.3%) and mdr-1 (M = 1.071), bcl-2 (M = 0.941) mRNA expression in the resistant group was significant higher than the sensitive group p170 protein (M = 3.6%) and mdr-1 (M = 0.094), bcl-2 (M = 0.153) (P < 0.01). (3) The expression of cyclin B1 protein and TOPOIIalpha, TOPOIIbeta mRNA was positive correlated (r(TOPOIIalpha) = 0.472, P < 0.01; r(TOPOIIbeta) = 0.683, P < 0.01), so was the cyclin B1 mRNA (r(TOPOIIalpha) = 0.319, P < 0.05; r(TOPOIIbeta) = 0.527, P < 0.05). (4) There was no correlation between cyclin B1 and p170, mdr-1, bcl-2. (5) By Binary logistic forward conditional analysis we concluded that cyclin B1 correlated with atypital mutidrug resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Low expression of cyclin B1 might be a unfavorable prognostic factor for patients with AL and measurement of both cyclin B1 and TOPOIIalpha, TOPOIIbeta gene expression would predict drug resistance in adult acute leukemia patients.","['Ma, Wei-dong', 'Xu, Shi-rong', 'Guo, Xiao-nan', 'Gao, Xiao-li', 'Ma, Jie', 'Qiao, Shu-kai']","['Ma WD', 'Xu SR', 'Guo XN', 'Gao XL', 'Ma J', 'Qiao SK']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050000, China. hbxushirong@haoyisheng.com.cn']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Cyclin B/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cyclin B1', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2003/06/21 05:00,2004/11/17 09:00,['2003/06/21 05:00'],"['2003/06/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/17 09:00 [medline]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2003 Mar;42(3):169-72.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(8;21) and mast cell leukemia (MCL) in which the mastocytosis persisted after standard chemotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation, although the myeloid leukemia achieved molecular complete remission soon after induction chemotherapy. Donor-type mast cells were noted on d31 after transplant. No c-kit mutation was found before or after the transplant. This represents the first reported case in which rapid engraftment of mast cells of donor origin was documented. Thus, the possibility that the mast cell originates from a common myeloid precursor cell may be questioned and a reactive process should be considered in some cases of systemic mastocytosis.","['Chen, T-Y', 'Chen, J-S', 'Huang, W-T', 'Su, W-C', 'Tsao, C-J']","['Chen TY', 'Chen JS', 'Huang WT', 'Su WC', 'Tsao CJ']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Cheng-Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Cell Lineage', '*Graft Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/complications/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*physiology', 'Mastocytosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Tissue Donors', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2003/06/20 05:00,2004/03/25 05:00,['2003/06/20 05:00'],"['2003/06/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/20 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2003 Jul;32(1):111-4. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1704098.,,"['10.1038/sj.bmt.1704098 [doi]', '1704098 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is neither clinical nor experimental data available addressing the question if other hematopoietic growth factors or combinations thereof might influence engraftment, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), and graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effects after allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation (PBPCT). We used a murine model to investigate these parameters after transplantation of PBPCs mobilized with G-CSF and SCF either alone or in combination. Treatment of splenectomized DBA and Balb/c mice with 250 microg/kg/day G-CSF for 5 days resulted in an increase of CFU-gm from 0 to 53/microl. The highest progenitor cell numbers (147/microl) were observed after treatment with 100 microg/kg/day SCF administered in conjunction with G-SCF. No differences were detected with regard to the number of T cells (CD3+), T cell subsets (CD4+, CD8+), B cells (CD19+) and NK cells (NK1.1+) in PBPC grafts mobilized by G-CSF plus SCF compared to those mobilized with G-CSF alone. The antileukemic activity of syngeneic and MHC-identical allogeneic PBPC grafts was investigated in lethally irradiated Balb/c mice bearing the B-lymphatic leukemia cell line A20. In this model, PBPCs mobilized by G-CSF plus SCF exerted a significantly higher antileukemic activity compared to grafts mobilized by G-CSF alone (94 vs 71% freedom from leukemia at day 100, P<0.05). The antileukemic effect was lowest after BMT (38% freedom from leukemia). Since significant differences in the incidence of lethal GvHD were not observed, improved GVL-activity resulted in superior overall survival. Our data demonstrate that the utilization of specific hematopoietic growth factors not only improve the yield of hematopoietic progenitor cells but can also significantly enhance the immunotherapeutic potential of allografts.","['Hartung, G', 'Zeis, M', 'Glass, B', 'Dreger, P', 'Steinmann, J', 'Schmitz, N', 'Uharek, L']","['Hartung G', 'Zeis M', 'Glass B', 'Dreger P', 'Steinmann J', 'Schmitz N', 'Uharek L']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Immune System/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Models, Animal', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Stem Cell Factor/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Transplantation Immunology/drug effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",2003/06/20 05:00,2004/03/25 05:00,['2003/06/20 05:00'],"['2003/06/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/20 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2003 Jul;32(1):49-56. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1704072.,,"['10.1038/sj.bmt.1704072 [doi]', '1704072 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
