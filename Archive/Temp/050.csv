Carrier status of mutations in BRCA2 is associated with familial breast and ovarian cancer, while bi-allelic BRCA2 mutations can cause Fanconi anemia (FA), a cancer predisposition syndrome with cellular cross-linker hypersensitivity. Cancers associated with BRCA2 mutations can acquire chemo-resistance on relapse. We modeled acquired cross-linker resistance with an FA-derived BRCA2-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) platform. Associated with acquired cross-linker resistance was the expression of a functional BRCA2 protein variant lacking exon 5 and exon 7 (BRCA2(DeltaE5+7)), implying a role for BRCA2 splicing for acquired chemo-resistance. Integrated network analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic differences for phenotyping of BRCA2 disruption infers impact on transcription and chromatin remodeling in addition to the DNA damage response. The striking overlap with transcriptional profiles of FA patient hematopoiesis and BRCA mutation associated ovarian cancer helps define and explicate the 'BRCAness' profile.","['Meyer, Stefan',

However, little is yet known about whether or not LSD1 may serve as therapeutic target in RMS. We therefore investigated the potential of LSD1 inhibitors alone or in combination with other epigenetic modifiers such as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Here, we identify a synergistic interaction of LSD1 inhibitors (i.e., GSK690, Ex917) and HDAC inhibitors (i.e., JNJ-26481585, SAHA) to induce cell death in RMS cells. By comparison, LSD1 inhibitors as single agents exhibit little cytotoxicity against RMS cells. Mechanistically, GSK690 acts in concert with JNJ-26481585 to upregulate mRNA levels of the proapoptotic BH3-only proteins BMF, PUMA, BIM and NOXA. This increase in mRNA levels is accompanied by a corresponding upregulation of BMF, PUMA, BIM and NOXA protein levels. Importantly, individual knockdown of either BMF, BIM or NOXA significantly reduces GSK690/JNJ-26481585-mediated cell death. Similarly, genetic silencing of BAK significantly rescues cell death upon GSK690/JNJ-26481585 cotreatment. Also, overexpression of antiapoptotic BCL-2 or MCL-1 significantly protects RMS cells from GSK690/JNJ-26481585-induced cell death. Furthermore, GSK690 acts in concert with JNJ-26481585 to increase activation of caspase-9 and -3. Consistently, addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD.fmk) significantly reduces GSK690/JNJ-26481585-mediated cell death. In conclusion, concomitant LSD1 and HDAC inhibition synergistically induces cell death in RMS cells by shifting the ratio of pro- and antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins in favor of apoptosis, thereby engaging the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. This indicates that combined treatment with LSD1 and HDAC inhibitors is a promising new therapeutic approach in RMS.","['Haydn, Tinka', 'Metzger, Eric', 'Schuele, Roland', 'Fulda, Simone']","['Haydn T', 'Metzger E', 'Schuele R', 'Fulda S']",,"['Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Komturstrasse 3a, Frankfurt 60528, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Urology, University Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Urology, University Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Komturstrasse 3a, Frankfurt 60528, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170615,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (quisinostat)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.5.- (KDM1A protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Histone Demethylases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/chemistry', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/drug therapy/*pathology']",PMC5520898,2017/06/16 06:00,2018/05/19 06:00,['2017/06/16 06:00'],"['2017/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2017239 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2017.239 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2017 Jun 15;8(6):e2879. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2017.239.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TFR is increasingly becoming a goal of treatment. Eighty-seven patients answered a survey exploring patient perceptions of TFR, incorporating CML-specific factors (disease history, treatment toxicity, and adherence) and questions concerning health beliefs. 81% of participants (95% CI: 72%-89%) indicated that they would be willing to attempt TFR. No demographic or CML-related variable in the survey was significantly associated with willingness. In qualitative analysis, the commonest motivations for TFR included TKI toxicity (n = 26) and convenience (n = 18). The leading reason for reluctance was fear of consequences of stopping TKI (n = 16). Reluctance was often associated with needs for additional information or incomplete understanding of the current data.

METHODS: The gene chip technique was used to detect different gene expression between Ph(+) ALL cell line SUP-B15/R (imatinib resistant cell line) and SUP-B15/S (imatinib sensitive cell line), the gene of solute carrier family 2 member 5 (SLC2A5) and its coded protein Glut5 were screened out and were reconfirmed by qPCR and Western blot assay. The imatinib half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) to SUP-B15/S cells with or without fructose treatment was further detected by MTT assay, simultaneously signal pathway gene was detected by qPCR assay. RESULTS: Metabolism related gene SLC2A5 was screened out with gene chip technique and the Western blot assay and qPCR confirmed the high expression of SLC2A5 gene and its coded protein Glut5 in SUP-B15/R cells. IC50 values of imatinib to SUP-B15/S cells after treatment with 25 mumol/L fructose were increased from (44.50+/-2.38) mumol/L to (64.71+/-1.69) mumol/L, in the meanwhile, PI3K and AKT mRNA level also increased in fructose treated SUP-B15/S cells compared to the control. CONCLUSIONS: High expression of SLC2A5 and Glut5 protein in SUP-B15/R cells leads to increased fructose absorption, and further activates PI3K/AKT pathway which cause the SUP-B15 cell resistance to imatinib.","['Yan, Tian-You', 'Naren, Duo-Lan', 'Gong, Yu-Ping']","['Yan TY', 'Naren DL', 'Gong YP']",,"['Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Sichuan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Sichuan da xue xue bao.

Patients (n = 34, 57%) with a platelet response were further evaluated for length of response. Median (range) response duration was 33 (7-174) weeks; 28/34 (82%) patients had a continuous response. Five of 34 patients (15%) had grade >/=3 bleeding events; three when the platelet count was >50 x 10(9) /l. There were no new safety concerns and the rate of progression to AML was low; response to romiplostim was maintained for most patients.","['Fenaux, Pierre', 'Muus, Petra', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Lyons, Roger M', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Becker, Pamela S', 'Orejudos, Amelia', 'Franklin, Janet']","['Fenaux P', 'Muus P', 'Kantarjian H', 'Lyons RM', 'Larson RA', 'Sekeres MA', 'Becker PS', 'Orejudos A', 'Franklin J']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0468-3553'],"[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Hopital St. Louis and Paris 7 University, Paris, France."", 'Department of Haematology, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Texas Oncology and US Oncology Research, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Cleveland Clinic, Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'University of Washington and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Amgen Inc., Morganville, NJ, USA.', 'Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170614,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Hematologic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'GN5XU2DXKV (romiplostim)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Hemorrhage/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*drug therapy', 'Platelet Count', 'Receptors, Fc/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/agonists', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood/*drug therapy', 'Thrombopoietin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC5600084,2017/06/16 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2017/06/16 06:00'],"['2016/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14792 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2017 Sep;178(6):906-913. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14792.

Our analysis showed that AML patients with FLT3-ITD and DNMT3A R882 mutations had a higher white blood cell count and a lower complete remission (CR) rate after first induction chemotherapy. All 206 patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in status of CR. These results indicate that AML patients with FLT3-ITD and DNMT3A R882 double mutation show a higher 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), lower 2-year overall survival (OS) rate, and lower 2-year leukocyte-free survival (LFS) after allo-HSCT. The univariate and multivariate analyses confirmed that disease status prior to transplantation, FLT3-ITD, FLT3-ITD, and DNMT3A R882 double mutation were independent factors for poor prognosis after allo-HSCT. In summary, the present cohort study demonstrated that FLT3-ITD and DNMT3A R882 double mutation predicts poor prognosis in Chinese AML patients receiving chemotherapy or allo-HSCT treatment.","['Tang, Shanhao', 'Shen, Hongjie', 'Mao, Xinliang', 'Dai, Haiping', 'Zhu, Xiaming', 'Xue, Shengli', 'Ding, Zixuan', 'Lu, Jing', 'Wu, Depei', 'Tang, Xiaowen']","['Tang S', 'Shen H', 'Mao X', 'Dai H', 'Zhu X', 'Xue S', 'Ding Z', 'Lu J', 'Wu D', 'Tang X']",,"['Department of Hematology, Yinzhou People Hospital, 251th, Baizhang East Road, Ningbo, 315040, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, 188 Shizi Road, Suzhou, 215006, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, 215006, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, 215123, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, 188 Shizi Road, Suzhou, 215006, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, 215006, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, 188 Shizi Road, Suzhou, 215006, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, 215006, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, 188 Shizi Road, Suzhou, 215006, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, 215006, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, 188 Shizi Road, Suzhou, 215006, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, 215006, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, 188 Shizi Road, Suzhou, 215006, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, 215006, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, 188 Shizi Road, Suzhou, 215006, China. wudepei@medmail.com.cn.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, 215006, China. wudepei@medmail.com.cn.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China. wudepei@medmail.com.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, 188 Shizi Road, Suzhou, 215006, China. xwtang1020@163.com.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, 215006, China. xwtang1020@163.com.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China. xwtang1020@163.com.']",['eng'],"['81270645/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81470346/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81100390/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81100372/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'SYS201457/Applied basic research of Suzhou science and technology progra', '2016YFC0902800/Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education', 'Institutions (PAPD) and The national key research and development program', 'BM2015004/Innovation Capability Development Project of Jiangsu Province']",['Journal Article'],20170614,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Allografts', 'Asians', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,2017/06/16 06:00,2018/01/06 06:00,['2017/06/16 06:00'],"['2016/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-017-2256-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-017-2256-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2017 Oct;106(4):552-561. doi: 10.1007/s12185-017-2256-7.

F. keratoplasticum (a member of F. solani species complex) is one of the Fusarium species commonly associated with human infection, and therefore, studies on the virulence of this fungus are needed. This study aimed to confirm the presence of melanin in F. keratoplasticum from a patient with systemic fusariosis. Immunofluorescence labeling with anti-melanin monoclonal antibody (MAb) was used to examine an expression of melanin in F. keratoplasticum in vitro and during infection. Electron spin resonance identified the particles extracted from F. keratoplasticum as stable free radical consistent with melanin. Lesional skin from the sites with fusariosis contained hyphal structures that could be labeled by melanin-binding MAb, while digestion of the tissue yielded dark particles that were reactive. These findings suggest that F. keratoplasticum hyphae and chlamydospores can produce melanin in vitro and that hyphae can synthesize pigment in vivo. Given the potential role of melanin in virulence of other fungi, this pigment in F. keratoplasticum may play a role in the pathogenesis of fusariosis.","['Chiewchanvit, Siri', 'Chongkae, Siriporn', 'Mahanupab, Pongsak', 'Nosanchuk, Joshua D', 'Pornsuwan, Soraya', 'Vanittanakom, Nongnuch', 'Youngchim, Sirida']","['Chiewchanvit S', 'Chongkae S', 'Mahanupab P', 'Nosanchuk JD', 'Pornsuwan S', 'Vanittanakom N', 'Youngchim S']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Medicine (Infectious Diseases), Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, 10461, USA.', 'Department of Physical Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Bangkok, 10400, Thailand.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand. syoungchim@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['AI52733/National Institutes of Health'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20170614,Netherlands,Mycopathologia,Mycopathologia,7505689,['0 (Melanins)'],IM,"['Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Fusariosis/*diagnosis/microbiology', 'Fusarium/*chemistry/*isolation & purification', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Hyphae/chemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Melanins/*analysis', 'Opportunistic Infections/*diagnosis/microbiology', 'Spores, Fungal/chemistry', 'Young Adult']",,2017/06/16 06:00,2018/07/10 06:00,['2017/06/16 06:00'],"['2016/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11046-017-0156-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s11046-017-0156-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Mycopathologia. 2017 Oct;182(9-10):879-885. doi: 10.1007/s11046-017-0156-2.

Spheroids are typically generated using hanging drop or non-adherent culture; however, an emerging technique is to use magnetic levitation. Herein, mesenchymal stem cell spheroids were generated using magnetic nanoparticles and subsequently cultured within a type I collagen gel, with a view towards developing a bone marrow niche environment. Cells were loaded with magnetic nanoparticles, and suspended beneath an external magnet, inducing self-assembly of multicellular spheroids. Cells in spheroids were viable and compared to corresponding monolayer controls, maintained stem cell phenotype and were quiescent. Interestingly, core spheroid necrosis was not observed, even with increasing spheroid size, in contrast to other commonly used spheroid systems. This mesenchymal stem cell spheroid culture presents a potential platform for modelling in vitro bone marrow stem cell niches, elucidating interactions between cells, as well as a useful model for drug delivery studies.","['Lewis, Natasha S', 'Lewis, Emily El', 'Mullin, Margaret', 'Wheadon, Helen', 'Dalby, Matthew J', 'Berry, Catherine C']","['Lewis NS', 'Lewis EE', 'Mullin M', 'Wheadon H', 'Dalby MJ', 'Berry CC']",,"['Centre for Cell Engineering, Institute of Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology (IMCSB), The University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'Centre for Cell Engineering, Institute of Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology (IMCSB), The University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'Electron Microscopy Unit, The University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, The University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", 'Centre for Cell Engineering, Institute of Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology (IMCSB), The University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'Centre for Cell Engineering, Institute of Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology (IMCSB), The University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],"['BB/G008868/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'JF20604/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom']",['Journal Article'],20170424,England,J Tissue Eng,Journal of tissue engineering,101550131,,,,PMC5460809,2017/06/16 06:00,2017/06/16 06:01,['2017/06/16 06:00'],"['2017/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2041731417704428 [doi]', '10.1177_2041731417704428 [pii]']",epublish,J Tissue Eng. 2017 Apr 24;8:2041731417704428. doi: 10.1177/2041731417704428. eCollection 2017 Jan-Dec.,['NOTNLM'],"['Nanoparticles', 'bone marrow', 'mesenchymal stem cells', 'niche', 'spheroids']","['Declaration of conflicting interests: The author(s) declared no potential', 'conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship and/or publication', 'of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of NMR studies revealed that Az associates with an ATPase domain of Hsc70 and thus blocks ATP binding to the protein. Observations made in the cell study indicated that Az treatment promotes leukemia cell death by activating caspase-dependent apoptosis without affecting the caspase-independent apoptotic pathway. Importantly, the hybrids composed of Az and geldanamycin, which have high inhibitory activities towards both Hsp70 and Hsp90, exhibit enhanced anti-leukemia activity relative to the individual inhibitors. However, the Az and imatinib hybrids have weak inhibitory activities towards Hsp70 and Abl, and display lower cytotoxicity against leukemia cells compared to those of the individual constituents. The results of a mechanistic study showed that the active hybrid molecules promote leukemia cell death through a caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. Taken together, the findings suggest that Hsp70 inhibitors as well as their hybrids can serve as potential anti-leukemia agents.","['Park, Seong-Hyun', 'Kim, Won-Je', 'Li, Hui', 'Seo, Wonil', 'Park, Sang-Hyun', 'Kim, Hwan', 'Shin, Sang Chul', 'Zuiderweg, Erik R P', 'Kim, Eunice EunKyeong', 'Sim, Taebo', 'Kim, Nak-Kyoon', 'Shin, Injae']","['Park SH', 'Kim WJ', 'Li H', 'Seo W', 'Park SH', 'Kim H', 'Shin SC', 'Zuiderweg ERP', 'Kim EE', 'Sim T', 'Kim NK', 'Shin I']",,"['National Creative Research Initiative Center for Biofunctional Molecules, Department of Chemistry, Yonsei University, Seoul, 03722, Korea.', 'Advanced Analysis Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Seoul, 02792, Korea.', 'National Creative Research Initiative Center for Biofunctional Molecules, Department of Chemistry, Yonsei University, Seoul, 03722, Korea.', 'National Creative Research Initiative Center for Biofunctional Molecules, Department of Chemistry, Yonsei University, Seoul, 03722, Korea.', 'National Creative Research Initiative Center for Biofunctional Molecules, Department of Chemistry, Yonsei University, Seoul, 03722, Korea.', 'Chemical Kinomics Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Seoul, 02792, Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Institute, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Seoul, 02792, Korea.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Biomedical Research Institute, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Seoul, 02792, Korea.', 'Chemical Kinomics Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Seoul, 02792, Korea.', 'KU-KIST Graduate School of Converging Science and Technology, Korea University, Seoul, 02841, Korea.', 'Advanced Analysis Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Seoul, 02792, Korea. nkkim@kist.re.kr.', 'National Creative Research Initiative Center for Biofunctional Molecules, Department of Chemistry, Yonsei University, Seoul, 03722, Korea. injae@yonsei.ac.kr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170614,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (apoptozole)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'Z3K3VJ16KU (geldanamycin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Benzamides/*metabolism', 'Benzoquinones/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/metabolism', 'Imidazoles/*metabolism', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/metabolism', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy']",PMC5471252,2017/06/16 06:00,2019/05/14 06:00,['2017/06/16 06:00'],"['2017/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-03814-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-03814-6 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Jun 14;7(1):3537. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-03814-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) as a platform for identifying mutations in circulating plasma tumor DNA (ptDNA). We present the unexpected finding of a spurious mutant allele fraction that was discovered to be artifactual because of the presence of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in a patient sample. DESIGN AND METHODS: Probe and primer combinations for the K700 and V701 loci of the SF3B1 spliceosome gene were designed for ddPCR to identify the percentage of mutant and wild-type alleles. Clinical samples from patients with cancer with known SF3B1 mutations were collected and tested to evaluate the assays' ability to detect SF3B1 mutations in ptDNA. RESULTS: Patient samples showed SF3B1 K700E mutations within the ptDNA of 4 patients with acute leukemia and 3 with myelodysplastic syndrome who were known to harbor this mutation. A blood sample from a patient with lung cancer with a known SF3B1 V701F mutation was also analyzed and this mutation was successfully identified in ptDNA. However, 1 of the patients with a K700E mutation was found to have a mutational burden of 98%. After careful analysis of this locus by Sanger sequencing and ddPCR, this patient was found to have an SNP (R702R), which prevented binding of the ddPCR wild-type probe to its cognate allele. CONCLUSIONS: These results further support that ddPCR-based assays may be valuable companion diagnostics for the identification and monitoring of patients with cancer, but the results also emphasize the need to identify SNPs at loci that are being analyzed.","['Christenson, Eric S', 'Dalton, W Brian', 'Chu, David', 'Waters, Ian', 'Cravero, Karen', 'Zabransky, Daniel J', 'DeZern, Amy E', 'Park, Ben Ho']","['Christenson ES', 'Dalton WB', 'Chu D', 'Waters I', 'Cravero K', 'Zabransky DJ', 'DeZern AE', 'Park BH']",,"['The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD; bpark2@jhmi.edu.', 'The Whiting School of Engineering, Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170614,England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (SF3B1 protein, human)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'DNA, Neoplasm/blood/*genetics', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing Factors/*genetics']",,2017/06/16 06:00,2017/08/19 06:00,['2017/06/16 06:00'],"['2017/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['clinchem.2017.273177 [pii]', '10.1373/clinchem.2017.273177 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2017 Aug;63(8):1370-1376. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2017.273177.

Using a comparative transcriptomic approach, we identify ZNF521/Zfp521 as a conserved hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-enriched transcription factor in human and murine hematopoiesis whose function in HSC biology remains elusive. Competitive serial transplantation assays using Zfp521-deficient mice revealed that ZFP521 regulates HSC self-renewal and differentiation. In contrast, ectopic expression of ZFP521 in HSCs led to a robust maintenance of progenitor activity in vitro. Transcriptional analysis of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples revealed that ZNF521 is highly and specifically upregulated in AMLs with MLL translocations. Using an MLL-AF9 murine leukemia model and serial transplantation studies, we show that ZFP521 is not required for leukemogenesis, although its absence leads to a significant delay in leukemia onset. Furthermore, knockdown of ZNF521 reduced proliferation in human leukemia cell lines possessing MLL-AF9 translocations. Taken together, these results identify ZNF521/ZFP521 as a critical regulator of HSC function, which facilitates MLL-AF9-mediated leukemic disease in mice.","['Garrison, Brian S', 'Rybak, Adrian P', 'Beerman, Isabel', 'Heesters, Balthasar', 'Mercier, Francois E', 'Scadden, David T', 'Bryder, David', 'Baron, Roland', 'Rossi, Derrick J']","['Garrison BS', 'Rybak AP', 'Beerman I', 'Heesters B', 'Mercier FE', 'Scadden DT', 'Bryder D', 'Baron R', 'Rossi DJ']",,"[""Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', ""Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD.', 'Division of Immunology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA.', 'Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA.', 'Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.', 'Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, MA.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Oral Medicine, Infection and Immunity, Harvard School of Dental Medicine, Boston, MA; and.', 'Endocrine Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.', ""Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, MA.']",['eng'],"['UC4 DK104218/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL099997/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR057769/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL107630/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL107440/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 HL129903/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20170614,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Evi3 protein, mouse)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Mllt3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (zinc finger protein 521, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic']",PMC5542850,2017/06/16 06:00,2017/08/11 06:00,['2017/06/16 06:00'],"['2016/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33133-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-09-738591 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Aug 3;130(5):619-624. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-09-738591.

HTLV-1 cell-to-cell transmission is dependent on the release of infectious virus particles into the virological synapse. The HTLV-1 particle structure is still poorly understood, and previous studies analyzed viruses produced by transformed lymphocytic cell lines chronically infected with HTLV-1, particularly the MT-2 cell line, which harbors truncated proviruses and expresses aberrant forms of the Gag protein. In this study, we demonstrate that the chronically infected SP cell line harbors a relatively low number of proviruses, making it a more promising experimental system for the study of the HTLV-1 particle structure. We first identified the genomic sites of integration and characterized the genetic structure of the gag region in each provirus. We also determined that despite encoding a truncated Gag protein, only the full-length Gag protein was incorporated into virus particles. Cryo-transmission electron microscopy analyses of the purified virus particles revealed three classes of particles based upon capsid core morphology: complete cores, incomplete cores, and particles without distinct electron densities that would correlate with the capsid region of a core structure. Observed cores were generally polygonal, and virus particles were on average 115 nm in diameter. These data corroborate particle morphologies previously observed for MT-2 cells and provide evidence that the known poor infectivity of HTLV-1 particles may correlate with HTLV-1 particle populations containing few virus particles possessing a complete capsid core structure.IMPORTANCE Studies of retroviral particle core morphology have demonstrated a correlation between capsid core stability and the relative infectivity of the virus. In this study, we used cryo-transmission electron microscopy to demonstrate that HTLV-1 particles produced from a distinct chronically infected cell line are polymorphic in nature, with many particles lacking organized electron densities that would correlate with a complete core structure. These findings have important implications for infectious HTLV-1 spread, particularly in the context of cell-to-cell transmission, a critical step in HTLV-1 transmission and pathogenesis.","['Meissner, Morgan E', 'Mendonca, Luiza M', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Mansky, Louis M']","['Meissner ME', 'Mendonca LM', 'Zhang W', 'Mansky LM']",,"['Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Molecular, Cellular, Developmental Biology, and Genetics Graduate Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Basic Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA zhangwei@umn.edu mansky@umn.edu.', 'Division of Basic Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Characterization Facility, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA zhangwei@umn.edu mansky@umn.edu.', 'Division of Basic Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Molecular, Cellular, Developmental Biology, and Genetics Graduate Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA077598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM098550/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI083196/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20170727,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Deltaretrovirus/genetics/*physiology/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Virion/*ultrastructure', '*Virus Integration']",PMC5533927,2017/06/16 06:00,2017/08/10 06:00,['2017/06/16 06:00'],"['2017/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00369-17 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00369-17 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2017 Jul 27;91(16). pii: JVI.00369-17. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00369-17.

Unusual thromboses, embolic events throughout the systemic or pulmonary vasculature, or osseous findings can often be clues to the underlying disease. There is limited literature about the imaging features of these disorders, and this may result in under-diagnosis. Multiple treatments are available for symptom control, and the development of multiple new pharmacological inhibitors has significantly improved morbidity and prognosis.

In the present study, we identified the secondary mutation c.2006C>T in c-KIT exon 14 in a mast cell tumor obtained from a dog carrying c.1663-1671del in exon 11 and showing resistance to imatinib. The mutation in exon 14 resulted in substitution of threonine with isoleucine at position 669, which was located at the center of the ATP binding site as a gatekeeper and played an important role in binding to imatinib. Transfectants were constructed to survey the functions of these mutations in exons 11 and 14. The transfectant with mutant KIT encoded by c-KIT carrying c.1663-1671del showed constitutive ligand-independent phosphorylation that was suppressed by imatinib, indicating a gain-of-function mutation. Furthermore, the transfectant with mutant KIT encoded by c-KIT carrying both c.1663-1671del and c.2006C>T caused ligand-independent phosphorylation, which was not suppressed by imatinib.

Although considered a benign disease, lymphomatoid papulosis has been associated potentially with an increased risk of secondary hematolymphoid malignancies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the clinical characteristics and histologic subtypes of lymphomatoid papulosis, identify the prevalence and types of secondary hematolymphoid malignancies, and determine the potential risk factors for development of these hematolymphoid malignancies. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective chart review was performed for all histologically confirmed cases of lymphomatoid papulosis between 1991 and 2016. RESULTS: Seventy patients with lymphomatoid papulosis were identified. Thirty patients (43%) experienced a secondary hematolymphoid malignancy. Twenty-four (80%) of the hematolymphoid malignancies occurred after the onset of lymphomatoid papulosis. Older age at diagnosis of lymphomatoid papulosis, male sex, histology type B, and the presence of T-cell receptor gene rearrangement are associated with higher risk of developing hematolymphoid malignancy. CONCLUSION: Lymphomatoid papulosis is associated with increased risk of developing secondary hematolymphoid malignancies, particularly mycosis fungoides and cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma.","['AbuHilal, Mohanad', 'Walsh, Scott', 'Shear, Neil']","['AbuHilal M', 'Walsh S', 'Shear N']",,"['1 Division of Dermatology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', '1 Division of Dermatology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', '1 Division of Dermatology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170614,United States,J Cutan Med Surg,Journal of cutaneous medicine and surgery,9614685,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor/genetics', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*epidemiology', 'Lymphomatoid Papulosis/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycosis Fungoides/*epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Skin Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,2017/06/16 06:00,2018/07/12 06:00,['2017/06/16 06:00'],"['2017/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1203475417716366 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cutan Med Surg. 2017 Nov/Dec;21(6):507-512. doi: 10.1177/1203475417716366.

Thiotepa-based conditioning is an emerging radiation-free regimen with recent publications indicative of comparable clinical outcomes to TBI-based conditioning. In this analysis of the acute leukemia working party of the EBMT, we performed a retrospective matched-pair analysis, evaluating the outcome of adult patients with ALL who received thiotepa-based conditioning (n = 180) with those receiving Cy/TBI conditioning (n = 540). The 2-year leukemia-free survival and overall survival (OS) rates of both conditioning regimens were comparable, 33% for thiotepa [95% confidence interval (CI): 26.4-42.8] versus 39% for Cy/TBI (95% CI: 34.8-44.5] (P = .33) and 46.5% [95% CI: 38.6-56.1] versus 48.8% [95% CI: 44.2-54] (P = .9), respectively. There was no significant difference between the two regimens in the incidence of either acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) or chronic GVHD. Multivariate analysis demonstrated increased relapse incidence for thiotepa conditioning compared to Cy/TBI (HR = 1.78, 95% CI, 1.07-2.95; P = .03) which did not affect OS. Our results indicate that thiotepa-based conditioning may not be inferior to Cy/TBI for adult patients with ALL.","['Eder, Sandra', 'Canaani, Jonathan', 'Beohou, Eric', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Sanz, Jaime', 'Arcese, William', 'Or, Reuven', 'Finke, Juergen', 'Cortelezzi, Agostino', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'Passweg, Jakob', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Gurman, Gunhan', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Eder S', 'Canaani J', 'Beohou E', 'Labopin M', 'Sanz J', 'Arcese W', 'Or R', 'Finke J', 'Cortelezzi A', 'Beelen D', 'Passweg J', 'Socie G', 'Gurman G', 'Aljurf M', 'Stelljes M', 'Giebel S', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5294-3524'],"['EBMT Office Paris, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', 'EBMT Office Paris, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'EBMT Office Paris, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Hospital Universitario La Fe, Servicio de Hematologia, Valencia, Spain.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Tor Vergata University of Rome, Policlinico Universitario Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology, Oncology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', ""Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico IRCCS, Milano, Italy."", 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Hematology, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology-BMT, Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France.', 'Transplantation Unit, Department of Hematology Adult Stem Cell, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre, Oncology (Section of Adult Haematolgy/BMT), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'EBMT Office Paris, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology, Gliwice, Poland.', 'EBMT Office Paris, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'EBMT Office Paris, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20170719,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Thiotepa/*administration & dosage', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', '*Whole-Body Irradiation', 'Young Adult']",,2017/06/15 06:00,2017/09/26 06:00,['2017/06/15 06:00'],"['2017/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/06 00:00 [revised]', '2017/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24823 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 Oct;92(10):997-1003. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24823.

Analyzing the spatial distribution of acute leukemia may generate the identification of risk factors. OBJECTIVE: To study the incidence rate of acute leukemia, its geographic distribution, and cluster detection in the metropolitan area of Guadalajara, Mexico. METHODS: We included children under 15 years of age diagnosed with acute leukemia during the period 2010-2014 in the metropolitan area of Guadalajara. Each case was geo-referenced to street level to latitude and longitude coordinates using Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS). Spatial clusters were found in the location of the acute leukemia cases applying the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm with R statistical software. RESULTS: A total of 269 cases of leukemia were registered, 227 (84%) were acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 42 (16%) acute myeloblastic leukemia. The mean age was 6 +/- 4 years. The mean incidence of acute leukemia was 6.44 cases/100,000 inhabitants: El Salto 10.12/100,000, Guadalajara 7.55/100,000, and Tlaquepaque 6.74/100,000. The DBSCAN found three clusters, all located within the municipality of Guadalajara. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of acute leukemia in our population is higher than that in Canada and the USA. We found three spatial clusters of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the municipality of Guadalajara, suggesting the presence of local predisposing factors.","['Tlacuilo-Parra, Alberto', 'Garibaldi-Covarrubias, Roberto', 'Romo-Rubio, Hugo', 'Soto-Sumuano, Leonardo', 'Ruiz-Chavez, Carlos Fernando', 'Suarez-Arredondo, Mijail', 'Sanchez-Zubieta, Fernando', 'Gallegos-Castorena, Sergio']","['Tlacuilo-Parra A', 'Garibaldi-Covarrubias R', 'Romo-Rubio H', 'Soto-Sumuano L', 'Ruiz-Chavez CF', 'Suarez-Arredondo M', 'Sanchez-Zubieta F', 'Gallegos-Castorena S']",,"['Medical Research Division, UMAE Hospital de Pediatria CMNO, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Guadalajara, Jal.

Gene editing holds great potential to precisely correct the underlying genetic cause such that gene expression remains under the endogenous control mechanisms. This has been accomplished to date only in transformed cells or their reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cell counterparts; however, it has not yet been reported in primary patient cells. Here we show the ability to correct a mutation in Fanconi anemia D1 (FANCD1) primary patient fibroblasts. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system was employed to target and correct a FANCD1 gene deletion. Homologous recombination using an oligonucleotide donor was achieved and a pure population of modified cells was obtained by using inhibitors of poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (poly ADP-ribose polymerase). FANCD1 function was restored and we did not observe any promiscuous cutting of the CRISPR/Cas9 at off target sites. This consideration is crucial in the context of the pre-malignant FA phenotype. Altogether we show the ability to correct a patient mutation in primary FANCD1 cells in a precise manner. These proof of principle studies support expanded application of gene editing for FA.","['Skvarova Kramarzova, Karolina', 'Osborn, Mark J', 'Webber, Beau R', 'DeFeo, Anthony P', 'McElroy, Amber N', 'Kim, Chong Jai', 'Tolar, Jakub']","['Skvarova Kramarzova K', 'Osborn MJ', 'Webber BR', 'DeFeo AP', 'McElroy AN', 'Kim CJ', 'Tolar J']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. karolina.skvarova@gmail.com.', 'Childhood Leukemia Investigation Prague (CLIP), Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague 15006, Czech Republic. karolina.skvarova@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. osbor026@umn.edu.', 'Stem Cell Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. osbor026@umn.edu.', 'Center for Genome Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. osbor026@umn.edu.', 'Asan-Minnesota Institute for Innovating Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. osbor026@umn.edu.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. webb0178@umn.edu.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. apdefeo@umn.edu.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. leira001@umn.edu.', 'Asan Institute for Life Sciences, Asan Medical Center, Asan-Minnesota Institute for Innovating Transplantation, Seoul 138-736, Korea. ckim@amc.seoul.kr.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. tolar003@umn.edu.', 'Stem Cell Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. tolar003@umn.edu.', 'Asan-Minnesota Institute for Innovating Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. tolar003@umn.edu.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA065493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR063070/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007062/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000114/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20170614,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (BRCA2 Protein)', '0 (BRCA2 protein, human)', 'Fanconi Anemia, Complementation Group D1']",IM,"['BRCA2 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', '*CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Fanconi Anemia/*genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Editing/*methods', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Humans']",PMC5486091,2017/06/15 06:00,2018/03/20 06:00,['2017/06/15 06:00'],"['2017/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/02 00:00 [revised]', '2017/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms18061269 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms18061269 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2017 Jun 14;18(6). pii: ijms18061269. doi: 10.3390/ijms18061269.,['NOTNLM'],"['CRISPR/Cas9', 'Fanconi anemia', 'Fanconi anemia D1', 'fibroblasts', 'gene editing', 'poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitors']",['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Macrophages play important roles in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. Apoptosis is progressively observed while plaques develop, although the precise mechanisms and outcomes of apoptosis in atherosclerosis development and progression are still contradictory. This study was conducted to explore the effects of simvastatin and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor alpha (RORalpha) ligands on apoptosis in human acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) macrophage cells. METHODS: Briefly, the occupancy of RORalpha in the promoter regions of apoptotic pathway genes was demonstrated in THP-1 cell lines using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis. In order to modulate RORalpha activity, THP-1 macrophage cells were treated with specific ligands (CPG52608 and SR1001) and then viability as well as count of THP-1 macrophage cells were analyzed. RESULTS: We observed that simvastatin and both RORalpha ligands had a tendency to decrease THP-1 macrophage cell viability in culture. When compared with non-treated controls, simvastatin significantly decreased cell viability (p=0.04) and cell count (p=0.03). However, this negative effect of simvastatin seemed to be partly prevented by RORalpha ligands. In addition, bioinformatics analysis of ChIP-on-chip data demonstrated that several genes that are involved in the apoptotic pathway were likely RORalpha target genes. These genes were involved in the regulation of apoptosis through various pathways. CONCLUSION: In summary, our study suggest that simvastatin-mediated macrophage apoptosis might be modulated by SR1001 administration. However, involvement of RORalpha in this modulation through potential apoptotic target genes remains elusive.","['Coban, Neslihan', 'Gulec, Cagri', 'Ozsait Selcuk, Bilge', 'Erginel-Unaltuna, Nihan']","['Coban N', 'Gulec C', 'Ozsait Selcuk B', 'Erginel-Unaltuna N']",,"['Department of Genetics, Institute for Experimental Medicine, Istanbul University; Istanbul-Turkey. neslic@istanbul.edu.tr.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170201,Turkey,Anatol J Cardiol,Anatolian journal of cardiology,101652981,"['0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 1)', '0 (RORA protein, human)', 'AGG2FN16EV (Simvastatin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Coronary Artery Disease/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Macrophages/*drug effects', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 1/*drug effects', 'Simvastatin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'THP-1 Cells/drug effects']",PMC5469082,2017/06/15 06:00,2019/04/19 06:00,['2017/06/15 06:00'],"['2017/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.14744/AnatolJCardiol.2016.7411 [doi]'],ppublish,Anatol J Cardiol. 2017 May;17(5):362-366. doi: 10.14744/AnatolJCardiol.2016.7411.

The aim of this study is characterization of leukemia-associated osteoarthralgia in comparison with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinical records of 31 patients with acute leukemia and 13 patients with articular JIA diagnosed between January 2008 and March 2013. Clinical and laboratory findings at the initial examination were compared among the three groups; 10 leukemia with and 21 leukemia without osteoarthralgia and 13 JIA groups. RESULTS: Eleven of the 31 leukemic patients (35%) had osteoarthralgia before the diagnosis of leukemia. Peripheral leukemic cells were initially absent in 10 of the 31 leukemia patients including three with osteoarthralgia. Platelet counts over 300 x 10(9)/L were common in JIA, but not in osteoarthralgia group. Mean serum lactate dehydrogenase levels were higher in both of the leukemia groups than JIA group but often within normal or near-normal levels in the leukemia groups. Magnetic resonance imaging was examined in three leukemic patients and demonstrated osteomyelitis-like bone marrow edema in two and periarticular infiltration similar to synovitis in one patient. Three leukemic patients with osteoarthralgia showed partial and transient responses to antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Leukemia-associated osteoarthralgia is often indistinguishable from rheumatic diseases by imaging and laboratory findings and should be confirmed by bone marrow examination.","['Tsujioka, Takao', 'Sugiyama, Minako', 'Ueki, Masahiro', 'Tozawa, Yusuke', 'Takezaki, Shunichiro', 'Ohshima, Junjiro', 'Cho, Yuko', 'Yamada, Masafumi', 'Iguchi, Akihiro', 'Kobayashi, Ichiro', 'Ariga, Tadashi']","['Tsujioka T', 'Sugiyama M', 'Ueki M', 'Tozawa Y', 'Takezaki S', 'Ohshima J', 'Cho Y', 'Yamada M', 'Iguchi A', 'Kobayashi I', 'Ariga T']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4956-4010'],"['a Department of Pediatrics , Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine , Sapporo , Japan.', 'a Department of Pediatrics , Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine , Sapporo , Japan.', 'a Department of Pediatrics , Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine , Sapporo , Japan.', 'a Department of Pediatrics , Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine , Sapporo , Japan.', 'a Department of Pediatrics , Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine , Sapporo , Japan.', 'a Department of Pediatrics , Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine , Sapporo , Japan.', 'a Department of Pediatrics , Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine , Sapporo , Japan.', 'a Department of Pediatrics , Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine , Sapporo , Japan.', 'a Department of Pediatrics , Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine , Sapporo , Japan.', 'a Department of Pediatrics , Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine , Sapporo , Japan.', 'b Center for Pediatric Allergy and Rheumatology , KKR Sapporo Medical Center , Sapporo , Japan.', 'a Department of Pediatrics , Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine , Sapporo , Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20170614,England,Mod Rheumatol,Modern rheumatology,100959226,,IM,"['Arthralgia/*diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Arthritis, Juvenile/*diagnostic imaging', 'Bone Marrow/*diagnostic imaging', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Edema/*diagnostic imaging', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/*diagnostic imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods', 'Male', 'Pain/*diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2017/06/15 06:00,2018/07/06 06:00,['2017/06/15 06:00'],"['2017/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14397595.2017.1332474 [doi]'],ppublish,Mod Rheumatol. 2018 Jan;28(1):108-113. doi: 10.1080/14397595.2017.1332474.

Treatment of this group of patients is challenging because they become less tolerant to aggressive chemotherapy with increasing age. Less than one-third of elderly patients are considered eligible for intensive treatment; nevertheless, the survival analysis for this population remains poor. Due to numerous comorbidities and an overall deteriorating condition, most elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia receive only palliative or best supportive care, which are associated with a high mortality rate. New therapeutic approaches are expected to improve the overall survival and quality of life of this group of patients. These promising treatments include cell kinase inhibitors, cytotoxic agents, monoclonal antibodies, and epigenetic therapy including hypomethylating agents and inhibitors of isocitrate dehydrogenase and histone deacetylase. In monotherapy, these new drugs show lower levels of toxicity than those commonly used in chemotherapy; however, they do not lead to a better long-lasting treatment response. To enhance therapeutic efficacy, combinations of the above-mentioned treatments are often used, and, during clinical trials, combinations with standard cytostatics are also common. The promising results of these studies show that even low-toxicity therapies can lead to a better overall treatment response and to longer overall survival. AIM: This article provides a brief overview of new drugs that are evaluated for their mechanism of effect, efficacy and toxicity in therapy of patients suffering from acute myeloid leukemia.Key words: acute myeloid leukemia - elderly - FLT3 inhibitors - epigenetic therapy - monoclonal antibodies The authors declare they have no potential conflicts of interest concerning drugs, products, or services used in the study.

Most of the polymorphisms do not have any implications for the primary structure of the BCR-ABL protein. Nucleotide changes are often located in the area close to the fusion region, and therefore may influence primer annealing. Our previous work failed to amplify 15 of 200 samples from BCR-ABL positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients using multiplex PCR, the standard method to detect BCR-ABL transcripts used in our institution. The failure was considered due to problems in primer annealing caused by sequence variations. Sequence analysis of BCR-ABL fusion gene breakpoint types in CML patients has never been hitherto performed in Indonesia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform sequence analysis of several samples that did not show amplification using the standard method. Methods: Fifteen samples were qualitatively amplified by two-step PCR using inner primers in the 2nd PCR to determine the breakpoint type of the BCR-ABL fusion gene. The 2nd PCR products were used as templates to perform sequence analysis, and the results were compared to those in genbank. Result: Seven and 5 of 15 samples were confirmed as major b3a2 and major b2a2, respectively. One sample featured a combination of b3a2 and b2a2, and 2 samples a combination of b3a2 and b2a2 with an additional fragment at 500bp. Sequence analysis showed 3 sequence variations in the major b3a2 breakpoint. One had been reported earlier (c.3296T>C) but the others (c.3245C>T and c.3359T>C) were novel. Fragments at 500bp were confirmed as b3a2 and similar sequence b3a2 in genbank. Conclusion: This study found two new genetic variations in the BCR gene in BCR-ABL fusion cases.","['Sholikah, Tri Agusti', 'Hutajulu, Susanna Hilda', 'Sulistyawati, Dewi', 'Aning, Sumartiningsih', 'Fatmawati, Sri', 'Syifarahmah, Anditta', 'Widayati, Kartika', 'Kurnianda, Johan', 'Paramita, Dewi Kartikawati']","['Sholikah TA', 'Hutajulu SH', 'Sulistyawati D', 'Aning S', 'Fatmawati S', 'Syifarahmah A', 'Widayati K', 'Kurnianda J', 'Paramita DK']",,"['Biomedical Science Study Program, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.', 'Departement of Histology, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Sebelas Maret, Surakarta, Indonesia.

METHODS: SUP-B15 cell line was treated with PP242, imatinib (IM), or PP242 plus IM for 72 h, IC50 values (the concentration of drug required to kill 50% of the cells) and the combination index (CI ) of synergistic cytotoxicity was determined using MTT methods. The expressions of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and apoptosis associated proteins were examined by Western blot test. RESULTS: The IC50 value of IM alone was (1.50+/-0.09) mumol/L, however, the IC50 values were (0.81+/-0.030) mumol/L, (0.36+/-0.140) mumol/L and (0.02+/-0.002) mumol/L combined with 20 nmol/L, 30 nmol/L and 50 nmol/L of PP242, and the CI values were 0.764, 0.545 and 0.507, indicating two drugs had highly synergistic effect on anti-proliferation in the SUP-B15 cell line. The expressions of p-Akt, p-4EBP1, p-elF4E, p-cAbl, p-mTOR and p-P70 were down-regulated significantly in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner after PP242 treatment#.Compared with PP242 or IM alone, the down-regulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and the up-regulation of the apoptosis associated proteins (bax and cleaved caspase-3) were more significant in the combination of two drugs. CONCLUSION: The combination of IM and PP242 could increase the inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and apoptosis mediated by bax and caspase-3 in SUP-B15 cell line.","['Wu, Jia-Hui', 'Shi, Fang-Fang', 'Gong, Yu-Ping', 'Shi, Rui']","['Wu JH', 'Shi FF', 'Gong YP', 'Shi R']",,"['Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Sichuan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Sichuan da xue xue bao.

It was historically thought to be expressed specifically in germline, but with additional organisms studied, it is now clear that in some animals DDX4/Vasa functions outside of the germline, in a variety of somatic cells in the embryo and in the adult. In this report, we document that DDX4 is widely expressed in soma-derived cancer cell lines, including myeloma (IM-9) and leukemia (THP-1) cells. In these cells, the DDX4 protein localized to the mitotic spindle, consistent with findings in other somatic cell functions, and its knockout in IM-9 cells compromised cell proliferation and migration activities, and downregulated several cell cycle/oncogene factors such as CyclinB and the transcription factor E2F1. These results suggest that DDX4 positively regulates cell cycle progression of diverse somatic-derived blood cancer cells, implying its broad contributions to the cancer cell phenotype and serves as a potential new target for chemotherapy.","['Schudrowitz, Natalie', 'Takagi, Satoshi', 'Wessel, Gary M', 'Yajima, Mamiko']","['Schudrowitz N', 'Takagi S', 'Wessel GM', 'Yajima M']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5613-1005'],"['Department of Molecular Biology, Cellular Biology and Biochemistry, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Cellular Biology and Biochemistry, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Cellular Biology and Biochemistry, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island.']",['eng'],['R01 HD028152/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20170711,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['EC 3.6.1.- (DDX4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Spindle Apparatus/*metabolism']",PMC5543511,2017/06/15 06:00,2017/09/29 06:00,['2017/06/15 06:00'],"['2017/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/31 00:00 [revised]', '2017/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.13299 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2017 Aug;108(8):1612-1619. doi: 10.1111/cas.13299.

Although blast cell counts of <5% on day 14 bone marrow is sensitive in predicting remission on day 28, various studies have found that day 14 bone marrow is highly nonspecific because a large proportion of patients with blast cell counts of >5% on day 14 bone marrow would still attain a complete remission of the disease without any further chemotherapy. Clinical decision based on day 14 bone marrow will result in some of these patients being given a second induction therapy unnecessarily. A second cycle of chemotherapy is associated with not only higher risk for treatment-related mortality but also increased use of hospital resources such as increased intravenous antimicrobials use, longer hospital stay, and higher demand for blood products. In this article, we examined the utility, discussed the shortfalls, and re-appraised the values of day 14 bone marrow in the management of patients with AML. On the basis of our review, we suggest that the practice of day 14 bone marrow examination should be re-evaluated and should probably only be carried out in the setting of clinical trials with clear questions to address its role in predicting outcome of the therapeutic intervention.","['Terry, Christopher M', 'Shallis, Rory M', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Lim, Seah H']","['Terry CM', 'Shallis RM', 'Estey E', 'Lim SH']",,"['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Rhode Island Hospital/Brown University Warren Alpert Medical School, Providence, Rhode Island.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Rhode Island Hospital/Brown University Warren Alpert Medical School, Providence, Rhode Island.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Rhode Island Hospital/Brown University Warren Alpert Medical School, Providence, Rhode Island.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170719,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination/methods', 'Clinical Decision-Making', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Remission Induction', 'Retreatment', 'Time Factors']",,2017/06/15 06:00,2017/09/26 06:00,['2017/06/15 06:00'],"['2017/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2017/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24818 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 Oct;92(10):1079-1084. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24818.

This study aimed to evaluate the relative contribution of patient condition and mutational status in peripheral blood when added to the IPSS-R, for estimating overall survival and the risk of leukemic transformation in patients with MDS. A prospective cohort (2006-2015) of 200 consecutive patients with MDS were included in the study series and categorized according to the IPSS-R. Patients were further stratified according to patient condition (assessed using the multidimensional Lee index for older adults) and genetic mutations (peripheral blood samples screened using next-generation sequencing). The change in likelihood-ratio was tested in Cox models after adding individual covariates. The addition of the Lee index to the IPSS-R significantly improved prediction of overall survival [hazard ratio (HR) 3.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.96-4.66, P < 0.001), and mutational analysis significantly improved prediction of leukemic evolution (HR 2.64, 1.56-4.46, P < 0.001). Non-leukemic death was strongly linked to patient condition (HR 2.71, 1.72-4.25, P < 0.001), but not to IPSS-R score (P = 0.35) or mutational status (P = 0.75). Adjustment for exposure to disease-modifying therapy, evaluated as a time-dependent covariate, had no effect on the proposed model's predictive ability.

Previous reports have shown that the development of peripheral neuropathy caused by anti-neoplastic agents may be a result of reduced axonal transport. Based on evidence from prior studies that the kinesin-5 inhibitor monastrol enhances axonal transport and improves neuronal regeneration, we focused on the neuroprotective role of monastrol during the chemotherapeutic treatment with bortezomib. Prolonged treatment of C57BL/6 mice with bortezomib induced a length-dependent small-fiber neuropathy with axonal atrophy and loss of sensory nerve fibers. The administration of monastrol substantially alleviated morphological features of axonal injury and functional measures of sensory neuropathy. Cytotoxicity studies in leukemia and multiple myeloma cell lines showed no interference of monastrol with the cytostatic effects of bortezomib. Our data indicate that the novel approach of targeting microtubule turnover by monastrol provides protection against bortezomib-induced neurotoxicity. The favorable cytotoxic profile of monastrol makes it an interesting candidate as neuroprotective agent in combined chemotherapy regimens that warrants further consideration.","['Bobylev, Ilja', 'Peters, Dominik', 'Vyas, Maulik', 'Barham, Mohammed', 'Klein, Ines', 'von Strandmann, Elke Pogge', 'Neiss, Wolfram F', 'Lehmann, Helmar C']","['Bobylev I', 'Peters D', 'Vyas M', 'Barham M', 'Klein I', 'von Strandmann EP', 'Neiss WF', 'Lehmann HC']",,"['Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Cologne, Kerpener Str. 62, 50937, Cologne, Germany.', 'Centre for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Radiooncology, Clinic and Policlinic for Radiation Therapy and Radiooncology, University of Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Experimental Tumor Research, Center for Tumor Biology and Immunology, Clinic for Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Philipps University, Marburg, Germany.', 'Department of Anatomy I, Medical Faculty, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Cologne, Kerpener Str. 62, 50937, Cologne, Germany.', 'Centre for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Experimental Tumor Research, Center for Tumor Biology and Immunology, Clinic for Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Philipps University, Marburg, Germany.', 'Department of Anatomy I, Medical Faculty, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Cologne, Kerpener Str. 62, 50937, Cologne, Germany. helmar.lehmann@uk-koeln.de.', 'Centre for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. helmar.lehmann@uk-koeln.de.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170613,United States,Neurotox Res,Neurotoxicity research,100929017,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiones)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '6BSM97YZ8G (monastrol)', 'EC 3.6.4.4 (Kinesins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Axons/drug effects', 'Bortezomib/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Kinesins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microtubules/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neurons/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Peripheral Nervous System/drug effects', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Thiones/*pharmacology']",,2017/06/15 06:00,2018/08/08 06:00,['2017/06/15 06:00'],"['2017/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12640-017-9760-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12640-017-9760-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Neurotox Res. 2017 Nov;32(4):555-562. doi: 10.1007/s12640-017-9760-7.

Three hundred four patients were sequenced for mutations in 54 genes. We used a Cox multivariate model and competing risk analysis with internal and cross validation to identify factors prognostic of overall survival (OS), cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), and non-relapse mortality (NRM). In multivariate analysis, mutated NRAS, U2AF1, IDH2, and TP53 and/or a complex karyotype were significant prognostic markers for OS besides age above 60 years, remission status, IPSS-R cytogenetic risk, HCT-CI > 2 and female donor sex. Mutated NRAS, IDH1, EZH2, and TP53 and/or a complex karyotype were genetic aberrations with prognostic impact on CIR. No molecular markers were associated with the risk of NRM. The inclusion of molecular information results in better risk prediction models for OS and CIR when assessed by the Akaike information criterion. Internal cross validation confirmed the robustness of our comprehensive risk model. In summary, we propose to combine molecular, cytogenetic, and patient- and transplantation-associated risk factors into a comprehensive risk model to provide personalized predictions of outcome after alloHCT.","['Heuser, Michael', 'Gabdoulline, Razif', 'Loffeld, Patrick', 'Dobbernack, Vera', 'Kreimeyer, Henriette', 'Pankratz, Mira', 'Flintrop, Madita', 'Liebich, Alessandro', 'Klesse, Sabrina',

However, reaching this point warrants better characterization of tumor-induced NK cell alterations. Our group recently reported heterogeneous NK maturation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. However, the clinical significance of such observations remained to be assessed on a larger cohort of patients. NK maturation based on expression of CD56, CD57, and KIR was assessed by flow cytometry in newly diagnosed AML patients (N = 87 patients from GOELAMS-LAM-IR-2006 multicenter trial). Clinical outcome was evaluated with regard to NK maturation profiles. Unsupervised integrated analysis of NK maturation markers confirmed the existence of three distinct groups of patients [hypomaturation (24.1%), intermediate maturation (66.7%), and hypermaturation (9.2%)]. In univariate analysis, significant differences in overall survival (OS) (P = 0.0006) and relapse-free survival (RFS) (P < 0.0001) were observed among these different groups. Patients with hypomaturation profile had reduced OS, with 3-year OS rates of 12.5 vs 57.1 and 57.4% for patients with intermediate and hypermaturation, respectively. Consistently, patients with hypomaturation profile had reduced RFS, with 3-year RFS rates of 0 vs 52.6 and 73.3% for patients with intermediate and hypermaturation, respectively. In multivariate Cox regression models, NK hypomaturation remained significantly associated with reduced OS and RFS, independent of other factors [hazard ratio (HR) = 4.15, P = 0.004 and HR = 8.23, P = 0.003, respectively]. NK maturation defects were further explored by mass cytometry and revealed that NK hypomaturation profile is associated with a reduced frequency of memory-like NK cells. In conclusion, besides classical alterations of NK triggering and inhibitory receptors expression in AML, we confirm that the homeostasis of NK maturation can be modified in the context of AML, notably with a deep maturation blockade in almost 10% patients.","['Chretien, Anne-Sophie', 'Fauriat, Cyril', 'Orlanducci, Florence', 'Galseran, Claire', 'Rey, Jerome', 'Bouvier Borg, Gaelle', 'Gautherot, Emmanuel', 'Granjeaud, Samuel', 'Hamel-Broza, Jean-Francois', 'Demerle, Clemence', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Lacombe, Catherine', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre, Pascale', 'Delaunay, Jacques', 'Toubert, Antoine', 'Gregori, Emilie', 'Luche, Herve', 'Malissen, Marie', 'Arnoulet, Christine', 'Nunes, Jacques A', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Olive, Daniel']","['Chretien AS', 'Fauriat C', 'Orlanducci F', 'Galseran C', 'Rey J', 'Bouvier Borg G', 'Gautherot E', 'Granjeaud S', 'Hamel-Broza JF', 'Demerle C', 'Ifrah N', 'Lacombe C', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre P', 'Delaunay J', 'Toubert A', 'Gregori E', 'Luche H', 'Malissen M', 'Arnoulet C', 'Nunes JA', 'Vey N', 'Olive D']",,"['Team Immunity and Cancer, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, U1068;

These results could subsequently be used to infer when the element entered the body. This study was conducted in two parts. First, a method was developed and validated for the elemental analysis of hair by LA-ICP-MS. A calibration strategy in LA-ICP-MS was developed using prepared matrix-matched laboratory hair standards doped with analytes of interest at a defined concentration. The use of hair strand standards enables calibration curves to be obtained by plotting the analyte ion (M(+)) intensity normalized to(34)S(+)(the ratio M(+)/(34)S(+)) as a function of the concentration determined by ICP-MS of the acidic digests. The linear correlation coefficients (R(2)) of the calibration curves for the analytes As and Pb were typically between 0.9970 and 0.9998, respectively. Second, an actual hair was measured using the developed method. The spatial distribution of As along the hair was observed in a hair sample from a leukaemia patient treated with arsenic trioxide (As2O3). The actual and estimated times over which the drug entered the body were compared and discussed.","['Luo, Ruxin', 'Su, Xiaohong', 'Xu, Weicong', 'Zhang, Sujing', 'Zhuo, Xianyi', 'Ma, Dong']","['Luo R', 'Su X', 'Xu W', 'Zhang S', 'Zhuo X', 'Ma D']",,"['Shanghai Key Laboratory of Forensic Medicine, Shanghai Forensic Service Platform, Institute of Forensic Science, Ministry of Justice, P.R.China, Shanghai, 200063, Shanghai, China.', 'Lanzhou Industry Research Institude, Lanzhou, 730000, China.', 'Department of Health Inspection and Quarantine, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University, Key Laboratory of Military Preventive Medicine of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, 510515, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Forensic Medicine, Shanghai Forensic Service Platform, Institute of Forensic Science, Ministry of Justice, P.R.China, Shanghai, 200063, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Forensic Medicine, Shanghai Forensic Service Platform, Institute of Forensic Science, Ministry of Justice, P.R.China, Shanghai, 200063, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Forensic Medicine, Shanghai Forensic Service Platform, Institute of Forensic Science, Ministry of Justice, P.R.China, Shanghai, 200063, Shanghai, China. madong_112@sina.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170613,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['2P299V784P (Lead)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",IM,"['Arsenic/*analysis', 'Female', 'Hair/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Lasers', 'Lead/*analysis', 'Mass Spectrometry/*methods/standards']",PMC5469827,2017/06/15 06:00,2019/01/08 06:00,['2017/06/15 06:00'],"['2016/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-03660-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-03660-6 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Jun 13;7(1):3426. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-03660-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 8;21 chromosomal rearrangement disrupts the key hematopoietic RUNX1 transcription factor, and contributes to leukemia through recruitment of co-repressor complexes to RUNX1 target genes, altered subnuclear localization, and deregulation of the myeloid gene regulatory program. However, a role of non-coding microRNAs (miRs) in t(8;21)-mediated leukemogenesis is minimally understood. We present evidence of an interplay between the tumor suppressor miR-29b-1 and the AML1-ETO (also designated RUNX1-RUNX1T1) oncogene that is encoded by the t(8;21). We find that AML1-ETO and corepressor NCoR co-occupy the miR-29a/b-1 locus and downregulate its expression in leukemia cells. Conversely, re-introduction of miR-29b-1 in leukemia cells expressing AML1-ETO causes significant downregulation at the protein level through direct targeting of the 3' untranslated region of the chimeric transcript. Restoration of miR-29b-1 expression in leukemia cells results in decreased cell growth and increased apoptosis. The AML1-ETO-dependent differentiation block and transcriptional program are partially reversed by miR-29b-1. Our findings establish a novel regulatory circuit between the tumor-suppressive miR-29b-1 and the oncogenic AML1-ETO that controls the leukemic phenotype in t(8;21)-carrying acute myeloid leukemia.","['Zaidi, Sayyed K', 'Perez, Andrew W', 'White, Elizabeth S', 'Lian, Jane B', 'Stein, Janet L', 'Stein, Gary S']","['Zaidi SK', 'Perez AW', 'White ES', 'Lian JB', 'Stein JL', 'Stein GS']",,"['Department of Biochemistry and University of Vermont Cancer Center, The University of Vermont Larner College of Medicine, Burlington, VT, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and University of Vermont Cancer Center, The University of Vermont Larner College of Medicine, Burlington, VT, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and University of Vermont Cancer Center, The University of Vermont Larner College of Medicine, Burlington, VT, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and University of Vermont Cancer Center, The University of Vermont Larner College of Medicine, Burlington, VT, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and University of Vermont Cancer Center, The University of Vermont Larner College of Medicine, Burlington, VT, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA082834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 CA167726/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Co-Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic']",PMC5522207,2017/06/15 06:00,2018/05/16 06:00,['2017/06/15 06:00'],"['2017/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['18127 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.18127 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jun 20;8(25):39994-40005. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.18127.,['NOTNLM'],"['AML1-ETO', 'RUNX', 'leukemia', 'miR-29', 't(8;21)']",,,,,,,['Oncotarget. 2017 Sep 7;8(38):62818-62819.

They have also demonstrated clinical activity in acute myelogenous leukemia, non-small cell lung cancer, and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, and trials are underway assessing their activity in combination regimens including immunotherapy. However, there is currently no clear strategy to reliably predict HDACi sensitivity. In colon cancer cells, apoptotic sensitivity to HDACi is associated with transcriptional induction of multiple immediate-early (IE) genes. Here, we examined whether this transcriptional response predicts HDACi sensitivity across tumor type and investigated the mechanism by which it triggers apoptosis.Experimental Design: Fifty cancer cell lines from diverse tumor types were screened to establish the correlation between apoptotic sensitivity, induction of IE genes, and components of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.Results: We show that sensitivity to HDACi across tumor types is predicted by induction of the IE genes FOS, JUN, and ATF3, but that only ATF3 is required for HDACi-induced apoptosis. We further demonstrate that the proapoptotic function of ATF3 is mediated through direct transcriptional repression of the prosurvival factor BCL-XL (BCL2L1) These findings provided the rationale for dual inhibition of HDAC and BCL-XL, which we show strongly cooperate to overcome inherent resistance to HDACi across diverse tumor cell types.Conclusions: These findings explain the heterogeneous responses of tumor cells to HDACi-induced apoptosis and suggest a framework for predicting response and expanding their therapeutic use in multiple cancer types.

However, molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of JAK2 have remained elusive. Here we report that the Casitas B-cell lymphoma (CBL) family E3 ubiquitin ligases down-regulate JAK2 stability and signaling via the adaptor protein LNK/SH2B3. We demonstrated that depletion of CBL/CBL-B or LNK abrogated JAK2 ubiquitination, extended JAK2 half-life, and enhanced JAK2 signaling and cell growth in human cell lines as well as primary murine HSPCs. Built on these findings, we showed that JAK inhibitor (JAKi) significantly reduced aberrant HSPCs and mitigated leukemia development in a mouse model of aggressive myeloid leukemia driven by loss of Cbl and Cbl-b Importantly, primary human CBL mutated (CBL(mut) ) leukemias exhibited increased JAK2 protein levels and signaling and were hypersensitive to JAKi. Loss-of-function mutations in CBL E3 ubiquitin ligases are found in a wide range of myeloid malignancies, which are diseases without effective treatment options. Hence, our studies reveal a novel signaling axis that regulates JAK2 in normal and malignant HSPCs and suggest new therapeutic strategies for treating CBL(mut) myeloid malignancies.","['Lv, Kaosheng',

METHODS: Abnormal lymphoid cells circulating in peripheral blood in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, B-prolymphocytic leukaemia, hairy cell leukaemia, splenic marginal zone lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, T-prolymphocytic leukaemia, T large granular lymphocytic leukaemia and Sezary syndrome, normal, reactive and blast lymphoid cells were included. From 325 patients, 12 574 cell images were obtained and 2676 features (27 geometric and 2649 related to colour and texture) were extracted and analysed. RESULTS: We analysed the 20 most relevant features for the morphological differentiation of the 12 lymphoid cell groups under study. Most of them showed significant differences: 19 comparing follicular and mantle cells, 18 for blast and reactive cells, 17 for Sezary cells and T prolymphocytes and 16 for B and T prolymphocytes and 16 for villous lymphocytes. Moreover, a total of five quantitative features were significant for the discrimination among reactive and the set of abnormal lymphoid cells included. CONCLUSIONS: Image analysis may assist in quantifying cell morphology turning qualitative data into quantitative values. New cytological variables were established based on geometric and colour/texture features to contribute to a more accurate and objective morphological assessment of lymphoid cells and their association with flow cytometry methods may be interesting to explore in the next future.","['Puigvi, Laura', 'Merino, Anna', 'Alferez, Santiago', 'Acevedo, Andrea', 'Rodellar, Jose']","['Puigvi L', 'Merino A', 'Alferez S', 'Acevedo A', 'Rodellar J']",,"['Biomedical Diagnostic Center, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'CoDAlab, Polytechnic University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Biomedical Diagnostic Center, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'CoDAlab, Polytechnic University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Biomedical Diagnostic Center, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'CoDAlab, Polytechnic University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain.', 'CoDAlab, Polytechnic University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20170613,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,,IM,"['Automation, Laboratory', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Microscopy/*methods', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated', 'Predictive Value of Tests']",,2017/06/15 06:00,2017/12/05 06:00,['2017/06/15 06:00'],"['2017/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/10 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['jclinpath-2017-204389 [pii]', '10.1136/jclinpath-2017-204389 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2017 Dec;70(12):1038-1048. doi: 10.1136/jclinpath-2017-204389.

Although there have been considerable efforts to classify this disease based on high-throughput sequencing techniques, targeted treatments for specific subgroups have been limited. KRAS and BRAF mutations are prevalent genetic alterations in colorectal cancers, and patients with mutations in either of these genes have a worse prognosis and are resistant to anti-EGFR treatments. In this study, we have found that a subgroup of colorectal cancers, defined by having either KRAS or BRAF (KRAS/BRAF) mutations and BCL2L1 (encoding BCL-XL) amplification, can be effectively targeted by simultaneous inhibition of BCL-XL (with ABT-263) and MCL1 (with YM-155). This combination treatment of ABT-263 and YM-155 was shown to have a synergistic effect in vitro as well as in in vivo patient-derived xenograft models. Our data suggest that combined inhibition of BCL-XL and MCL1 provides a promising treatment strategy for this genomically defined colorectal cancer subgroup. Mol Cancer Ther; 16(10); 2178-90.

Emerging evidence indicates that activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway contributes to the development of myeloid neoplasms with del(5q). Whether beta-catenin is a potential therapeutic target for myeloid neoplasms with del(5q) has yet to be evaluated. Here, we report that genetic deletion of a single allele of beta-catenin rescues ineffective hematopoiesis in an Apc haploinsufficient mouse model, which recapitulates several characteristic features of the preleukemic stage of myeloid neoplasms with a -5/del(5q). In addition, loss of a single allele of beta-catenin reversed the defective self-renewal capacity of Apc-haploinsufficient hematopoietic stem cells and reduced the frequency of apoptosis induced by Apc haploinsufficiency. Suppression of beta-catenin by indomethacin or beta-catenin shRNA reduced proliferation and survival of human leukemia cell lines with del(5q) but not of control leukemia cell lines in vitro; beta-catenin inactivation also inhibited leukemia progression in vivo in xenograft mice reconstituted with del(5q) leukemia cell lines. Inhibition of beta-catenin also stunted growth and colony-forming abilities of primary bone marrow cells from del(5q) AML patients in vitro Overall, our data support the idea that beta-catenin could serve as a therapeutic target for the treatment of myeloid neoplasms with del(5q).

They control the process of hematopoiesis by secreting regulatory cytokines and growth factors and by the expression of important cell adhesion molecules for cell-to-cell interactions. This investigation was intended to examine the effect of bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs on the differentiation of HL-60 cells according to morphological evaluation, flow cytometry analysis, and gene expression profile. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The BM-MSCs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). After the third passage, the BM-MSCs were irradiated at 30 Gy. To compare how the HL-60 cells differentiated in groups treated differently, HL-60 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 and supplemented with 10% FBS. The HL-60 cells were seeded into six-well culture plates and treated with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), BM-MSCs, or BM-MSCs in combination with ATRA, while one well remained as untreated HL-60 cells. The expression levels of the granulocyte subset-specific genes in the HL-60 cells were assayed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Our results revealed that BM-MSCs support the granulocytic differentiation of the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, we concluded that BM-MSCs may be an effective resource in reducing or even preventing ATRA's side effects and may promote differentiation for short medication periods. Though BM-MSCs are effective resources, more complementary studies are necessary to improve this differentiation mechanism in clinical cases.","['Nikkhah, Hossein', 'Safarzadeh, Elham', 'Shamsasenjan, Karim', 'Yousefi, Mehdi', 'Lotfinejad, Parisa', 'Talebi, Mehdi', 'Mohammadian, Mozhde', 'Golafshan, Farhoud', 'Movassaghpour, Aliakbar']","['Nikkhah H', 'Safarzadeh E', 'Shamsasenjan K', 'Yousefi M', 'Lotfinejad P', 'Talebi M', 'Mohammadian M', 'Golafshan F', 'Movassaghpour A']",,"['Tabriz University Faculty of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Tabriz University Faculty of Medicine, Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Tabriz University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Immunology, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Tabriz University Faculty of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Tabriz University Faculty of Medicine, Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Tabriz University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Immunology, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Tabriz University Faculty of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Tabriz University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Immunology, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Tabriz University Faculty of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Mazandaran University Faculty of Medicine, Amol Faculty of Paramedical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Hamline University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Biology, Minnesota, USA.', 'Tabriz University Faculty of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170613,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', '*Cell Communication', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Granulocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",PMC5843773,2017/06/15 06:00,2018/08/28 06:00,['2017/06/15 06:00'],"['2017/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.4274/tjh.2016.0498 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2018 Mar 1;35(1):42-48. doi: 10.4274/tjh.2016.0498.

A total of 540 young grass carp (221.83 +/- 0.84 g) were fed six diets containing graded levels of myo-inositol (27.0, 137.9, 286.8, 438.6, 587.7 and 737.3 mg/kg) for 10 weeks. After the growth trial, fish were challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila for 14 days. The results indicated that compared with optimal myo-inositol levels, myo-inositol deficiency (27.0 mg/kg diet): (1) decreased glutathione (GSH) contents and antioxidant enzymes activities, and down-regulated the mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes [not glutathione-S-transferase (gst) p1 and gstp2] and NF-E2-related factor 2 (nrf2), whereas up-regulated the reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) contents, and the mRNA levels of Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1 (keap1) in three intestinal segments of young grass carp (P < 0.05). (2) Up-regulated cysteinyl aspartic acid-protease (caspase)-2, -3, -7, -8, -9, apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (apaf-1), Bcl2-associated X protein (bax), fas ligand (fasl), gen-activated protein kinase (p38mapk) and c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (jnk) mRNA levels, whereas down-regulated B-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2), inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (iap) and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (mcl-1) mRNA levels in three intestinal segments of young grass carp (P < 0.05). (3) Down-regulated mRNA levels of cell cycle proteins cyclin b, cyclin d, cyclin e and E2F transcription factor 4 (e2f4) in three intestinal segments of young grass carp (P < 0.05). (4) Down-regulated the mRNA levels of zonula occludens (zo) 1, zo-2, occludin, claudin-b, -c, -f, -3c, -7a, -7b as well as -11, and up-regulated the mRNA levels of claudin-12, -15a (not -15b) and myosin light chain kinase (mlck) in three intestinal segments of young grass carp (P < 0.05).

Considering that the search for new chemotherapeutic agents is still necessary, the aim of this study was to investigate the cytotoxic mechanisms involved in cell death induced by a synthetic chalcone (A23) on different tumor cells. Chalcone A23 reduced the cell viability of twelve tumor cell lines in a concentration and time dependent manner and it was more cytotoxic against acute leukemia cells. Interestingly, the compound was non cytotoxic to normal cells and non-hemolytic to normal red blood cells. Chalcone A23 decreased the expression of cell proliferation marker KI-67 and blocked the G2/M phase in both K562 and Jurkat cell lines. Cells treated with A23 showed morphological features suggestive of apoptosis, the ""latter pattern"" in agarose gel, the externalization of phosphatidylserine and caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. Chalcone A23 significantly reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and survivin and increased the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, confirming the involvement of the intrinsic pathway. The increased mitochondrial permeability resulted in the release of AIF, cytochrome c and endonuclease G from the mitochondria to the cytosol. In addition, chalcone A23 increased the expression of FasR and induced Bid cleavage, showing the involvement of the extrinsic pathway. Finally, chalcone A23 seems to have a synergic effect with the chemotherapy drugs cytarabine and vincristine. These results suggest that A23 is an interesting compound with strong and selective anti-tumor activity.","['Maioral, Mariana Franzoni', 'Bodack, Camila do Nascimento', 'Stefanes, Natalia Marceli', 'Bigolin, Alisson', 'Mascarello, Alessandra', 'Chiaradia-Delatorre, Louise Domeneghini', 'Yunes, Rosendo Augusto', 'Nunes, Ricardo Jose', 'Santos-Silva, Maria Claudia']","['Maioral MF', 'Bodack CDN', 'Stefanes NM', 'Bigolin A', 'Mascarello A', 'Chiaradia-Delatorre LD', 'Yunes RA', 'Nunes RJ', 'Santos-Silva MC']",,"['Laboratorio de Oncologia Experimental e Hemopatias, Departamento de Analises Clinicas, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Campus Trindade, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Farmacia, Centro de Ciencias da Saude, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, 88040-900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Oncologia Experimental e Hemopatias, Departamento de Analises Clinicas, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Campus Trindade, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Oncologia Experimental e Hemopatias, Departamento de Analises Clinicas, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Campus Trindade, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Farmacia, Centro de Ciencias da Saude, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, 88040-900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Oncologia Experimental e Hemopatias, Departamento de Analises Clinicas, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Campus Trindade, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Farmacia, Centro de Ciencias da Saude, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, 88040-900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio Estrutura e Atividade, Departamento de Quimica, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Campus Trindade, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio Estrutura e Atividade, Departamento de Quimica, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Campus Trindade, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio Estrutura e Atividade, Departamento de Quimica, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Campus Trindade, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio Estrutura e Atividade, Departamento de Quimica, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Campus Trindade, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Oncologia Experimental e Hemopatias, Departamento de Analises Clinicas, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Campus Trindade, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Farmacia, Centro de Ciencias da Saude, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, 88040-900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.

However, people with the sickle cell trait (SCT) carry a single allele of HbS and do not usually suffer from SCD symptoms, thus providing a rationale to treat SCD. METHODS: To validate gene therapy potential, hematopoietic stem cells were isolated from the SCD patient blood and treated with CRISPR/Cas9 approach. To precisely dissect genome-editing effects, erythroid progenitor cells were cloned from single colonies of CRISPR-treated cells and then expanded for simultaneous gene, protein, and cellular function studies. RESULTS: Genotyping and sequencing analysis revealed that the genome-edited erythroid progenitor colonies were converted to SCT genotype from SCD genotype. HPLC protein assays confirmed reinstallation of normal hemoglobin at a similar level with HbS in the cloned genome-edited erythroid progenitor cells. For cell function evaluation, in vitro RBC differentiation of the cloned erythroid progenitor cells was induced. As expected, cell sickling assays indicated function reinstitution of the genome-edited offspring SCD RBCs, which became more resistant to sickling under hypoxia condition. CONCLUSIONS: This study is an exploration of genome editing of SCD HSPCs.","['Wen, Jianguo', 'Tao, Wenjing', 'Hao, Suyang', 'Zu, Youli']","['Wen J', 'Tao W', 'Hao S', 'Zu Y']",,"['Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. yzu@houstonmethodist.org.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170613,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Hemoglobin, Sickle)', '0 (Hemoglobins)']",IM,"['Anemia, Sickle Cell/*genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', '*CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Erythroid Cells/cytology/metabolism/pathology', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Gene Editing/*methods', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Genotype', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Hemoglobin, Sickle/analysis/genetics', 'Hemoglobins/analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Sickle Cell Trait/genetics/pathology']",PMC5470227,2017/06/15 06:00,2018/01/10 06:00,['2017/06/15 06:00'],"['2017/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-017-0489-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-017-0489-9 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2017 Jun 13;10(1):119. doi: 10.1186/s13045-017-0489-9.,['NOTNLM'],"['*CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing', '*Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell colonies', '*Sickle cell disease']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the compound affects the lifespan of yeast and flies it might be an anti-aging substance. Mechanistically, RES is involved in down regulating the inflammatory response. The pleiotropic effects of RES in cells of the immune and endothelial system were examined in this study. RESULTS: Murine macrophages (RAW264.7 cells), human monocytic/leukemia cells (THP-1), PBLs and HUVECs were incubated with RES and activated with inflammatory stimuli such as LPS or TNF-alpha. Inflammatory mediators and adhesion molecules were measured by multiplex analysis and gene expression was quantified by RT-PCR. In PBLs, which were activated with LPS, RES blunted the production of TNF-alpha, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL5/RANTES, CXCL8/IL-8, whereas it increased the production of IL-1beta, IL-6, CCL4/MIP-1beta and CXCL10/IP-10. Thus, in the blood compartment chemokines attracting mainly monocytes were up-regulated by RES, while those attracting T lymphocytes or neutrophils were diminished. At conditions of endothelial dysfunction (ED), RES reduced the expression of cytokines, chemokines, ICAM and GM-CSF in TNF-alpha activated HUVECs, whereas eNOS expression was corrected to pre-ED homeostasis. In macrophages nitric oxide, PGE2, cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6) and chemokines (CCL2/MCP-1, CCL4/MIP-1beta, CCL5/RANTES, CXCL10/IP-10) were reduced by the phenolic substance. CONCLUSIONS: RES had cell-specific and context-dependent effects, in particular on the expression of IL-1beta, IL-6, CCL4/MIP-1beta and CXCL10/IP-10. It enhanced cellular features that mirror increased alertness to disturbed immune homeostasis in the vascular-endothelial compartment (e.g. increased production of IL-1beta or IL-6), whereas it blunted inflammatory mediators in macrophages and consequently chronic inflammation. We infer from the present in vitro study, that RES has unique properties in the regulation of inflammatory and immune responses, which are controlled in a complex hierarchical and temporal order.","['Schwager, Joseph', 'Richard, Nathalie', 'Widmer, Franziska', 'Raederstorff, Daniel']","['Schwager J', 'Richard N', 'Widmer F', 'Raederstorff D']",,"['DSM Nutritional Products Ltd., Department of Human Nutrition & Health, P.O.

Midostaurin combined with chemotherapy followed by single-agent maintenance therapy elicited statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival versus placebo in patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutant acute myeloid leukemia. Although gastrointestinal events were more common with midostaurin, overall the drug was relatively well tolerated. Of note, midostaurin is metabolized by cytochrome P450-3A4 (CYP3A4); therefore, concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be used with caution. Preliminary safety results from an ongoing trial evaluating midostaurin as a single agent in the post-transplant setting are encouraging.

The study aimed to investigate the underlying role of ANRIL in H2O2-induced cell injury of rat PC-12 cells. Cell injury was evaluated on the basis of cell viability, migration, invasion and apoptosis. The effect of ANRIL on H2O2-induced cell injury was estimated after cell transfection. Then, the interaction between ANRIL and miR-125a was explored by qRT-PCR and estimation of cell injury. Predicted by TargetScan, the possible target gene of miR-125a was verified. After that, the effects of aberrantly expressed target gene on cell viability, migration, invasion and apoptosis as well as phosphorylation of key kinases involved in JAK/STAT and ERK/MAPK pathways were evaluated. Results revealed that H2O2-induced PC-12 cell injury could be aggravated by ANRIL suppression. ANRIL appeared to act as a sponge of miR-125a, and ANRIL suppression promoted H2O2-induced cell injury by up-regulation of miR-125a. MCL-1 was a target of miR-125a, and MCL-1 was negatively correlated with miR-125a. Subsequent experiments showed the effect of MCL-1 silence on H2O2-induced PC-12 cell injury was the same as ANIRL suppression. MCL-1 attenuated H2O2-induced PC-12 cell injury by activating JAK/STAT and ERK/MAPK pathways. These findings suggested that knockdown of ANRIL aggravates H2O2-induced injury in PC-12 cells by targeting miR-125a. This might provide novel insights in the role of ANRIL in pathogenesis of oxidative damage during SCI.","['Li, Ran', 'Yin, Fei', 'Guo, Ying-Ying', 'Zhao, Kun-Chi', 'Ruan, Qing', 'Qi, Ying-Mei']","['Li R', 'Yin F', 'Guo YY', 'Zhao KC', 'Ruan Q', 'Qi YM']",,"['Department of Orthopedics, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130033, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130033, China.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130033, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130033, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130033, China.

Here we show, using rigorous, independent animal models, that endogenous MLL1 is dispensable for MLL-rearranged leukemia. Potential redundancy was addressed by co-deleting the closest paralog, Mll2. Surprisingly, Mll2 deletion alone had a significant impact on survival of MLL-AF9-transformed cells, and additional Mll1 loss further reduced viability and proliferation. We show that MLL1/MLL2 collaboration is not through redundancy, but regulation of distinct pathways.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this case report was to see whether very-low-dose methadone (VLDM) (defined as <50% of accepted starting analgesic dose of methadone for children) would be an effective strategy to treat refractory neuropathic pain due to vincristine in two children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: This case report is based on the clinical experience and parent-reported outcomes of two children with refractory neuropathic pain who received VLDM. RESULTS: Based on parent/caregiver-reported outcome scores over a one-year period, both children's refractory neuropathic pain syndrome was successfully treated with the addition of VLDM to their pre-existing regimen of gabapentin. Neither child suffered any adverse effects from methadone.

Congenital and acquired hematopoietic disorders are often diagnosed through the detection of aberrant frequency or composition of hematopoietic cell populations. We here describe a novel protocol, called ""Whole Blood Dissection"" (WBD), capable of analyzing in a single test-tube, hematopoietic progenitors and all major mature cell lineages composing either BM or peripheral blood (PB) through a multiparametric flow-cytometry analysis. WBD allows unambiguously identifying in the same tube up to 23 different blood cell types including HSPC subtypes and all the major myeloid and lymphoid lineage compartments at different stages of maturation, through a combination of 17 surface and 1 viability cell markers. We assessed the efficacy of WBD by analyzing BM and PB samples from adult (n = 8) and pediatric (n = 9) healthy donors highlighting age-related shift in cell composition. We also tested the capability of WBD on detecting aberrant hematopoietic cell composition in clinical samples of patients with primary immunodeficiency or leukemia unveiling expected and novel hematopoietic unbalances. Overall, WBD allows unambiguously identifying >99% of the cell subpopulations composing a blood sample in a reproducible, standardized, cost-, and time-efficient manner. This tool has a wide range of potential pre-clinical and clinical applications going from the characterization of hematopoietic disorders to the monitoring of hematopoietic reconstitution in patients after transplant or gene therapy.

METHODS: TP53 mutation analysis was performed in 164 newly diagnosed adult patients with ALL using a combination of targeted amplicon-based next-generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: TP53 mutations were detected in 25 patients (15%), with a median allelic frequency of 42.2% (range, 5.6%-93.8%). The majority of mutations were single-nucleotide variants of missense type and involved the DNA-binding domain. TP53-mutated (TP53(mut) ) ALL was found to be significantly associated with older age, lower median white blood cell and platelet counts, lower frequency of Philadelphia chromosome and a higher frequency of low hypodiploid karyotype compared with ALL with wild-type TP53 (TP53(wt) ). To evaluate the prognostic effect of TP53 mutations, the authors selected 146 patients with B-cell immunophenotype ALL (24 with TP53(mut) and 122 with TP53(wt) ) who were uniformly treated with frontline hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD)-based regimens; >90% of these individuals also received a monoclonal antibody. Over a median follow-up duration of 15 months, there was no significant difference in the median overall survival, event-free survival, and duration of complete remission noted between patients with TP53(mut) ALL and those with TP53(wt) ALL. CONCLUSIONS: Hyper-CVAD-based regimens appear to negate the poor prognostic impact of TP53 mutations in patients with adult B-cell immunophenotype ALL. Cancer 2017;123:3717-24.

These results are due to a better management and combination of old therapies, refined risk-group stratification and emergence of minimal residual disease (MRD) combined with treatment's intensification for high-risk subgroups. However, the subgroup of patients with refractory/relapsed ALL still presents a dismal prognosis indicating necessity for innovative therapeutic approaches. Areas covered: We performed an exhaustive review of current first-line therapies for childhood ALL in the worldwide main consortia, summarized the major advances for front-line and relapse treatment and highlighted recent and promising innovative therapies with an overview of the most promising ongoing clinical trials. Expert opinion: Two major avenues marked the beginning of 21(st) century. First, is the introduction of tyrosine-kinase inhibitor coupled to chemotherapy for treatment of Philadelphia positive ALL opening new treatment possibilities for the recently identified subgroup of Ph-like ALL. Second, is the breakthrough of immunotherapy, notably CAR T-cell and specific antibody-based therapy, with remarkable success observed in initial studies. This review gives an insight on current knowledge in these innovative therapeutic directions, summarizes currently ongoing clinical trials and addresses challenges these approaches are faced with.","['Santiago, Raoul', 'Vairy, Stephanie', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Krajinovic, Maja', 'Bittencourt, Henrique']","['Santiago R', 'Vairy S', 'Sinnett D', 'Krajinovic M', 'Bittencourt H']",,"['a CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center , Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.', 'b Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine , University of Montreal , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.', 'a CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center , Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.', 'b Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine , University of Montreal , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.', 'a CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center , Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.', 'b Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine , University of Montreal , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.', 'a CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center , Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.', 'b Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine , University of Montreal , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.', 'c Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Faculty of Medicine , University of Montreal , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.', 'a CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center , Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.', 'b Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine , University of Montreal , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170626,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*prevention & control', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology']",,2017/06/14 06:00,2017/11/04 06:00,['2017/06/14 06:00'],"['2017/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/04 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14656566.2017.1340938 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2017 Aug;18(11):1081-1099. doi: 10.1080/14656566.2017.1340938.

However, except for rare examples of lymphoma-specific immunohistochemistry, such as cyclin D1 in mantle cell lymphoma and annexin A1 in hairy cell leukemia, immunohistochemical profiles of mature B-cell lymphomas overlap and lack specificity. OBJECTIVES: - To systemically review immunohistochemical features associated with commonly encountered mature B-cell lymphomas based on the presence or absence of CD5 and CD10; to review the immunophenotypic profile of plasma cells derived from plasma cell myelomas and B-cell lymphomas; and to review a group of rare, aggressive B-cell lymphomas with antigen expression features of plasma cells. DATA SOURCES: - Published and PubMed-indexed English literature was reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: - Although the presence or absence of CD5 and CD10 expression should be included in the initial immunohistochemistry screening panel for mature B-cell lymphomas, appropriate and judicial use of other B-cell antigens is necessary to ensure correct diagnoses. Furthermore, although the status of CD5 and CD10 expression is associated with certain prototypes of B-cell lymphomas, their expression is not specific. Plasma cells from plasma cell neoplasias and B-cell lymphomas exhibit overlapping but relatively distinct immunophenotypes; thus, a panel of immunohistochemical markers (CD19, CD45, CD56, and CD117) can be employed for their proper identification. Lastly, CD138 staining results are almost always positive in a group of aggressive B-cell lymphomas with plasmablastic features, including plasmablastic plasma cell myeloma, plasmablastic lymphoma, and ALK-1(+) large B-cell lymphoma.","['Wang, Huan-You', 'Zu, Youli']","['Wang HY', 'Zu Y']",,,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170613,United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/*methods', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*diagnosis']",,2017/06/14 06:00,2017/10/03 06:00,['2017/06/14 06:00'],"['2017/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.5858/arpa.2016-0521-RA [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2017 Sep;141(9):1236-1246. doi: 10.5858/arpa.2016-0521-RA.

Several hypotheses involve environmental exposures that could implicate spatial clustering of cases. The evidence from previous clustering studies is inconclusive. Most of them used areal data and thus had limited spatial resolution. We investigated whether childhood leukaemia tends to cluster in space using exact geocodes of place of residence both at the time of birth or diagnosis. We included 1,871 leukaemia cases diagnosed between 1985 and 2015 at age 0-15 years from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. For each case, we randomly sampled 10 age and sex matched controls from national censuses closest in time. We used the difference of k-functions, Cuzick-Edwards' test and Tango's index for point data to assess spatial clustering and Kulldorff's circular scan to detect clusters. We separately investigated acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), different age groups at diagnosis (0-4, 5-15 years) and adjusted for multiple testing. After adjusting for multiple testing, we found no evidence of spatial clustering of childhood leukaemia neither around time of birth (p = 0.52) nor diagnosis (p = 0.51). Individual tests indicated spatial clustering for leukaemia diagnosed at age 5-15 years, p k-functions = 0.05 and p Cuzick-Edwards' = 0.04 and a cluster of ALL cases diagnosed at age 0-4 years in a small rural area (p = 0.05). This study provides little evidence of spatial clustering of childhood leukaemia in Switzerland and highlights the importance of accounting for multiple testing in clustering studies.","['Konstantinoudis, Garyfallos', 'Kreis, Christian', 'Ammann, Roland A', 'Niggli, Felix', 'Kuehni, Claudia E', 'Spycher, Ben D']","['Konstantinoudis G', 'Kreis C', 'Ammann RA', 'Niggli F', 'Kuehni CE', 'Spycher BD']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7493-9334', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1430-5695']","['Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), Faculty of Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), Faculty of Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Paediatrics Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland.', ""Department of Oncology, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Switzerland."", 'Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), Faculty of Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), Faculty of Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170630,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Space-Time Clustering', 'Switzerland/epidemiology']",,2017/06/14 06:00,2017/09/28 06:00,['2017/06/14 06:00'],"['2017/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.30832 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2017 Oct 1;141(7):1324-1332. doi: 10.1002/ijc.30832.

The study aims to reconstruct the subjective meaning-making process related to CML in order to gain insights into the impact the disease has on patients' emotions and everyday lives, as well as to explore the psychological impact of their being presented with the chance to suspend their therapy and recover from the disease. METHODS: Data were gathered from a qualitative study conducted in Italy on 158 Italian CML patients. Basing the study on the narrative inquiry approach, the patients were required to describe their patient journey in a qualitative narrative diary. These contained prompts to elicit the free expression of their needs, expectations, and priorities. A lexicographic analysis was carried out with T-LAB software and in particular a thematic analysis of elementary contexts (TAECs) and a word association analysis (WAA). RESULTS: The TAEC detected four thematic clusters related to two factors (temporal frame and contextual setting) that explained the variance among the narratives. The WAA evidenced a wide variety of emotions, both positive and negative, as patients reacted to the possibility of interrupting their therapy. CONCLUSIONS: A better understanding of patients' experiences can offer insights into promoting the development of more sustainable healthcare services and into therapeutic innovation aimed at improving patients' quality of life and at engaging them more in their treatment. The findings of this study can also help make medical professionals more aware of the patient's burden and help them identify potential interactions and emotional levers to improve clinical relationships.","['Graffigna, G', 'Cecchini, I', 'Breccia, M', 'Capochiani, E', 'Della Seta, R', 'Galimberti, S', 'Melosi, A', 'Simonetti, F', 'Pizzuti, M', 'Capalbo, S F', 'Falzetti, F', 'Mazza, P', 'Di Renzo, N', 'Mastrullo, L', 'Rapezzi, D', 'Orlandi, E', 'Intermesoli, T', 'Iurlo, A', 'Pungolino, E', 'Pacilli, M']","['Graffigna G', 'Cecchini I', 'Breccia M', 'Capochiani E', 'Della Seta R', 'Galimberti S', 'Melosi A', 'Simonetti F', 'Pizzuti M', 'Capalbo SF', 'Falzetti F', 'Mazza P', 'Di Renzo N', 'Mastrullo L', 'Rapezzi D', 'Orlandi E', 'Intermesoli T', 'Iurlo A', 'Pungolino E', 'Pacilli M']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4378-7467'],"['Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Milan, Italy.

However, the mechanisms responsible for the appearance of symptoms have not been fully clarified. It is believed that viral factors, host genetic and epigenetic mechanisms are implicated in this process. Studies have shown the involvement of histone methyltransferases in retrovirus infection, but no study observed their expression in HTLV-1-infected patients. Among them, euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase (EHMT)-1 and EHMT-2 were related to retroviral latency in HIV-1 infection. We investigated whether histone methyltransferases EHMT1 and EHMT2 exert any influence on HAM/TSP development by assessing their expression levels in CD4(+) T-cells from HTLV-1-infected patients. CD4(+) T-cells were immunomagnetically isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HTLV-1-infected or non-infected individuals and the expression levels of EHMT1 and EHMT2 were determined by RT-qPCR. We observed that EHMT2 was negatively regulated in HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers compared to non-infected individuals. No difference was observed for EHMT1. These results suggest that EHMT2 downregulation in CD4(+) T-cells may be linked to a protection mechanism against the development of HAM/TSP.","['Colaco, Camila Schoueri', 'de Matos, Adriano Reis', 'Estrela, Martha Silva', 'Rocha-Junior, Mauricio Cristiano', 'Otaguiri, Katia Kaori', 'Rodrigues, Evandra Strazza', 'Takayanagui, Osvaldo Massaiti', 'Covas, Dimas Tadeu', 'Kashima, Simone', 'Pittella Silva, Fabio', 'Haddad, Rodrigo']","['Colaco CS', 'de Matos AR', 'Estrela MS', 'Rocha-Junior MC', 'Otaguiri KK', 'Rodrigues ES', 'Takayanagui OM', 'Covas DT', 'Kashima S', 'Pittella Silva F', 'Haddad R']",,"['Laboratory of Molecular Pathology of Cancer, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Brasilia - UnB, Brasilia, Federal District, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology of Cancer, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Brasilia - UnB, Brasilia, Federal District, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology of Cancer, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Brasilia - UnB, Brasilia, Federal District, Brazil.', 'Hemotherapy Center of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo - USP, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hemotherapy Center of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo - USP, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hemotherapy Center of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo - USP, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo - USP, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hemotherapy Center of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo - USP, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hemotherapy Center of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo - USP, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology of Cancer, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Brasilia - UnB, Brasilia, Federal District, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology of Cancer, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Brasilia - UnB, Brasilia, Federal District, Brazil. haddad@unb.br.', 'Tropical Medicine Unit, University of Brasilia - UnB, Brasilia, Federal District, Brazil. haddad@unb.br.', 'Faculty of Ceilandia, University of Brasilia - UnB, Brasilia, Federal District, Brazil. haddad@unb.br.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170612,Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (EHMT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EHMT2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/*metabolism', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*genetics/*virology']",,2017/06/14 06:00,2018/04/03 06:00,['2017/06/14 06:00'],"['2017/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00705-017-3428-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00705-017-3428-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Virol. 2017 Oct;162(10):3131-3136. doi: 10.1007/s00705-017-3428-8.

Although significant progress has been made in treating many types of cancers during recent years, AML remains a deadly disease with survival rate lagging behind other blood cancers. A combination of toxic chemotherapies has been the standard AML treatment for more than 40 years. With intensive efforts to define the pathogenesis of AML, novel therapeutic drugs targeting key molecular defects in AML are being developed. Mutated in nearly 30% of AML, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) represents one of the most attractive targets. FLT3 mutants resulted from either internal tandem duplication (ITD) or point mutations possess enhanced kinase activity and cause constitutive activation of signaling. To date, several small molecule inhibitors of FLT3 have been developed but their clinical efficacy is limited due to a lack of potency and the generation of drug resistance. Therefore, next-generation FLT3 inhibitors overcoming these limitations are urgently in need. This review focuses on the pathological role of mutant FLT3 in the development of AML, the current status of FLT3 inhibitor development, and mechanisms underlining the development of resistance to existing FLT3 inhibitors.","['Chen, Yun', 'Pan, Yihang', 'Guo, Yao', 'Zhao, Wanke', 'Ho, Wanting Tina', 'Wang, Jianlong', 'Xu, Mingjiang', 'Yang, Feng-Chun', 'Zhao, Zhizhuang Joe']","['Chen Y', 'Pan Y', 'Guo Y', 'Zhao W', 'Ho WT', 'Wang J', 'Xu M', 'Yang FC', 'Zhao ZJ']",,"['Department of Pathology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.', 'The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen 518107, China.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental and Regenerative Biology, Black Family Stem Cell Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170602,China,Stem Cell Investig,Stem cell investigation,101672113,,,,PMC5460107,2017/06/14 06:00,2017/06/14 06:01,['2017/06/14 06:00'],"['2017/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/sci.2017.05.04 [doi]', 'sci-04-2017.05.04 [pii]']",epublish,Stem Cell Investig. 2017 Jun 2;4:48. doi: 10.21037/sci.2017.05.04. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)', 'Leukemia', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)']",['Conflicts of Interest: The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, this beneficial effect of ATG coincides with its detrimental effect on immune reconstitution. The latter directly relates to a high incidence of viral infections and leukemia relapses. ATG has been used in transplant patients for over 30 years. In recent years, the knowledge on the mechanisms of action of ATG and its implementation in the UCBT setting has increased dramatically.

It can be an important manifestation of severe diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in neonates or bowel wall rupture in older children. However, there are many other diseases presenting with HPVG that do not necessarily require a surgical intervention. CASE REPORT: In the period between 2011-2015, there were 12 cases of HPVG in children aged up to 24 months in our hospital. We did not include children with NEC. We retrospectively analyzed clinical data and US examinations as regards the suspected causes and final diagnoses. Only 1 patient with HPVG required an immediate surgical intervention. This was - a 4-month-old girl 32 days after a repair of a congenital diaphragmatic hernia, with ultrasound signs of acute bowel wall necrosis. During surgery a bowel strangulation was revealed. Other causes included: - 4 patients with bowel inflammation (including complications of neoplastic diseases such as leukemia and Hodgkins'disease); - 3 patients with food allergy; - 1 patient with acute gastroenteritis; - 1 patient with hepatic injury because of a suspected metabolic disease; - 1 incidental finding revealed before closing a ventricular septum defect; - 1 patient during follow-up performed 2 weeks after a reconstruction of bowel continuity. CONCLUSIONS: HPVG is not always a sign of a life-threatening condition and it should not be by itself an indication for surgical treatment. HPVG requires a close monitoring of the clinical status, which is crucial for further management. In patients in non-severe clinical condition, we propose to perform a follow-up ultrasound imaging within 1-2 days, and not to extend diagnostic procedures, especially in case of ultrasound picture normalization. An abdominal ultrasound examination appears to be the method of choice for the identification of gas in the hepatic portal system in children.","['Barczuk-Falecka, Marzena', 'Bombinski, Przemyslaw', 'Majkowska, Zofia', 'Brzewski, Michal', 'Warchol, Stanislaw']","['Barczuk-Falecka M', 'Bombinski P', 'Majkowska Z', 'Brzewski M', 'Warchol S']",,"['Department of Pediatric Radiology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Radiology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Radiology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Radiology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery and Urology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20170519,Poland,Pol J Radiol,Polish journal of radiology,101175532,,,,PMC5445907,2017/06/14 06:00,2017/06/14 06:01,['2017/06/14 06:00'],"['2016/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.12659/PJR.899995 [doi]', '899995 [pii]']",epublish,Pol J Radiol. 2017 May 19;82:275-278. doi: 10.12659/PJR.899995. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['Enterocolitis, Necrotizing', 'Gastroenterology', 'Portal Vein']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibitors of CDK4 and CDK6 are currently being tested in clinical trials for patients with several cancer types, with promising results. Here, using human cancer cells and patient-derived xenografts in mice, we show that the cyclin D3-CDK6 kinase phosphorylates and inhibits the catalytic activity of two key enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, 6-phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase M2. This re-directs the glycolytic intermediates into the pentose phosphate (PPP) and serine pathways. Inhibition of cyclin D3-CDK6 in tumour cells reduces flow through the PPP and serine pathways, thereby depleting the antioxidants NADPH and glutathione. This, in turn, increases the levels of reactive oxygen species and causes apoptosis of tumour cells. The pro-survival function of cyclin D-associated kinase operates in tumours expressing high levels of cyclin D3-CDK6 complexes. We propose that measuring the levels of cyclin D3-CDK6 in human cancers might help to identify tumour subsets that undergo cell death and tumour regression upon inhibition of CDK4 and CDK6. Cyclin D3-CDK6, through its ability to link cell cycle and cell metabolism, represents a particularly powerful oncoprotein that affects cancer cells at several levels, and this property can be exploited for anti-cancer therapy.","['Wang, Haizhen', 'Nicolay, Brandon N', 'Chick, Joel M', 'Gao, Xueliang', 'Geng, Yan', 'Ren, Hong', 'Gao, Hui', 'Yang, Guizhi', 'Williams, Juliet A', 'Suski, Jan

Efforts to target CD33 therapeutically have focused on gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO; Mylotarg), an antibody-drug conjugate delivering a DNA-damaging calicheamicin derivative. GO is most effective in acute promyelocytic leukemia but induces remissions in other AML types and received accelerated approval in the US in 2000. However, because a large follow-up study showed no survival improvement and increased early deaths the drug manufacturer voluntarily withdrew the US New Drug Application in 2010. More recently, a meta-analysis of data from several trials reported better survival in adults with favorable- and intermediate-risk cytogenetics but not adverse-risk AML randomized to receive GO along with intensive induction chemotherapy. As a result, GO is being re-evaluated by regulatory agencies. Responses to GO are diverse and predictive biological response markers are needed. Besides cytogenetic risk, ATP-binding cassette transporter activity and possibly CD33 display on AML blasts may predict response, but established clinical assays and prospective validation are lacking. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in CD33 may also be predictive, most notably rs12459419 where the minor T-allele leads to decreased display of full-length CD33 and preferential translation of a splice variant not recognized by GO. Data from retrospective analyses suggest only patients with the rs12459419 CC genotype may benefit from GO therapy but confirmation is needed. Most important may be markers for AML cell sensitivity to calicheamicin, which varies over 100 000-fold, but useful assays are unavailable. Novel CD33-targeted drugs may overcome some of GO's limitations but it is currently unknown whether such drugs will be more effective in patients benefitting from GO and/or improve outcomes in patients not benefitting from GO, and what the supportive care requirements will be to enable their safe use.","['Godwin, C D', 'Gale, R P', 'Walter, R B']","['Godwin CD', 'Gale RP', 'Walter RB']",,"['Hematology/Oncology Fellowship Program, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Experimental Medicine, Department of Medicine, Haematology Research Centre, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],['T32 HL007093/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170613,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Aminoglycosides/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/drug effects']",,2017/06/14 06:00,2017/09/29 06:00,['2017/06/14 06:00'],"['2017/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/26 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017187 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.187 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Sep;31(9):1855-1868. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.187.

In this prospective, phase 2 Italian study, CMML patients received intravenous decitabine 20 mg/m(2) per day on Days 1-5 of a 28-day treatment cycle. Response was evaluated after four and six cycles; patients responding at the end of six cycles could continue treatment with decitabine. Forty-three patients were enrolled; >50% were high-risk according to four CMML-specific scoring systems. In the intent-to-treat population (n=42), the overall response rate after six cycles was 47.6%, with seven complete responses (16.6%), eight marrow responses (19%), one partial response (2.4%) and four hematological improvements (9.5%).

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that enable such plasticity to occur. Here, we describe the function of the plant homeodomain finger protein 6 (PHF6) in leukemia and define its role in regulating chromatin accessibility to lineage-specific transcription factors. We show that loss of Phf6 in B-cell leukemia results in systematic changes in gene expression via alteration of the chromatin landscape at the transcriptional start sites of B-cell- and T-cell-specific factors. Additionally, Phf6(KO) cells show significant down-regulation of genes involved in the development and function of normal B cells, show up-regulation of genes involved in T-cell signaling, and give rise to mixed-lineage lymphoma in vivo. Engagement of divergent transcriptional programs results in phenotypic plasticity that leads to altered disease presentation in vivo, tolerance of aberrant oncogenic signaling, and differential sensitivity to frontline and targeted therapies. These findings suggest that active maintenance of a precise chromatin landscape is essential for sustaining proper leukemia cell identity and that loss of a single factor (PHF6) can cause focal changes in chromatin accessibility and nucleosome positioning that render cells susceptible to lineage transition.","['Soto-Feliciano, Yadira M', 'Bartlebaugh, Jordan M E', 'Liu, Yunpeng', 'Sanchez-Rivera, Francisco J', 'Bhutkar, Arjun', 'Weintraub, Abraham S', 'Buenrostro, Jason D', 'Cheng, Christine S', 'Regev, Aviv', 'Jacks, Tyler E', 'Young, Richard A', 'Hemann, Michael T']","['Soto-Feliciano YM', 'Bartlebaugh JME', 'Liu Y', 'Sanchez-Rivera FJ', 'Bhutkar A', 'Weintraub AS', 'Buenrostro JD', 'Cheng CS', 'Regev A', 'Jacks TE', 'Young RA', 'Hemann MT']",,"['David H.

Current advances in AML research yield important insights regarding AML genetic, epigenetic, evolutional, and clinical diversity, all in which dysfunctional p53 plays a key role. As p53 is central to hematopoietic stem cell functions, its aberrations affect AML evolution, biology, and therapy response and usually predict poor prognosis. While in human solid tumors TP53 is mutated in more than half of cases, TP53 mutations occur in less than one tenth of de novo AML cases. Nevertheless, wild-type (wt) p53 dysfunction due to nonmutational p53 abnormalities appears to be rather frequent in various AML entities, bearing, presumably, a greater impact than is currently appreciated. Hereby, we advocate assessment of adult AML with respect to coexisting p53 alterations. Accordingly, we focus not only on the effects of mutant p53 oncogenic gain of function but also on the mechanisms underlying nonmutational wtp53 inactivation, which might be of therapeutic relevance. Patient-specific TP53 genotyping with functional evaluation of p53 protein may contribute significantly to the precise assessment of p53 status in AML, thus leading to the tailoring of a rationalized and precision p53-based therapy. The resolution of the mechanisms underlying p53 dysfunction will better address the p53-targeted therapies that are currently considered for AML. Additionally, a suggested novel algorithm for p53-based diagnostic workup in AML is presented, aiming at facilitating the p53-based therapeutic choices.","['Prokocimer, Miron', 'Molchadsky, Alina', 'Rotter, Varda']","['Prokocimer M', 'Molchadsky A', 'Rotter V']",,"['Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel; and.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170612,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Genomic Instability/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Karyopherins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', '*Mutation/drug effects', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Protein Interaction Maps/drug effects', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis/*genetics/*metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism']",PMC5659817,2017/06/14 06:00,2017/08/16 06:00,['2017/06/14 06:00'],"['2017/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33107-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-02-763086 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Aug 10;130(6):699-712. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-02-763086.

All the patients were analyzed before, during, and after the administration of L-AMB, and renal injury was graded according to the RIFLE criteria (risk, injury, failure, loss of function, end-stage renal disease). Most patients (87.3%) received L-AMB at 3 mg/kg of body weight/day. Nearly two-thirds (61.7%) of the treatment courses did not meet any RIFLE category for renal injury, while 19.4% of patients were classified at risk, 13.6% met an injury classification, and 5.8% were categorized as developing renal failure. However, 15% of the patients developed renal injury within 48 h of the onset of multiorgan failure associated with sepsis, bleeding, or progressing malignancy. When these patients were analyzed as a competing risk for L-AMB-associated renal injury (RIFLE category I or above) in a multivariate Cox regression model, receipt of cyclosporine (subhazard ratio [SHR], 2.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10 to 6.27; P = 0.03), cyclosporine plus furosemide at >/=40 mg/day (SHR, 5.46; 95% CI, 1.89 to 15.74; P = 0.002), or cyclosporine plus foscarnet (SHR, 9.03; 95% CI, 3.68 to 22.14; P < 0.0001) were the only comedications significantly associated with increased rates of renal injury. The cumulative incidence of L-AMB renal injury during the first 10 days of therapy was 7% overall but only 3% in patients who were not receiving cyclosporine. Hence, the renal risk of L-AMB therapy may be lessened if patients are switched to alternative agents after 7 to 10 days or if aggressive diuresis and/or foscarnet is avoided, especially among patients receiving calcineurin inhibitors.","['Stanzani, Marta', 'Vianelli, Nicola', 'Cavo, Michele', 'Maritati, Alessandro', 'Morotti, Marta', 'Lewis, Russell E']","['Stanzani M', 'Vianelli N', 'Cavo M', 'Maritati A', 'Morotti M', 'Lewis RE']",,"[""Institute of Hematology Lorenzo e Ariosto Seragnoli, Department of Medicine and Experimental Hematology, Policlinico Sant'Orsola-Malpighi, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy."", ""Institute of Hematology Lorenzo e Ariosto Seragnoli, Department of Medicine and Experimental Hematology, Policlinico Sant'Orsola-Malpighi, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy."", ""Institute of Hematology Lorenzo e Ariosto Seragnoli, Department of Medicine and Experimental Hematology, Policlinico Sant'Orsola-Malpighi, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy."", ""Institute of Hematology Lorenzo e Ariosto Seragnoli, Department of Medicine and Experimental Hematology, Policlinico Sant'Orsola-Malpighi, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy."", ""Clinical Pharmacy, Policlinico Sant'Orsola-Malpighi, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy."", ""Unit of Infectious Diseases, Policlinico Sant'Orsola-Malpighi, Department of Medical Sciences and Surgery, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy russeledward.lewis@unibo.it.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170824,United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (liposomal amphotericin B)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/*chemically induced', 'Adult', 'Amphotericin B/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney/drug effects/physiology', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC5571305,2017/06/14 06:00,2018/05/16 06:00,['2017/06/14 06:00'],"['2016/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['AAC.02651-16 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.02651-16 [doi]']",epublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2017 Aug 24;61(9). pii: AAC.02651-16. doi: 10.1128/AAC.02651-16.

However, patients managed in community settings might not have access to the methods used in the COMFORT trials. In this exploratory analysis we summarize efficacy findings of COMFORT-I using practical, community-oriented measures of patient outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this post hoc analysis of data from COMFORT-I we evaluated changes from baseline to week 12 in spleen size (palpable length and volume), patient-reported outcomes (Patient Global Impression of Change; Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form; Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement System Fatigue Scale), body weight, and serum albumin levels in 5 subgroups of ruxolitinib-treated patients on the basis of week 12 spleen length changes from baseline: (1-4) >/= 50%, 25% to < 50%, 10% to < 25%, or < 10% reduction; and (5) worsening. OS was evaluated in ruxolitinib-treated patients with week 12 spleen length reductions from baseline >/= 50%, 25% to < 50%, or < 25% (including worsening). RESULTS: In all spleen length subgroups, including patients with worsening spleen length at week 12, ruxolitinib (n = 150) was associated with improvements in spleen volume, patient-reported symptom burden, body weight, and serum albumin levels. Greater reductions in spleen length were associated with prolonged OS. CONCLUSION: A variety of assessment methods beyond palpable spleen length that are easily accessible in the community setting might be useful in evaluating the clinical benefit of ruxolitinib over time in patients with MF.","['Miller, Carole B', 'Komrokji, Rami S', 'Mesa, Ruben A', 'Sun, William', 'Montgomery, Michael', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Miller CB', 'Komrokji RS', 'Mesa RA', 'Sun W', 'Montgomery M', 'Verstovsek S']",,"['Saint Agnes Cancer Institute, Baltimore, MD.

OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that subjects with PIDD would have an increased incidence of cancer due to impaired immune function. METHODS: Overall and site-specific cancer incidence rates were evaluated in subjects with PIDD (n = 3658) enrolled in the USIDNET registry from 2003 to 2015 and compared with age-adjusted incidence rates in the SEER database. RESULTS: We observed a 1.42-fold excess relative risk of cancer in subjects with PIDD compared with the age-adjusted SEER population (P < .001). Men with PIDD had a 1.91-fold excess relative risk of cancer compared with the age-adjusted male population (P < .001), while women with PIDD had similar overall cancer rates compared with the age-adjusted female population. Of the 4 most common malignancies in men and women in SEER (lung, colon, breast, and prostate cancers), we found no significant increase in these diagnoses in subjects with PIDD. Significant increases in lymphoma in both men (10-fold increase, P < .001) and women (8.34-fold increase, P < .001) with PIDD were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Excess incidence of cancer occurred in subjects with PIDD. An excess of lymphoma in specific PIDD populations principally drove this increased incidence, while no increased risk of the most common solid tumor malignancies was observed.

METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR analyses were performed to assess the expression levels of beta-integrin family members in bone marrow samples from 22 children with newly-diagnosed T-ALL and 21 controls (16 children with non-malignant hematologic disease and 5 healthy donors with bone marrow transplantation). Jurkat cells were treated with integrin inhibitor arginine-glycine-aspartate (Arg-Gly-Asp, RGD) peptide. The cell viability and apoptosis rate were determined by CCK8 assay and flow cytometry respectively. RESULTS: The mRNA levels of integrins beta2, beta3, and beta5 were significantly lower in children with T-ALL than in controls (P<0.05). In T-ALL patients, high integrin beta3 expression was associated with lower white blood cell counts (<100x10(9)/L), minimal residual disease (MRD) positivity, and day 33 bone marrow negative remission (P<0.05). In T-ALL patients, higher integrin beta5 expression was associated with relapse of T-ALL (P<0.05). Based on survival curve analysis, higher integrin beta3 expression was related to lower event-free survival and overall survival rates. RGD peptide treatment inhibited the proliferation of Jurkat cells and increased their apoptosis rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: beta-Integrin may play a role in the occurrence and development of T-ALL by affecting cell proliferation and apoptosis. The expression of integrin beta5 is closely related to the risk of relapse of T-ALL. The expression of integrin beta3 is closely related the treatment response and prognosis of T-ALL.","['Kong, Qing-Lin', 'An, Xi-Zhou', 'Guan, Xian-Min', 'Ma, Yi-Mei', 'Li, Peng-Fei', 'Liang, Shao-Yan', 'Hu, Yan-Ni', 'Cui, Ying-Hui', 'Yu, Jie']","['Kong QL', 'An XZ', 'Guan XM', 'Ma YM', 'Li PF', 'Liang SY', 'Hu YN', 'Cui YH', 'Yu J']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University/Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders/Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics/China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders, Chongqing, China. 1808106657@qq.com.""]",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,"['0 (Integrin beta Chains)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta Chains/genetics/*physiology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Male', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/metabolism/*mortality', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",PMC7390291,2017/06/14 06:00,2017/09/01 06:00,['2017/06/14 06:00'],"['2017/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2017.06.003 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2017 Jun;19(6):620-626.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 86 newly diagnosed ALL children and adolescents over 10 years of age (62 cases of B-ALL and 24 cases of T-ALL) were enrolled. Clinical characteristics, therapeutic effect and prognostic factors were retrospectively analyzed. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic factors were evaluated by COX regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 86 patients, 62 were in medium risk, and 24 in high risk. At diagnosis, 53 patients (62%) had hepatomegaly, 50 patients (58%) had splenomegaly, and 46 patients (54%) had lymphoadenopathy. Twenty-nine patients (34%) showed high leukocyte counts (>/=50x10(9)/L) at diagnosis. The karyotype analysis was performed on 78 patients. The percentage of hyperdiploidy was 19% (15 cases), and that of hypodiploidy was 5% (4 cases). Eleven patients (14%) had abnormalities of chromosome structure. Of them, one patient was Philadelphia chromosome-positive, and another patient had the t (1; 19) chromosomal translocation. Three patients (4%) were positive for TEL/AML1, 3 (4%) were positive for E2A/PBX1, 6 were positive for BCR/ABL (7%), and 4 (5%) were positive for SIL/TAL1. During 4 weeks of induction therapy, 85 patients (99%) achieved complete remission (CR). In 86 patients, the 5-year anticipated EFS and OS were (64+/-6)% and (75+/-5)% respectively. The 5-year EFS and OS in the medium risk group were significantly higher than those in the high risk group (P<0.05). The 5-year EFS in B-ALL patients was significantly higher than that in T-ALL patients (P<0.05). COX multivariate analysis showed that white blood counts at diagnosis and minimal residual disease (MRD) after induction therapy were independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents with ALL over 10 years of age often have clinical characteristics of unfavorable prognosis. White blood counts at diagnosis and MRD after induction therapy may be important factors for the long-term prognosis.","['Wu, Jun', 'Lu, Ai-Dong', 'Zhang, Le-Ping']","['Wu J', 'Lu AD', 'Zhang LP']",,"[""Department of Pediatrics, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China. zhangleping@pkuph.edu.cn.""]",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models']",PMC7390288,2017/06/14 06:00,2017/09/01 06:00,['2017/06/14 06:00'],"['2017/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2017.06.002 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2017 Jun;19(6):614-619.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, the degree to which germline, or inherited, variation contributes to tumorigenesis remains unclear, possibly due to a lack of accessible germline variant data. Here we called germline variants on 9618 cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database representing 31 cancer types. RESULTS: We identified batch effects affecting loss of function (LOF) variant calls that can be traced back to differences in the way the sequence data were generated both within and across cancer types. Overall, LOF indel calls were more sensitive to technical artifacts than LOF Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV) calls. In particular, whole genome amplification of DNA prior to sequencing led to an artificially increased burden of LOF indel calls, which confounded association analyses relating germline variants to tumor type despite stringent indel filtering strategies. The samples affected by these technical artifacts include all acute myeloid leukemia and practically all ovarian cancer samples. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate how technical artifacts induced by whole genome amplification of DNA can lead to false positive germline-tumor type associations and suggest TCGA whole genome amplified samples be used with caution. This study draws attention to the need to be sensitive to problems associated with a lack of uniformity in data generation in TCGA data.","['Buckley, Alexandra R', 'Standish, Kristopher A', 'Bhutani, Kunal', 'Ideker, Trey', 'Lasken, Roger S', 'Carter, Hannah', 'Harismendy, Olivier', 'Schork, Nicholas J']","['Buckley AR', 'Standish KA', 'Bhutani K', 'Ideker T', 'Lasken RS', 'Carter H', 'Harismendy O', 'Schork NJ']",,"['Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'J.

The recent introduction of two novel substance classes, B-cell receptor inhibitors and BH3 mimetics, into CLL treatment has provided enormous clinical progress in this previously difficult-to-treat patient subgroup characterized by high risk for treatment failure with standard chemoimmunotherapy and rapid disease progression. Compounds now approved for the treatment of TP53-deficient CLL are the two B-cell receptor inhibitors ibrutinib and idelalisib and the BH3 mimetic venetoclax. All three compounds were approved on the basis of favorable response rates that, importantly, revealed no differences between TP53-competent and TP53-deficient CLL cases. Using these compounds, longer-lasting remissions in patients with TP53-deficient CLL could be demonstrated for the first time. Whether TP53 alterations will maintain their significance as adverse prognostic factors in treatment strategies involving novel compounds needs to be assessed. This review provides an overview of current treatment options for 17p-deleted/ TP53-mutated CLL, including those compounds that are already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration or are under advanced clinical investigation. Available clinical trial data are discussed, as is the use of novel targeted treatment options in the context of transplant strategies, and an algorithm for off-study treatment of 17p-deficient CLL is suggested.","['Edelmann, Jennifer', 'Gribben, John G']","['Edelmann J', 'Gribben JG']",,"['Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Oncol Pract,Journal of oncology practice,101261852,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Piperidines', 'Prognosis', 'Purines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'Quinazolinones/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*deficiency/genetics']",,2017/06/13 06:00,2018/03/20 06:00,['2017/06/13 06:00'],"['2017/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/JOP.2017.023291 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pract. 2017 Jun;13(6):371-377. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2017.023291.,,,,,,,,,"['J Oncol Pract. 2017 Jun;13(6):381-382.

For this reason, mLV integration sites can be used as functional markers of active regulatory elements. Here, we present a retroviral scanning tool, which allows the genome-wide identification of cell-specific enhancers and promoters. Briefly, the target cell population is transduced with an mLV-derived vector and genomic DNA is digested with a frequently cutting restriction enzyme. After ligation of genomic fragments with a compatible DNA linker, linker-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR) allows the amplification of the virus-host genome junctions. Massive sequencing of the amplicons is used to define the mLV integration profile genome-wide. Finally, clusters of recurrent integrations are defined to identify cell-specific regulatory regions, responsible for the activation of cell-type specific transcriptional programs. The retroviral scanning tool allows the genome-wide identification of cell-specific promoters and enhancers in prospectively isolated target cell populations. Notably, retroviral scanning represents an instrumental technique for the retrospective identification of rare populations (e.g. somatic stem cells) that lack robust markers for prospective isolation.","['Romano, Oriana', 'Cifola, Ingrid', 'Poletti, Valentina', 'Severgnini, Marco', 'Peano, Clelia', 'De Bellis, Gianluca', 'Mavilio, Fulvio', 'Miccio, Annarita']","['Romano O', 'Cifola I', 'Poletti V', 'Severgnini M', 'Peano C', 'De Bellis G', 'Mavilio F', 'Miccio A']",,"['Center for Genome Research, Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia; Laboratory of Chromatin and Gene Regulation During Development, Imagine Institute.', 'Institute for Biomedical Technologies, CNR.', 'Genethon.', 'Institute for Biomedical Technologies, CNR.', 'Institute for Biomedical Technologies, CNR.', 'Institute for Biomedical Technologies, CNR.', 'Center for Genome Research, Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia; Genethon.', 'Center for Genome Research, Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia; Laboratory of Chromatin and Gene Regulation During Development, Imagine Institute; Genethon; Sorbonne Paris Cite - Universite Paris Descartes; annarita.miccio@institutimagine.org.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Video-Audio Media']",20170528,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,,IM,"['Humans', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', '*Virus Integration']",PMC5608156,2017/06/13 06:00,2018/05/15 06:00,['2017/06/13 06:00'],"['2017/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/55919 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2017 May 28;(123). doi: 10.3791/55919.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, all 3 fractions increased IL-23 expression, with the highest increase brought about by Fr-II. qRT-PCR analysis showed that Fr-I and Fr-II increased IL-17 expression in RAW264.7 cells by 13.3-fold and 19.6-fold, respectively. IL-17 expression in lung tissue was increased 2.1-fold compared with the control group, whereas that in liver tissue was unaltered by oral administration of CPP for 7 days. In a mouse model, qRT-PCR analysis showed that CPP induced liver TIMP-1 and lung IL-17 expressions 8.9-fold and 2.1-fold, respectively, without affecting MMP-9 expression. Our in vitro and in vivo data suggest that inducing TIMP-1 without altering MMP-9 expression by administering the polysaccharide fraction of Ph. linteus could be a novel antitumor or antimetastasis mechanism of polysaccharide from the medicinal mushroom Ph. linteus.","['Yoon, Soo Kyung', 'Sung, Soo Kyung', 'Lee, Dong Hee', 'Kim, Ha Won']","['Yoon SK', 'Sung SK', 'Lee DH', 'Kim HW']",,"['Department of Life Science, University of Seoul, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Life Science, University of Seoul, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Seoul, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Life Science, University of Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Int J Med Mushrooms,International journal of medicinal mushrooms,100886202,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-23)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (Timp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Basidiomycota/*chemistry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Interleukin-23/*biosynthesis', 'Liver/drug effects', 'Lung/drug effects', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Polysaccharides/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'RAW 264.7 Cells', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1/*biosynthesis']",,2017/06/13 06:00,2018/02/20 06:00,['2017/06/13 06:00'],"['2017/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['2660055b0a219fef,0f617c9915ba5be8 [pii]', '10.1615/IntJMedMushrooms.v19.i3.30 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Med Mushrooms. 2017;19(3):213-223. doi: 10.1615/IntJMedMushrooms.v19.i3.30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This therapeutic strategy required finding a selective NK cell stimulator that, upon administration, did not disturb organism homeostasis, unlike natural activators (interleukin-2 or interleukin-12). Because the majority of anticancer agents derived from Basidiomycetes are able to stimulate lymphocytes, we describe the influence of Boletus edulis RNA on a human NK cell line (NK92). Our studies showed that a B. edulis RNA fraction was not toxic against NK92 cells. Furthermore, the tested fraction significantly stimulated NK92 cell proliferation and their cytotoxicity against tumor cells. We demonstrate here, to our knowledge for the first time, that B. edulis RNA enhances NK cell activity and possesses immunomodulatory potential.","['Lemieszek, Marta Kinga', 'Nunes, Fernando Herminio Ferreira Milheiro', 'Sawa-Wejksza, Katarzyna', 'Rzeski, Wojciech']","['Lemieszek MK', 'Nunes FHFM', 'Sawa-Wejksza K', 'Rzeski W']",,"['Department of Medical Biology, Institute of Rural Health, Lublin, Poland.', 'Chemistry Research Centre, Chemistry Department, University of Trasos-Montes e Alto Douro, Vila Real, Portugal.', 'Department of Virology and Immunology, Maria Curie-Sklodowska University, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Institute of Rural Health, Lublin, Poland; Department of Virology and Immunology, Maria Curie-Sklodowska University, Lublin, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Int J Med Mushrooms,International journal of medicinal mushrooms,100886202,"['0 (Biological Products)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (RNA, Fungal)']",IM,"['Basidiomycota/*chemistry', 'Biological Products/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology/physiology', 'RNA, Fungal/*isolation & purification/*metabolism']",,2017/06/13 06:00,2018/02/20 06:00,['2017/06/13 06:00'],"['2017/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['7e712f4f2518a7dc,49b6bde944ede8be [pii]', '10.1615/IntJMedMushrooms.v19.i4.50 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Med Mushrooms. 2017;19(4):347-353. doi: 10.1615/IntJMedMushrooms.v19.i4.50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies in children have shown that the negative prognostic impact of chemotherapy resistance is abrogated by the implementation of early response-based intensification strategies. Comparable data in adults are lacking. Patients and Methods We performed comprehensive clinicobiologic, genetic, and survival analyses of a large cohort of 213 adult patients with T-ALL, including 47 patients with ETP-ALL, treated in the GRAALL (Group for Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) -2003 and -2005 studies. Results Targeted next-generation sequencing revealed that the genotype of immunophenotypically defined adult T-ALL is similar to the pediatric equivalent, with high rates of mutations in factors involved in cytokine receptor and RAS signaling (62.2%), hematopoietic development (29.7%), and chemical modification of histones (48.6%). In contrast to pediatric cases, mutations in DNA methylation factor genes were also common (32.4%). We found that despite expected high levels of early bone marrow chemotherapy resistance (87%), the overall prognosis for adults with ETP-ALL treated using the GRAALL protocols was not inferior to that of the non-ETP-ALL group (5-year overall survival: ETP, 59.6%; 95% CI, 44.2% to 72.0% v non-ETP, 66.5%; 95% CI, 58.7% to 73.2%; P = 0.33) and that allogeneic stem-cell transplantation had a beneficial effect in a large proportion of patients with ETP-ALL. Conclusion Our results suggest that the use of response-based risk stratification and therapy intensification abrogates the poor prognosis of adult ETP-ALL.","['Bond, Jonathan', 'Graux, Carlos', 'Lhermitte, Ludovic', 'Lara, Diane', 'Cluzeau, Thomas', 'Leguay, Thibaut', 'Cieslak, Agata', 'Trinquand, Amelie', 'Pastoret, Cedric', 'Belhocine, Mohamed', 'Spicuglia, Salvatore', 'Lheritier, Veronique', 'Lepretre, Stephane', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Huguet, Francoise', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth', 'Boissel, Nicolas', 'Asnafi, Vahid']","['Bond J', 'Graux C', 'Lhermitte L', 'Lara D', 'Cluzeau T', 'Leguay T', 'Cieslak A', 'Trinquand A', 'Pastoret C', 'Belhocine M', 'Spicuglia S', 'Lheritier V', 'Lepretre S', 'Thomas X', 'Huguet F', 'Ifrah N', 'Dombret H', 'Macintyre E', 'Boissel N', 'Asnafi V']",,"[""Jonathan Bond, Ludovic Lhermitte, Agata Cieslak, Amelie Trinquand, Elizabeth Macintyre, and Vahid Asnafi, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades;

Expression of FLI-1 has been demonstrated in Ewing's sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (ES/PNET) and vascular neoplasms. In the present study, we describe 2 cases of metastatic melanoma with small round blue cell morphology that showed strong nuclear expression of FLI-1. Because of the small round blue cell morphology and negative immunohistochemical staining for pan-melanocytic cocktail (HMB45, anti MART1 and anti-tyrosinase) and SOX10 in both cases, FLI-1 immunostaining was requested as part of the tumors workup. Ultimately, both cases were established as being metastatic melanoma. Dermatopathologists should be aware that melanoma can be strongly positive for FLI-1 and not misinterpret these cases for ES/PNET or vascular lesions, especially when melanomas show unusual morphology.","['Ramani, Nisha', 'Aung, Phyu P', 'Hwu, Wen-Jen', 'Nagarajan, Priyadharsini', 'Tetzlaff, Michael T', 'Curry, Johnathan L', 'Ivan, Doina', 'Prieto, Victor G', 'Torres-Cabala, Carlos A']","['Ramani N', 'Aung PP', 'Hwu WJ', 'Nagarajan P', 'Tetzlaff MT', 'Curry JL', 'Ivan D', 'Prieto VG', 'Torres-Cabala CA']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1787-9587'],"['Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pathology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department Melanoma Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Dermatology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Dermatology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Dermatology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Dermatology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20170710,United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (FLII protein, human)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'Melanoma, Cutaneous Malignant']",IM,"['Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melanoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Microfilament Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*biosynthesis', 'Skin Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Trans-Activators']",,2017/06/13 06:00,2018/05/10 06:00,['2017/06/13 06:00'],"['2017/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/30 00:00 [revised]', '2017/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cup.12979 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2017 Sep;44(9):790-793. doi: 10.1111/cup.12979.

METHODS: Interphase FISH was performed on bone marrow samples derived from 105 patients with CLL at the time of diagnosis using probes for D13S319/13q14, ATM/11q22, P53/17p13 and CEP12. The abnormalities and prognostic factors were analyzed. Overall survival of the patients was calculated. RESULTS: The FISH assay has detected genomic abnormalities in 81 (77.1%) of the patients, among which D13S319/13q14 deletion was the most common (49/105, 46.67%). 24(22.86%) patients had trisomy 12, 21(20.00%) had ATM/11q deletion, and 12(11.43%) had P53/17p deletion. A significant correlation was found between Binet staging and the detected abnormalities (< 0.05). With a median follow-up time of 10 months, 11 patients (10.5%) had died. Compared with those with P53 deletion, patients with 13q deletion showed a better overall survival. However, the overall survival did not significantly differ between patients with various genomic abnormalities (> 0.05). CONCLUSION: FISH is capable of detecting common genomic aberrations among patients with newly diagnosed CLL. Deletion of D13S319/13q14 is the most common aberration in such patients. Genomic aberrations are significantly correlated with Binet staging but not the overall survival of CLL patients.","['Wang, Huanping', 'Xu, Huan', 'Chen, Zhimei', 'Lou, Jiyu', 'Jin, Jie']","['Wang H', 'Xu H', 'Chen Z', 'Lou J', 'Jin J']",,"['Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies of Zhejiang Province, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310009, China. jiej0503@163.com.']",['chi'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,9425197,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2017/06/13 06:00,2017/09/15 06:00,['2017/06/13 06:00'],"['2017/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['940634070 [pii]', '10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2017.03.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi. 2017 Jun 10;34(3):357-360. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2017.03.009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PD-L1 expression is upregulated in many solid tumors including lung cancer and functions predominantly in lactate-enriched tumor microenvironments. Here, we provided evidence for PD-L1 induction in response to lactate stimulation in lung cancer cells. Lactate-induced PD-L1 induction was mediated by its receptor GPR81. The silencing of GPR81 signaling in lung cancer cells resulted in a decrease in PD-L1 protein levels and functional inactivation of PD-L1 promoter activity. In addition, GPR81-mediated upregulation of PD-L1 in glucose-stimulated lung cancer cells that recapitulates the enhanced glycolysis in vivo was dependent on lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). We also demonstrated that activation of GPR81 decreases intracellular cAMP levels and inhibits protein kinase A (PKA) activity, leading to activation of the transcriptional coactivator TAZ. Interaction of TAZ with the transcription factor TEAD was essential for TAZ activation of PD-L1 and induction of its expression. Furthermore, we found that lactate-induced activation of PD-L1 in tumor cells led to reduced production of interferon-gamma and induction of apoptosis of cocultured Jurkat T-cell leukemia cells. Our findings reveal an unexpected role of lactate in contributing to tumor cell protection from cytotoxic T-cell targeting and establishes a direct connection between tumor cell metabolic reprograming and tumor evasion from the immune response.","['Feng, J', 'Yang, H', 'Zhang, Y', 'Wei, H', 'Zhu, Z', 'Zhu, B', 'Yang, M', 'Cao, W', 'Wang, L', 'Wu, Z']","['Feng J', 'Yang H', 'Zhang Y', 'Wei H', 'Zhu Z', 'Zhu B', 'Yang M', 'Cao W', 'Wang L', 'Wu Z']",,"['Medical Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, China.', 'The Tianjin Key Laboratory of Lung Cancer Metastasis and Tumor Microenvironment, Tianjin Lung Cancer Center and Institute, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Anhui Province Key laboratory of Active Biological Macro-molecules Research, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, China.', 'Department of Central Laboratory, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, China.', 'School of Forensic Medicine, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, China.', 'School of Anesthesiology, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, China.', 'School of Anesthesiology, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, China.', 'Medical Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, China.', 'Anhui Province Key laboratory of Active Biological Macro-molecules Research, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, China.', 'School of Preclinical Medicine, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170612,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (HCAR1 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Coactivator with PDZ-Binding Motif Proteins)', '0 (WWTR1 protein, human)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 1.1.- (Lactate Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 1.1.1.28 (D-lactate dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'B7-H1 Antigen/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lactate Dehydrogenases/genetics/metabolism', 'Lactic Acid/*metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Coactivator with PDZ-Binding Motif Proteins']",,2017/06/13 06:00,2017/10/25 06:00,['2017/06/13 06:00'],"['2016/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/06 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc2017188 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2017.188 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2017 Oct 19;36(42):5829-5839. doi: 10.1038/onc.2017.188.

The conditioning regimen was thiotepa, busulfan and fludarabine; following bone marrow or peripheral blood infusion. GvHD prophylaxis with high-dose cyclophosphamide on days +3 and +4, and IV tacrolimus from day +5 was administered. 62% were in complete remission, 17% had received previous allogeneic SCT and 44% had a high-very high refined disease risk index. One patient had primary graft failure and three more died before +21. The median days to neutrophil and platelet recoveries were +18 and +23, respectively, and 93% achieved a full donor chimerism on day +30. At 1 year, cumulative incidences (CumInc) of non-relapse mortality and relapse were 27 and 19%. One-year overall survival and PFS were 61 and 51%. CumInc of grade II-IV and III-IV were 23 and 14%.

A total of 748 first RIC-UCBT between 2000 and 2012 (MTX+ group, 446, MMF+ group, 302) were included. The cumulative incidence of neutrophil and platelet counts higher than 50 000/muL was significantly better in the MMF+ group (relative risk (RR), 1.55; P<0.001: RR, 1.34; P=0.003, respectively). In multivariate analyses, the risk of grade II-IV and III-IV acute GvHD was significantly higher in the MMF+ group than in the MTX+ group (RR, 1.75; P<0.001: RR, 1.97; P=0.004, respectively). In disease-specific analyses of AML, the risk of relapse of high-risk disease was significantly lower in the MMF+ group (RR, 0.69; P=0.009), whereas no significant difference was observed in the risk of relapse-free and overall survival in high-risk disease. In patients with standard-risk disease, no significant differences were noted in the risk of relapse or survival between the MTX+ and MMF+ groups. Collectively, these results suggest that MMF-containing prophylaxis may be preferable in RIC-UCBT, particularly for high-risk disease.","['Terakura, S', 'Kuwatsuka, Y', 'Yamasaki, S', 'Wake, A', 'Kanda, J', 'Inamoto, Y', 'Mizuta, S', 'Yamaguchi, T', 'Uchida, N', 'Kouzai, Y', 'Aotsuka, N', 'Ogawa, H', 'Kanamori, H', 'Nishiwaki, K', 'Miyakoshi, S', 'Onizuka, M', 'Amano, I', 'Fukuda, T', 'Ichinohe, T', 'Atsuta, Y', 'Murata, M', 'Teshima, T']","['Terakura S', 'Kuwatsuka Y', 'Yamasaki S', 'Wake A', 'Kanda J', 'Inamoto Y', 'Mizuta S', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Uchida N', 'Kouzai Y', 'Aotsuka N', 'Ogawa H', 'Kanamori H', 'Nishiwaki K', 'Miyakoshi S', 'Onizuka M', 'Amano I', 'Fukuda T', 'Ichinohe T', 'Atsuta Y', 'Murata M', 'Teshima T']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1194-8046', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6704-3633']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Center for Advanced Medicine and Clinical Research, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Clinical Research Institute, National Hospital Organization Kyushu Medical Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Toranomon Hospital Kajigaya, Kawasaki, Japan.', 'Okinaka Memorial Institute of Medical Research, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Hospital Organization Toyohashi Medical Center, Toyohashi, Japan.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Okinaka Memorial Institute of Medical Research, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, Tokyo Metropolitan Tama Medical Center, Fuchu, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Japanese Red Cross Narita Hospital, Narita, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Division of Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Jikei University School of Medicine, Kashiwa Hospital, Kashiwa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'The Second Department of Internal Medicine, Nara Medical University Hospital, Kashihara, Japan.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Healthcare Administration, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170612,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Young Adult']",,2017/06/13 06:00,2018/06/13 06:00,['2017/06/13 06:00'],"['2017/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/04 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['bmt2017116 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2017.116 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2017 Sep;52(9):1261-1267. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2017.116.

To understand GVL resistance, we studied GVL against mouse models of CP-CML, BC-CML, and AML generated by the transduction of mouse BM with fusion cDNAs derived from human leukemias. Prior work has shown that CD4+ T cell-mediated GVL against CP-CML and BC-CML required intact leukemia MHCII; however, stem cells from both leukemias were MHCII negative. Here, we show that CP-CML, BC-CML, and AML stem cells upregulate MHCII in alloSCT recipients. Using gene-deficient leukemias, we determined that BC-CML and AML MHC upregulation required IFN-gamma stimulation, whereas CP-CML MHC upregulation was independent of both the IFN-gamma receptor (IFN-gammaR) and the IFN-alpha/beta receptor IFNAR1. Importantly, IFN-gammaR-deficient BC-CML and AML were completely resistant to CD4- and CD8-mediated GVL, whereas IFN-gammaR/IFNAR1 double-deficient CP-CML was fully GVL sensitive. Mouse AML and BC-CML stem cells were MHCI+ without IFN-gamma stimulation, suggesting that IFN-gamma sensitizes these leukemias to T cell killing by mechanisms other than MHC upregulation. Our studies identify the requirement of IFN-gamma stimulation as a mechanism for BC-CML and AML GVL resistance, whereas independence from IFN-gamma renders CP-CML more GVL sensitive, even with a lower-level alloimmune response.","['Matte-Martone, Catherine', 'Liu, Jinling', 'Zhou, Meng', 'Chikina, Maria', 'Green, Douglas R', 'Harty, John T', 'Shlomchik, Warren D']","['Matte-Martone C', 'Liu J', 'Zhou M', 'Chikina M', 'Green DR', 'Harty JT', 'Shlomchik WD']",,"['Department of Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Computational Systems Biology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', ""Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis Tennessee, USA."", 'Department of Microbiology and Pathology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA.', 'Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Pathology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA.', 'Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA086862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI044828/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA169291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL117855/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20170612,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (IFNG protein, mouse)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology/pathology']",PMC5490746,2017/06/13 06:00,2017/09/15 06:00,['2017/06/13 06:00'],"['2015/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['85736 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI85736 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2017 Jun 30;127(7):2765-2776. doi: 10.1172/JCI85736.

The 5-year overall survival is only 30-40% in adults and elderly patients with ALL compared to 90% in children. We have seen major advances in our understanding and management of ALL related to identification of new cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities and development of novel targeted agents for the treatment of ALL. The addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies and novel immune therapies (e.g. bispecific T cell engager [BiTE] and chimeric antigen receptor [CAR] T cells) has resulted in improved outcomes. These new developments are changing the treatment paradigm of adults ALL from a 'one size fits all' approach to a more individualized treatment approach based on immunophenotypic, cytogenetic and molecular features. In this article we review recent diagnostic and therapeutic advances along with the challenges in the treatment of patients with ALL.","['Kansagra, Ankit', 'Dahiya, Saurabh', 'Litzow, Mark']","['Kansagra A', 'Dahiya S', 'Litzow M']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6901-0782', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9816-6302']","['a Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant , Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN , USA.', 'b Division of Blood and Marrow Transplant , Stanford University , Stanford , CA , USA.', 'a Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant , Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN , USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170611,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Humans', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*therapy']",,2017/06/13 06:00,2019/01/12 06:00,['2017/06/13 06:00'],"['2017/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2017.1335397 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2018 Mar;59(3):526-541. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2017.1335397.

Cytologic examination of CSF demonstrated a hypercellular specimen composed of hematopoietic cells including few blasts, as well as maturing red blood cells and granulocytic cells. The integration of morphologic findings, peripheral blood and bone marrow counts, as well as flow cytometric analysis of CSF and bone marrow, excluded leptomeningeal involvement by leukemic blasts and helped establish the diagnosis of intracranial EMH.

Microenvironment, antigenic stimulation and genetical mutations are demonstrated in etiopathogenesis. We aimed to evaluate the expression of CD11c in patients with CLL and its possible clinical significance. METHODS: Data of 259 patients with CLL between 2010 and 2016 in Trakya University Faculty of Medicine, including age at diagnosis, sex, whole blood count, stage, percentage of CLL cells in bone marrow, line of treatments, development of Richter's transformation and secondary tumors, autoimmune complications, IgG level, prognostic cytogenetic analysis, and length of survival were recorded from files. RESULTS: 151 patients were male (58.3%) and 108 were male (41.7%). Mean age was 70 (21-92) years. CD11c was observed to be positive (>%20) in 103 patients (39.8%). Development of Richter's transformation, secondary tumors and ITP was significantly frequent in patients with CD11c positivity (P values .000, .003, .000 respectively). Also, IgG levels were significantly lower in this group (P = .000). Hemoglobin level, RAI stage and bone marrow CLL infiltration percentage were statistically related with CD11c (P values .036, .037, .000 respectively). Finally, CD11c was statistically related (in positive group 70 months, negative group 79 months, P = .001). CONCLUSION: CD11c, expressed not only in Hairy cell leukemia but also in dendritic cells, macrophages and monocytes is a differentiation marker for inflammation. Prolonged inflammation in the microenvironment of CLL cells may cause a susceptibility to autoimmune disorders and secondary tumors in CLL, in this way, an increase in mortality.","['Umit, E G', 'Baysal, M', 'Durmus, Y', 'Demir, A M']","['Umit EG', 'Baysal M', 'Durmus Y', 'Demir AM']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5589-3000'],"['Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine Trakya University, Edirne, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine Trakya University, Edirne, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Trakya University, Edirne, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine Trakya University, Edirne, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170612,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD11c Antigen)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Autoimmune Diseases/etiology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'CD11c Antigen/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",,2017/06/13 06:00,2017/10/20 06:00,['2017/06/13 06:00'],"['2016/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12695 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2017 Oct;39(5):552-556. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12695.

Tetrandrine (TET), a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid extracted from a Chinese herb, is a potential anti-cancer and anti-leukaemic drug. In this study we investigated the mechanisms of TET resistance in T-ALL cells in vitro. Among the four T-ALL cell lines tested, Jurkat and CEM cells exhibited the lowest and highest resistance to TET with IC50 values at 24 h of 4.31+/-0.12 and 16.53+/-3.32 mumol/L, respectively. When treated with TET, the activity of transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1) was significantly decreased in Jurkat cells but nearly constant in CEM cells. To avoid cell-specific variation in drug resistance and transcription factor activities, we established a TET-R Jurkat subclone with the estimated IC50 value of 10.90+/-.92 mumol/L by exposing the cells to increasing concentrations of TET. Interestingly, when treated with TET, TET-R Jurkat cells exhibited enhanced AP-1 and NF-kappaB activity, along with upregulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways, whereas the expression of P-gp was not altered. Selective inhibition of JNK but not ERK suppressed AP-1 activity and TET resistance in TET-R Jurkat cells and in CEM cells. These results demonstrate that Jurkat cells acquire TET resistance through activation of the JNK/AP-1 pathway but not through P-gp expression. The JNK/AP-1 pathway may be a potential therapeutic target in relapsed T-ALL.","['Liou, Jun-Ting', 'Lin, Chin-Sheng', 'Liao, Yu-Cheng', 'Ho, Ling-Jun', 'Yang, Shih-Ping', 'Lai, Jenn-Haung']","['Liou JT', 'Lin CS', 'Liao YC', 'Ho LJ', 'Yang SP', 'Lai JH']",,"['Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, China.', 'Graduate Institute of Medical Science, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, China.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, China.', 'Graduate Institute of Microbiology and Immunology, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, China.', 'Institute of Cellular and System Medicine, National Health Research Institute, Zhunan, Miaoli County, Taiwan, China.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, China.', 'Graduate Institute of Medical Science, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, China.', 'Division of Allergy, Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan County, Taiwan, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170612,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '29EX23D5AJ (tetrandrine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Benzylisoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System/physiology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism']",PMC5547555,2017/06/13 06:00,2018/02/16 06:00,['2017/06/13 06:00'],"['2016/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['aps201726 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2017.26 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2017 Aug;38(8):1171-1183. doi: 10.1038/aps.2017.26.

We retrospectively studied commercial qPCR and STR chimerism with respective positivity thresholds of .1% and 1% in 359 peripheral blood (PB) and 95 bone marrow (BM) samples from 30 adult patients after first HLA-matched SCT for myeloid malignancies or acute lymphatic leukemia. Concordance between the 2 methods was 79.5%, with all discordant samples positive in qPCR but negative in STR. Of the latter, sporadic qPCR positivity without clinical correlates was seen mostly in BM samples early post-transplant. In 7 of 21 patients with available follow-up samples in the first months after transplantation, qPCR but not STR revealed low levels (<1%) of sustained host chimerism in PB, reflecting delayed engraftment or persistent mixed chimerism (PMC). These conditions were associated with donor-recipient cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus and early CMV reactivation but not with immunosuppressive regimens or clinical outcome. qPCR predicted all 8/8 relapses with samples in the 6 months before onset by sustained positivity in both PB and BM compared with 1/8 relapses predicted by STR mainly in BM. The response kinetics to donor lymphocyte infusions for the treatment of PMC or relapse was shown by qPCR but not STR to be protracted over several months in 3 patients. Our results demonstrate the superior clinical utility of qPCR compared with STR for monitoring subtle changes of host chimerism associated with different clinical conditions, making a case for its use in the clinical follow-up of transplant patients.","['Ahci, Muberra', 'Stempelmann, Karin', 'Buttkereit, Ulrike', 'Crivello, Pietro', 'Trilling, Mirko', 'Heinold, Andreas', 'Steckel, Nina Kristin', 'Koldehoff, Michael', 'Horn, Peter A', 'Beelen, Dietrich W', 'Fleischhauer, Katharina']","['Ahci M', 'Stempelmann K', 'Buttkereit U', 'Crivello P', 'Trilling M', 'Heinold A', 'Steckel NK', 'Koldehoff M', 'Horn PA', 'Beelen DW', 'Fleischhauer K']",,"['Institute for Experimental Cellular Therapy, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cellular Therapy, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cellular Therapy, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Virology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cellular Therapy, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.

WGS revealed that the diagnostic cells also contained mutations in ASXL1, SEC23B, MAD1L1, and RREB1 as well as 12,000 additional uncommon DNA variants. WGS of endothelial cells generated from circulating precursors revealed many of these were shared with the CML clone. Surprisingly, WGS of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from the AP cells revealed only six additional coding somatic mutations, despite retention by the hematopoietic progeny of the parental AP cell levels of BCR-ABL1 expression and sensitivity to imatinib and pimozide. Limited analysis of BP cells revealed independent subclonal progression to homozygosity of the MAD1L1 and RREB1 variants.

These CSCs are considered to be associated with chemo- and radio-resistance, and consequently, failure of conventional anticancer therapies. The recent demonstration of several microRNAs as enhancers of tumorigenicity via modulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stemness, makes them putative novel therapeutic target in oncology. Antrodia cinnamomea is a Chinese traditional medicine with several biological functions including anti-inflammation, antioxidant, and cancer prevention. However, the anti-CSC capability of A. Cinnamomea is not clear yet. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the inhibitory effect of A. cinnamomea mycelium and extract on CSCs derived from various human cancer cell lines using our in-house therapeutics and human genome-wide miRNA screening panels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A broad range of human cancer cell lines, including the acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM 8401), lung carcinoma (A549), breast adenocarcinoma (MDA-MB-231), hepatoblastoma (HepG2), colorectal adenocarcinoma (SW620), and foreskin fibroblast (HS68), were exposed to A. cinnamomea in this study. CD133(+) CSCs generated from the cell lines were characterized and isolated by flow cytometry, effect of chemo- and radiotherapy was assessed using the MTT assay, while the RT-PCR and human genome wide qRT-PCR determined the differential gene expression patterns. A comparative analysis of the anticancer effect of A. cinnamomea and Cisplatin, Taxol, or irradiation was also performed. RESULTS: Our results indicated that A. cinnamomea mycelium and its ethyl acetate extracts showed anti-proliferation effects against all types of CSCs, especially the lung, breast, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma CSCs. Furthermore, CSCs treatment with A. cinnamomea combined with irradiation or chemotherapeutics demonstrated significant anti-cancer effect. We also established an association between the CSC-inhibitory effect of A. cinnamomea and significant downregulation of several microRNAs and cancer stemness expression levels in brain and breast CSCs. More importantly, higher CD133 expression is associated with poor prognosis in glioblastoma and breast cancer patients. CONCLUSION: Herein, we demonstrate the putative role of A. cinnamomea as an effective ethnopharmacologic therapeutic agent for cancer treatment.","['Su, Yu-Kai', 'Shih, Ping-Hsiao', 'Lee, Wei-Hwa', 'Bamodu, Oluwaseun Adebayo', 'Wu, Alexander T H', 'Huang, Chun-Chih', 'Tzeng, Yew-Min', 'Hsiao, Michael', 'Yeh, Chi-Tai', 'Lin, Chien-Min']","['Su YK', 'Shih PH', 'Lee WH', 'Bamodu OA', 'Wu ATH', 'Huang CC', 'Tzeng YM', 'Hsiao M', 'Yeh CT', 'Lin CM']",,"['Department of Neurology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Surgery, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology, Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Cancer Center, Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Medical Research & Education, Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan.', 'The Ph.D. Program for Translational Medicine, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Life Science, National Taitung University, Taitung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Life Science, National Taitung University, Taitung, Taiwan.', 'Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Cancer Center, Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Medical Research & Education, Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan.

The utility of carbapenems, which are considered 'last-line' agents, is being diminished by the growing incidence of various resistance mechanisms in Gram-negative bacteria. A molecular investigation was performed of an MDR carbapenem-resistant Citrobacter freundii of sequence type 8 (ST8) isolated from a hematology patient with acute myeloid leukemia. METHODS: Multilocus sequence typing and analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the class I integron were performed using PCR and Sanger sequencing. Transformation of the resistance plasmid isolated following the alkaline lysis method was performed using chemically competent E. coli TOP10. RESULTS: Molecular analysis of the carbapenem-resistant C. freundii revealed the presence of the VIM-4 isoenzyme located on the approximately 55-kb transferable resistance plasmid. Interestingly, the blaVIM-4 gene was inserted into an unusual gene cassette containing a 169-bp direct repeat of the 3' segment of the blaVIM-4 gene. CONCLUSIONS: All unusual gene cassettes containing VIM-DR (direct repeat) described thus far have been harbored by non-fermenters, i.e., Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas, underscoring the importance of resistance determinant mobility, which may go even beyond genus, family, and order boundaries. Great efforts need to be taken to explore pathways of resistance to 'last-resort' antimicrobials, especially among clinically relevant pathogens.","['Majewski, Piotr', 'Wieczorek, Piotr', 'Lapuc, Izabela', 'Ojdana, Dominika', 'Sienko, Anna', 'Sacha, Pawel', 'Kloczko, Janusz', 'Tryniszewska, Elzbieta']","['Majewski P', 'Wieczorek P', 'Lapuc I', 'Ojdana D', 'Sienko A', 'Sacha P', 'Kloczko J', 'Tryniszewska E']",,"['Department of Microbiological Diagnostics and Infectious Immunology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.

After this publication, a practice guideline made HT alone a standard treatment option in British Columbia. The subsequent population-based pattern of practice was studied. METHODS AND MATERIALS: All women aged 70 to 79 years, referred after lumpectomy from 1999 to 2009, with stage 1, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer were identified. The use of adjuvant HT or HT-RT was evaluated in 2 eras: before (1999-2003) and after (2005-2009) the CALGB publication. The proportion receiving each treatment in these eras was determined. Kaplan-Meier analyses with Cox regression were used for survival endpoints. The Fine and Gray method was used with non-breast cancer death as a competing risk for event-free survival. The Charlson score was used to quantify comorbidity. Adherence was defined as dispensation of 80% of prescribed HT. RESULTS: HT-RT was used in 91% of patients before (n=319) and 89% of patients after (n=403) the CALGB publication (P=.4). In the HT-alone group, the rate of HT adherence was 75% at 1 year and 55% at 4 years. The 10-year locoregional recurrence-free survival rate was 98% with HT-RT and 90% with HT alone (P=.01), whereas the 10-year breast cancer-specific survival rate was 96% with HT-RT and 95% with HT alone (P=.2). Patients with grade 3 histology or lymphovascular invasion were more likely to have low event-free survival. On multivariate analysis, treatment type did not predict overall survival (P=.3). CONCLUSIONS: Our patient outcomes closely matched those of the CALGB trial, suggesting that its results are generalizable to a population of elderly breast cancer patients with typical HT adherence. The CALGB trial results, as well as the resulting practice guideline, did not change the use of adjuvant HT-RT in our population-based cancer program.","['Nichol, Alan M', 'Chan, Elisa K', 'Lucas, Sarah', 'Smith, Sally L', 'Gondara, Lovedeep', 'Speers, Caroline', 'Tyldesley, Scott']","['Nichol AM', 'Chan EK', 'Lucas S', 'Smith SL', 'Gondara L', 'Speers C', 'Tyldesley S']",,"['Department of Radiation Oncology, Vancouver Centre, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; Division of Radiation Oncology and Developmental Radiotherapeutics, University of British Columbia, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Evidence sources were reviewed for topic applicability. Each of the final 23 sources was appraised by 2 team members. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system was used to assign a quality and strength rating for each recommendation. Multiple recommendations were developed: 4 relating to nurse monitoring of patients during and after drug administration, 8 guiding hypersensitivity reaction management, and 4 concerning patient/family educational content. These strong recommendations were based on moderate, low, or very-low-quality evidence. Several recommendations relied on generalized drug hypersensitivity guidelines.

Fludarabine, which is a compound used to treat various hematological malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acts by down-regulating signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) by inhibiting STAT1 phosphorylation in both normal and cancer cells. This study assessed the effects of fludarabine in vitro (primary murine osteoblasts) and in vivo (rat SANFH model). In vitro, pretreatment with fludarabine significantly inhibited Dexamethasone (Dex)-induced apoptosis in osteoblasts, which was examined by TUNEL staining. Treatment with Dex caused a remarkable decrease in the expression of Bcl-2; an increase in cytochrome c release; activation of BAX, caspase-9, and caspase-3; and an obvious enhancement in STAT1 phosphorylation. However, treatment resulted in the up-regulation of caspase-3 expression. Enhanced P-STAT1 activity and up-regulation of caspase-3 expression were also observed in osteoblasts. In vivo, the subchondral trabeculae in fludarabine-treated rats exhibited less bone loss and a lower ratio of empty lacunae. Taken together, our results suggest that STAT1-mediated up-regulation of caspase-3 is involved in osteoblast apoptosis induced by Dex and indicates that fludarabine may serve as a potential agent for the treatment of SANFH.","['Feng, Zhenhua', 'Zheng, Wenhao', 'Tang, Qian', 'Cheng, Liang', 'Li, Hang', 'Ni, Wenfei', 'Pan, Xiaoyun']","['Feng Z', 'Zheng W', 'Tang Q', 'Cheng L', 'Li H', 'Ni W', 'Pan X']",,"[""Department of Orthopaedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 109 xueyuan xi Road, Wenzhou, 325000, China."", ""Department of Orthopaedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 109 xueyuan xi Road, Wenzhou, 325000, China."", ""Department of Orthopaedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 109 xueyuan xi Road, Wenzhou, 325000, China."", ""Department of Orthopaedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 109 xueyuan xi Road, Wenzhou, 325000, China."", ""Department of Orthopaedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 109 xueyuan xi Road, Wenzhou, 325000, China."", ""Department of Orthopaedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 109 xueyuan xi Road, Wenzhou, 325000, China."", ""Department of Orthopaedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 109 xueyuan xi Road, Wenzhou, 325000, China. xiaoyunpan@126.com.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, rat)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/*genetics', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Femur Head Necrosis/chemically induced/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Osteoblasts/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Rats', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",,2017/06/12 06:00,2018/03/22 06:00,['2017/06/12 06:00'],"['2017/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10495-017-1383-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s10495-017-1383-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 2017 Aug;22(8):1001-1012. doi: 10.1007/s10495-017-1383-1.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Caspase-3', '*Osteoblast', '*STAT1', '*Steroid-induced avascular necrosis of the femoral head (SANFH)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite promising preclinical data, TEX exhibit relatively low efficacy and limited clinical benefit in clinical trials. In the present study, we investigated whether exosomes from the TGF-beta1 silenced L1210 cells (LEXTGF-beta1si) can enhance the efficacy of DC-based vaccines. We silenced TGF-beta1 in L1210 cells with a lentiviral shRNA vector and prepared the LEXTGF-beta1si. It was shown that LEXTGF-beta1si can significantly decrease TGF-beta1 expression of dendritic cells (DC) and effectively promote their maturation and immune function. In addition, DC pulsed with LEXTGF-beta1si (DCLEX-TGF-beta1si) more effectively promoted CD4(+) T cell proliferation in vitro and Th1 cytokine secretion and induced tumor-specific CTL response. This response was higher in potency compared to that noted by the other two formulations. Moreover, DCLEX-TGF-beta1si inhibited tumor growth more efficiently than other formulations did as the preventive or therapeutic tumor vaccine. Accordingly, these findings revealed that DCLEX-TGF-beta1si induced a more potent antigen-specific anti-leukemic immunity than DC pulsed with exosomes from non-manipulated L1210 cells. This indicated that the targeting of DC by LEXTGF-beta1si may be used as a promising approach for leukemia immunotherapy.","['Huang, Fang', 'Wan, Jiangbo', 'Hao, Siguo', 'Deng, Xiaohui', 'Chen, Linjun', 'Ma, Liyuan']","['Huang F', 'Wan J', 'Hao S', 'Deng X', 'Chen L', 'Ma L']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6381-7729'],"['Department of Hematology, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, 1665# Kongjiang Road, Shanghai, 200090, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, 1665# Kongjiang Road, Shanghai, 200090, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, 1665# Kongjiang Road, Shanghai, 200090, China. haosghj88@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, 1665# Kongjiang Road, Shanghai, 200090, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, 1665# Kongjiang Road, Shanghai, 200090, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, 1665# Kongjiang Road, Shanghai, 200090, China.']",['eng'],['81470314/National Natural Science Foundation of China'],['Journal Article'],20170610,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,['0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Exosomes', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/*immunology']",,2017/06/12 06:00,2017/12/06 06:00,['2017/06/12 06:00'],"['2016/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00262-017-2028-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00262-017-2028-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2017 Oct;66(10):1321-1331. doi: 10.1007/s00262-017-2028-5.

Report from a developing country.,3523-3528,10.1007/s00520-017-3776-7 [doi],"PURPOSE: Febrile neutropenia (FN) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We aimed to look at complications in febrile neutropenia and to derive a risk model for developing complications from the variables predicting complications. METHODS: Children on treatment for ALL, presenting with FN, were prospectively enrolled over a period of 1 year. Their clinical presentation, course during hospital stay, and outcomes were recorded. Complications recorded included septic shock, pneumonia requiring invasive or non-invasive ventilation, renal failure, neutropenic enterocolitis, encephalopathy, congestive heart failure, and bleeding manifestations. RESULTS: There were 320 episodes of FN among 176 patients. Complications occurred during 73 (22.8%) episodes. Time since last chemotherapy </=7 days [OR 2.2 (1-4.5)], clinical focus of infection [OR 2.7 (1.3-5.5)], undernutrition [OR 2.5 (1.1-5.5)], absolute neutrophil count (ANC) </= 100/muL [OR 2.8 (1.3-5.9)], and C-reactive protein (CRP) > 60 mg/L at admission [OR 13.3 (5.2-33.8)] were independent predictors of complications. A risk model (total score = 13) was developed based on these predictors. Children with score of >/=7 had 17.2 (7.7-38.6) odds of developing complications as compared to those with score <7.

We sought to quantify the associations of cancer incidence with eGFR and with proteinuria in a large population-based cohort. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 242,583 adults (30-74 years old) without a diagnosis of cancer at baseline in the Korean Heart Study, based on health checkups in 1996 to 2004 with follow-up until 2012. PREDICTORS: Creatinine-based eGFR (>/=90, 60-89, 45-59, and <45mL/min/1.73m(2)) and dipstick proteinuria (undetectable/trace, 1+, 2+, and >/=3+). OUTCOMES: Overall and site-specific cancer incidence based on ICD-10 codes. RESULTS: 15,165 cases of cancer were detected. The relationship between eGFR and incidence of any cancer was J shaped, with the lowest risk at 45 to 59mL/min/1.73m(2). There was 44% higher risk for any cancer among those with eGFRs<45mL/min/1.73m(2) compared with those with eGFRs>/=90mL/min/1.73m(2) (HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.11-1.87). High proteinuria was also associated with cancer risk, showing a dose-response relationship (HRs of 1.24 [95% CI, 1.13-1.35], 1.38 [95% CI, 1.17-1.63], and 1.66 [95% CI, 1.30-2.12] for 1+, 2+, and >/=3+ vs undetectable/trace). Examining site-specific cancer, eGFR<45 (vs >/=45) mL/min/1.73m(2) was significantly associated with kidney and ureteral cancer, multiple myeloma, and leukemia, whereas proteinuria >/= 1+ (vs undetectable/trace) was related to a broader set of cancers (ie, stomach, rectal, liver, lung, ovarian, kidney, bladder, and multiple myeloma). After excluding study participants with follow-up less than 3 years, the associations remained consistent for kidney cancer and myeloma with eGFR and for rectal, liver, lung, and ovarian cancer with proteinuria. LIMITATIONS: Relatively small number of participants with severely reduced eGFR or 70 years or older. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney measures, particularly proteinuria, were associated with increased incidence of cancer. Future studies are needed to better understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying these associations.","['Mok, Yejin', 'Matsushita, Kunihiro', 'Ballew, Shoshana H', 'Sang, Yingying', 'Jung, Keum Ji', 'Lee, Sunmi', 'Jee, Sun Ha', 'Coresh, Josef']","['Mok Y', 'Matsushita K', 'Ballew SH', 'Sang Y', 'Jung KJ', 'Lee S', 'Jee SH', 'Coresh J']",,"['Department of Epidemiology, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Promotion and Institute for Health Promotion, Graduate School of Public Health, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Health Insurance Policy Research Institute, National Health Insurance Service, Wonju, Korea.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Health Promotion and Institute for Health Promotion, Graduate School of Public Health, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.

Currently established methods such as metaphase cytogenetics, FISH or array-based approaches have limitations due to their dependency on viable cells, high costs or semi-quantitative nature. Importantly, they cannot be used on low abundance DNA. We therefore aimed to establish a robust and quantitative technique that overcomes these shortcomings. METHODS: For precise determination of del(5q) cell fractions, we developed an inexpensive multiplex-PCR assay requiring only nanograms of DNA that simultaneously measures allelic imbalances of 12 independent short tandem repeat markers. RESULTS: Application of this method to n=1142 samples from n=260 individuals revealed strong intermarker concordance (R(2)=0.77-0.97) and reproducibility (mean SD: 1.7%). Notably, the assay showed accurate quantification via standard curve assessment (R(2)>0.99) and high concordance with paired FISH measurements (R(2)=0.92) even with subnanogram amounts of DNA. Moreover, cytogenetic response was reliably confirmed in del(5q) patients with myelodysplastic syndromes treated with lenalidomide. While the assay demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy in receiver operating characteristic analysis (area under the curve: 0.97), we further observed robust correlation between bone marrow and peripheral blood samples (R(2)=0.79), suggesting its potential suitability for less-invasive clonal monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we present an adaptable tool for quantification of chromosomal aberrations, particularly in problematic samples, which should be easily applicable to further tumour entities.","['Jann, Johann-Christoph', 'Nowak, Daniel', 'Nolte, Florian', 'Fey, Stephanie', 'Nowak, Verena', 'Oblander, Julia', 'Pressler, Jovita', 'Palme, Iris', 'Xanthopoulos, Christina', 'Fabarius, Alice', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Giagounidis, Aristoteles', 'Gotze, Katharina', 'Letsch, Anne', 'Haase, Detlef', 'Schlenk, Richard', 'Bug, Gesine', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Mossner, Maximilian']","['Jann JC', 'Nowak D', 'Nolte F', 'Fey S', 'Nowak V', 'Oblander J', 'Pressler J', 'Palme I', 'Xanthopoulos C', 'Fabarius A', 'Platzbecker U', 'Giagounidis A', 'Gotze K', 'Letsch A', 'Haase D', 'Schlenk R', 'Bug G', 'Lubbert M', 'Ganser A', 'Germing U', 'Haferlach C', 'Hofmann WK', 'Mossner M']",,"['III Medizinische Klinik, Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsmedizin Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'III Medizinische Klinik, Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsmedizin Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'III Medizinische Klinik, Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsmedizin Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'III Medizinische Klinik, Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsmedizin Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'III Medizinische Klinik, Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsmedizin Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'III Medizinische Klinik, Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsmedizin Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'III Medizinische Klinik, Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsmedizin Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'III Medizinische Klinik, Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsmedizin Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'III Medizinische Klinik, Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsmedizin Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'III Medizinische Klinik, Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsmedizin Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und Palliativmedizin, Marienhospital, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'III.

Here, we review how genetic alterations define subclasses of patients with acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. These include new subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia defined by mutations in RUNX1 or BCR-ABL1 translocations as well as a constellation of somatic structural DNA alterations in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Among patients with MDS, detection of mutations in SF3B1 define a subgroup of patients with the ring sideroblast form of MDS and a favorable prognosis. For patients with MPNs, detection of the BCR-ABL1 fusion delineates chronic myeloid leukemia from classic BCR-ABL1(-) MPNs, which are largely defined by mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL In the B-cell lymphomas, detection of characteristic rearrangements involving MYC in Burkitt lymphoma, BCL2 in follicular lymphoma, and MYC/BCL2/BCL6 in high-grade B-cell lymphomas are essential for diagnosis. In T-cell lymphomas, anaplastic large-cell lymphoma is defined by mutually exclusive rearrangements of ALK, DUSP22/IRF4, and TP63 Genetic alterations affecting TP53 and the mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region are important in clinical management of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Additionally, detection of BRAFV600E mutations is helpful in the diagnosis of classical hairy cell leukemia and a number of histiocytic neoplasms. Numerous additional examples provided here demonstrate how clinical evaluation of genomic alterations have refined classification of myeloid neoplasms and major forms of lymphomas arising from B, T, or natural killer cells.","['Taylor, Justin', 'Xiao, Wenbin', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar']","['Taylor J', 'Xiao W', 'Abdel-Wahab O']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4407-6325', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8586-8500', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3907-6171']","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Department of Medicine.', 'Department of Pathology, and.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Department of Medicine.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],['R01 HL128239/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20170609,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],IM,"['*Hematologic Neoplasms/classification/diagnosis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics']",PMC5533199,2017/06/11 06:00,2017/08/18 06:00,['2017/06/11 06:00'],"['2017/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33154-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-02-734541 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Jul 27;130(4):410-423. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-02-734541.

Response was defined as showing at least hematologic improvement. Outcomes were compared using Cox regression. Overall, 73 of 125 HMA-treated patients (58%) had died by the time of last contact. Median follow-up of survivors, measured from HCT, was 41.9 months (range, 2.7 to 98.5). The estimated probability of relapse at 3 years was 56.6% and 34.2% among failing and responding patients, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 3.66; P < .01). The estimated probability of relapse-free survival at 3 years was 23.8% and 42% in failing and responding patients, respectively (HR for relapse/death, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.19 to 2.95; P < .01). The risk of nonrelapse mortality was similar for both groups (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, .52 to 2.39; P = .77). Failure of treatment with HMA was associated with higher risk of post-HCT relapse than observed in patients responding to HMA. Prospective trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of novel conditioning regimens and post-HCT maintenance strategies in patients who have failed HMA pre-HCT.","['Festuccia, Moreno', 'Baker, Kelsey', 'Gooley, Theodore A', 'Sandmaier, Brenda M', 'Deeg, H Joachim', 'Scott, Bart L']","['Festuccia M', 'Baker K', 'Gooley TA', 'Sandmaier BM', 'Deeg HJ', 'Scott BL']",,"['Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Medical Oncology, University of Washington Medical Center/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Medical Oncology, University of Washington Medical Center/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Medical Oncology, University of Washington Medical Center/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, WA.

Numerous studies have shown that drug resistance not only exists against conventional chemotherapeutic drugs, but also limits the efficacy of new biological agents. Therefore, it is important to identify the mechanisms behind chemoresistance and seek therapeutic strategies to enhance efficacy in AML chemotherapy. MicroRNA (miR)-217 has been recognized as a tumor suppressor that is downregulated in various types of cancer, however the mechanisms behind the expression and function of miR-217 in AML have not yet been recognized. The expression of miR-217 was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Following transfection with miR-217 mimics, an MTT assay, chemosensitivity assay, cell apoptosis assay and western blot analysis were performed in AML cell lines. Functional assays were also performed to explore the effects of endogenous Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) in AML. The results revealed that miR-217 was downregulated in patients with AML. Overexpression of miR-217 inhibited cellular proliferation and enhanced cell chemosensitivity to doxorubicin by the cell apoptosis pathway in AML cells. A dual-luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that KRAS was a direct target gene of miR-217 in vitro. qPCR and western blot analysis revealed that miR-217 negatively regulated KRAS protein expression, but had no impact on KRAS mRNA expression. Knockdown of KRAS expression markedly suppressed AML cellular proliferation, and enhanced cell chemosensitivity to doxorubicin via the cell apoptosis pathway. These findings indicate that miR-217 functions as a tumor suppressor in AML by directly targeting KRAS. Therefore, miR-217-based therapeutic strategies may provide a novel strategy for the enhancement of efficacy in the treatment of AML.","['Xiao, Yi', 'Deng, Taoran', 'Su, Changliang', 'Shang, Zhen']","['Xiao Y', 'Deng T', 'Su C', 'Shang Z']",,"['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, P.R.

The occurrence of methylation requires several factors, such as DNA methylation systems and polycomb group (PcG) proteins. At present, novel drugs are needed for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), particularly considering the current prognosis of CML. The methylation status of the Src homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP1) gene, a negative regulator of signal transduction, has been identified as being altered in numerous haematological malignancies. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and the PcG protein complex member enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) participate in a number of gene methylation processes. The present study investigated the methylation status of the SHP1 gene in CML, and examined the association between DNMT1 and EZH2 activity and the SHP1 gene methylation status to develop novel strategies for the treatment of CML. The results revealed that SHP1 gene methylation status was altered during the progression of CML. These data indicated that SHP1 gene methylation is associated with the progression of this disease. The associations of DNMT1 and EZH2 activities with the methylation status of the SHP1 gene were additionally investigated via chromatin immunoprecipitation. DNMT1 and EZH2 were revealed to be bound to the promoter region of the SHP1 gene, and were involved in the process of SHP1 methylation. Furthermore, DNMT1 and EZH2 were associated with disease progression. Thus, the findings of the present study suggest a new target for the treatment of CML, particularly for future drug development.","['Wang, Jing', 'Hua, Luoming', 'Guo, Ming', 'Yang, Lin', 'Liu, Xiaojun', 'Li, Yanmeng', 'Shang, Xiaoyan', 'Luo, Jianmin']","['Wang J', 'Hua L', 'Guo M', 'Yang L', 'Liu X', 'Li Y', 'Shang X', 'Luo J']",,"['Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei 050017, P.R.

However, it is not clear how Tax-specific CTLs behave in lymph nodes of ATLL patients. The present study analyzed the immunostaining of Tax-specific CTLs. Furthermore, ATLL tumor cells are known to be positive for forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)and to have a regulatory T (Treg)-cell-like function. The association between T-reg function and number and activity of Tax-specific CTLs was also investigated. A total of 15 ATLL lymphoma cases with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A24, for which Tax has a high affinity, were selected from the files of the Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University (Kurume, Japan) using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Immunostaining was performed for cluster of differentiation (CD) 20, CD3, CD4, CD8, T-cell intracellular antigen-1 and Foxp3 in paraffin sections, and for Tax, interferon gamma and HLA-A24 in frozen sections. In addition, the staining of Tax-specific CTLs (HLA-A24-restricted) was analyzed by MHC Dextramer((R)) assay in frozen sections. In addition, the messenger RNA expression of Tax and HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor were also evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR. Immunohistochemical staining of Tax protein in lymphoma tissue revealed the presence of positive lymphoma cells ranging from 5 to 80%, and immunohistochemical staining of HLA-A24 revealed the presence of positive lymphoma cells ranging from 1 to 95%. The expression of Tax and HLA-A24 was downregulated by viral function. Foxp3, a marker for Treg cells, was expressed in 0-90% of cells. Several cases exhibited Tax-specific CTL (HLA-A24-restricted)-positive cells, and there was an inverse correlation between Tax-specific CTLs and Foxp3. However, neither Tax nor HLA-A24 expression was associated with CTL or Foxp3. Our study indicated the possibility that ATLL cells, which expressed Tax, target of CTL, evade the CTL-mediated immune control by expression of Foxp3 as a Treg function.","['Ichikawa, Ayako', 'Miyoshi, Hiroaki', 'Arakawa, Fumiko', 'Kiyasu, Junichi', 'Sato, Kensaku', 'Niino, Daisuke', 'Kimura, Yoshizo', 'Yoshida, Maki', 'Kawano, Riko', 'Muta, Hiroko', 'Sugita, Yasuo', 'Ohshima, Koichi']","['Ichikawa A', 'Miyoshi H', 'Arakawa F', 'Kiyasu J', 'Sato K', 'Niino D', 'Kimura Y', 'Yoshida M', 'Kawano R', 'Muta H', 'Sugita Y', 'Ohshima K']",,"['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University, Kurume, Fukuoka 830 0011, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University, Kurume, Fukuoka 830 0011, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University, Kurume, Fukuoka 830 0011, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University, Kurume, Fukuoka 830 0011, Japan.', 'Biostatistics Center, School of Medicine, Kurume University, Kurume, Fukuoka 830 0011, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University, Kurume, Fukuoka 830 0011, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University, Kurume, Fukuoka 830 0011, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University, Kurume, Fukuoka 830 0011, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University, Kurume, Fukuoka 830 0011, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University, Kurume, Fukuoka 830 0011, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University, Kurume, Fukuoka 830 0011, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University, Kurume, Fukuoka 830 0011, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170421,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,,PMC5453040,2017/06/11 06:00,2017/06/11 06:01,['2017/06/11 06:00'],"['2015/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2017.6067 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-6067 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2017 Jun;13(6):4611-4618. doi: 10.3892/ol.2017.6067.

The present study constructed an E1B-55 gene-deleted conditionally replicating adenovirus expressing the IL-24 gene (ZD55-IL-24). IL-24 was expressed at high levels in melanoma cells infected with ZD55-IL-24 in the presence of TMZ. The combination of ZD55-IL-24 + TMZ induced higher protein expression levels of the proapoptotic proteins B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)-like protein 4 and phosphorylated protein, gamma-H2A histone family member X (gamma-H2AX), and reduced the levels of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2, myeloid cell leukemia-1and nuclear factor-kappaB compared with either treatment individually. A dose-dependent increase in the cytopathic effects for the combination of ZD55-IL-24 and TMZ was also observed. The data of the present study suggest that the ZD55-IL-24 + TMZ combination induced increased levels of apoptosis, possibly by triggering DNA damage, in melanoma cells in vitro compared with either treatment alone. These findings suggest that this strategy may be a promising approach for the treatment of patients with malignant melanoma.","['Liang, Zhen', 'Yang, Chun-Sheng', 'Gu, Feng', 'Zhang, Lan-Sheng']","['Liang Z', 'Yang CS', 'Gu F', 'Zhang LS']",,"['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Xuzhou Central Hospital, Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221009, P.R.

Rare cases of promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARA) fusion without the reciprocal RARA-PML have been reported in cytogenetically normal samples. Conversely, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis has revealed a cryptic insertion of the RARA gene into the PML gene on chromosome 15. The current study reports a unique case with a normal karyotype and molecular evidence of the PML-RARA short isoform 3-fusion transcript, with FISH analysis revealing two fusion signals on the two copies of chromosome 15, but absence of the reciprocal on the two copies of chromosome 17. This finding raised the hypothesis of chromosome 15 uniparental isodysomy as consequence of normal chromosome 15 loss and duplication of the rearranged chromosome, as supported by polymorphic loci molecular analysis.

The present study aimed to investigate the mechanisms behind the development and progression of BC and identify potential biomarkers for it. The chromatin immunoprecipitation-DNA sequencing (ChIP-Seq) dataset GSM1642516 and gene expression dataset GSE34925 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Affy and oligo packages were used for the background correction and normalization of the gene expression dataset. Based on Limma package and the criteria of a fold change >1.41 or <0.71, and a false discovery rate adjusted P-value <0.05, differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) in euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 2 (G9A) -knockout (KO) breast samples compared with control samples were identified. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Analysis was used for the functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs. Bowtie 2 and model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq version 14 (macs14) were used for the mapping of raw reads and the identification of G9A binding sites (peaks), respectively. In addition, overlapping genes between the DEGs and genes in the peaks located in -3000 to 3000 bp centered in the transcription start sites (conpeaks) were screened out and microRNAs (miRNAs) believed to regulate those overlaps were identified through the TargetScan database. A total of 217 DEGs were identified in G9A-KO samples, which were mainly involved in the biological processes and pathways associated with the inflammatory response and cancer progression. A total of 10,422 peaks, containing 1,210 conpeaks involving 1,138 genes, were identified. Among the 1,138 genes, 15 were overlapped with the DEGs, and 35 miRNAs were identified to regulate those overlaps. Insulin-induced gene 1 was regulated by 9 genes in the miRNA-gene regulation network, which may indicate its importance in the progression of BC. The present study identified potential biomarkers of BC that may be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with the disease.","['Jiang, Wenhua', 'Liu, Pengfei', 'Li, Xiaodong']","['Jiang W', 'Liu P', 'Li X']",,"['Department of Radiotherapy, Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300211, P.R.

We have now demonstrated that protein expression of human estrogen receptor alpha 36 (ERalpha36), an alternative splicing variant of human estrogen receptor alpha 66 (ERalpha66), is highly increased in TKI-insensitive CD34+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells and BCR-ABL-T315I mutant cells, and is abnormally localized in plasma membrane and cytoplasm. Interestingly, new pre-clinically-validated analogs of Icaritin (SNG162 and SNG1153), which target abnormal ERalpha36 activity, inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis of BCR-ABL+ leukemic cells, particularly BCR-ABL-T315I mutant cells. A combination of SNG inhibitors and TKI selectively eliminates treatment-naive TKI-insensitive stem/progenitor cells while sparing healthy counterparts. Oral TKI dasatinib combined with potent SNG1153 inhibitor effectively eliminates infiltrated BCR-ABL+ blast cells and enhances survival of mice. Importantly, a unique mechanism of SNG inhibition was uncovered by demonstrating a marked interruption of the BCR-ABLTyr177-GRB2 interaction, leading to inhibition of the downstream RAS/MAPK pathway. This new combination therapy may lead to more effective disease eradication, especially in patients at high risk of TKI resistance and disease progression.","['Chen, Min', 'Turhan, Ali G', 'Ding, Hongxia', 'Lin, Qingcong', 'Meng, Kun', 'Jiang, Xiaoyan']","['Chen M', 'Turhan AG', 'Ding H', 'Lin Q', 'Meng K', 'Jiang X']",,"['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, Paris Sud University Hospitals, University Paris Sud 11 and INSERM U935, Villejuif, France.', 'Shenogen Pharma Group Ltd, Beijing, China.', 'Shenogen Pharma Group Ltd, Beijing, China.', 'Shenogen Pharma Group Ltd, Beijing, China.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Chromans)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (SNG1153)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['*Amino Acid Substitution', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromans/pharmacology', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Models, Biological', '*Mutation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Transport']",PMC5546432,2017/06/10 06:00,2018/03/30 06:00,['2017/06/10 06:00'],"['2017/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/30 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['18216 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.18216 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jul 4;8(27):43662-43677. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.18216.,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL+ human leukemia', 'ERalpha36', 'Icaritin (SNG162 and SNG1153)', 'leukemic stem cells', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical evolution is extremely variable amongst affected individuals with survival ranging from a few months in aggressive cases, to a few decades in cases of indolent CLL. The identification of new prognostic factors, apart from clinical staging, has been an important research topic aiming at a better understanding of CLL. There are approximately one thousand miRNAs in the human genome. They are expressed in specific tissues and changes in this expression are associated with different pathologies. In recent years, several studies have focused on the role of regulatory miRNAs in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including CLL. It has become evident that the profiles of miRNAs have great potential for application in the evaluation of CLL prognosis, since changes in miRNA expression profiles contribute to cell survival, proliferation and development of the disease. The deletion 13q14, the most prevalent alteration in CLL, leads to the deletion of the human tumor suppressor genes miR-15a and miR-16-1, which act on cell proliferation and in the process of apoptosis. Therefore, in patients with 13q deletion, loss of miR-15a and miR-16-1 displaces the expression balance for higher levels of Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic p53 proteins. Regarding these microRNAs, the correlation of miR-15a and miR-16-1 with low-risk CLL is of particular interest. In this context, this mini review summarizes the current evidences on the role of regulatory miRNAs in the pathogenesis of CLL, particularly miR-15a and miR-16-1, involved on cell proliferation and apoptosis. In addition, it is our intention to highlight the potential role of micro RNAs as a marker of prognosis in this disease and to arouse interest in future studies addressing this interesting issue. Several current and future studies may shed light on the role of microRNAs in the pathogenesis of CLL, possibly leading to the development of new laboratory biomarkers.","['Braga, Tatiane Vieira', 'Evangelista, Fernanda Cristina Gontijo', 'Gomes, Lorena Caixeta', 'Araujo, Sergio Schusterschitz da Silva', 'Carvalho, Maria das Gracas', 'Sabino, Adriano de Paula']","['Braga TV', 'Evangelista FCG', 'Gomes LC', 'Araujo SSDS', 'Carvalho MDG', 'Sabino AP']",,"['Clinical and Toxicological Analysis Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'Clinical and Toxicological Analysis Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'Clinical and Toxicological Analysis Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'Hematology Unit of Clinical Hospital, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'Clinical and Toxicological Analysis Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'Clinical and Toxicological Analysis Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.

We developed a shared care model where patients receive consolidation chemotherapy at a quaternary center, but post-consolidation supportive care at local hospitals. To evaluate the impact of our model on patient travel and outcomes we conducted a retrospective analysis of AML and acute promyelocytic leukemia patients receiving consolidation over four years at our quaternary center. 73 patients received post-consolidation care locally, and 344 at the quaternary center. Gender, age and cytogenetic risk did not significantly differ between groups. Shared care patients saved mean round trip distance of 146.5km+/-99.6 and time of 96.7min+/-63.4 compared to travelling to quaternary center. There was no significant difference in overall survival between groups, and no increased hazard of death for shared care patients. 30, 60, and 90day survival from start of consolidation was 98.6%, 97.2%, and 95.9% for shared care and 98.8%, 97.1%, and 95.3% for quaternary center patients.

We studied whether FF-10501-01 is effective in targeting a variety of hypomethylating agent (HMA)-sensitive and -resistant acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell lines. METHODS: We treated multiple cell lines (including HMA-resistant cells) with FF-10501-01 and analyzed proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle status. We also assessed HMA-FF-10501-01 combinations and the ability of extracellular guanosine to rescue cell proliferation in FF-10501-01-treated cells. We performed high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to study guanine nucleotide levels in treated and untreated cells. Finally, we studied the effects of FF-10501-01 in fresh peripheral blood cells taken from AML patients. RESULTS: FF-10501-01 showed a strong dose-dependent effect on proliferation and induced apoptosis at approximately 30muM. The effects of FF-10501-01 treatment on cell cycle status were variable, with no statistically significant trends. Guanosine rescued proliferation in FF-10501-01-treated cells, and HPLC results showed significant decreases in phosphorylated guanosine levels in MOLM13 cells. FF-10501-01 effectively reduced proliferation at concentrations of 300muM and above in 3 primary AML samples.

Abnormal expression of BMI1 is associated with a number of human malignances and cancer stem cells (CSCs), which cause chemotherapy resistance. Therefore, small molecules that inhibit BMI1 expression are potential candidates for cancer therapy. In this study, a cell-based reporter gene assay was developed that allowed BMI1 promoter activity to be measured in 293T human embryonic kidney cells based on luciferase expression levels. Using this screening assay, the methanol-soluble extracts of Beaumontia murtonii and Eugenia operculata were selected as leads. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the extracts led to the isolation of three known cardenolides (1-3) and one new compound (4) from B. murtonii and two known triterpenoids (5 and 6) and one new compound (7) from E. operculata. These seven compounds inhibited BMI1 promoter activity (IC50 range 0.093-23.0 muM), and the most active compound, wallichoside (1), was further evaluated. Western blot analysis revealed that wallichoside (1) decreases BMI1 protein levels in HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells, and flow cytometry analysis showed that it significantly reduced levels of the CSC biomarker epithelial cell adhesion molecule. Wallichoside (1) also inhibited sphere formation of Huh7 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, indicating that it diminished the self-renewal capability of CSCs.","['Kaneta, Yui', 'Arai, Midori A', 'Ishikawa, Naoki', 'Toume, Kazufumi', 'Koyano, Takashi', 'Kowithayakorn, Thaworn', 'Chiba, Tetsuhiro', 'Iwama, Atsushi', 'Ishibashi, Masami']","['Kaneta Y', 'Arai MA', 'Ishikawa N', 'Toume K', 'Koyano T', 'Kowithayakorn T', 'Chiba T', 'Iwama A', 'Ishibashi M']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0254-9550', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2839-1045']","['Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University , 1-8-1 Inohana, Chuo-ku, Chiba 260-8675, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University , 1-8-1 Inohana, Chuo-ku, Chiba 260-8675, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University , 1-8-1 Inohana, Chuo-ku, Chiba 260-8675, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University , 1-8-1 Inohana, Chuo-ku, Chiba 260-8675, Japan.', 'Temko Corporation , 4-27-4 Honcho, Nakano, Tokyo 164-0012, Japan.', 'Faculty of Agriculture, Khon Kaen University , Khon Kaen 40002, Thailand.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University , 1-8-1 Inohana, Chuo-ku, Chiba 260-8670, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University , 1-8-1 Inohana, Chuo-ku, Chiba 260-8670, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University , 1-8-1 Inohana, Chuo-ku, Chiba 260-8675, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170609,United States,J Nat Prod,Journal of natural products,7906882,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Cardenolides)', '0 (Triterpenes)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Apocynaceae/*chemistry', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy', 'Cardenolides/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Eugenia/*chemistry', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Plant Leaves/chemistry', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*metabolism', 'Thailand', 'Triterpenes/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology']",,2017/06/10 06:00,2017/08/31 06:00,['2017/06/10 06:00'],"['2017/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/31 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jnatprod.7b00138 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nat Prod. 2017 Jun 23;80(6):1853-1859. doi: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.7b00138.

We describe the hospitalization rate and its costs for an open population with ALL in a low-middle income country. PROCEDURE: We retrospectively analyzed 449 hospital admissions for 101 pediatric patients with ALL over 8 years. Clinical files and electronic databases were scrutinized to document causes, duration, readmission rate, costs, and outcome of each admission. Hospitalizations were divided into two categories: general pediatric ward and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Hospitalization rates and its costs per patient were estimated considering person-time at risk. RESULTS: Patients had an admission rate of 2.09 hospitalizations per patient-year and median length of stay per admission was 5 days. Most admissions occurred during the first 2 years from diagnosis. Mean cost per day was 239 US dollars (USD) and mean cost per stay was 2,246 USD versus 1,016 and 19,004 USD (P = 0.001) in the PICU, respectively. Total hospitalization cost per patient per year (PPPY) was 5,991 USD for high-risk patients and 3,038 USD for standard-risk patients. Patients between ages 1 and 9 years had a PPPY cost of $4,057; while for children younger than 1 year or older than 9 years, it was 7,463 USD. The popular medical insurance program covered 70% of hospitalizations and 63% of its total cost; patients contributed 2%, with the hospital absorbing 35%. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalizations for children with ALL were less expensive than in high-income countries but had a significant cost to low-income families and to the healthcare system.","['Jaime-Perez, Jose Carlos', 'Fernandez, Lucia Teresa', 'Jimenez-Castillo, Raul Alberto', 'Colunga-Pedraza, Julia Esther', 'Padilla-Medina, Jose Ramon', 'Mancias-Guerra, Consuelo', 'Gomez-Almaguer, David']","['Jaime-Perez JC', 'Fernandez LT', 'Jimenez-Castillo RA', 'Colunga-Pedraza JE', 'Padilla-Medina JR', 'Mancias-Guerra C', 'Gomez-Almaguer D']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6804-9095'],"['Department of Hematology, Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez University Hospital, School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology, Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez University Hospital, School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology, Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez University Hospital, School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology, Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez University Hospital, School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology, Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez University Hospital, School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology, Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez University Hospital, School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology, Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez University Hospital, School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170609,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization/*economics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Intensive Care Units, Pediatric', 'Length of Stay', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2017/06/10 06:00,2017/10/27 06:00,['2017/06/10 06:00'],"['2017/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26673 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Dec;64(12). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26673.

We prospectively studied eating behavior, energy, nutrient intake, and the effect on leptin and adiponectin levels during dexamethasone administration in children with ALL. PATIENTS: Parents of patients with ALL (3-16 years) completed a dietary diary for their child during 4 days of dexamethasone (6 mg/m(2) ) administration. Energy intake and nutrient intake (energy percentage = E%) were assessed and compared with the recommended intake. The Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire for Children was completed before start and after 4 days of dexamethasone administration by patients of 7-12 years of age. Fasting leptin and adiponectin levels were also measured before start and after 4 days of dexamethasone administration. RESULTS: Energy intake per day(kcal) (N = 44) increased significantly during dexamethasone (median day 1: 1,103 (717-1,572) versus day 4: 1,482 (1,176-1,822), P < 0.01), including an increase in total protein, fat, saturated fat, carbohydrate, and sodium intake. Intake of saturated fat (median day 4: 12 E%) and salt (median day 4: 1.9 g/day) exceeded the healthy range for age and gender. With respect to eating behavior, dexamethasone significantly decreased restrained eating (P = 0.04). Leptin levels as well as adiponectin levels increased significantly during the dexamethasone course. CONCLUSIONS: Four days of dexamethasone treatment significantly increased energy intake, including excessive saturated fat and salt intake, and changed eating behavior in children with ALL. Nutritional and behavioral interventions during dexamethasone treatment are recommended to stimulate a healthy lifestyle.","['Warris, Lidewij T', 'van den Akker, Erica L T', 'Bierings, Marc B', 'van den Bos, Cor', 'Aarsen, Femke K', 'Zwaan, Michel C', 'Tissing, Wim J E', 'Veening, Margreet A', 'Pieters, Rob', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M']","['Warris LT', 'van den Akker ELT', 'Bierings MB', 'van den Bos C', 'Aarsen FK', 'Zwaan MC', 'Tissing WJE', 'Veening MA', 'Pieters R', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8929-8119'],"[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Utrecht-Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, Utrecht, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Academic Medical Center-Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry/Psychology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170609,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Adiponectin)', '0 (Leptin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Adiponectin/blood', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/*adverse effects', 'Energy Intake', 'Feeding Behavior/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leptin/blood', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies']",,2017/06/10 06:00,2017/10/27 06:00,['2017/06/10 06:00'],"['2016/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26679 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Dec;64(12). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26679.

This study aimed to determine the frequency of hypodiploidy, ETV6-RUNX1, BCR-ABL1, and MLL rearrangement within New Zealand's pediatric ALL population and to assess whether the frequency of these ALL prognostic markers varies according to ethnicity. PROCEDURE: The New Zealand Children's Cancer Registry provided information for all registered pediatric ALL patients that were diagnosed between 2000 and 2009, with medical records available for 246 patients. Each patient's medical record was reviewed to determine the frequency of hypodiploidy, ETV6-RUNX1, BCR-ABL1, MLL rearrangement, and cell lineage. Chi-square tests for independence were undertaken to compare the frequencies of cytogenetic abnormalities according to prioritized ethnicity. RESULTS: The frequency of cytogenetic ALL abnormalities in the New Zealand pediatric population were consistent with international reference values. A low frequency of ETV6-RUNX1 was evident for Maori pediatric ALL patients (5.4%, P = 0.018), when compared to Pacific peoples (21.1%) and non-Maori/non-Pacific peoples (27.4%). This has not impacted on outcome, however, with equivalent 5-year overall survival being observed in Maori (89.4%) compared to Pacific peoples (92.0%) and non-Maori/non-Pacific peoples (90.2%). CONCLUSIONS: A lower frequency of the favorable prognostic marker ETV6-RUNX1 was observed in Maori pediatric ALL patients. This did not translate into poorer survival. Future research into biological and nonbiological prognostic factors in this patient population may assist in explaining this finding.","['Pettit, Tristan', 'Cole, Nyree', 'Leung, Wingchi', 'Ballantine, Kirsten', 'Macfarlane, Scott']","['Pettit T', 'Cole N', 'Leung W', 'Ballantine K', 'Macfarlane S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4842-8420'],"[""Children's Haematology Oncology Centre, Christchurch Hospital, Christchurch, New Zealand."", ""Starship Blood and Cancer Centre, Starship Children's Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand."", ""Starship Blood and Cancer Centre, Starship Children's Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand."", ""Children's Haematology Oncology Centre, Christchurch Hospital, Christchurch, New Zealand."", 'National Child Cancer Network NZ, Auckland, New Zealand.', ""Starship Blood and Cancer Centre, Starship Children's Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand."", 'National Child Cancer Network NZ, Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170609,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/ethnology/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics']",,2017/06/10 06:00,2017/10/27 06:00,['2017/06/10 06:00'],"['2017/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26676 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Dec;64(12). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26676.

METHODS: To evaluate different CNS-directed treatment options (intrathecal [IT] therapy, CNS irradiation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]), 261 patients (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia) with initial CNS involvement treated in trials with similar intensive chemotherapy by four cooperative European study groups (1998-2013) were studied and compared with CNS-negative patients from the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster group. RESULTS: Patient characteristics in the different study groups were comparable. Young age, high white blood cell count, extramedullary involvement other than the CNS, monoblastic morphology, and inv(16) were associated with CNS involvement (each P < 0.0001). There were no major differences in outcome between the study groups. The cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) regarding the CNS was higher in initially CNS-positive versus initially CNS-negative patients (all: 8 +/- 2% vs. 3 +/- 1%, P(Gray) = 0.001; isolated: 4 +/- 1% vs. 1 +/- 0%, P(Gray) = 0.03). However, global outcome of the CNS-positive cohort (overall survival, 64 +/- 3%; event-free survival 48 +/- 3%; and CIR 33% +/- 3%) did not differ significantly from CNS-negative patients. Risk groups defined by cytogenetics were of likewise prognostic significance in CNS-positive and -negative patients. CNS treatment with cranial irradiation was not superior compared to IT therapy and systemic chemotherapy (+/- HSCT). CONCLUSION: Although CNS relapses occurred more frequently in initially CNS-positive patients, their global outcome was similar as in CNS-negative patients. Intensified IT therapy was heterogeneous; however, at least eight applications, preferably with triple IT chemotherapy, seem to be appropriate to accompany dose-intensive systemic chemotherapy.","['Creutzig, Ursula', 'Dworzak, Michael N', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Sramkova, Lucie', 'Bourquin, Jan Pierre', 'Hasle, Henrik', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Kaspers, Gertjan', 'van den Heuvel, Mary M', 'Reedijk, Ardine M J', 'De Moerloose, Barbara', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Masetti, Riccardo']","['Creutzig U', 'Dworzak MN', 'Zimmermann M', 'Reinhardt D', 'Sramkova L', 'Bourquin JP', 'Hasle H', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Kaspers G', 'van den Heuvel MM', 'Reedijk AMJ', 'De Moerloose B', 'Locatelli F', 'Masetti R']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0045-6668'],"[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatrics, St. Anna Children's Hospital and Children's Cancer Research Institute, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Charles University Prague, Czech Pediatric Hematology Working Group (CPH), Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Institution of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Pediatric Oncology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG), The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG), The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG), The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, IRCCS Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, University of Pavia, Rome, Italy.', 'Oncologia ed Ematologia Pediatrica ""Lalla Seragnoli"" Ospedale Sant\'Orsola Malpighi Universita di Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170609,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/mortality/*therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2017/06/10 06:00,2017/10/27 06:00,['2017/06/10 06:00'],"['2017/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/21 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26664 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Dec;64(12). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26664.

The molecular details of the BcR-BcR interactions apparently dictate the clinical course of disease, with stronger affinities and longer half-lives in indolent cases, and weaker, short-lived contacts mediating the aggressive ones. The diversity of homotypic BcR contacts leading to cell-autonomous signalling reconciles the existence of a shared pathogenic mechanism with the biological and clinical heterogeneity of CLL and offers opportunities for innovative treatment strategies.","['Minici, Claudia', 'Gounari, Maria', 'Ubelhart, Rudolf', 'Scarfo, Lydia', 'Duhren-von Minden, Marcus', 'Schneider, Dunja', 'Tasdogan, Alpaslan', 'Alkhatib, Alabbas', 'Agathangelidis, Andreas', 'Ntoufa, Stavroula', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Jumaa, Hassan', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Degano, Massimo']","['Minici C', 'Gounari M', 'Ubelhart R', 'Scarfo L', 'Duhren-von Minden M', 'Schneider D', 'Tasdogan A', 'Alkhatib A', 'Agathangelidis A', 'Ntoufa S', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Jumaa H', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Ghia P', 'Degano M']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3750-7342', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0787-1883']","['Biocrystallography Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, via Olgettina 58, 20132 Milan, Italy.', 'Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, 20132 Milan, Italy.', 'B-cell Neoplasia Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, 20132 Milan, Italy.', 'Universitatsklinik Ulm, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, 20132 Milan, Italy.', 'B-cell Neoplasia Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, 20132 Milan, Italy.', 'Strategic Research Program on CLL, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, 20132 Milan, Italy.', 'Universitatsklinik Ulm, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Centre for Biological Signaling Studies, Faculty of Biology, Albert-Ludwigs University of Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Universitatsklinik Ulm, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Centre for Biological Signaling Studies, Faculty of Biology, Albert-Ludwigs University of Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany.', 'B-cell Neoplasia Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, 20132 Milan, Italy.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Center for Research and Technology, 57001 Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, New York 11030, USA.', 'Universitatsklinik Ulm, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Center for Research and Technology, 57001 Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, 75105 Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, 20132 Milan, Italy.', 'B-cell Neoplasia Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, 20132 Milan, Italy.', 'Strategic Research Program on CLL, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, 20132 Milan, Italy.', 'Biocrystallography Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, via Olgettina 58, 20132 Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['694992/European Research Council/International', 'R01 CA081554/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170609,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dimerization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Domains', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC5472768,2017/06/10 06:00,2019/01/03 06:00,['2017/06/10 06:00'],"['2016/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms15746 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms15746 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2017 Jun 9;8:15746. doi: 10.1038/ncomms15746.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The patients had a FLT3 gene expression level of 0.01-180.68 (mean 14.65) at the initial diagnosis,with AML-M1 the most expressed and AML-M6 the least expressed,but without statistical significance.The patients with a high level of FLT3 gene expression had higher peripheral blood white blood cell count (WBC) (P<0.01) and were more likely to become anemic and febrile (P<0.05).WBC [regression coefficient (B)=1.508,odds ratio (OR)=4.518,95% confidence interval(CI):1.465-13.390,P=0.009] and anemia (B=2.142,OR=8.513,95%CI:3.201-22.644,P<0.001)were predictors of higher expression of FLT3.The patients with high levels of FLT3 gene expression had lower complete remission rate (32/83),compared with those (36/44) with low levels of FLT3 gene expression (P<0.05).The Cox regression analysis showed that the patients with higher levels of FLT3 gene expression had a higher risk of death (B=1.338, relative risk=3.810, 95%CI:1.820-7.947,P<0.001).The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the patients with higher levels of FLT3 gene expression had lower survival time (56.63%) than those with lower levels of FLT3 expression (70.45%,P<0.05).

METHODS: he HEL cells were treated with Ruxolitinib in different concentrations (1 nmol/L, 5 nmol/L, 10 nmol/L, 50 nmol/L, 100 nmol/L, 500 nmol/L). The growth inhibition of Ruxolitinib on HEL cells was detected by CCK-8 assay;the mRNA expression level ofJAK2 were measured by RT-PCR and the protein level of p-JAK2, VEGF, HIF-1alpha were observed by Western blot after treated with Ruxolitinib for 24,48,72 h. Chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) test was used to testify the effect of Ruxolitinib on angiogenesis. RESULTS: Ruxolitinib with different concentrations could inhibit HEL cells proliferation. RT-PCR showed that the mRNA level ofJAK2 decreased in a concentration-dependent manner and Western blot demonstrated that the expression levels of p-JAK2, VEGF and HIF-1alpha were lower in Ruxolitinib treatment groups than those in control group (P<0.05) after HEL cells were treated with different concentrations of Ruxolitinib for 24,48,72 h. Ruxolitinib significantly suppressed blood vessels'formation in CAM. CONCLUSIONS: Ruxolitinib can inhibit VEGF, HIF-1alpha expression and angiogenesis of HEL leukemia cells by inhibiting JAK2 pathway.","['Xu, Qian', 'Liu, Gui-Min', 'Wang, Feng-Yun', 'Zhang, Li-Jun', 'Liang, Wen-Tong', 'Cheng, Zhi-Yong']","['Xu Q', 'Liu GM', 'Wang FY', 'Zhang LJ', 'Liang WT', 'Cheng ZY']",,"['Department of Hematology, the No.1 Hospital of Baoding,Baoding 071000,China.', 'Nanjing Red Cross Hospital,Nanjing 210001,China.', 'Department of Hematology, the No.1 Hospital of Baoding,Baoding 071000,China.', 'Postgraduate Research Institute, Chengde Medical College,Chengde 067000,China.', 'Department of Hematology, the No.1 Hospital of Baoding,Baoding 071000,China.', 'Department of Hematology, the No.1 Hospital of Baoding,Baoding 071000,China.', 'Postgraduate Research Institute, Chengde Medical College,Chengde 067000,China.', 'Department of Hematology, the No.1 Hospital of Baoding,Baoding 071000,China.', 'Department of Hematology, the No.1 Hospital of Baoding,Baoding 071000,China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Sichuan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Sichuan da xue xue bao.

In this clinical cohort, 1,350 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based chromosomal microarrays from 1,211 pediatric cancer patients were evaluated for copy number alterations (CNAs) associated with gene fusions. Karyotype or fluorescence in situ hybridization studies were performed in 42% of the patients. Ten percent of the bone marrow or solid tumor specimens had SNP array-associated CNAs suggestive of a gene fusion. Alterations involving ETV6, ABL1-NUP214, EBF1-PDGFRB, KMT2A(MLL), LMO2-RAG, MYH11-CBFB, NSD1-NUP98, PBX1, STIL-TAL1, ZNF384-TCF3, P2RY8-CRLF2, and RUNX1T1-RUNX1 fusions were detected in the bone marrow samples. The most common alteration among the low-grade gliomas was a 7q34 tandem duplication resulting in a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion. Additional fusions identified in the pediatric brain tumors included FAM131B-BRAF and RAF1-QKI. COL1A1-PDGFB, CRTC1-MAML2, EWSR1, HEY1, PAX3- and PAX7-FOXO1, and PLAG1 fusions were determined in a variety of solid tumors and a novel potential gene fusion, FGFR1-USP6, was detected in an aneurysmal bone cyst. The identification of these gene fusions was instrumental in tumor diagnosis. In contrast to hematologic and solid tumors in adults that are predominantly driven by mutations, the majority of hematologic and solid tumors in children are characterized by CNAs and gene fusions. Chromosomal microarray analysis is therefore a robust platform to identify diagnostic and prognostic markers in the clinical setting.","['Busse, Tracy M', 'Roth, Jacquelyn J', 'Wilmoth, Donna', 'Wainwright, Luanne', 'Tooke, Laura', 'Biegel, Jaclyn A']","['Busse TM', 'Roth JJ', 'Wilmoth D', 'Wainwright L', 'Tooke L', 'Biegel JA']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9270-6411'],"[""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, Center for Personalized Medicine, Los Angeles, California."", 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, Center for Personalized Medicine, Los Angeles, California."", 'Department of Pathology, USC Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170701,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Child', '*DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Glioma/*genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/pathology', 'Oncogene Fusion/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",,2017/06/10 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2017/06/10 06:00'],"['2017/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/31 00:00 [revised]', '2017/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22477 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2017 Oct;56(10):730-749. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22477.

The only strategy shown to be effective in reducing febrile neutropenia incidence is fluoroquinolone prophylaxis, but the safety of this class of drugs in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD-), the most common human enzyme defect, is still controversial because of the claimed association with acute haemolytic anaemia. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 242 patients treated with 628 intensive chemotherapy courses. Of these, 59 patients were with G6PD-. All patients underwent fluoroquinolone prophylaxis and were transfused according to our single-unit transfusion policy. The principal endpoint was the incidence of acute haemolytic anaemia. Secondary endpoints included the incidence of febrile neutropenia, microbiologically and clinically documented infection (MDI and CDI) and the incidence of Gram-positive or Gram-negative infections. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS: No episode of acute haemolytic anaemia was observed in the entire cohort. The incidence of MDI and CDI was similar, but the incidence of invasive fungal disease (IFD; P<.0001, HR 11.4, 95%CI 3.5-37.05) and Candida sepsis (P=.008, HR 37, 95%CI 2.01-680.9) was higher in patients with G6PD-. Interestingly, we observed a reduced incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients with G6PD- (P=.01, HR 0.46, 95%CI 0.25-0.8). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that fluoroquinolone prophylaxis in patients with G6PD-, treated with intensive chemotherapy, is feasible and safe. Our findings on the incidence of IFD and febrile neutropenia suggest that G6PD may be important in susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens and host response in neutropenic patients.","['Sanna, M', 'Caocci, G', 'Orru, F', 'Ledda, A', 'Vacca, A', 'Piras, E', 'Fozza, C', 'Deias, P', 'Tidore, G', 'Dore, F', 'La Nasa, G']","['Sanna M', 'Caocci G', 'Orru F', 'Ledda A', 'Vacca A', 'Piras E', 'Fozza C', 'Deias P', 'Tidore G', 'Dore F', 'La Nasa G']",,"['Hematology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, Bone Marrow Transplant Center, R.

The safety and efficacy analysis populations comprised 484 and 442 patients, respectively. The ATL subtype was acute in 58.9% and lymphoma in 34.2% of patients. All patients were scheduled to receive intravenous infusions of mogamulizumab (1.0 mg/kg) once weekly for eight weeks, alone or in combination with other modalities. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported in 74.0% of patients, of which 35.7% were serious and 6.2% were fatal. The priority survey items of infusion-related reaction, skin disorder, infection, immune disorder, and tumor lysis syndrome were reported in 29.3, 34.3, 22.1, 3.5, and 2.5% of patients, respectively. Graft-versus-host disease was reported in 25/42 patients who received mogamulizumab before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The best overall response rate was 57.7% overall, 57.5% in patients treated with mogamulizumab alone, and 58.2% in patients treated with combination therapy.

In a retrospective study, we aimed to determine the incidence and predictors of TH-ED in childhood APL. Data were analyzed from children and adolescents with t(15;17)-positive APL (n = 683) who started treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy in different international studies. Demographic data; initial white blood cell (WBC), peripheral blood (PB) blast, and platelet counts; hemoglobin value; coagulation parameters; morphologic variant (M3 or M3v); and induction details were analyzed. Early death was defined as death occurring within 30 days of presentation. The incidence of ED was 4.7% (32 of 683 patients). Predictors of TH-ED were identified by univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analyses (n = 25). In univariable analysis, high WBC (>10 x 10(9)/L) (P < 0.001) and high PB blast (>30 x 10(9)/L) (P < 0.001), M3v (P < 0.01), and black ethnicity (P < 0.001) were independent predictors of TH-ED. In multivariable analysis, high WBC count (P < 0.01) and obesity (i.e., body mass index >/=95th percentile for age) (P = 0.03) were predictors of TH-ED. Initial high WBC counts and obesity are likely predictors of TH-ED in childhood APL. The efficacy of novel drugs for APL-associated coagulopathy or of frontline arsenic trioxide and ATRA combination regimens in reducing ED rates in childhood APL remains to be established.","['Abla, Oussama', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Testi, Anna Maria', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Creutzig, Ursula', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Di Giuseppe, Giancarlo', 'Stephens, Derek', 'Feusner, James H', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Hasle, Henrik', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Dalla-Pozza, Luciano', 'Lassaletta, Alvaro', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Hitzler, Johann', 'Sanz, Miguel A']","['Abla O', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Testi AM', 'Montesinos P', 'Creutzig U', 'Sung L', 'Di Giuseppe G', 'Stephens D', 'Feusner JH', 'Powell BL', 'Hasle H', 'Kaspers GJL', 'Dalla-Pozza L', 'Lassaletta A', 'Tallman MS', 'Locatelli F', 'Reinhardt D', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Hitzler J', 'Sanz MA']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7446-6274'],"['Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. oussama.abla@sickkids.ca.', ""Division of Leukemia/Lymphoma, Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, USA."", 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, and Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer, Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital and Research Center Oakland, Oakland, USA."", 'Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center, Winston-Salem, USA.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, University Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', ""Department of Oncology, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, Australia."", 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Department, Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, IRCCS Ospedale Bambino Gesu, Rome, Italy.', 'University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Haematology-Oncology, University of Essen, Duisburg, Germany.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Department of Medicine, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer, Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20170608,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*genetics', '*Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/blood/chemically induced/genetics/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Obesity/blood/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Risk Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic', '*Tretinoin/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,2017/06/10 06:00,2017/08/18 06:00,['2017/06/10 06:00'],"['2017/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-017-3042-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-017-3042-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2017 Sep;96(9):1449-1456. doi: 10.1007/s00277-017-3042-6.

The undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) with giant cells, a high grade tumor of soft tissue, is very unusual, especially in young adults before the age of 40. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a human retrovirus, classified as group 1 human carcinogens by The International Agency for Research on Cancer, that causes an aggressive malignancy known as adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia and a progressive chronic inflammatory neurological disease named HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). HTLV-1 causes accumulation of genetic mutations in the host genome that could contribute to cellular transformation, one of the oncogenic features of HTLV-1. CASE REPORT: We describe a case of a young woman with UPS who suffered from HAM/TSP with 3 years of evolution. In 2013, the patient started with neurological symptoms: weakness in the legs and bladder dysfunction. One year later, the patient developed a mild paraparesis in both extremities, anti-HTLV-1 antibodies were detected in plasma and in cerebrospinal fluid, and HAM/TSP was confirmed. In November 2015, a benign ganglion cyst was first suspected without intervention and by March 2016 a sarcoma was diagnosed. Three weeks after surgical resection, the tumor aroused in deep tissue and behaved aggressively, implicating a curative wide resection of the fibula, joint reconstruction, and soft-tissue graft. Histopathological examination confirmed UPS with giant cells. CONCLUDING REMARKS: The unapparent subclinical immunodeficiency state due to HTLV-1 infection deserves to be considered in order to carefully monitor the possibility of developing any type of cancer. Besides, reaching an accurate and timely diagnosis of UPS can be challenging due to the difficulty in diagnosis/classification and delayed consultation. In this particular case, considering the high grade of UPS and the progressive invalidating myelopathy caused by HTLV-1, treatment should be carefully evaluated to positively impact on the patient's life expectancy.","['Lupo, Sergio', 'Berini, Carolina', 'Canepa, Camila', 'Santini Araujo, Eduardo', 'Biglione, Mirna']","['Lupo S', 'Berini C', 'Canepa C', 'Santini Araujo E', 'Biglione M']",,"['School of Medical Sciences (UNR) and UAI Rosario, Centralized Institute of Integral Clinical Research (CAICI), Rosario, Argentina.', 'CONICET-Universidad de Buenos Aires, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas en Retrovirus y SIDA (INBIRS), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'CONICET-Universidad de Buenos Aires, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas en Retrovirus y SIDA (INBIRS), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratory of Orthopaedic Pathology, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'CONICET-Universidad de Buenos Aires, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas en Retrovirus y SIDA (INBIRS), Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20170524,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC5442215,2017/06/10 06:00,2017/06/10 06:01,['2017/06/10 06:00'],"['2017/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2017.00091 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2017 May 24;7:91. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2017.00091. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['HTLV-1', 'immunodeficiency', 'mutation', 'myelolpathy', 'sarcoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that aberrant methylation of the topoisomerase II alpha gene causes altered gene expression and acquired drug resistance in etoposide-resistant leukemia cells. In this study, we analyzed the genome-wide methylation status in resistant leukemia cells. We used MX2, which is a morpholino anthracycline derivative that functions as a topoisomerase II alpha inhibitor. We established a human myelogenous leukemia cell line (K562/P) and a related cell line with resistance to MX2 (K562/MX2). Using these cell lines, we investigated the genome-wide methylation status, compared expression profiles with a microarray, and analyzed the data using Gene Ontology and key node analysis. We demonstrate that the MX2-resistant cell line was globally hypermethylated. Gene Ontology analysis identified genes involved in the immunological response and gene silencing that were responsible for methylation-related altered gene expression in drug-resistant cells. Key node analysis showed that p38alpha mitogen-activated protein kinase was a novel enzyme involved in MX2-related resistance. p38 kinase activity in resistant cells was increased compared to MX2-sensitive parent cells. Blocking p38alpha activity using inhibitors and p38alpha knock down with small interfering RNA restored the sensitivity to MX2 in resistant cells with a decrease in p38 kinase activity as well as decreased expression of p38alpha mRNA and phosphorylated p38alpha protein. These findings may lead to a new strategy for treatment of drug-resistant leukemia cells.","['Asano, Takeshi', 'Narazaki, Hidehiko', 'Fujita, Atsushi']","['Asano T', 'Narazaki H', 'Fujita A']",,"['Department of Pediatrics Nippon Medical School Tokyo Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics Nippon Medical School Tokyo Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics Nippon Medical School Tokyo Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20161229,United States,Pharmacol Res Perspect,Pharmacology research & perspectives,101626369,,,,PMC5461645,2017/06/10 06:00,2017/06/10 06:01,['2017/06/10 06:00'],"['2016/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2016/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1002/prp2.285 [doi]', 'PRP2285 [pii]']",epublish,Pharmacol Res Perspect. 2016 Dec 29;5(1):e00285. doi: 10.1002/prp2.285. eCollection 2017 Feb.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Drug resistance', '*key node search', '*leukemia', '*methylation array', '*morpholino anthracycline', '*p38alpha']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Skin biopsy revealed neutrophilic dermatosis and findings classical of bullous PG. Cladribine therapy (0.09 mg/kg/day by continuous intravenous infusion for 7 days) led to remission of both HCL and PG after a duration of 4 weeks.

We conducted a preliminary study to assess hearing pattern in patients with CML on long term TKI therapy. This is a single center, cross sectional study from northern-India. Patients of CML who were on regular Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) therapy for at least 6 months underwent audiovestibular evaluation . A total of 44 CML patients on TKI therapy were assessed over a period of 6 months. The median age of the patients was 41 years, the mean duration of TKI therapy was 36 months. Four patients were found to have otological disorder clinically. On pure tone audiometry of 88 ears normal hearing pattern were found with at low and mid frequencies. There was a down sloping type of curve at higher frequencies in PTA in most of the patients. Cold caloric tests in 42 patients were found as equal response in both ears. We conclude from this preliminary study that there are no audio vestibular dysfunctions amongst patients of CML on TKI.

Continuous crosstalk between cancer cells and local/distant host environment is required for effective tumor growth. Among the main actors of this dynamic interplay between tumoral cells and their microenvironment are the nano-sized vesicles called exosomes. Emerging evidence indicates that secretion, composition, and functional capacity of exosomes are altered as tumors progress to an aggressive phenotype. In CLL, no data exist exploring the specific changes in the proteomic profile of plasma-derived exosomes from patients during disease evolution. We hereby report for the first time different proteomic profiles of plasma exosomes, both between indolent and progressive CLLs as well as within the individual patients at the onset of disease and during its progression. Next, we focus on the changes of the exosome protein cargoes, which are found exclusively in patients with progressive CLL after disease progression. The alterations in the proteomic cargoes underline different networks specific for leukemia progression related to inflammation, oxidative stress, and NF-kappaB and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway activation. Finally, our results suggest a preponderant role for the protein S100-A9 as an activator of the NFkappaB pathway during CLL progression and suggest that the leukemic clone can generate an autoactivation loop through S100-A9 expression, NF-kappaB activation, and exosome secretion.

Drug combinations covering a broad range of targets may overcome resistance. CDDO-Me (bardoxolone methyl) is a drug that inhibits the survival of leukemic cells by targeting different pro-survival molecules, including STAT3. We found that CDDO-Me inhibits proliferation and survival of tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant BCR-ABL1(+) cell lines and primary leukemic cells, including cells harboring BCR-ABL1(T315I) or T315I(+) compound mutations. Furthermore, CDDO-Me was found to block growth and survival of CD34(+)/CD38(-) leukemic stem cells (LSC). Moreover, CDDO-Me was found to produce synergistic growth-inhibitory effects when combined with BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These drug-combinations were found to block multiple signaling cascades and molecules, including STAT3 and STAT5. Furthermore, combined targeting of STAT3 and STAT5 by shRNA and STAT5-targeting drugs also resulted in synergistic growth-inhibition, pointing to a new efficient concept of combinatorial STAT3 and STAT5 inhibition. However, CDDO-Me was also found to increase the expression of heme-oxygenase-1, a heat-shock-protein that triggers drug resistance and cell survival. We therefore combined CDDO-Me with the heme-oxygenase-1 inhibitor SMA-ZnPP, which also resulted in synergistic growth-inhibitory effects. Moreover, SMA-ZnPP was found to sensitize BCR-ABL1(+) cells against the combination 'CDDO-Me+ tyrosine kinase inhibitor'. Together, combined targeting of STAT3, STAT5, and heme-oxygenase-1 overcomes resistance in BCR-ABL1(+) cells, including stem cells and highly resistant sub-clones expressing BCR-ABL1(T315I) or T315I-compound mutations. Whether such drug-combinations are effective in tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant patients with chronic myeloid leukemia remains to be elucidated.","['Gleixner, Karoline V', 'Schneeweiss, Mathias', 'Eisenwort, Gregor', 'Berger, Daniela', 'Herrmann, Harald', 'Blatt, Katharina', 'Greiner, Georg', 'Byrgazov, Konstantin', 'Hoermann, Gregor', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Waliul, Islam', 'Cumaraswamy, Abbarna A', 'Gunning, Patrick T', 'Maeda, Hiroshi', 'Moriggl, Richard', 'Deininger, Michael', 'Lion, Thomas', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Valent, Peter']","['Gleixner KV', 'Schneeweiss M', 'Eisenwort G', 'Berger D', 'Herrmann H', 'Blatt K', 'Greiner G', 'Byrgazov K', 'Hoermann G', 'Konopleva M', 'Waliul I', 'Cumaraswamy AA', 'Gunning PT', 'Maeda H', 'Moriggl R', 'Deininger M', 'Lion T', 'Andreeff M', 'Valent P']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria karoline.gleixner@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Radiation Therapy, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Vienna, Austria."", 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Institute of Drug Delivery Sciences, Sojo University, Kumamoto and BioDynamics Research Laboratory, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, Canada.', 'Institute of Drug Delivery Sciences, Sojo University, Kumamoto and BioDynamics Research Laboratory, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Animal Breeding and Genetics, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Vienna, Austria."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['R01 CA178397/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170608,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",PMC5685220,2017/06/10 06:00,2018/05/08 06:00,['2017/06/10 06:00'],"['2017/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2016.163436 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2016.163436 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2017 Sep;102(9):1519-1529. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.163436.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are composed of exosomes and microparticles, play an important role in cell communication. However, little is known about their role in CLL / microenvironment interactions. In the present study, EVs purified by ultracentrifugation from BM mesenchymal stromal cell (BM-MSC) cultures were added to CLL B cells. After their integration into CLL B cells, we observed a decrease of leukemic cell spontaneous apoptosis and an increase in their chemoresistance to several drugs, including fludarabine, ibrutinib, idelalisib and venetoclax after 24 hours. Spontaneous (P=0.0078) and stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha -induced migration capacities of CLL B cells were also enhanced (P=0.0020). A microarray study highlighted 805 differentially expressed genes between leukemic cells cultured with or without EVs. Of these, genes involved in the B-cell receptor pathway such as CCL3/4, EGR1/2/3, and MYC were increased. Interestingly, this signature presents important overlaps with other microenvironment stimuli such as B-cell receptor stimulation, CLL/nurse-like cells co-culture or those provided by a lymph node microenvironment. Finally, we showed that EVs from MSCs of leukemic patients also rescue leukemic cells from spontaneous or drug-induced apoptosis. However, they induce a higher migration and also a stronger gene modification compared to EVs of healthy MSCs. In conclusion, we show that EVs play a crucial role in CLL B cells/BM microenvironment communication.","['Crompot, Emerence', 'Van Damme, Michael', 'Pieters, Karlien', 'Vermeersch, Marjorie', 'Perez-Morga, David', 'Mineur, Philippe', 'Maerevoet, Marie', 'Meuleman, Nathalie', 'Bron, Dominique', 'Lagneaux, Laurence', 'Stamatopoulos, Basile']","['Crompot E', 'Van Damme M', 'Pieters K', 'Vermeersch M', 'Perez-Morga D', 'Mineur P', 'Maerevoet M', 'Meuleman N', 'Bron D', 'Lagneaux L', 'Stamatopoulos B']",,"['Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Jules Bordet Institute, Belgium emerence.crompot@ulb.ac.be bstamato@ulb.ac.be.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Jules Bordet Institute, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Jules Bordet Institute, Belgium.', 'Center for Microscopy and Molecular Imaging (CMMI), Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Gosselies, Belgium.', 'Center for Microscopy and Molecular Imaging (CMMI), Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Gosselies, Belgium.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Grand Hopital de Charleroi, Gilly, Belgium.', 'Hematology Department, Jules Bordet Institute, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Hematology Department, Jules Bordet Institute, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Hematology Department, Jules Bordet Institute, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Jules Bordet Institute, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Jules Bordet Institute, Belgium emerence.crompot@ulb.ac.be bstamato@ulb.ac.be.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170608,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism/pathology', '*Cell Movement', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Extracellular Vesicles/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC5685228,2017/06/10 06:00,2018/05/08 06:00,['2017/06/10 06:00'],"['2016/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2016.163337 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2016.163337 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2017 Sep;102(9):1594-1604. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.163337.

Four-digit typing of HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 loci was performed in 359 pediatric ALL patients by using next-generation sequencing method. Based on genotypic data of the two loci, haplotype reconstruction was carried out. In order to investigate the possible role of the HLA-DQ complex, the HLA-DQA1 alleles were also inferred. Multivariate logistic regression analysis and a Bayesian network-based approach were applied to identify relevant genetic risk factors of asparaginase hypersensitivity. Patients with HLA-DRB1*07:01 and HLA-DQB1*02:02 alleles had significantly higher risk of developing asparaginase hypersensitivity compared to non-carriers [P=4.56x10(-5); OR=2.86 (1.73-4.75) and P=1.85x10(-4); OR=2.99 (1.68-5.31); n=359, respectively].

We describe the clinicopathologic findings of a single-institution series of 11 de novo AML cases with JAK2 V617. Methods: We identified cases of de novo AML with JAK2 V617F over a 10-year period. We reviewed diagnostic peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM) morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular studies, including next-generation sequencing. The control group consisted of 12 patients with JAK2 wild-type (wt) AML matched for age, sex, and diagnosis. Results: We identified 11 patients (0.5%) with JAK2 V617F, with a median age at diagnosis of 72.5 years (range, 36-90 years). Ten neoplasms were classified as AML with myelodysplasia-related changes and 1 as AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22). All JAK2mut AML cases showed at least bilineage dysplasia, 7 of 11 showed fibrosis, 8 of 11 had an abnormal karyotype, and 5 had deletions or monosomy of chromosomes 5 and 7. Using the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) classification, 9 patients (82%) with JAK2mut AML were intermediate-2 and adverse risk. Cases of JAK2mut AML did not have mutations in other activating signaling pathways (P=.013); 7 (64%) showed additional mutations in at least one gene involving DNA methylation and/or epigenetic modification. Patients with JAK2mut AML had a significantly higher median BM granulocyte percentage (12% vs 3.5%; P=.006) and a higher frequency of ELN intermediate-2 and adverse risk cytogenetics (P=.04) compared with those with JAK2wt AML. JAK2mut AML showed higher circulating blasts, but this difference was not significant (17% vs 5.5%; P=not significant). No difference was seen in the median overall survival rate of patients with JAK2mut AML versus those with JAK2wt AML (14 vs 13.5 months, respectively). Conclusions: De novo JAK2mut AML is rare and frequently found in patients with dysplasia, BM fibrosis, and abnormal karyotype with intermediate- or high-risk features; gene mutations in DNA methylation and epigenetic-modifying pathways; and absence of gene mutations in activating signaling pathways.","['Hidalgo-Lopez, Juliana E', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Yin, C Cameron', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Konoplev, Sergej', 'Jorgensen, Jeffrey L', 'Mohammad, Mohammad M', 'Miranda, Roberto N', 'Zhao, Chong', 'Lee, John', 'Zuo, Zhuang', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E']","['Hidalgo-Lopez JE', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Estrov Z', 'Yin CC', 'Verstovsek S', 'Konoplev S', 'Jorgensen JL', 'Mohammad MM', 'Miranda RN', 'Zhao C', 'Lee J', 'Zuo Z', 'Bueso-Ramos CE']",,,['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,101162515,"['0 (Codon)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Codon', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,2017/06/10 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2017/06/10 06:00'],"['2016/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['jnccn_15_6_009 [pii]', '10.6004/jnccn.2017.0106 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2017 Jun;15(6):790-796. doi: 10.6004/jnccn.2017.0106.,,,,['Copyright (c) 2017 by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report on a 47-year-old woman with polycythemia vera (PV) treated with pegIFNa and in complete hematologic remission who developed thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). To our knowledge, thrombotic microangiopathy has been reported as a side effect of interferon (IFN) use in patients with hepatitis and chronic myeloid leukemia, but not in those with PV. Our patient had a low ADAMTS13 level due to an inhibitor, which normalized after withholding pegIFNa and initiating treatment for TTP with therapeutic plasma exchange and corticosteroids. She experienced refractory TTP, necessitating treatment with rituximab and splenectomy. Postsplenectomy, she developed a high platelet count, warranting the need to restart treatment for PV. However, JAK2(V617F) allelic burden by real-time PCR was 0.7%, indicating that the increased platelet count was likely secondary to splenectomy. Therefore, we elected to monitor her counts and JAK2(V617F) allelic burden closely. With this case report, we hope to alert treating physicians that TTP should be considered as a complication of pegIFNa therapy in PV and that prompt discontinuation of the drug with necessary treatment should be instituted to prevent fatal complications.","['Gangaraju, Radhika', 'Kim, Soo J', 'Dong, Jing-Fei', 'Swierczek, Sabina', 'Prchal, Josef T']","['Gangaraju R', 'Kim SJ', 'Dong JF', 'Swierczek S', 'Prchal JT']",,"['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,101162515,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'Q46947FE7K (peginterferon alfa-2a)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Polycythemia Vera/*complications/diagnosis', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*therapeutic use', 'Purpura, Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic/*complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2017/06/10 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2017/06/10 06:00'],"['2016/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['15/6/757 [pii]', '10.6004/jnccn.2017.0108 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2017 Jun;15(6):757-760. doi: 10.6004/jnccn.2017.0108.,,,,['Copyright (c) 2017 by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Axons in the central nervous system do not readily regenerate after injury, leading to dysfunction of the nervous system. This failure of regeneration is due to both the low intrinsic capacity of axons for regeneration and the various inhibitors emerging upon injury. After many years of concerted efforts, however, these hurdles to axon regeneration have been partially overcome. SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes the mechanisms regulating axon regeneration. We highlight proteoglycans, particularly because it has become increasingly clear that these proteins serve as critical regulators for axon regeneration. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Studies on proteoglycans have revealed that glycans not only assist in the modulation of protein functions but also act as main players-e.g., as functional ligands mediating intracellular signaling through specific receptors on the cell surface. By regulating clustering of the receptors, glycans in the proteoglycan moiety, i.e., glycosaminoglycans, promote or inhibit axon regeneration. In addition, proteoglycans are involved in various types of neural plasticity, ranging from synaptic plasticity to experience-dependent plasticity. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Although studies on proteins have progressively facilitated our understanding of the nervous system, glycans constitute a new frontier for further research and development in this field.

We sought to identify new regulators of HSCs and AML cells from previously published HSC and leukemia stem cell (LSC) gene expression signatures. We identified PRKCH (protein kinase C eta) as a gene that is highly expressed in both mouse and human HSCs, as well as in LSCs from independent cohorts of AML patients. Prkch deletion in mice resulted in impaired HSC function. PRKCH was most highly expressed in undifferentiated (FAB M0) subtype AML, and high expression correlated with TP53 and RUNX1 mutations, high-risk cytogenetic features, and poor overall survival. Prkch deletion in an Flt3-ITD/Runx1 mutant mouse AML model did not extend survival. Thus, PRKCH is necessary for normal HSC function; its expression predicts poor survival in AML patients, but it is not required for AML to develop.","['Porter, Shaina N', 'Magee, Jeffrey A']","['Porter SN', 'Magee JA']",,"['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.

However, little is yet known about the signaling mechanism. Here, we report that lipoxygenases (LOX) contribute to the regulation of RSL3-induced ferroptosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. We show that the glutathione (GSH) peroxidase 4 (GPX4) inhibitor RSL3 triggers lipid peroxidation, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell death in ALL cells. All these events are impeded in the presence of Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), a small-molecule inhibitor of lipid peroxidation. Also, lipid peroxidation and ROS production precede the induction of cell death, underscoring their contribution to cell death upon exposure to RSL3. Importantly, LOX inhibitors, including the selective 12/15-LOX inhibitor Baicalein and the pan-LOX inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), protect ALL cells from RSL3-stimulated lipid peroxidation, ROS generation and cell death, indicating that LOX contribute to ferroptosis. RSL3 triggers lipid peroxidation and cell death also in FAS-associated Death Domain (FADD)-deficient cells which are resistant to death receptor-induced apoptosis indicating that the induction of ferroptosis may bypass apoptosis resistance. By providing new insights into the molecular regulation of ferroptosis, our study contributes to the development of novel treatment strategies to reactivate programmed cell death in ALL.","['Probst, Lukas', 'Dachert, Jasmin', 'Schenk, Barbara', 'Fulda, Simone']","['Probst L', 'Dachert J', 'Schenk B', 'Fulda S']",,"['Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Komturstr. 3a, 60528 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Komturstr. 3a, 60528 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Komturstr. 3a, 60528 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Komturstr. 3a, 60528 Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.

Ploidy changes as gain or loss of individual chromosomes are rare in AML, occurring only in about 1-2% of the affected children. Hyperdiploid karyotypes are exceedingly rare in infants less than 12 months of age. In this age group, structural rearrangements involving the KMT2A gene occur in about 58% of the cases. Among them, the translocation t(9;11)(p22;q23), KMT2A-MLLT3, is the most common abnormality accounting for approximately 22% of KMT2A rearrangements in infant AML cases. Here, we describe a 7- month-old girl with a history of fever and severe diarrhea, and a physical examination remarkable for pallor and hepatosplenomegaly. A novel complex hyperdiploid karyotype 53,XX,+X,+6,t(9;11)(p21.3;q23.3),+der(9)t(9;11)(p21.3;q23.3),dup(13)(q31q34),+14, +19,+21,+22 was characterized by high-resolution molecular cytogenetic approaches. Fluorescence in situ hybridization, multiplex-FISH, and multicolor chromosome banding were applied, revealing 2 reverse MLLT3-KMT2A fusions and a duplication of the GAS6 oncogene.

PROTACs conjugate a target warhead to an E3 ubiquitin ligase ligand via a linker. Here we examined the impact of derivatizing two different BET bromodomain inhibitors, triazolodiazepine JQ1 and the more potent tetrahydroquinoline I-BET726, via distinct exit vectors, using different polyethylene glycol linkers to VHL ligand VH032. Triazolodiazepine PROTACs exhibited positive cooperativities of ternary complex formation and were more potent degraders than tetrahydroquinoline compounds, which showed negative cooperativities instead. Marked dependency on linker length was observed for BET-degrading and cMyc-driven antiproliferative activities in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. This work exemplifies as a cautionary tale how a more potent inhibitor does not necessarily generate more potent PROTACs and underscores the key roles played by the conjugation. The provided insights and framework for structure-activity relationships of bivalent degraders are anticipated to have wide future applicability.","['Chan, Kwok-Ho', 'Zengerle, Michael', 'Testa, Andrea', 'Ciulli, Alessio']","['Chan KH', 'Zengerle M', 'Testa A', 'Ciulli A']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8654-1670'],"['Division of Biological Chemistry and Drug Discovery, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee , Dow Street, Dundee, DD1 5EH, Scotland, U.K.', 'Division of Biological Chemistry and Drug Discovery, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee , Dow Street, Dundee, DD1 5EH, Scotland, U.K.', 'Division of Biological Chemistry and Drug Discovery, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee , Dow Street, Dundee, DD1 5EH, Scotland, U.K.', 'Division of Biological Chemistry and Drug Discovery, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee , Dow Street, Dundee, DD1 5EH, Scotland, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '311460/European Research Council/International', 'BB/J001201/2/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170622,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0', '(4-(1-acetyl-4-((4-chlorophenyl)amino)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl)b', 'enzoic acid)', '0 (Aminoquinolines)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (BRD3 protein, human)', '0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Triazoles)', '105219-56-5 (WEB 2086)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (VHL protein, human)']",IM,"['Aminoquinolines/*chemistry', 'Azepines/*chemistry', 'Benzoates/*chemistry', 'Calorimetry', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Chemistry Techniques, Synthetic', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Proteolysis/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Triazoles/*chemistry', 'Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein/chemistry/metabolism']",PMC5788402,2017/06/09 06:00,2019/02/23 06:00,['2017/06/09 06:00'],"['2017/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b01912 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2018 Jan 25;61(2):504-513. doi: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b01912.

Less is known about associations with presence of non-chromosomal anomalies. METHODS: Records of children diagnosed with cancer at <20 years of age during 1984-2013 in Washington State cancer registries were linked to their birth certificates (N = 4,105). A comparison group of children born in the same years was identified. Congenital anomalies were assessed from birth records and diagnosis codes in linked hospital discharge data. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for cancer, and for specific cancer types in relation to the presence of any anomaly and specific anomalies. RESULTS: Having any congenital anomaly was associated with an increased risk of childhood cancer (OR: 1.46, 95% CI 1.28-1.65). Non-chromosomal anomalies were also associated with increased childhood cancer risk overall (OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.18-1.54), and with increased risk of several cancer types, including neuroblastoma, renal, hepatoblastoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, and germ cell tumors. Increasing number of non-chromosomal anomalies was associated with a stronger risk of childhood cancer (OR for 3+ anomalies: 3.11, 95% CI: 1.54-6.11). Although central nervous system (CNS) anomalies were associated with CNS tumors (OR: 6.05, 95% CI 2.75-13.27), there was no strong evidence of other non-chromosomal anomalies being specifically associated with cancer occurring in the same organ system or anatomic location. CONCLUSIONS: Non-chromosomal anomalies increased risk of several cancer types. Additionally, we found that increasing number of non-chromosomal anomalies was associated with a stronger risk of cancer. Pooling similar data from many regions would increase power to identify specific associations in order to inform molecular studies examining possible common developmental pathways in the etiologies of birth defects and cancer.","['Norwood, Marlena S', 'Lupo, Philip J', 'Chow, Eric J', 'Scheurer, Michael E', 'Plon, Sharon E', 'Danysh, Heather E', 'Spector, Logan G', 'Carozza, Susan E', 'Doody, David R', 'Mueller, Beth A']","['Norwood MS', 'Lupo PJ', 'Chow EJ', 'Scheurer ME', 'Plon SE', 'Danysh HE', 'Spector LG', 'Carozza SE', 'Doody DR', 'Mueller BA']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0978-5863'],"['Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', ""Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington, United States of America."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Division of Epidemiology/Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America.', 'College of Public Health and Human Sciences, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, United States of America.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', 'Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170608,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Congenital Abnormalities/epidemiology/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Washington/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC5464621,2017/06/09 06:00,2017/09/20 06:00,['2017/06/09 06:00'],"['2017/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0179006 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-09236 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Jun 8;12(6):e0179006. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0179006. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A plethora of PDTXs were generated to study solid cancers, but limited data are as yet available on hematological diseases. The aim of this review is to describe the state of art of lymphoma PDTXs, discussing future directions for the development of integrated/personalized cancer programs. RECENT FINDINGS: In the last decades, several PDTXs of lymphoproliferative disorders have been produced. Most studies focused on acute lymphoblastic leukemias, but consistent results have recently been obtained also for indolent and aggressive B-/T-cell lymphomas. These models have contributed to characterize lymphoma biology and therapy, despite technical and scientific issues have partially limited their application (e.g. high costs, relatively low engraftment rates, lack of human-derived tumor microenvironment, clonal selection of engrafted cells, limited characterization of tumor grafts). In the next future, such limitations should be overcome by new technical approaches and dedicated multiinstitutional programs. SUMMARY: PDTXs represent an unprecedented opportunity to study the biology and clinical management of lymphoproliferative disorders. Many of the current models display limitations, which will be resolved by rigorous approaches and comprehensive libraries, recapitulating the extreme heterogeneity of such neoplasms.","['Pizzi, Marco', 'Inghirami, Giorgio']","['Pizzi M', 'Inghirami G']",,"['aDepartment of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USAbSurgical Pathology and Cytopathology Unit, Department of Medicine-DIMED, University of Padova, Padova, ItalycDepartment of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Science and Center for Experimental Research and Medical Studies (CeRMS), University of Torino, Torino, ItalydDepartment of Pathology, and NYU Cancer Center, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', '*Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/genetics/immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/pathology/therapy', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2017/06/09 06:00,2017/10/20 06:00,['2017/06/09 06:00'],"['2017/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000349 [doi]', '00062752-201707000-00015 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2017 Jul;24(4):384-392. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000349.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The designed peptides potently trigger disruption of the mitochondrial outer membrane in cells dependent on Bfl-1, but not in cells dependent on other anti-apoptotic homologs. High-resolution crystal structures show that designed peptide FS2 binds Bfl-1 in a shifted geometry, relative to PUMA and other binding partners, due to a set of epistatic mutations. FS2 modified with an electrophile reacts with a cysteine near the peptide-binding groove to augment specificity.

Patients with severe congenital neutropenia are prone to recurrent, often life-threatening infections beginning in their first months of life. The most frequent pathogenic defects are autosomal dominant mutations in ELANE, which encodes neutrophil elastase, and autosomal recessive mutations in HAX1, whose product contributes to the activation of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) signalling pathway. The pathophysiological mechanisms of these conditions are the object of extensive research and are not fully understood. Furthermore, severe congenital neutropenias may predispose to myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukaemia. Molecular events in the malignant progression include acquired mutations in CSF3R (encoding G-CSF receptor) and subsequently in other leukaemia-associated genes (such as RUNX1) in a majority of patients. Diagnosis is based on clinical manifestations, blood neutrophil count, bone marrow examination and genetic and immunological analyses. Daily subcutaneous G-CSF administration is the treatment of choice and leads to a substantial increase in blood neutrophil count, reduction of infections and drastic improvement of quality of life. Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the alternative treatment. Regular clinical assessments (including yearly bone marrow examinations) to monitor treatment course and detect chromosomal abnormalities (for example, monosomy 7 and trisomy 21) as well as somatic pre-leukaemic mutations are recommended.","['Skokowa, Julia', 'Dale, David C', 'Touw, Ivo P', 'Zeidler, Cornelia', 'Welte, Karl']","['Skokowa J', 'Dale DC', 'Touw IP', 'Zeidler C', 'Welte K']",,"['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical School Hannover, Hannover, Germany.', ""University Children's Hospital, Department of General Pediatrics and Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hoppe-Seyler-Str. 1, Tubingen 72076, Germany.""]",['eng'],['R24 AI049393/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170608,England,Nat Rev Dis Primers,Nature reviews.

However, the roles of ASXL2 in normal haematopoiesis and the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies remain unknown. Here we show that deletion of Asxl2 in mice leads to the development of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-like disease. Asxl2(-/-) mice have an increased bone marrow (BM) long-term haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors compared with wild-type controls. Recipients transplanted with Asxl2(-/-) and Asxl2(+/-) BM cells have shortened lifespan due to the development of MDS-like disease or myeloid leukaemia. Paired daughter cell assays demonstrate that Asxl2 loss enhances the self-renewal of HSCs. Deletion of Asxl2 alters the expression of genes critical for HSC self-renewal, differentiation and apoptosis in Lin(-)cKit(+) cells. The altered gene expression is associated with dysregulated H3K27ac and H3K4me1/2.

We hypothesized that in addition to leukemic promyelocytes, monocytic leukemia cells may also have a higher procoagulant activity. METHODS: Fibrin formation was assessed by a one-stage clotting assay using a magnetic coagulometer. The thrombin generation test (TGT) of magnetically isolated normal human monocytes, intact leukemic cells and their isolated microparticles was performed by a fluorimetric assay. Phosphatidylserine (PS) expression of leukemic cells and microparticle number determinations were carried out by flow cytometry. RESULTS: All cell lines displayed a significant procoagulant potential compared to isolated normal human monocytes. In the TGT test, the mean of lagtime and the time to peak parameters were significantly shorter in leukemic cells (3.9-4.7 and 9.9-10.3 min) compared to monocytes (14.9 and 26.5 min). The mean of peak thrombin in various monocytic leukemia cell lines was 112.1-132.9 nM vs. 75.1 nM in monocytes; however, no significant difference was observed in the ETP parameter. Factor VII-deficient plasma abolished all procoagulant activity, whereas factor XII-deficient plasma did not affect the speed of fibrin formation and thrombin generation but modulated the amount of thrombin. Factor XI-deficient plasma affected the time to peak values in one leukemic cell line and also attenuated peak thrombin. Leukemia cell-derived microparticles from all three cell lines exerted a procoagulant effect by significantly shortening the lagtime in TGT; there was a nonsignificant difference in case of ETP parameter. CONCLUSIONS: All investigated monocytic leukemia cell lines exhibited significant thrombin generation. This phenomenon was achieved by the procoagulants on the surface of leukemic cells as well as by their microparticles.","['Hudak, Renata', 'Debreceni, Ildiko Beke', 'Deak, Ivett', 'Szabo, Gabriella Gal', 'Hevessy, Zsuzsanna', 'Antal-Szalmas, Peter', 'Osterud, Bjarne', 'Kappelmayer, Janos']","['Hudak R', 'Debreceni IB', 'Deak I', 'Szabo GG', 'Hevessy Z', 'Antal-Szalmas P', 'Osterud B', 'Kappelmayer J']",,"['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Chem Lab Med,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,9806306,"['0 (Blood Coagulation Factors)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)']",IM,"['*Blood Coagulation', 'Blood Coagulation Factors/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles/metabolism/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', '*Laboratories', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Monocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Thrombin/biosynthesis']",,2017/06/09 06:00,2017/08/02 06:00,['2017/06/09 06:00'],"['2017/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1515/cclm-2017-0021 [doi]', '/j/cclm.ahead-of-print/cclm-2017-0021/cclm-2017-0021.xml [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Chem Lab Med. 2017 Jul 26;55(8):1215-1223. doi: 10.1515/cclm-2017-0021.,['NOTNLM'],"['monocytic leukemia', 'procoagulant activity', 'thrombin generation', 'tissue factor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, recent studies showed that RIG-I participates in other various cellular activities by sensing endogenous RNAs under different circumstances. For example, RIG-I facilitates the therapy resistance and expansion of breast cancer cells and promotes T cell-independent B cell activation through interferon signaling activation by recognizing non-coding RNAs and endogenous retroviruses in certain situations. While in hepatocellular carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia, RIG-I acts as a tumor suppressor through either augmenting STAT1 activation by competitively binding STAT1 against its negative regulator SHP1 or inhibiting AKT-mTOR signaling pathway by directly interacting with Src respectively. These new findings suggest that RIG-I plays more diverse roles in various cellular life activities, such as cell proliferation and differentiation, than previously known. Taken together, the function of RIG-I exceeds far beyond that of a pattern recognition receptor.","['Xu, Xiao-Xiao', 'Wan, Han', 'Nie, Li', 'Shao, Tong', 'Xiang, Li-Xin', 'Shao, Jian-Zhong']","['Xu XX', 'Wan H', 'Nie L', 'Shao T', 'Xiang LX', 'Shao JZ']",,"['Key Laboratory for Cell and Gene Engineering of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Cell and Gene Engineering of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Cell and Gene Engineering of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Cell and Gene Engineering of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Cell and Gene Engineering of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China. xianglx@zju.edu.cn.', 'Key Laboratory for Cell and Gene Engineering of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China. shaojz@zju.edu.cn.', 'Laboratory for Marine Biology and Biotechnology, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao, 266235, China. shaojz@zju.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20170608,Germany,Protein Cell,Protein & cell,101532368,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD Box Protein 58)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DEAD Box Protein 58/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*physiology']",PMC5829270,2017/06/09 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2017/06/09 06:00'],"['2017/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13238-017-0431-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s13238-017-0431-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Protein Cell. 2018 Mar;9(3):246-253. doi: 10.1007/s13238-017-0431-5.

In Korea also, a recent study showed 10-year EFS of 78.5%. Much of the improved outcome for pediatric ALL stems from the accurate identification of prognostic factors, the designation of risk group based on these factors, and treatment of appropriate duration and intensity according to risk group, done within the setting of cooperative clinical trials. The schema of first-line therapy for ALL remains mostly unchanged, although many groups have now reported on the elimination of cranial irradiation in all patients with low rates of central nervous system relapse. Specific high risk subgroups, such as Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) ALL and infant ALL continue to have significantly lower survival than other ALL patients. The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors into therapy has led to enhanced outcome for Ph+ ALL patients. Infant ALL patients, particularly those with MLL rearrangements, continue to have poor outcome, despite treatment intensification including allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Relapsed ALL is a leading cause of mortality in pediatric cancer. Recent advances in immunotherapy targeting the CD19 of the ALL blast have shown remarkable efficacy in some of these relapsed and refractory patients.

We report updated results from RESONATE in these traditionally chemotherapy resistant high-risk genomic subgroups at a median follow-up of 19 months. Mutations were detected by Foundation One Heme Panel. Baseline mutations in the ibrutinib arm included TP53 (51%), SF3B1 (31%), NOTCH1 (28%), ATM (19%) and BIRC3 (14%). Median PFS was not reached, with 74% of patients randomized to ibrutinib alive and progression-free at 24 months. The improved efficacy of ibrutinib vs ofatumumab continues in all prognostic subgroups including del17p and del11q. No significant difference within the ibrutinib arm was observed for PFS across most genomic subtypes, although a subset carrying both TP53 mutation and del17p had reduced PFS compared with patients with neither abnormality. Reduced PFS or OS was not evident in patients with only del17p. PFS was significantly better for ibrutinib-treated patients in second-line vs later lines of therapy. The robust clinical activity of ibrutinib continues to show ongoing efficacy and acceptable safety consistent with prior reports, independent of various known high-risk mutations.","['Brown, J R', 'Hillmen, P', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Barrientos, J C', 'Reddy, N M', 'Coutre, S E', 'Tam, C S', 'Mulligan, S P', 'Jaeger, U', 'Barr, P M', 'Furman, R R', 'Kipps, T J', 'Cymbalista, F', 'Thornton, P', 'Caligaris-Cappio, F', 'Delgado, J', 'Montillo, M', 'DeVos, S', 'Moreno, C', 'Pagel, J M', 'Munir, T', 'Burger, J A', 'Chung, D', 'Lin, J', 'Gau, L', 'Chang, B', 'Cole, G', 'Hsu, E', 'James, D F', 'Byrd, J C']","['Brown JR', 'Hillmen P', ""O'Brien S"", 'Barrientos JC', 'Reddy NM', 'Coutre SE', 'Tam CS', 'Mulligan SP', 'Jaeger U', 'Barr PM', 'Furman RR', 'Kipps TJ', 'Cymbalista F', 'Thornton P', 'Caligaris-Cappio F', 'Delgado J', 'Montillo M', 'DeVos S', 'Moreno C', 'Pagel JM', 'Munir T', 'Burger JA', 'Chung D', 'Lin J', 'Gau L', 'Chang B', 'Cole G', 'Hsu E', 'James DF', 'Byrd JC']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5157-4376'],"['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'St James Institute of Oncology, Leeds, UK.', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY, USA.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', ""Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia."", 'Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, Australia.', 'Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'University of Rochester Cancer Center, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Weill Cornell Medical College/New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA.', 'UCSD Moores Cancer Center, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Hopital Avicenne, Paris, France.', 'Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Niguarda Cancer Center Niguarda Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Hospital de la Santa Creu Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Swedish Cancer Institute, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'St James Institute of Oncology, Leeds, UK.', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA177292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170608,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Piperidines', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrazoles/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",PMC5770586,2017/06/09 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2017/06/09 06:00'],"['2017/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/11 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017175 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.175 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Jan;32(1):83-91. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.175.

We designed a TCRalpha VJC PCR to identify clonal TCRalpha rearrangements in 32% of 127 T-ALLs, including 0/52 immature/TCRgammadelta lineage cases and 41/75 (55%) TCRalphabeta lineage cases. Amongst the latter, TCRalpha rearrangements were not identified in 30/54 (56%) of IMbeta/pre-alphabeta early-cortical T-ALLs, of which the majority (21/30) expressed TLX1/3. We reasoned that the remaining T-ALLs might express other NKL proteins, so compared transcript levels of 46 NKL in T-ALL and normal thymic subpopulations. Ectopic overexpression of 10 NKL genes, of which six are unreported in T-ALL (NKX2-3, BARHL1, BARX2, EMX2, LBX2 and MSX2), was detectable in 17/104 (16%) T-ALLs. Virtually all NKL overexpressing T-ALLs were TCRalpha unrearranged and ectopic NKL transcript expression strongly repressed Ealpha activity, suggesting that ectopic NKL expression is the major determinant in early-cortical thymic T-ALL maturation arrest. This immunogenetic T-ALL subtype, defined by TCRbeta VDJ but no TCRalpha VJ rearrangement, is associated with a favorable outcome in GRAALL-treated adult T-ALLs.","['Villarese, P', 'Lours, C', 'Trinquand, A', 'Le Noir, S', 'Belhocine, M', 'Lhermitte, L', 'Cieslak, A', 'Tesio, M', 'Petit, A', 'LeLorch, M', 'Spicuglia, S', 'Ifrah, N', 'Dombret, H', 'Langerak, A W', 'Boissel, N', 'Macintyre, E', 'Asnafi, V']","['Villarese P', 'Lours C', 'Trinquand A', 'Le Noir S', 'Belhocine M', 'Lhermitte L', 'Cieslak A', 'Tesio M', 'Petit A', 'LeLorch M', 'Spicuglia S', 'Ifrah N', 'Dombret H', 'Langerak AW', 'Boissel N', 'Macintyre E', 'Asnafi V']",,"['Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Cite, Institut Necker Enfants-Malades (INEM), Institut National de Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1151, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Cite, Institut Necker Enfants-Malades (INEM), Institut National de Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1151, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Cite, Institut Necker Enfants-Malades (INEM), Institut National de Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1151, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Cite, Institut Necker Enfants-Malades (INEM), Institut National de Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1151, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Cite, Institut Necker Enfants-Malades (INEM), Institut National de Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1151, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Paris, France.', 'Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, TAGC UMR1090, Marseille, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Cite, Institut Necker Enfants-Malades (INEM), Institut National de Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1151, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Cite, Institut Necker Enfants-Malades (INEM), Institut National de Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1151, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Cite, Institut Necker Enfants-Malades (INEM), Institut National de Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1151, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncologie Pediatrique, Hopital Trousseau Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Paris, France.', 'Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, TAGC UMR1090, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier, Angers, France.', ""University Paris 7, Hopital Saint-Louis, AP-HP, Department of Hematology and Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Paris, France."", 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', ""University Paris 7, Hopital Saint-Louis, AP-HP, Department of Hematology and Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Paris, France."", 'Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Cite, Institut Necker Enfants-Malades (INEM), Institut National de Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1151, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Cite, Institut Necker Enfants-Malades (INEM), Institut National de Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1151, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20170608,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'HeLa Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*metabolism']",,2017/06/09 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2017/06/09 06:00'],"['2016/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017176 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.176 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Jan;32(1):61-71. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.176.

Advances in DNA sequencing have led to the discovery that clonal hematopoiesis is remarkably common and occurs in a wide variety of settings, each often described by unique acronym. These distinctions can be useful as the implications of clonal hematopoiesis depend almost entirely on the clinical context in which it is identified. However, some generalizations can be made. The prevalence of clonal hematopoiesis increases with age, particularly after the fifth decade of life. Clonal hematopoiesis in normal individuals with very small clones is typically benign, while patients with clinically abnormal hematopoiesis, larger clones and more driver gene mutations appear to be at much greater risk. Understanding the significance of clonal hematopoiesis in the various contexts in which it occurs can influence how physicians assess risk, select therapies and counsel their patients. This concise review examines the implications of clonal hematopoiesis in several settings, including normal aging, aplastic anemia, unexplained cytopenias and patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy.","['Bejar, R']",['Bejar R'],,"['Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of California, San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, CA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170608,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Aging', 'Clone Cells/*pathology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Risk Assessment']",,2017/06/09 06:00,2017/09/29 06:00,['2017/06/09 06:00'],"['2017/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017181 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.181 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Sep;31(9):1869-1871. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.181.

In the 2016 revision of the World Health Organization classification of lymphoid malignancies, firstly, disease-specific mutations such as MYD88 L265P in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and BRAF V600E in hairy cell leukemia were incorporated into diagnostic tests, and secondly, the determination of cell-of-origin in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was strongly recommended in diagnosis. Ibrutinib or lenalidomide was shown to be more effective in activated B-cell (ABC) -type-DLBCL than in germinal center B-cell type-DLBCL. Therefore, randomized trials to evaluate the efficacy of adding these agents to standard chemoimmunotherapy focused on the ABC type-DLBCL.

The World Health Organization classification was revised in 2016. ALL was included within the subgroup of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia. New provisional entities with recurrent abnormalities have been recognized and incorporated into the classification. Treatment of ALL involves some of the most complex chemotherapy combinations and treatment schedules used in oncology. Two main chemotherapy regimens are being used. The Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster framework consists of an induction regimen, consolidation regimen, reintensification regimen, and maintenance therapy and is mostly used in Europe for adult ALL trials. Another approach is to alternatively repeat two different intensive chemotherapy cycles, such as the hyper-CVAD regimen designed by investigators at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. Furthermore, the treatment of older patients with ALL is an unmet medical need.

The patient received peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a one haplotype HLA-mismatched daughter after total body irradiation and the administration of fludarabine as a myeloablative conditioning regimen, followed by post-transplant cyclophosphamide. While subsequent acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was never more than Grade I, severe chronic GVHD (cGVHD) developed in the oral cavity and skin that was resistant to escalated doses of cyclosporine and prednisolone. The patient subsequently had a second relapse of ATL as a subcutaneous mass and eventually died of disease progression. Mogamulizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG that targets CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) and is a key treatment option for relapsed ATL. It reportedly increases the risk of acute GVHD after HSCT due to the depletion of CCR4-positive regulatory T-cells; however, information on its impact on cGVHD is unavailable. Here, we discuss the potential risks and benefits of mogamulizumab, particularly in a haploidentical donor setting during a HSCT for ATL.","['Kusakabe, Manabu', 'Kurita, Naoki', 'Nishikii, Hidekazu', 'Sato, Rie', 'Yoshida, Chikashi', 'Yokoyama, Yasuhisa', 'Sakata-Yanagimoto, Mamiko', 'Obara, Naoshi', 'Hasegawa, Yuichi', 'Chiba, Shigeru']","['Kusakabe M', 'Kurita N', 'Nishikii H', 'Sato R', 'Yoshida C', 'Yokoyama Y', 'Sakata-Yanagimoto M', 'Obara N', 'Hasegawa Y', 'Chiba S']",,"['Department of Hematology, University of Tsukuba Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Tsukuba Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Tsukuba Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Tsukuba Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Mito Medical Center.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Tsukuba Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Tsukuba Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Tsukuba Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Tsukuba Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Tsukuba Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba.']",['jpn'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'YI437801BE (mogamulizumab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Haplotypes', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*therapy/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2017/06/09 06:00,2017/11/09 06:00,['2017/06/09 06:00'],"['2017/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.58.449 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2017;58(5):449-454. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.58.449.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', '*haploidentical transplantation', '*mogamulizumab', '*post-transplantation cyclophosphamide']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After induction chemotherapy and four courses of consolidation therapy, he underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation (CBT) in his first remission. He developed acute graft-versus-host disease (skin stage 2) after successful engraftment. On post-transplantation day 147, he was admitted to the hospital suffering from pneumonia. During the treatment, drastic thrombocytopenia was observed on day 251. Both platelet-associated immunoglobulin G and platelet antibody producing B cells were detected, and he was diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Treatment with prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day), eltrombopag (25 mg/day), and intravenous immunoglobulin (400 mg/kg) was commenced, but there was no improvement in his platelet count. After switching from eltrombopag to romiplostim (350 microg/week), and addition of cyclosporine, the platelet count rapidly elevated to 150,000/microl. ITP after allogenic stem cell transplantation is a rare complication, and it is often refractory to the 1st-line treatment such as steroids.

The clinicopathological characteristics of cryptococcal lymphadenitis are not well known. We analyzed three cases of cryptococcal lymphadenitis and compared their characteristics with those in previous reports. Two patients were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) carriers, and one patient was a human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) carrier. The age of the HTLV-1 carrier with cryptococcosis was much higher than that of the HIV-1 carriers. CD4-positive cell counts in peripheral blood were 5.8/muL (Case 1) and 79.9/muL (Case 2) in the HIV carriers and 3285/muL in the HTLV-1 carrier (Case 3). According to flow cytometric analysis of the lymph nodes of Cases 1, 2, and 3, 50.0%, 87.1%, and 85.9%, respectively, of the T-cells were CD3; 9.8%, 16.3%, and 75.8%, respectively, were CD4; and 35.5%, 77.3%, and 10.2%, respectively, were CD8. Cryptococcus neoformans was detected in tissue culture in all patients. Although gelatinous lesions and numerous fungal cocci were observed in the two HIV patients, the granuloma formation was small. Gelatinous formation and granuloma formation were observed in the HTLV-1 carrier. Necrosis was observed in all cases. In previous reports, granuloma formation, epithelioid cells, and necrotic lesions were observed in most cases. Most of the patients were also immunosuppressed. However, no HTLV-1 carrier was detected. In conclusion, lymphadenopathy in a HTLV-1 carrier may suggest the presence of cryptococcal lymphadenitis. The frequency of cryptococcosis in HTVL-1 carriers may increase with increase in the long-term survival rate of HTLV-1 carriers.","['Kawamoto, Keisuke', 'Miyoshi, Hiroaki', 'Suzuki, Takaharu', 'Muto, Reiji', 'Yamada, Kyohei', 'Yanagida, Eriko', 'Koshino, Mayuko', 'Sasaki, Yuya', 'Takizawa, Jun', 'Sone, Hirohito', 'Sugita, Yasuo', 'Seto, Masao', 'Ohshima, Koichi']","['Kawamoto K', 'Miyoshi H', 'Suzuki T', 'Muto R', 'Yamada K', 'Yanagida E', 'Koshino M', 'Sasaki Y', 'Takizawa J', 'Sone H', 'Sugita Y', 'Seto M', 'Ohshima K']",,"['Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Faculty of Medicine, Niigata University.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University.', 'Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Faculty of Medicine, Niigata University.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University.', 'Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Faculty of Medicine, Niigata University.', 'Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Faculty of Medicine, Niigata University.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20170608,Japan,J Clin Exp Hematop,Journal of clinical and experimental hematopathology : JCEH,101141257,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers', 'Biopsy', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Colony Count, Microbial', 'Cryptococcosis/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/complications', 'HTLV-I Infections/complications', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphadenitis/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Male', 'Phenotype']",PMC6144269,2017/06/09 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2017/06/09 06:00'],"['2017/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3960/jslrt.17011 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Exp Hematop. 2017 Jul 5;57(1):26-30. doi: 10.3960/jslrt.17011.

Several new therapies for ATL have since been developed, i.e. dose-intensity multi-agent chemotherapies, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), monoclonal antibodies, and anti-viral therapy. The monoclonal antibody to CCR4, mogamulizumab, clearly improved response rates in patients with treatment-naive and relapsed aggressive ATL, and has the potential to provide a survival advantage. The outcomes of allo-HSCT have been reported since the early 2000s. High treatment-related mortality was initially the crucial issue associated with this treatment approach; however, reduced intensity conditioning regimens have decreased the risk of treatment-related mortality. The introduction of allo- HSCT has had a positive impact on the prognosis of and potential curability with treatments for ATL. A meta-analysis of a treatment with interferon-alpha and zidovudine (IFN/AZT) revealed a survival benefit in patients with the leukemic subtype. A phase 3 study comparing IFN/AZT with watchful waiting in patients with indolent ATL is ongoing in Japan. Several clinical trials on novel agents are currently being conducted, such as the histone deacetylase inhibitors, alemtuzumab, brentuximab vedotin, nivolumab, and an EZH1/2 dual inhibitor.","['Katsuya, Hiroo', 'Ishitsuka, Kenji']","['Katsuya H', 'Ishitsuka K']",,"['Center for AIDS Research, Kumamoto University.', 'Department of Medicine, Imperial College London.', 'Division of Hematology and Immunology, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170608,Japan,J Clin Exp Hematop,Journal of clinical and experimental hematopathology : JCEH,101141257,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods']",PMC6144188,2017/06/09 06:00,2018/08/01 06:00,['2017/06/09 06:00'],"['2017/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3960/jslrt.17008 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Exp Hematop. 2017 Dec 27;57(3):87-97. doi: 10.3960/jslrt.17008.

RESULTS: The TT genotype did not show more toxicity compared with the CC/CT genotype. However, plasma MTX levels were related with mucositis, but not with hematological toxicity, nor hepatotoxicity. Survival rates did not differ between homozygous and non-homozygous patients. Yet, homozygous patients had higher relapse risk.

In this report, we describe the patient characteristics, engraftment, toxicity of treatment, complications, overall survival, and relapse incidence of 79 patients treated chemotherapy and followed by auto-HSCT. The descriptive statistics was used, and the method of Kaplan and Meier was applied to calculate the actuarial rate of overall survival. The patients achieved an absolute neutrophile count (ANC) of >/= 0.5 x109/l in between 10 to 40 days; median was 14 days after auto-HSCT. The patients achieved platelet count >/= 20 x109/l in between 10 to 209 days; median was 19 days after auto-HSCT. Hundred-day mortality after autologous transplant was 6.57% (5/76). The relapse rate was 39.5% (32 patients) and 7 patients (8.6%) were lost from follow-up.

Methods: The lineage(-) (Lin(-)) cells of C57BL/6J were transduced with retrovirus carrying MSCV-MLL-AF9-IRES-GFP fusion gene. The transduced cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated recipient mice to induce AML, and then the AML mouse model were established. The leukemia mice were treated with vehicle, dasatinib, PP242, dasatinib+ PP242, separately. The survival of the recipient mice was observed and the percentage of leukemia cells in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) was examined every four days. The apoptosis rates and cell cycle status of leukemia cells were also examined by FLOW. The leukemia cells in different group were sorted, the mRNA of these leukemia were extracted and reverse transcripted for related gene expression by qRT-PCR. The molecular mechanism of supression of leukemia cells growth was studied via RNA-Seq experiments. Results: Compared with control group, either PP242 or dasatinib could prolong the survival rate of recipient mice, however, the combination treatment AML mice with PP242 and dasatinib prolonged the life span of AML mice more significantly. The combination of PP242 and dasatinib could decrease the percentage of leukemia cells in PB and BM more significantly, arresting more leukemia cells in G0 phase, inducing more apoptosis of leukemia cells. Conclusion: Combination of tryosine kinase inhibitor-dasatinib and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway inhibitor- PP242 could delay the progression of AML by inducing more leukemia to apoptosis and arrest more leukemia cells in the cell cycle G0 phase, it may be provied a new method for clinical therapy.","['Qu, Y H', 'Liu, H T', 'He, F C']","['Qu YH', 'Liu HT', 'He FC']",,"['Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Key Clinical Laboratory of Henan Province, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Purines)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'H5669VNZ7V (PP242)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Indoles/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Purines/*therapeutic use']",,2017/06/09 06:00,2018/07/03 06:00,['2017/06/09 06:00'],"['2017/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0376-2491.2017.20.017 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2017 May 30;97(20):1584-1588. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0376-2491.2017.20.017.,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia, myeloid, acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular mechanisms of pharmacological action']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 64 adult patients who received their first allogeneic stem cell transplantation between March 2010 and December 2014; the follow-up time was 2 years. RESULTS: Acute leukemia was the most frequent underlying disease (45.3%), and conditioning included myeloablative (67.2%) and nonmyeloablative protocols (32.8%). All patients received 10 mg of alemtuzumab on day -2 (20 mg in case of mismatch) as GvHD prophylaxis. Twenty-seven patients (41.5%) developed cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation. BKPyV-associated hemorrhagic cystitis was diagnosed in 10 patients (15.6%). Other opportunistic infections caused by viruses or protozoa occurred rarely (<10%). There was no association of BKPyV or JCPyV with CMV reactivation, Epstein-Barr virus reactivation, human herpes virus 6, or parvovirus B19 infection requiring treatment. There was a significant correlation of BKPyV-associated hemorrhagic cystitis with toxoplasmosis (p = 0.013). Additionally, there was a significant link of simultaneous BKPyV and JCPyV viruria with toxoplasmosis (p = 0.047). BKPyV and JCPyV were not associated with GvHD, relapse, or death. CONCLUSION: We found no association of BKPyV or JCPyV with viral infections or GvHD. Only the correlation of both polyomaviruses with toxoplasmosis was significant. This is a novel and interesting finding.","['Schneidewind, Laila', 'Neumann, Thomas', 'Knoll, Florian', 'Zimmermann, Kathrin', 'Smola, Sigrun', 'Schmidt, Christian Andreas', 'Kruger, William']","['Schneidewind L', 'Neumann T', 'Knoll F', 'Zimmermann K', 'Smola S', 'Schmidt CA', 'Kruger W']",,"['Institute of Virology, Saarland University Medical Center, Saarland University, Homburg/Saar, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170608,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'BK Virus/physiology', 'Cystitis/diagnosis/etiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'JC Virus/physiology', 'Leukemia/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Opportunistic Infections/complications/*diagnosis/pathology/virology', 'Polyomavirus Infections/complications/virology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Toxoplasma/isolation & purification', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Virus Infections/complications/virology', 'Urinary Tract Infections/complications/diagnosis']",,2017/06/08 06:00,2017/09/20 06:00,['2017/06/08 06:00'],"['2016/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['000468972 [pii]', '10.1159/000468972 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2017;138(1):3-9. doi: 10.1159/000468972.

Therefore, the development of methods that produce functional human astrocytes represents an advance in the study of neurological diseases. Here we report an efficient method for inflammation-responsive astrocyte generation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and embryonic stem cells. This protocol uses an intermediate glial progenitor stage and generates functional astrocytes that show levels of glutamate uptake and calcium activation comparable with those observed in human primary astrocytes. Stimulation of stem cell-derived astrocytes with interleukin-1beta or tumor necrosis factor alpha elicits a strong and rapid pro-inflammatory response. RNA-sequencing transcriptome profiling confirmed that similar gene expression changes occurred in iPSC-derived and primary astrocytes upon stimulation with interleukin-1beta. This protocol represents an important tool for modeling in-a-dish neurological diseases with an inflammatory component, allowing for the investigation of the role of diseased astrocytes in neuronal degeneration.","['Santos, Renata', 'Vadodaria, Krishna C', 'Jaeger, Baptiste N', 'Mei, Arianna', 'Lefcochilos-Fogelquist, Sabrina', 'Mendes, Ana P D', 'Erikson, Galina', 'Shokhirev, Maxim', 'Randolph-Moore, Lynne', 'Fredlender, Callie', 'Dave, Sonia', 'Oefner, Ruth', 'Fitzpatrick, Conor', 'Pena, Monique', 'Barron, Jerika J', 'Ku, Manching', 'Denli, Ahmet M', 'Kerman, Bilal E', 'Charnay, Patrick', 'Kelsoe, John R', 'Marchetto, Maria C', 'Gage, Fred H']","['Santos R', 'Vadodaria KC', 'Jaeger BN', 'Mei A', 'Lefcochilos-Fogelquist S', 'Mendes APD', 'Erikson G', 'Shokhirev M', 'Randolph-Moore L', 'Fredlender C', 'Dave S', 'Oefner R', 'Fitzpatrick C', 'Pena M', 'Barron JJ', 'Ku M', 'Denli AM', 'Kerman BE', 'Charnay P', 'Kelsoe JR', 'Marchetto MC', 'Gage FH']",,"[""Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA; Ecole Normale Superieure, PSL Research University, CNRS, Inserm, Institut de Biologie de l'Ecole Normale Superieure (IBENS), 46 rue d'Ulm, 75005 Paris, France."", 'Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'The Razavi Newman Integrative Genomics and Bioinformatics Core Facility, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'The Razavi Newman Integrative Genomics and Bioinformatics Core Facility, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Flow Cytometry Core Facility, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'The Razavi Newman Integrative Genomics and Bioinformatics Core Facility, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', ""Ecole Normale Superieure, PSL Research University, CNRS, Inserm, Institut de Biologie de l'Ecole Normale Superieure (IBENS), 46 rue d'Ulm, 75005 Paris, France."", 'Department of Psychiatry, VA San Diego Healthcare System, La Jolla, CA 92151, USA; Department of Psychiatry, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.

Here, we show that ESCs can occupy a spectrum of distinct transcriptional and epigenetic states in response to varied extrinsic conditions. This spectrum broadly corresponds to a developmental continuum of pluripotency and is coupled with a gradient of increasing global DNA methylation. Each pluripotent state is linked with activation of distinct classes of transposable elements (TEs), which in turn influence ESCs through generating chimeric transcripts. Moreover, varied ESC culture parameters differentially license heterogeneous activation of master lineage regulators, including Sox1, Gata4, or Blimp1, and influence differentiation. Activation of Blimp1 is prevalent in 2i (without LIF) conditions, and marks a dynamic primordial germ cell (PGC)-like sub-state that is directly repressed by Klf4 downstream of LIF/STAT3 signaling. Thus, extrinsic cues establish a spectrum of pluripotent states, in part by modulating sub-populations, as well as directing the transcriptome, epigenome, and TE.","['Hackett, Jamie A', 'Kobayashi, Toshihiro', 'Dietmann, Sabine', 'Surani, M Azim']","['Hackett JA', 'Kobayashi T', 'Dietmann S', 'Surani MA']",,"['Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QN, UK; Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3DY, UK; European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) - Monterotondo, via Ramarini 32, 00015, Rome, Italy.', 'Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QN, UK; Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3DY, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QN, UK; Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3DY, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QN, UK; Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3DY, UK.

This finding of a pluripotent ground state has led to conceptual and practical advances, including the establishment of germline-competent ESCs from recalcitrant mouse strains and for the first time from the rat. Here, we summarize historical and recent progress in defining the signaling environment that supports self-renewal. We compare the contrasting requirements of two types of pluripotent stem cell, naive ESCs and primed post-implantation epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), and consider the outstanding challenge of generating naive pluripotent stem cells from different mammals.","['Ying, Qi-Long', 'Smith, Austin']","['Ying QL', 'Smith A']",,"['Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at USC, Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.

Therefore we determined the expression pattern and subcellular distribution of Dg complex in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) primary blasts (M1, M2, and M3 phenotypes), as well as HL-60 and Kasumi-1 leukemia cell lines. Additionally, we evaluated the relative expression of the main enzymes controlling alpha-Dg glycosylation to ascertain the post-translational modifications in the leukemia cell phenotype. MAIN METHODS: Primary leukemia blasts and leukemia cell lines were processed by confocal analysis to determine the subcellular distribution of alpha-Dg, beta-Dg, and phosphorylated beta-Dg (Y892), to evaluate the expression pattern of the different Dg species we performed Western Blot (WB) assays, while the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of enzymes involved in alpha-Dg glycosylation, such as POMGnT1, POMT1, POMT2, LARGE, FKTN, and FKRP, were evaluated by qualitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). Finally, in an attempt to ameliorate the leukemia cell phenotype, we transfected leukemia cells with a plasmid expressing the Dg complex. KEY FINDINGS: The Dg complex was altered in leukemia cells, including decreased mRNA, protein, and alpha-Dg glycosylated levels, mislocalization of beta-Dg, and a diminution of mRNA expression of LARGE in patients leukemia blasts and in cell lines. Interestingly, the exogenous expression of Dg complex promoted filopodial formation, differentiation, and diminished proliferation, attenuating some HL-60 and Kasumi cells characteristics. SIGNIFICANCE: Dg complex integrity and balance are required for a proper hematopoietic cell function, in that its disruption might contribute to leukemia pathophysiology.","['Alonso-Rangel, Lea', 'Benitez-Guerrero, Tizziani', 'Martinez-Vieyra, Ivette', 'Cisneros, Bulmaro', 'Martinez-Tovar, Adolfo', 'Winder, Steve J', 'Cerecedo, Doris']","['Alonso-Rangel L', 'Benitez-Guerrero T', 'Martinez-Vieyra I', 'Cisneros B', 'Martinez-Tovar A', 'Winder SJ', 'Cerecedo D']",,"['Laboratorio de Hematobiologia, Escuela Nacional de Medicina y Homeopatia (ENMH), Instituto Politecnico Nacional (IPN), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Hematobiologia, Escuela Nacional de Medicina y Homeopatia (ENMH), Instituto Politecnico Nacional (IPN), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Hematobiologia, Escuela Nacional de Medicina y Homeopatia (ENMH), Instituto Politecnico Nacional (IPN), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Genetica y Biologia Molecular, Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del IPN (Cinvestav-IPN), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital General de Mexico Dr. Eduardo Liceaga, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.', 'Laboratorio de Hematobiologia, Escuela Nacional de Medicina y Homeopatia (ENMH), Instituto Politecnico Nacional (IPN), Mexico City, Mexico.

They are characterized by cytopenia(s), dysplasia of one or more cell lines, ineffective hematopoiesis, and an increased risk for developing acute myelogenous leukemia. The classification of MDS has been complicated due to the great heterogeneity in clinical phenotype as well as in the morphological and cytogenetic characteristics. The prognostic value of cytogenetic abnormalities in MDS has been analyzed in multicenter studies. This approach raised the development of the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R), which analyzes five prognostic variables, among which the cytogenetic study stands out. According to the cytogenetic findings, a classification of MDS in five subgroups was developed. Knowledge of the cytogenetic abnormalities has led to the study of genes involved in various chromosomal rearrangements. Moreover, DNA sequencing has helped to identify mutations in approximately 50 genes related to signal transduction, DNA methylation, transcriptional regulation, and RNA splicing. Therefore, the cytogenetic study should be used to improve the classification and therapeutic management of MDS. This approach will be an essential tool for the development of targeted therapy protocols.","['Borjas-Gutierrez, Cesar', 'Dominguez-Cruz, Martin Daniel', 'Gonzalez-Garcia, Juan Ramon']","['Borjas-Gutierrez C', 'Dominguez-Cruz MD', 'Gonzalez-Garcia JR']",,"['Division de Genetica, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Occidente, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. medinhemato@hotmail.com.']",['spa'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Mexico,Rev Med Inst Mex Seguro Soc,Revista medica del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social,101243727,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Genetic Markers', '*Genetic Testing', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2017/06/08 06:00,2018/04/19 06:00,['2017/06/08 06:00'],"['2017/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rev Med Inst Mex Seguro Soc. 2017 Jul-Aug;55(4):481-489.,['NOTNLM'],"['Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'Genetic translocation', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes']",,,,,La citogenetica de los sindromes mielodisplasicos y su impacto como factor pronostico.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective was to evaluate the quality of life of patients with leukemia and its relationship with psychological, familial and disease-related aspects. METHODS: An analytic cross-sectional study was carried out in patients with acute leukemia at different stages of treatment. We used SF-36, Optimism and Family Cohesion scales. RESULTS: Quality of life was affected physically and mentally in the treatment phases aimed to mitigate the active, and the advanced stage of this disease (50.6 +/- 25.6, 62 +/- 14.3; 46 +/- 23.2, 53.8 +/- 23.4, respectively), regardless of gender, age, level of optimism and family cohesion. Patients could carry out basic functions of self-care (bathing, feeding, etcetera), but not activities of daily living (shopping, household chores, etcetera), which require a greater effort. Although the patients perceived having been affected in the emotional health area-by the presence of anxiety and depression-they did not consider that these alterations limited their ability to carry out work and everyday activities. CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life was most affected at mental dimension and physical dimension, mainly in patients at induction and palliative treatment. The results showed that the objectives of care aimed to reduce symptoms and maintain patient comfort are not achieved.","['Lavielle-Sotomayor, Pilar', 'Rozen-Fuller, Etta', 'Bustamante-Rojano, Juan', 'Martinez-Murillo, Carlos']","['Lavielle-Sotomayor P', 'Rozen-Fuller E', 'Bustamante-Rojano J', 'Martinez-Murillo C']",,"['Unidad de Investigacion en Epidemiologia Clinica, Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico. lavielle.pilar@gmail.com.']",['spa'],,['Journal Article'],,Mexico,Rev Med Inst Mex Seguro Soc,Revista medica del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social,101243727,,IM,"['Activities of Daily Living/psychology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anxiety/etiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Depression/etiology', 'Family Relations/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Optimism/*psychology', 'Palliative Care/psychology', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Self Care/psychology', 'Young Adult']",,2017/06/08 06:00,2018/04/19 06:00,['2017/06/08 06:00'],"['2017/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rev Med Inst Mex Seguro Soc. 2017 Jul-Aug;55(4):456-463.,['NOTNLM'],"['Family', 'Leukemia', 'Optimism', 'Quality of life']",,,,,"Optimismo, cohesion familiar y tratamiento como predictores de la calidad de vida en padecimientos oncohematologicos.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although intensive chemotherapy can induce complete responses in older patients, the mortality rate is unacceptably high. The 5-year survival rate for patients achieving a remission ranges from 17% to 23%. ALL is usually more aggressive in older patients, and these patients' reduced functional capacity renders them less able to tolerate treatment. The need for less-intensive, more-efficient treatment modalities in this population of frail and high-risk patients is evident. Clinicians should strongly consider treatment in clinical trials for their older patients. If such trials are not available on site, physicians should refer older patients to tertiary centers for possible enrollment in a study. Significant advances have been made in the past decade toward understanding the biology of ALL and in developing novel therapeutic agents. Blinatumomab, inotuzumab ozogamicin, and newer-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors appear to be promising agents. Clinical studies show remarkable results with these agents, either alone or in combination with low-dose chemotherapy. Now that clinical trials are being designed with less-intensive treatment regimens and broad entry criteria, older age is less likely to be an exclusionary factor. However, clinical trials that enroll older patients with ALL should include detailed documentation of their underlying comorbidities, cognitive function, and performance status.","['Yilmaz, Musa', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Jabbour, Elias']","['Yilmaz M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Jabbour E']",,"['MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2017/06/08 06:00,2017/10/20 06:00,['2017/06/08 06:00'],"['2017/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2017 Apr;15(4):266-274.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the utility of blood cell counts (BCCs) in the first three days postirradiation to predict clinical outcome, specifically for hematologic acute radiation syndrome (HARS). We analyzed BCC test samples from radiation accident victims (n = 135) along with their clinical outcome HARS severity scores (H1-4) using the System for Evaluation and Archiving of Radiation Accidents based on Case Histories (SEARCH) database. Data from nonirradiated individuals (H0, n = 132) were collected from an outpatient facility. We created binary categories for severity scores, i.e., 1 (H0 vs. H1-4), 2 (H0-1 vs. H2-4) and 3 (H0-2 vs. H3-4), to assess the discrimination ability of BCCs using unconditional logistic regression analysis. The test sample contained 454 BCCs from 267 individuals. We validated the discrimination ability on a second independent group comprised of 275 BCCs from 252 individuals originating from SEARCH (HARS 1-4), an outpatient facility (H0) and hospitals (e.g., leukemia patients, H4). Individuals with a score of H0 were easily separated from exposed individuals based on developing lymphopenia and granulocytosis. The separation of H0 and H1-4 became more prominent with increasing hematologic severity scores and time. On day 1, lymphocyte counts were most predictive for discriminating binary categories, followed by granulocytes and thrombocytes. For days 2 and 3, an almost complete separation was achieved when BCCs from different days were combined, supporting the measurement of sequential BCC. We found an almost complete discrimination of H0 vs. irradiated individuals during model validation (negative predictive value, NPV > 94%) for all three days, while the correct prediction of exposed individuals increased from day 1 (positive predictive value, PPV 78-89%) to day 3 (PPV > 90%). The models were unable to provide predictions for 10.9% of the test samples, because the PPVs or NPVs did not reach a 95% likelihood defined as the lower limit for a prediction. We developed a prediction model spreadsheet to provide early and prompt diagnostic predictions and therapeutic recommendations including identification of the worried well, requirement of hospitalization or development of severe hematopoietic syndrome.

Ovarian cancer cells were treated with different concentrations of geraniin for 48 h and examined for viability, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and gene expression. Xenograft tumor studies were performed to determine the anticancer activity of geraniin in vivo. Geraniin significantly decreased cancer cell viability in a concentration-dependent fashion. Geraniin significantly triggered apoptosis, which was accompanied by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased cytochrome c release and caspsase-3 activity. Mechanistically, geraniin significantly downregulated Mcl-1 and impaired NF-kappaB p65 binding to the mcl-1 promoter. Overexpression of Mcl-1 significantly reversed geraniin-induced apoptosis in OVCAR3 cells. In addition, geraniin retarded ovarian cancer growth and reduced expression of phospho-p65 and Mcl-1. Collectively, geraniin elicits growth suppression in ovarian cancer through inhibition of NF-kappaB and Mcl-1 and may provide therapeutic benefits for this malignancy.","['Wang, Xue', 'Chen, Zhuo', 'Li, Xiao', 'Jiang, Zheng-Kui', 'Zhao, Yan-Qiu', 'Ping, Feng-Feng']","['Wang X', 'Chen Z', 'Li X', 'Jiang ZK', 'Zhao YQ', 'Ping FF']",,"[""China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Biotechnology Developing Center of Henan Academy of Sciences, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Biotechnology Developing Center of Henan Academy of Sciences, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Wuxi People's Hospital affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170607,United States,J Biochem Mol Toxicol,Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,9717231,"['0 (Glucosides)', '0 (Hydrolyzable Tannins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RELA protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '60976-49-0 (Geraniin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Glucosides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrolyzable Tannins/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*biosynthesis', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factor RelA/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2017/06/08 06:00,2018/01/03 06:00,['2017/06/08 06:00'],"['2016/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jbt.21929 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem Mol Toxicol. 2017 Sep;31(9). doi: 10.1002/jbt.21929.

Patients with DS mostly suffer from characteristic tumor types. Although individual patients of DS are at a higher risk for acute leukemia and testicular cancers, other types of solid tumors including breast cancers are mostly uncommon and have significantly lower-than-expected age-adjusted incidence rates. Except for an increased risk of retinoblastomas, and lymphomas, the risk of developing solid tumors has been found to be lower in both children and adults, and breast cancer was found to be almost absent (Hasle H., The Lancet Oncology, 2001). A study conducted in the United States found only one death when 11.65 were expected (Scholl T et al., Dev Med Child Neurol. 1982). A recent study examined mammogram reports of women with DS treated in the largest medical facility specifically serving adults with DS in the United States. It was found that only 0.7% women with DS had been diagnosed with breast cancers (Chicoine B et al., Intellect Dev Disabil. 2015). Here we describe a case of breast cancer in a 25-year-old patient with DS. The disease was presented as lymph node positive carcinoma with alterations of tumor suppressor genes characteristic to the triple negative breast cancer subtype. Comprehensive Genomic Profiling (CGP) revealed a wild-type status for BRCA1. The CGP report showed a frameshift mutation, A359fs*10 of the tumor suppressor gene INPP4B and another frameshift mutation, R282fs*63 of tumor suppressor gene TP53 in the tumor biopsy as characteristically found in triple-negative breast cancers. The VUS (Variance of Unknown Significance) alteration(s) were identified in ASXL1 (L1395V), NTRK1 (G18E), DDR2 (I159T), RUNX1 (amplification), ERG (amplification), SOX2 (T26A), FAM123B (G1031D), and HNF1A (A301T). Bonafide cancer-related genes of chromosome 21 amplified in the patient's tumor are RUNX1 and ERG genes. After the completion of the radiation, the patient was placed on everolimus which was based on the result of her CGP report. Thus, post-mastectomy radiation therapy was completed with a recommendation for everolimus for one year. During the time of writing of this report, no metastatic lesions were identified. The patient currently has no evidence of disease.","['Dey, Nandini', 'Krie, Amy', 'Klein, Jessica', 'Williams, Kirstin', 'McMillan, Amanda', 'Elsey, Rachel', 'Sun, Yuliang', 'Williams, Casey', 'De, Pradip', 'Leyland-Jones, Brian']","['Dey N', 'Krie A', 'Klein J', 'Williams K', 'McMillan A', 'Elsey R', 'Sun Y', 'Williams C', 'De P', 'Leyland-Jones B']",,"['Center for Precision Oncology, Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Avera Cancer Institute, Sioux Falls, SD 57105, USA. nandini.dey@avera.org.', 'Departmental of Internal Medicine, Sanford School of Medicine, University of South Dakota, Sioux Falls, SD 57105, USA. nandini.dey@avera.org.', 'Center for Precision Oncology, Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Avera Cancer Institute, Sioux Falls, SD 57105, USA.

Rapid and accurate testing at the point-of-need (PON) supports prevention of virus spread and management of clinical disease. This study evaluated the performance of an insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) that detects proviral DNA, and a reverse transcription (RT)-iiPCR that detects both viral RNA and proviral DNA, for FeLV detection at the PON. Methods Mycoplasma haemofelis, feline coronavirus, feline herpesvirus, feline calicivirus and feline immunodeficiency virus were used to test analytical specificity. In vitro transcribed RNA, artificial plasmid, FeLV strain American Type Culture Collection VR-719 and a clinical FeLV isolate were used in the analytical sensitivity assays. A retrospective study including 116 clinical plasma and serum samples that had been tested with virus isolation, real-time PCR and ELISA, and a prospective study including 150 clinical plasma and serum samples were implemented to evaluate the clinical performances of the iiPCR-based methods for FeLV detection. Results Ninety-five percent assay limit of detection was calculated to be 16 RNA and five DNA copies for the RT-iiPCR, and six DNA copies for the iiPCR. Both reactions had analytical sensitivity comparable to a reference real-time PCR (qPCR) and did not detect five non-target feline pathogens. The clinical performance of the RT-iiPCR and iiPCR had 98.82% agreement (kappa[kappa] = 0.97) and 100% agreement (kappa = 1.0), respectively, with the qPCR (n = 85).

One such predictive biomarker is the mutational status of the variable region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGHV) gene, which is a powerful predictor of duration of response and overall survival with chemoimmunotherapy (CIT). As this test may influence choice of therapy between CIT and novel agents, it is critical that providers understand how mutational status is determined and the limitations of testing.

We therefore analysed the impact of procedure- and centre-related factors on 5-year event-free survival (EFS) in a large retrospective study. Data of 684 CLL patients who received a first alloHCT between 2000 and 2011 were analysed by multivariable Cox proportional hazards models with a frailty component to investigate unexplained centre heterogeneity. Five-year EFS of the whole cohort was 37% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34-42%). Larger numbers of CLL alloHCTs (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, P = 0.002), certification of quality management (HR 0.7, P = 0.045) and a higher gross national income per capita (HR 0.4, P = 0.04) improved EFS. In vivo T-cell depletion (TCD) with alemtuzumab compared to no TCD (HR 1.5, P = 0.03), and a female donor compared to a male donor for a male patient (HR 1.4, P = 0.02) had a negative impact on EFS, but not non-myeloablative versus more intensive conditioning. After correcting for patient-, procedure- and centre-characteristics, significant variation in centre outcomes persisted. In conclusion, further research on the impact of centre and procedural characteristics is warranted. Non-myeloablative conditioning appears to be the preferable approach for patients with CLL.","['Schetelig, Johannes', 'de Wreede, Liesbeth C', 'Andersen, Niels S', 'Moreno, Carol', 'van Gelder, Michel', 'Vitek, Antonin', 'Karas, Michal', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Machaczka, Maciej', 'Gramatzki, Martin', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Delgado, Julio', 'Volin, Liisa', 'Passweg, Jakob', 'Dreger, Peter', 'Schaap, Nicolaas', 'Wagner, Eva', 'Henseler, Anja', 'van Biezen, Anja', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Iacobelli, Simona', 'Putter, Hein', 'Schonland, Stefan O', 'Kroger, Nicolaus']","['Schetelig J', 'de Wreede LC', 'Andersen NS', 'Moreno C', 'van Gelder M', 'Vitek A', 'Karas M', 'Michallet M', 'Machaczka M', 'Gramatzki M', 'Beelen D', 'Finke J', 'Delgado J', 'Volin L', 'Passweg J', 'Dreger P', 'Schaap N', 'Wagner E', 'Henseler A', 'van Biezen A', 'Bornhauser M', 'Iacobelli S', 'Putter H', 'Schonland SO', 'Kroger N']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2780-2981'],"['Medical Department I, University Hospital of the Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'DKMS Clinical Trials Unit, Dresden, Germany.', 'DKMS Clinical Trials Unit, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Statistics & Bioinformatics, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'BMT Unit Department of Haematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Hematologia, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'University Medical Centre Maastricht, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, Institute of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Haematology/Oncology, Charles University Hospital, Pilsen, Czech Republic.', 'Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud - Hematologie, Lyon, France.', 'Haematology Centre Karolinska and Department of Medicine at Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine - Haematology, Oncology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Haematology & Oncology, Department of Haematology, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department for Haematology, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Medizinische Klinik u.

Previous studies implied the effects of marrow fibrosis on prognosis for acute lymphoblastic leukemia were disputable. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential role of bone marrow fibrosis on clinical survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. METHODS: Bone marrow fibrosis (evaluated as reticulin fiber density, RFD) in bone marrow sections was evaluated at diagnosis via computer technology. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to analyze the predictive value of RFD for relapse and survival status. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival rates per subgroup between patients with different RFD. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to model the overall survival. RESULTS: High RFD at diagnosis in bone marrow sections from primary AML might predict early relapse and shorter survival (P = 0.003 and 0.001, respectively). The optimal cutoff value of RFD at diagnosis was determined to be 7.2%. Furthermore, the Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with high marrow RFD had shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) than patients with low RFD (P = 0.007 and 0.000, respectively). Multivariate analysis suggested that similar with cytogenetics, marrow RFD at diagnosis was an independent prognostic factor for RFS [HR 0.564, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.338-0.940, P = 0.028] and OS (HR 0.457, 95% CI 0.225-0.929, P = 0.031) in primary AML patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that marrow RFD before treatment should be seemed as prognostic factor in primary AML, it may provide valuable clues for developing new targeted therapy.","['Wu, Z', 'Chen, R', 'Wu, L', 'Zou, L', 'Ding, F', 'Wang, M', 'Liu, X']","['Wu Z', 'Chen R', 'Wu L', 'Zou L', 'Ding F', 'Wang M', 'Liu X']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7378-3726'],"[""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Ningde Mindong Hospital, Fujian Medical University, No. 89 Heshan Road, Fu'an, Fujian, China. wzt1977@163.com."", ""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Ningde Mindong Hospital, Fujian Medical University, No. 89 Heshan Road, Fu'an, Fujian, China."", ""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Ningde Mindong Hospital, Fujian Medical University, No. 89 Heshan Road, Fu'an, Fujian, China."", ""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Ningde Mindong Hospital, Fujian Medical University, No. 89 Heshan Road, Fu'an, Fujian, China."", ""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Ningde Mindong Hospital, Fujian Medical University, No. 89 Heshan Road, Fu'an, Fujian, China."", ""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Ningde Mindong Hospital, Fujian Medical University, No. 89 Heshan Road, Fu'an, Fujian, China."", ""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Ningde Mindong Hospital, Fujian Medical University, No. 89 Heshan Road, Fu'an, Fujian, China.""]",['eng'],['2015J01414/Fujian Provincial Department of Science and Technology'],['Journal Article'],20170606,Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*complications/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'ROC Curve', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,2017/06/08 06:00,2018/07/31 06:00,['2017/06/08 06:00'],"['2017/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/31 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12094-017-1687-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12094-017-1687-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2017 Dec;19(12):1462-1468. doi: 10.1007/s12094-017-1687-1.

METHODS: The German Register of Autoimmune Diseases 2 (GRAID2) is a retrospective, non-interventional, multicenter registry collecting data from all patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases refractory to conventional therapy and treated with initial off-label biologics between August 2006 and December 2013. Patients with MAS could be included without prior treatment with a biologic agent. RESULTS: Data from 26 patients with AIF and 5 with MAS were collected. Of the AIF patients 13 (50%) were diagnosed with adult onset Still's disease (AOSD), 6 (23%) with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), 4 (15.4%) with tumor necrosis factor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), 1 (3.8%) patient with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) and 2 (8%) with undifferentiated fever syndromes. The 5 MAS patients suffered from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with chronic myeloid leukemia, systemic lupus erythematosus and in 2 cases AOSD. In 1 patient a chronic neurological disease was documented without further differentiaton. All patients with TRAPS were primarily treated with etanercept and all CAPS patients with canakinumab. The AOSD and FMF patients were treated with anakinra as the first line off-label biologic in 6 out of 13 and 5 out of 6 cases, respectively. The MAS patients responded very well or well to therapy in 40% and 60% had a moderate response. There were no non-responders. Within the group of AIF patients the physicians documented a very effective or effective treatment in 38.5%, a moderate response in 30.8% and no response in 30.7%. The tolerance was very good in 5 out of 5 of the MAS and in 92% of the AIF patients.

However, refractory and resistance to imatinib therapy has encouraged many investigators to get involved in development of new therapeutic agents such as Phorbol 12-myrestrat 13-acetate (PMA) for patients with CML. In that line, we attempted to investigate the chemosensitizing effect of PMA on the imatinib-resistant cells. Based on our western blot analyses, resistant K562 cells (K562R) showed high levels of FoxO3a and Bcl6 expressions which were not modulated by imatinib treatment. However, upon PMA treatment, the levels of both FoxO3a and Bcl6 were up-regulated among both the sensitive and the resistant cells and this treatment was associated with initiation of megakaryocytic differentiation of the cells. SiRNA-silencing of FoxO3a led to augmentation of megakaryocytic differentiation of the cells. Similarly, siRNA gene silencing of Bcl6 enhanced the differentiation and induced cell apoptosis among both types of cells. Regarding these results, it might be concluded that Bcl6 knockdown combined with PMA therapy could present a new therapeutical strategy for refractory CML patients to imatinib.","['Eskandari, Sedigheh', 'Yazdanparast, Razieh']","['Eskandari S', 'Yazdanparast R']",,"['Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, P.

Successively, the failure to reproduce these findings, and the suspect that the diagnostic PCR was vitiated by laboratory contaminations, led to the retraction of the paper. Notwithstanding, XMRV continued to be the subject of researches and public debates. Occasional positivity in humans was also detected recently, even if the data always appeared elusive and non-reproducible. In this study, we discuss the current status of this controversial association and propose that a major role in the unreliability of the results was played by the XMRV genomic composition in itself. In this regard, we present bioinformatic analyses that show: (i) aspecific, spurious annealings of the available primers in multiple homologous sites of the human genome; (ii) strict homologies between whole XMRV genome and interspersed repetitive elements widespread in mammalian genomes. To further detail this scenario, we screen several human and mammalian samples by using both published and newly designed primers. The experimental data confirm that available primers are far from being selective and specific. In conclusion, the occurrence of highly conserved, repeated DNA sequences in the XMRV genome deeply undermines the reliability of diagnostic PCRs by leading to artifactual and spurious amplifications. Together with all the other evidences, this makes the association between the XMRV retrovirus and CFS totally unreliable.","['Panelli, Simona', 'Lorusso, Lorenzo', 'Balestrieri, Alessandro', 'Lupo, Giuseppe', 'Capelli, Enrica']","['Panelli S', 'Lorusso L', 'Balestrieri A', 'Lupo G', 'Capelli E']",,"['Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Section of Animal Biology, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Centre for Health Technologies (C.H.T.), University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Neurology Unit, A.S.S.T.

Germline CBL mutations are dominant. Pathogenic de novo mutations result in a phenotype that overlaps Noonan syndrome (1). Some patients with CBL mutations go on to develop juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), an aggressive malignancy that usually necessitates bone marrow transplantation. Using whole exome sequencing methods, we identified a known mutation in CBL in a 4-year-old Caucasian boy with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, moyamoya phenomenon, and dysmorphology consistent with a mild Noonan-like phenotype. Exome data revealed loss of heterozygosity across chromosome 11q consistent with JMML but in the absence of clinical leukemia. Our finding challenges conventional clinical diagnostics since we have identified a pathogenic variant in the CBL gene previously only ascertained in children presenting with leukemia. The increasing affordability of expansive sequencing is likely to increase the scope of clinical profiles observed for previously identified pathogenic variants and calls into question the interpretability and indications for clinical management.","['Seaby, Eleanor G', 'Gilbert, Rodney D', 'Andreoletti, Gaia', 'Pengelly, Reuben J', 'Mercer, Catherine', 'Hunt, David', 'Ennis, Sarah']","['Seaby EG', 'Gilbert RD', 'Andreoletti G', 'Pengelly RJ', 'Mercer C', 'Hunt D', 'Ennis S']",,"['Human Genetics and Genomic Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', ""Wessex Regional Paediatric Nephro-Urology Service, Southampton Children's Hospital, Southampton, UK."", 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Human Genetics and Genomic Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Human Genetics and Genomic Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Wessex Clinical Genetics Service, Princess Anne Hospital, Southampton, UK.', 'Wessex Clinical Genetics Service, Princess Anne Hospital, Southampton, UK.', 'Human Genetics and Genomic Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20170522,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,,,PMC5438966,2017/06/08 06:00,2017/06/08 06:01,['2017/06/08 06:00'],"['2017/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2017.00113 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2017 May 22;5:113. doi: 10.3389/fped.2017.00113. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['JMML', 'aHUS', 'genomics', 'preclinical cancer', 'whole-exome sequencing']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The supplementation of folic acid during pregnancy has long been known to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) in the foetus. Folate metabolism can be altered by many factors, including adequate intake through diet. Folate deficiency can compromise the synthesis, repair and methylation of DNA, with deleterious consequences on genomic stability and gene expression. These processes are known to be altered in chronic diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. MAIN BODY: This review focuses on the association between folate intake and the risk of childhood leukaemia. Having compiled and analysed studies from the literature, we show the documented effects of folates on the genome and their role in cancer prevention and progression with particular emphasis on DNA methylation modifications. These changes are of crucial importance during pregnancy, as maternal diet has a profound impact on the metabolic and physiological functions of the foetus and the susceptibility to disease in later life. Folate deficiency is capable of modifying the methylation status of certain genes at birth in both animals and humans, with potential pathogenic and tumorigenic effects on the progeny. Pre-existing genetic polymorphisms can modify the metabolic network of folates and influence the risk of cancer, including childhood leukaemias. The protective effects of folic acid might be dose dependent, as excessive folic acid could have the adverse effect of nourishing certain types of tumours. CONCLUSION: Overall, maternal folic acid supplementation before and during pregnancy seems to confer protection against the risk of childhood leukaemia in the offspring. The optimal folic acid requirements and supplementation doses need to be established, especially in conjunction with other vitamins in order to determine the most successful combinations of nutrients to maintain genomic health and wellbeing. Further research is therefore needed to uncover the role of maternal diet as a whole, as it represents a main factor capable of inducing permanent changes in the foetus.","['Cantarella, Catia Daniela', 'Ragusa, Denise', 'Giammanco, Marco', 'Tosi, Sabrina']","['Cantarella CD', 'Ragusa D', 'Giammanco M', 'Tosi S']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0036-0191'],"['Department of Experimental Biomedicine and Clinical Neurosciences, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.0000 0004 1762 5517grid.10776.37', 'Division of Biosciences, College of Health and Life Sciences, Institute of Environment, Health and Societies, Brunel University London, Uxbridge, UK.0000 0001 0724 6933grid.7728.a', 'Department of Experimental Biomedicine and Clinical Neurosciences, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.0000 0004 1762 5517grid.10776.37', 'Division of Biosciences, College of Health and Life Sciences, Institute of Environment, Health and Societies, Brunel University London, Uxbridge, UK.0000 0001 0724 6933grid.7728.a']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170602,Germany,Genes Nutr,Genes & nutrition,101280108,,,,PMC5455200,2017/06/08 06:00,2017/06/08 06:01,['2017/06/08 06:00'],"['2017/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12263-017-0560-8 [doi]', '560 [pii]']",epublish,Genes Nutr. 2017 Jun 2;12:14. doi: 10.1186/s12263-017-0560-8. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Childhood leukaemia', 'DNA methylation', 'Folates', 'Folic acid', 'Genomic health']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mRNA expression profile (GSE42534) was downloaded from the Gene Expressed Omnibus database, including three samples without propranolol treatment (control), three samples with propranolol treatment for 4 h and three samples with propranolol treatment for 24 h. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in angiosarcoma tumor cells with or without propranolol treatment were obtained via the limma package of R and designated DEGs-4 h and DEGs-24 h. The DEGs-24 h group was divided into two sets. Set 1 contained the DEGs also contained in the DEGs-4 h group. Set 2 contained the remainder of the DEGs. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis of sets 1 and 2 was performed. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of sets 1 and 2 were constructed, termed PPI 1 and PPI 2, and visualized using Cytoscape software. Modules of the two PPI networks were analyzed, and their topological structures were simulated using the tYNA platform. A total of 543 and 2,025 DEGs were identified in angiosarcoma tumor cells treated with propranolol for 4 and 24 h, respectively, compared with the control group. A total of 401 DEGs were involved in DEGs-4 h and DEGs-24 h, including metallothionein 1, heme oxygenase 1, WW domain-binding protein 2 and sequestosome 1. Certain significantly enriched gene ontology (GO) terms and pathways of sets 1 and 2 were identified, containing 28 overlapping GO terms. Furthermore, 121 nodes and 700 associated pairs were involved in PPI 1, whereas 1,324 nodes and 11,839 associated pairs were involved in PPI 2. A total of 45 and 593 potential target genes were obtained according to the node degrees of PPI 1 and PPI 2. The results of the present study indicated that a number of potential target genes, including AXL receptor tyrosine kinase, coatomer subunit alpha, DR1-associated protein 1 and ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor 1 may be involved in the effect of propranolol on angiosarcoma.","['Zhou, Shiyong', 'Liu, Pengfei', 'Jiang, Wenhua', 'Zhang, Huilai']","['Zhou S', 'Liu P', 'Jiang W', 'Zhang H']",,"[""Department of Lymphoma, Sino-US Center of Lymphoma and Leukemia, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin 300060, P.R.

Limited data exists, regarding the optimal regimen to obtain remission prior to allo-HCT. Single agent high-dose cytarabine (10-12 doses administered every 12 hours) has been previously used as induction therapy. Six-dose high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC-6), commonly used as a consolidation regimen, has never been evaluated as induction therapy. We present a retrospective review of 26 consecutive patients with RR-AML receiving single agent cytarabine 3 g/m(2) intravenously every 12 hours on days 1, 3, and 5 for a total of six doses (HiDAC-6). Median follow-up for surviving patients was 10.4 months (range 1.6-112.2 months). Complete remission was obtained in 62% (54% CR and 8% CRi) of the patients. The median relapse-free survival (RFS) was 22.3 months (range 0.7-112 months), event-free survival (EFS) was 4.7 months (range 0.5-112 months), and the overall survival (OS) was 9.6 months (range 1-112 months). Thirty-five percent of patients were able to subsequently proceed to allo-HCT. Treatment-related toxicities included neutropenic fever (38%), infection (35%), neurotoxicity (8%), and skin toxicity (8%). This is the first study to demonstrate HiDAC-6 as an active treatment option for younger patients with RR-AML which can effectively serve as a bridge to allo-HCT without significant toxicity.","['Anders, Brandi', 'Veltri, Lauren', 'Kanate, Abraham S', 'Shillingburg, Alexandra', 'Shah, Nilay', 'Craig, Michael', 'Cumpston, Aaron']","['Anders B', 'Veltri L', 'Kanate AS', 'Shillingburg A', 'Shah N', 'Craig M', 'Cumpston A']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4712-0053', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9776-4802']","['Department of Pharmacy, West Virginia University Medicine, Morgantown, WV, USA.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA.', 'Osborn Hematopoietic Malignancy and Transplantation Program, MBRCC, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, West Virginia University Medicine, Morgantown, WV, USA.', 'Osborn Hematopoietic Malignancy and Transplantation Program, MBRCC, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA.', 'Osborn Hematopoietic Malignancy and Transplantation Program, MBRCC, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA.', 'Osborn Hematopoietic Malignancy and Transplantation Program, MBRCC, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, West Virginia University Medicine, Morgantown, WV, USA.', 'Osborn Hematopoietic Malignancy and Transplantation Program, MBRCC, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA.']",['eng'],['U54 GM104942/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20170514,United States,Adv Hematol,Advances in hematology,101504271,,,,PMC5446853,2017/06/08 06:00,2017/06/08 06:01,['2017/06/08 06:00'],"['2017/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2017/6464972 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Hematol. 2017;2017:6464972. doi: 10.1155/2017/6464972.

They were originally identified in a selection for increased resistance to histidine starvation in the yeast S. cerevisiae. Recent work indicated that the Not5 subunit, ortholog of mammalian CNOT3, determines global translation levels by defining binding of the Ccr4-Not scaffold protein Not1 to ribosomal mRNAs during transcription. This is needed for optimal translation of ribosomal proteins. In this work we searched for mutations in budding yeast that were resistant to histidine starvation using the same selection that originally led to the isolation of the NOT genes. We thereby isolated mutations in ribosome-related genes. This common phenotype of ribosome mutants and not mutants is in good agreement with the positive role of the Not proteins for translation. In this regard, it is interesting that frequent mutations in RPL5 and RPL10 or in CNOT3 have been observed to accumulate in adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). This suggests that in metazoans a common function implicating ribosome subunits and CNOT3 plays a role in the development of cancer. In this perspective we suggest that the Ccr4-Not complex, according to translation levels and fidelity, could itself be involved in the regulation of amino acid biosynthesis levels. We discuss how this could explain why mutations have been identified in many cancers.","['Collart, Martine A', 'Kassem, Sari', 'Villanyi, Zoltan']","['Collart MA', 'Kassem S', 'Villanyi Z']",,"['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Medicine, Centre Medical Universitaire (CMU), Faculty of Medicine, University of GenevaGeneva, Switzerland.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Medicine, Centre Medical Universitaire (CMU), Faculty of Medicine, University of GenevaGeneva, Switzerland.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Medicine, Centre Medical Universitaire (CMU), Faculty of Medicine, University of GenevaGeneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170522,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,,,PMC5439007,2017/06/08 06:00,2017/06/08 06:01,['2017/06/08 06:00'],"['2017/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2017.00061 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2017 May 22;8:61. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2017.00061. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['CNOT3', 'Ccr4-Not complex', 'T-ALL leukemia', 'histidine starvation', 'ribosome', 'translation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MSC functions can be influenced by their tissue origin. Their microenvironment strongly affects their biology notably through TLR sensing. In this study, we show that MSC isolated from four different sources express another type of cytosolic pathogen recognition receptors known as retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLR). RLR activation in MSC induces the production of Type I IFN (IFN-beta) and Type III IFN (IFN-lambda1). The highest producers are adipose tissue(AT)-MSC. We further show that Interferon production is induced through TBK1/IKK-epsilon signaling and IRF7 phosphorylation. Depending on MSC source, the knockdown of TLR3 and/or RIG-I decreases the MSC response to RLR ligand poly(I:C)/Lyovec. Among the different MSC types, AT-MSCs display the highest sensitivity to viral stimuli as shown by the alteration of their viability after prolonged stimulation. Our work indicates that this could be linked to an increase of pro-apoptotic Noxa expression. Finally, the expression of IDO1 and LIF upon RLR activation indicate the increase of MSC immunomodulatory potential, especially in AT-MSCs. Altogether, these data should be considered when designing MSC-based therapy in clinical settings where inflammation or infection are present.","['Raicevic, Gordana', 'Najar, Mehdi', 'Busser, Helene', 'Crompot, Emerence', 'Bron, Dominique', 'Toungouz, Michel', 'Lagneaux, Laurence']","['Raicevic G', 'Najar M', 'Busser H', 'Crompot E', 'Bron D', 'Toungouz M', 'Lagneaux L']",,"['Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Hopital Erasme, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium. gordana.raicevic@ulb.ac.be.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Hopital Erasme, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Hopital Erasme, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Hopital Erasme, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Hopital Erasme, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Jules Bordet Institute, Hopital Erasme, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Hopital Erasme, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Immunology-Hematology-Transfusion, Hopital Erasme, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Hopital Erasme, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170606,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (IRF7 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-7)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (PLAAT4 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKE protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (DDX58 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (IFIH1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD Box Protein 58)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (Interferon-Induced Helicase, IFIH1)', 'O84C90HH2L (Poly I-C)']",IM,"['Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'DEAD Box Protein 58/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/metabolism', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-7/metabolism', 'Interferon-Induced Helicase, IFIH1/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'Poly I-C/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Immunologic', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 3/metabolism']",PMC5460162,2017/06/08 06:00,2018/12/19 06:00,['2017/06/08 06:00'],"['2016/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-02850-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-02850-6 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Jun 6;7(1):2896. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-02850-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA repair processes contribute towards sensitivity to alkylating agents and therefore we here evaluate the role of nucleotide excision repair (NER), which is involved in the removal of bulky adducts and DNA crosslinks in MM. We first evaluated NER activity using a novel functional assay and observed a heterogeneous NER efficiency in MM cell lines and patient samples. Using next-generation sequencing data, we identified that expression of the canonical NER gene, excision repair cross-complementation group 3 (ERCC3), significantly impacted the outcome in newly diagnosed MM patients treated with alkylating agents. Next, using small RNA interference, stable knockdown and overexpression, and small-molecule inhibitors targeting xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group B (XPB), the DNA helicase encoded by ERCC3, we demonstrate that NER inhibition significantly increases sensitivity and overcomes resistance to alkylating agents in MM. Moreover, inhibiting XPB leads to the dual inhibition of NER and transcription and is particularly efficient in myeloma cells. Altogether, we show that NER impacts alkylating agents sensitivity in myeloma cells and identify ERCC3 as a potential therapeutic target in MM.","['Szalat, R', 'Samur, M K', 'Fulciniti, M', 'Lopez, M', 'Nanjappa, P', 'Cleynen, A', 'Wen, K', 'Kumar, S', 'Perini, T', 'Calkins, A S', 'Reznichenko, E', 'Chauhan, D', 'Tai, Y-T', 'Shammas, M A', 'Anderson, K C', 'Fermand, J-P', 'Arnulf, B', 'Avet-Loiseau, H', 'Lazaro, J-B', 'Munshi, N C']","['Szalat R', 'Samur MK', 'Fulciniti M', 'Lopez M', 'Nanjappa P', 'Cleynen A', 'Wen K', 'Kumar S', 'Perini T', 'Calkins AS', 'Reznichenko E', 'Chauhan D', 'Tai YT', 'Shammas MA', 'Anderson KC', 'Fermand JP', 'Arnulf B', 'Avet-Loiseau H', 'Lazaro JB', 'Munshi NC']",,"['Department of Medical Oncology, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'VA Boston Healthcare System, West Roxbury, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'CNRS, UMR 5149, Institut Montpellierain Alexander Grothendieck, Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Center for DNA Damage and Repair, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Center for DNA Damage and Repair, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'VA Boston Healthcare System, West Roxbury, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Departement d'Immunologie Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France."", ""Departement d'Immunologie Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France."", ""INSERM, UMR 1126, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France."", 'Unite de Genomique du Myelome, University Hospital, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Center for DNA Damage and Repair, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'VA Boston Healthcare System, West Roxbury, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['I01 BX001584/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'P01 CA155258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20170607,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '146045-44-5 (XPBC-ERCC-3 protein)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'Xeroderma Pigmentosum, Complementation Group B']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Helicases/genetics', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Xeroderma Pigmentosum/genetics']",PMC5720937,2017/06/08 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2017/06/08 06:00'],"['2017/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/05 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017182 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.182 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Jan;32(1):111-119. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.182.

Despite this, there are very few studies published from Bangladesh, documenting the frequency of bcr-abl fusion transcripts. So, we would like to perform this observational study to evaluate bcr-abl fusion transcripts and demographic status among RT-PCR positive chronic phase CML patients at BIRDEM & other two centers of Dhaka city, Bangladesh where patients admitted from different districts of Bangladesh in the period of January 2010 to June 2012. Twenty patients from three centers willing to perform RT-PCR test and showed positive PCR result, were enrolled under written consent before starting treatment with targeted molecular therapy. The age range of the sample was 18 to 52 years, with mean age of 34.80 and male - female ratio of 4:1. This study showed among chronic phase CML patients bcr-abl transcript rearrangement frequency was b3a2 (e14a 2) 45% while b2a2 (e13a2) was 55% by RT-PCR testing method. Cytogenetic and molecular analysis has become mandatory in order to make a correct diagnosis and monitoring response to newer molecular targeted treatment modalities.

Mutated IDH2 proteins neomorphically synthesize 2-hydroxyglutarate resulting in DNA and histone hypermethylation, which leads to blocked cellular differentiation. Enasidenib (AG-221/CC-90007) is a first-in-class, oral, selective inhibitor of mutant-IDH2 enzymes. This first-in-human phase 1/2 study assessed the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, safety, and clinical activity of enasidenib in patients with mutant-IDH2 advanced myeloid malignancies. We assessed safety outcomes for all patients and clinical efficacy in the largest patient subgroup, those with relapsed or refractory AML, from the phase 1 dose-escalation and expansion phases of the study. In the dose-escalation phase, an MTD was not reached at doses ranging from 50 to 650 mg per day. Enasidenib 100 mg once daily was selected for the expansion phase on the basis of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and demonstrated efficacy. Grade 3 to 4 enasidenib-related adverse events included indirect hyperbilirubinemia (12%) and IDH-inhibitor-associated differentiation syndrome (7%). Among patients with relapsed or refractory AML, overall response rate was 40.3%, with a median response duration of 5.8 months. Responses were associated with cellular differentiation and maturation, typically without evidence of aplasia. Median overall survival among relapsed/refractory patients was 9.3 months, and for the 34 patients (19.3%) who attained complete remission, overall survival was 19.7 months. Continuous daily enasidenib treatment was generally well tolerated and induced hematologic responses in patients for whom prior AML therapy had failed. Inducing differentiation of myeloblasts, not cytotoxicity, seems to drive the clinical efficacy of enasidenib.

In preclinical models these mutations cause accumulation of the oncogenic metabolite R-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) and induce hematopoietic differentiation block. Single-agent enasidenib (AG-221/CC-90007), a selective mutant IDH2 (mIDH2) inhibitor, produced an overall response rate of 40.3% in relapsed/refractory AML (rrAML) patients with mIDH2 in a phase 1 trial. However, its mechanism of action and biomarkers associated with response remain unclear. Here, we measured 2-HG, mIDH2 allele burden, and co-occurring somatic mutations in sequential patient samples from the clinical trial and correlated these with clinical response. Furthermore, we used flow cytometry to assess inhibition of mIDH2 on hematopoietic differentiation. We observed potent 2-HG suppression in both R140 and R172 mIDH2 AML subtypes, with different kinetics, which preceded clinical response. Suppression of 2-HG alone did not predict response, because most nonresponding patients also exhibited 2-HG suppression. Complete remission (CR) with persistence of mIDH2 and normalization of hematopoietic stem and progenitor compartments with emergence of functional mIDH2 neutrophils were observed. In a subset of CR patients, mIDH2 allele burden was reduced and remained undetectable with response. Co-occurring mutations in NRAS and other MAPK pathway effectors were enriched in nonresponding patients, consistent with RAS signaling contributing to primary therapeutic resistance. Together, these data support differentiation as the main mechanism of enasidenib efficacy in relapsed/refractory AML patients and provide insight into resistance mechanisms to inform future mechanism-based combination treatment studies.","['Amatangelo, Michael D', 'Quek, Lynn', 'Shih, Alan', 'Stein, Eytan M', 'Roshal, Mikhail', 'David, Muriel D', 'Marteyn, Benoit', 'Farnoud, Noushin Rahnamay', 'de Botton, Stephane', 'Bernard, Olivier A', 'Wu, Bin', 'Yen, Katharine E', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Papaemmanuil, Elli', 'Penard-Lacronique, Virginie', 'Thakurta, Anjan', 'Vyas, Paresh', 'Levine, Ross L']","['Amatangelo MD', 'Quek L', 'Shih A', 'Stein EM', 'Roshal M', 'David MD', 'Marteyn B', 'Farnoud NR', 'de Botton S', 'Bernard OA', 'Wu B', 'Yen KE', 'Tallman MS', 'Papaemmanuil E', 'Penard-Lacronique V', 'Thakurta A', 'Vyas P', 'Levine RL']",,"['Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ.', 'Medical Research Council Molecular Hematology Unit, Oxford Comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, and Department of Hematology, Oxford University Hospital National Health Service Foundation Trust, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', 'Unite de Pathogenie Microbienne Moleculaire, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Hematologie Clinique, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', 'Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Center for Molecular Oncology and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and.', 'Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ.', 'Medical Research Council Molecular Hematology Unit, Oxford Comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, and Department of Hematology, Oxford University Hospital National Health Service Foundation Trust, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['U54 OD020355/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'C7893/A12796 /Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'MR/L008963/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12009/11/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107263/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'G1000729/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '4050189188/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'K08 CA181507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'G1000729/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",20170606,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glutarates)', '0 (Triazines)', '2889-31-8 (alpha-hydroxyglutarate)', '3T1SS4E7AG (enasidenib)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Aminopyridines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Glutarates/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Triazines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",PMC5553578,2017/06/08 06:00,2017/08/16 06:00,['2017/06/08 06:00'],"['2017/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33110-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-04-779447 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Aug 10;130(6):732-741. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-04-779447.

We developed a novel method of graft manipulation based on negative depletion of alphabeta T and B cells and conducted a prospective trial evaluating the outcome of children with AL transplanted with this approach. Eighty AL children, transplanted between September 2011 and September 2014, were enrolled in the trial. All children were given a fully myeloablative preparative regimen. Anti-T-lymphocyte globulin from day -5 to -3 was used for preventing graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD); no patient received any posttransplantation GVHD prophylaxis. Two children experienced primary graft failure. The cumulative incidence of skin-only, grade 1-2 acute GVHD was 30%; no patient developed extensive chronic GVHD. Four patients died, the cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality being 5%, whereas 19 relapsed, resulting in a 24% cumulative incidence of relapse. With a median follow-up of 46 months for surviving patients, the 5-year probability of chronic GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) is 71%. Total body irradiation-containing preparative regimen was the only variable favorably influencing relapse incidence and GRFS. The outcomes of these 80 patients are comparable to those of 41 and 51 children given transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling or a 10/10 allelic-matched unrelated donor in the same period.

Combination therapy may be used to improve the therapeutic efficiency. To evaluate this possibility, the present study determined the combined effects of Hedyotis diffusa Willd (HDW) extract and ATO in leukemic WEHI-3 cells. The results demonstrated that co-treatment of HDW with ATO resulted in a synergistic augmentation of cytotoxicity in cells at the concentration tested. In order to investigate the potential therapeutic application for leukemia, the combined effects of HDW and ATO were analyzed on the WEHI-3 cell-induced orthotopic leukemia animal model in vivo. The WEHI-3 cells in mice with leukemia were established by injecting murine WEHI-3 cells into BALB/c mice, and treating them with HDW and/or combined with ATO. The results indicated that HDW alone or HDW combined with ATO promoted the total survival rate of mice with leukemia, and these effects are dose-dependent. HDW alone or HDW combined with ATO did not affect the body weight, decreased the spleen weight and did not affect the liver weight. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that HDW alone or HDW combined with ATO resulted in a synergistic augmentation of apoptosis in WEHI-3 cells at the concentration tested. In order to further reveal the detailed mechanism of this synergistic effect on apoptosis, apoptosis-related proteins were also evaluated. The data revealed that HDW alone or HDW combined with ATO induced the expression of death receptor 4 (DR4) and DR5 and the activation of poly adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase, caspase-3, -8 and -9. Furthermore, HDW alone or HDW combined with ATO decreased the expression levels of B-cell lymphoma 2, B-cell lymphoma-extra large and survivin, and increased the expression levels of Bak and t-Bid. Altogether, the results indicate that the combination of HDW with ATO may be a promising strategy used to increase the clinical efficacy of ATO in the treatment of APL.","['Kuo, Yu-Jui', 'Liu, Yan-Jin', 'Way, Tzong-Der', 'Chiang, Su-Yin', 'Lin, Jaung-Geng', 'Chung, Jing-Gung']","['Kuo YJ', 'Liu YJ', 'Way TD', 'Chiang SY', 'Lin JG', 'Chung JG']",,"['Graduate Institute of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tainan Municipal Hospital, Tainan 70173, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Graduate Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Biological Sciences and Technology, College of Biopharmaceutical and Food Sciences, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Health and Nutrition Biotechnology, College of Health Science, Asia University, Taichung 41354, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Graduate Institute of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Biological Sciences and Technology, College of Biopharmaceutical and Food Sciences, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Asia University, Taichung 41354, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170427,Greece,Exp Ther Med,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,101531947,,,,PMC5450767,2017/06/08 06:00,2017/06/08 06:01,['2017/06/08 06:00'],"['2015/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/etm.2017.4392 [doi]', 'ETM-0-0-4392 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Ther Med. 2017 Jun;13(6):3388-3396. doi: 10.3892/etm.2017.4392.

Imatinib mesylate, the breakpoint cluster region-abelson murine leukeamia kinase inhibitor, is a specific reagent used in the clinical treatment of CML. The DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor, etoposide, is also employed as a therapeutic, though it is used to a lesser extent. The present study aims to evaluate the effects of CML-targeted therapy, utilising imatinib mesylate and etoposide in the in vitro treatment of parental sensitive and adriamycin-resistant CML in the K562 and K562/ADM cell lines, respectively. Preliminary work involved the screening of multidrug resistant (MDR) gene expression, including MDR1, MRP1 and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) at the mRNA levels. The sensitive and resistant CML cell lines expressed the MRP1 gene, though the sensitive K562 cells expressed low, almost undetectable levels of MDR1 and BCL-2 genes relative to the K562/ADM cells. Following treatment with imatinib mesylate or etoposide, the IC50 for imatinib mesylate did not differ between the sensitive and resistant cell lines (0.492+/-0.024 and 0.378+/-0.029, respectively), indicating that imatinib mesylate is effective in the treatment of CML regardless of cell chemosensitivity. However, the IC50 for etoposide in sensitive K562 cells was markedly lower than that of K562/ADM cells (50.6+/-16.5 and 194+/-8.46 microM, respectively), suggesting that the higher expression levels of MDR1 and/or BCL-2 mRNA in resistant cells may be partially responsible for this effect. This is supported by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling data, whereby a higher percentage of apoptotic cells were found in the sensitive and resistant K562 cells treated with imatinib mesylate (29.3+/-0.2 and 31.9+/-16.7%, respectively), whereas etoposide caused significant apoptosis of sensitive K562 cells (18.3+/-8.35%) relative to K562/ADM cells (5.17+/-3.3%). In addition, the MDR genes in K562/ADM cells were knocked down by short interfering RNAs. The percentage knockdowns were 15.4% for MRP1, 17.8% for MDR and 30.7% for BCL-2, which resulted in a non-significant difference in the half maximal inhibitory concentration value of K562/ADM cells relative to K562 cells upon treatment with etoposide.","['Husaini, Roslina', 'Ahmad, Munirah', 'Zakaria, Zubaidah']","['Husaini R', 'Ahmad M', 'Zakaria Z']",,"['Haematology Unit, Cancer Research Centre, Institute for Medical Research, Jalan Pahang, 50588 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit, Cancer Research Centre, Institute for Medical Research, Jalan Pahang, 50588 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Haematology Unit, Cancer Research Centre, Institute for Medical Research, Jalan Pahang, 50588 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170508,Greece,Exp Ther Med,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,101531947,,,,PMC5450554,2017/06/08 06:00,2017/06/08 06:01,['2017/06/08 06:00'],"['2015/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/etm.2017.4443 [doi]', 'ETM-0-0-4443 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Ther Med. 2017 Jun;13(6):3209-3216. doi: 10.3892/etm.2017.4443.

Plant-derived miRNAs may pass through the gastrointestinal tract, entering into the body fluid and regulate the expression of endogenous mRNAs. Camptotheca acuminata, a highly important medicinal plant known for its anti-cancer potential was selected to investigate cross-kingdom regulatory mechanism and involvement of miRNAs derived from this plant in cancer-associated pathways through in silico systems biology approach. In this study, total 33 highly stable putative novel miRNAs were predicted from the publically available 53,294 ESTs of C. acuminata, out of which 14 miRNAs were found to be regulating 152 target genes in human. Functional enrichment, gene-disease associations and network analysis of these target genes were carried out and the results revealed their association with prominent types of cancers like breast cancer, leukemia and lung cancer. Pathways like focal adhesion, regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes and mTOR signaling pathways were found significantly associated with the target genes. The regulatory network analysis showed the association of some important hub proteins like GSK3B, NUMB, PEG3, ITGA2 and DLG2 with cancer-associated pathways. Based on the analysis results, it can be suggested that the ingestion of the C. acuminata miRNAs may have a functional impact on tumorigenesis in a cross-kingdom way and may affect the physiological condition at genetic level. Thus, the predicted miRNAs seem to hold potentially significant role in cancer pathway regulation and therefore, may be further validated using in vivo experiments for a better insight into their mechanism of epigenetic action of miRNA.","['Kumar, Dinesh', 'Kumar, Swapnil', 'Ayachit, Garima', 'Bhairappanavar, Shivarudrappa B', 'Ansari, Afzal', 'Sharma, Priyanka', 'Soni, Subhash', 'Das, Jayashankar']","['Kumar D', 'Kumar S', 'Ayachit G', 'Bhairappanavar SB', 'Ansari A', 'Sharma P', 'Soni S', 'Das J']",,"['Gujarat Institute of Bioinformatics, Gujarat State Biotechnology Mission, Department of Science & Technology, Government of Gujarat, Gandhinagar 382011, India. dinesh.vascsc@gmail.com.', 'Gujarat Institute of Bioinformatics, Gujarat State Biotechnology Mission, Department of Science & Technology, Government of Gujarat, Gandhinagar 382011, India. swapnilkr.bi@gmail.com.', 'Gujarat Institute of Bioinformatics, Gujarat State Biotechnology Mission, Department of Science & Technology, Government of Gujarat, Gandhinagar 382011, India. garima_ayachit@yahoo.co.in.', 'Gujarat Institute of Bioinformatics, Gujarat State Biotechnology Mission, Department of Science & Technology, Government of Gujarat, Gandhinagar 382011, India. rudra8282@gmail.com.', 'Gujarat Institute of Bioinformatics, Gujarat State Biotechnology Mission, Department of Science & Technology, Government of Gujarat, Gandhinagar 382011, India. md.afzal294@gmail.com.', 'Gujarat Institute of Bioinformatics, Gujarat State Biotechnology Mission, Department of Science & Technology, Government of Gujarat, Gandhinagar 382011, India. mailsharma.p@gmail.com.', 'Gujarat Institute of Bioinformatics, Gujarat State Biotechnology Mission, Department of Science & Technology, Government of Gujarat, Gandhinagar 382011, India. mdbtm@gujarat.gov.in.', 'Gujarat Institute of Bioinformatics, Gujarat State Biotechnology Mission, Department of Science & Technology, Government of Gujarat, Gandhinagar 382011, India. ssbbtm@gujarat.gov.in.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170603,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Plant)']",IM,"['Camptotheca/genetics/metabolism', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Databases, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/chemistry/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'RNA Interference', '*RNA, Plant', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systems Biology/methods', 'Trees/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC5486014,2017/06/08 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2017/06/08 06:00'],"['2017/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/17 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms18061191 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms18061191 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2017 Jun 3;18(6). pii: ijms18061191. doi: 10.3390/ijms18061191.,['NOTNLM'],"['Camptotheca acuminata', 'cancer', 'cross-kingdom regulation', 'miRNA', 'protein-protein interaction network']",['Authors declare no conflicts of interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As such, its application in acute myeloid leukemia has greatly increased our ability to quantify treatment response, and to determine the chemosensitivity of the disease, as the final product of the drug schedule, dose intensity, biodistribution, and the pharmakogenetic profile of the patient. There is now consistent evidence for the prognostic power of minimal residual disease evaluation in acute myeloid leukemia, which is complementary to the baseline prognostic assessment of the disease. The focus for its use is therefore shifting to individualize treatment based on a deeper evaluation of chemosensitivity and residual tumor burden. In this review, we will summarize the results of the major clinical studies evaluating minimal residual disease in acute myeloid leukemia in adults in recent years and address the technical and practical issues still hampering the spread of these techniques outside controlled clinical trials. We will also briefly speculate on future developments and offer our point of view, and a word of caution, on the present use of minimal residual disease measurements in ""real-life"" practice. Still, as final standardization and diffusion of the methods are sorted out, we believe that minimal residual disease will soon become the new standard for evaluating response in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Mosna, Federico', 'Capelli, Debora', 'Gottardi, Michele']","['Mosna F', 'Capelli D', 'Gottardi M']",,"['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Ospedale Centrale ""San Maurizio"", Azienda Sanitaria dell\'Alto Adige, via L.

Similar to previous reports, we have found the decrease in ASS expression in poorly differentiated HCC. These ASS(-) tumors are auxotrophic for arginine. Pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20), which degrades arginine, has shown activity in these tumors, but the antitumor effect is not robust and hence combination treatment is needed. Herein, we have elucidated the effectiveness of ADI-PEG20 combined with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) in ASS(-)HCC by targeting urea cycle and pyrimidine metabolism using four HCC cell lines as model. SNU398 and SNU387 express very low levels of ASS or ASS(-) while Huh-1, and HepG2 express high ASS similar to normal cells. Our results showed that the augmented cytotoxic effect of combination treatment only occurs in SNU398 and SNU387, and not in HepG2 and Huh-1 (ASS(+)) cells, and is partly due to reduced anti-apoptotic proteins X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (Mcl-1) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2). Importantly, lack of ASS also influences essential enzymes in pyrimidine synthesis (carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase2, aspartate transcarbamylase and dihydrooratase (CAD) and thymidylate synthase (TS)) and malate dehydrogenase-1 (MDH-1) in TCA cycle. ADI-PEG20 treatment decreased these enzymes and made them more vulnerable to 5-FU. Transfection of ASS restored these enzymes and abolished the sensitivity to ADI-PEG20 and combination treatment. Overall, our data suggest that ASS influences multiple enzymes involved in 5-FU sensitivity. Combining ADI-PEG20 and 5-FU may be effective to treat ASS(-)hepatoma and warrants further clinical investigation.","['Thongkum, Angkana', 'Wu, Chunjing', 'Li, Ying-Ying', 'Wangpaichitr, Medhi', 'Navasumrit, Panida', 'Parnlob, Varabhorn', 'Sricharunrat, Thaniya', 'Bhudhisawasdi, Vajarabhongsa', 'Ruchirawat, Mathuros', 'Savaraj, Niramol']","['Thongkum A', 'Wu C', 'Li YY', 'Wangpaichitr M', 'Navasumrit P', 'Parnlob V', 'Sricharunrat T', 'Bhudhisawasdi V', 'Ruchirawat M', 'Savaraj N']",,"['Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology, Chulabhorn Research Institute, Laksi, Bangkok 10210, Thailand. d10120101@cgi.ac.th.', 'Chulabhorn Graduate Institute, Laksi, Bangkok 10210, Thailand. d10120101@cgi.ac.th.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Miami Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, Miami, FL 33125, USA. chunjingwu@hotmail.com.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Miami Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, Miami, FL 33125, USA.

The standard of care for perianal abscess in AML is unclear. METHODS: We retrospectively collected patient data in our institute from 2009 to 2012. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-two patients with AML were analyzed. In total, 1,051 chemotherapy sessions were administered. Twenty-three patients experienced perianal abscess. Patients with perianal abscess were younger than those without (44 vs. 60 years, p < 0.0001). Perianal abscess developed in various phases of treatment and in the stem cell transplantation period. Twelve recurrences developed in 6 patients. Patients with a prior perianal abscess have a 10-fold risk of developing a subsequent abscess following further chemotherapy. The microbiology profile revealed that most pathogens were derived from the intestinal tracts, which was similar to the findings of previous studies. The 28-day mortality was 14.3% and the direct cause of death was not perianal abscess in any case. Surgical interventions had no impact on recurrence or survival. CONCLUSION: In patients with AML, perianal abscess results from gastrointestinal tract pathogens. Many patients do not require surgical interventions. The mortality is low but recurrence is common following subsequent chemotherapies. Therefore, awareness of recurrence is important for the timely management of perianal abscess in AML.","['Chang, Hung', 'Kuo, Ming-Chung', 'Tang, Tzung-Chih', 'Lin, Tung-Liang', 'Wu, Jin-Hou', 'Hung, Yu-Shin', 'Wang, Po-Nan']","['Chang H', 'Kuo MC', 'Tang TC', 'Lin TL', 'Wu JH', 'Hung YS', 'Wang PN']",,"['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kweishan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170607,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Abscess', 'Acinetobacter/isolation & purification', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Anus Diseases/complications/*pathology', 'Enterococcus/isolation & purification', 'Escherichia coli/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/complications/diagnosis', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/complications/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Young Adult']",,2017/06/07 06:00,2017/09/20 06:00,['2017/06/07 06:00'],"['2016/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['000475589 [pii]', '10.1159/000475589 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2017;138(1):10-13. doi: 10.1159/000475589.

NLPs are ~10 nm in diameter discoidal cell membrane mimics composed of apolipoproteins surrounding a lipid bilayer. NLPs containing EGFR were synthesized via incubation of baculovirus-produced recombinant EGFR with apolipoprotein and phosphoplipids under conditions that favor self-assembly. The resulting EGFR-NLPs were the correct size, formed dimers and multimers, had intrinsic autophosphorylation activity, and retained the ability to interact with EGFR-targeted ligands and inhibitors consistent with previously-published in vitro binding affinities. We anticipate rapid adoption of EGFR-NLPs for structural studies of full-length receptors and drug screening, as well as for the in vitro characterization of ErbB heterodimers and disease-relevant mutants.","['Scharadin, Tiffany M', 'He, Wei', 'Yiannakou, Yianni', 'Tomilov, Alexey A', 'Saldana, Matthew', 'Cortopassi, Gino A', 'Carraway, Kermit L 3rd', 'Coleman, Matthew A', 'Henderson, Paul T']","['Scharadin TM', 'He W', 'Yiannakou Y', 'Tomilov AA', 'Saldana M', 'Cortopassi GA', 'Carraway KL 3rd', 'Coleman MA', 'Henderson PT']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4238-0446'],"['University of California Davis School of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology Oncology, Sacramento, California, United States of America.', 'Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, California, United States of America.', 'University of California Davis, Nutrition, Davis, California, United States of America.', 'University of California Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine, Molecular Biosciences, Davis, California, United States of America.', 'University of California Davis School of Medicine, Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Sacramento, California, United States of America.', 'University of California Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine, Molecular Biosciences, Davis, California, United States of America.', 'University of California Davis School of Medicine, Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Sacramento, California, United States of America.', 'University of California Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center, Sacramento, California, United States of America.', 'Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, California, United States of America.', 'University of California Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center, Sacramento, California, United States of America.', 'University of California Davis School of Medicine, Department of Radiation Oncology, Sacramento, California, United States of America.', 'University of California Davis School of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology Oncology, Sacramento, California, United States of America.', 'University of California Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center, Sacramento, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA093373/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA108459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20170606,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Apolipoproteins)', '0 (Lipid Bilayers)', '0 (Membranes, Artificial)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Apolipoproteins/biosynthesis/chemistry', 'ErbB Receptors/administration & dosage/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lipid Bilayers/*chemistry', 'Membranes, Artificial', 'Nanoparticles/administration & dosage/*chemistry', 'Solubility', 'Water/chemistry']",PMC5460842,2017/06/07 06:00,2017/09/15 06:00,['2017/06/07 06:00'],"['2016/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0177761 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-49042 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Jun 6;12(6):e0177761. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0177761. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of the methodologic aspects are common to studies of non-ionising (i.e. ELF-MF) and ionising radiation. A systematic search and review of studies with more than one exposure under study identified 33 key and 35 supplementary papers from ten countries that have been included in this review. Examining studies that have looked at several radiation exposures, and comparing similarities and differences for the different types of radiation, through the use of directed acyclic graphs, we evaluate to what extent bias, confounding and other methodological issues might be operating in these studies. We found some indication of bias, although results are not clear cut. There is little evidence that confounding has had a substantial influence on results. Influence of the residential mobility on the study conduct and interpretation is complex and can manifest as a selection bias, confounding, increased measurement error or could also be a potential risk factor. Other factors associated with distance to power lines and to nuclear power plants should be investigated. A more complete and consistent reporting of results in the future studies will allow for a more informative comparison across studies and integration of results.","['Kheifets, Leeka', 'Swanson, John', 'Yuan, Yingzhe', 'Kusters, Cynthia', 'Vergara, Ximena']","['Kheifets L', 'Swanson J', 'Yuan Y', 'Kusters C', 'Vergara X']",,"['University of California Los Angeles, United States of America.', 'National Grid, 1-3 Strand, London, United Kingdom.', 'University of California Los Angeles, United States of America.', 'University of California Los Angeles, United States of America.', 'University of California Los Angeles, United States of America.', 'Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA, United States of America.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20170606,England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,['Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)'],IM,"['Child', 'Gamma Rays/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Magnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Radon/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors']",,2017/06/07 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/06/07 06:00'],"['2017/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1088/1361-6498/aa5fc7 [doi]'],ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 2017 Jun 26;37(2):459-491. doi: 10.1088/1361-6498/aa5fc7.

New ideas are constantly being proposed and tested, resulting in CARs that are more effective and specialized. Areas covered: Many aspects of CAR design and administration can be varied in order to achieve the best possible outcomes; optimization of this therapeutic schema is an active area of research. Here, the authors summarize the work that has been carried out thus far to assess different adaptations for each portion of the CAR itself. They also discuss the various methods used for CAR transgene transfer into effector cells. Expert opinion: While the field has made significant advancements in terms of expansion and testing of the variations available for CAR therapy, it remains difficult to ascertain which options are truly superior and under what conditions. Continued research in this area, as well as in aspects such as improving the safety profile and the anti-tumor potency of CARs, will be required to bring this therapy from early-phase clinical trials to standard of care as an effective treatment for a broad range of tumor types.","['Oldham, Robyn A A', 'Medin, Jeffrey A']","['Oldham RAA', 'Medin JA']",,"['a Department of Pediatrics , The Medical College of Wisconsin , Milwaukee , USA.', 'b Department of Medical Biophysics , University of Toronto , Toronto , Canada.', 'a Department of Pediatrics , The Medical College of Wisconsin , Milwaukee , USA.', 'b Department of Medical Biophysics , University of Toronto , Toronto , Canada.', 'c Department of Biochemistry , The Medical College of Wisconsin , Milwaukee , USA.', 'd The Institute of Medical Sciences , University of Toronto , Toronto , Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170616,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'DNA Transposable Elements/genetics', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Protein Domains/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics']",,2017/06/07 06:00,2017/11/14 06:00,['2017/06/07 06:00'],"['2017/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14712598.2017.1339687 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2017 Aug;17(8):961-978. doi: 10.1080/14712598.2017.1339687.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by presenting somatic mutations in several myeloid-related genes. In this work, targeted deep sequencing has been performed on four paired fresh DNA and WGA DNA samples from bone marrow of MDS patients, to assess the feasibility of using WGA DNA for detecting somatic mutations. The results of this study highlighted that, in general, the sequencing and alignment statistics of fresh DNA and WGA DNA samples were similar. However, after variant calling and when considering variants detected at all frequencies, there was a high level of discordance between fresh DNA and WGA DNA (overall, a higher number of variants was detected in WGA DNA). After proper filtering, a total of three somatic mutations were detected in the cohort. All somatic mutations detected in fresh DNA were also identified in WGA DNA and validated by whole exome sequencing.","['Palomo, Laura', 'Fuster-Tormo, Francisco', 'Alvira, Daniel', 'Adema, Vera', 'Armengol, Maria Pilar', 'Gomez-Marzo, Paula', 'de Haro, Nuri', 'Mallo, Mar', 'Xicoy, Blanca', 'Zamora, Lurdes', 'Sole, Francesc']","['Palomo L', 'Fuster-Tormo F', 'Alvira D', 'Adema V', 'Armengol MP', 'Gomez-Marzo P', 'de Haro N', 'Mallo M', 'Xicoy B', 'Zamora L', 'Sole F']",,"['1 MDS Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC) , ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona (Barcelona), Spain .', '1 MDS Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC) , ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona (Barcelona), Spain .', '1 MDS Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC) , ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona (Barcelona), Spain .', '1 MDS Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC) , ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona (Barcelona), Spain .', '2 Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute , Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.', '3 Genomic and Microscopy facilities, Institut Investigacio Ciencies de la Salut Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP) , Badalona (Barcelona), Spain .', '1 MDS Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC) , ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona (Barcelona), Spain .', '1 MDS Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC) , ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona (Barcelona), Spain .', '1 MDS Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC) , ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona (Barcelona), Spain .', '4 Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias I Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC) , Universitat Autonoma De Barcelona, Badalona (Barcelona), Spain .', '4 Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias I Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC) , Universitat Autonoma De Barcelona, Badalona (Barcelona), Spain .', '1 MDS Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC) , ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona (Barcelona), Spain .']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170606,United States,Biopreserv Biobank,Biopreservation and biobanking,101507284,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['DNA/chemistry/genetics/*standards', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods/standards', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*standards', 'Humans', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*standards']",,2017/06/07 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/06/07 06:00'],"['2017/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/bio.2016.0094 [doi]'],ppublish,Biopreserv Biobank. 2017 Aug;15(4):360-365. doi: 10.1089/bio.2016.0094.

Here, we demonstrated genetically that in the liver subtle increases in wild-type Met RTK levels are sufficient for spontaneous tumors in mice (Alb-R26(Met) ), conceptually illustrating how the shift from physiological to pathological conditions results from slight perturbations in signaling dosage. By analyzing 96 different genes in a panel of tumor samples, we demonstrated that liver tumorigenesis modeled by Alb-R26(Met) mice corresponds to a subset of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, thus establishing the clinical relevance of this HCC mouse model. We elucidated the regulatory networks underlying tumorigenesis by combining a phosphokinome screen with bioinformatics analysis. We then used the signaling diversity results obtained from Alb-R26(Met) HCC versus control livers to design an ""educated guess"" drug screen, which led to the identification of new, deleterious synthetic lethal interactions. In particular, we report synergistic effects of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, ribosomal S6 kinase, and cyclin-dependent kinase 1/2 in combination with Bcl-XL inhibition on a panel of liver cancer cells. Focusing on mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and Bcl-XL targeting, we mechanistically demonstrated concomitant down-regulation of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase and myeloid cell leukemia 1 levels. Of note, a phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase+/BCL-XL(+) /myeloid cell leukemia 1+ signature, deregulated in Alb-R26(Met) tumors, characterizes a subgroup of HCC patients with poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: Our genetic studies highlight the heightened vulnerability of liver cells to subtle changes in nononcogenic RTK levels, allowing them to acquire a molecular profile that facilitates the full tumorigenic program; furthermore, our outcomes uncover new synthetic lethal interactions as potential therapies for a cluster of HCC patients.

In our study, the antileukemic effect of KML001 on acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) and its mechanism of action were investigated. The results showed that KML001 inhibited cell proliferation in two types of ALL cell lines, CCRF-CEM and Molt-4. Exposure of ALL cells to KML001 induced apoptosis in a time-dependent manner. KML001 caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase instead of G0/G1 phase shown in other leukemia cells. In addition, we also tested the possibility of synergy of KML001 with doxercalciferol, a vitamin D2 derivative. Also, we found that a combination of KML001 with doxercalciferol showed a synergistic effect on ALL cell lines and this could be due to its different mechanism of action. Overall, our findings demonstrated KML001 could be a promising antileukemic agent especially when it is combined with doxercalciferol in ALL treatment.","['Liu, Yang', 'Shin, Dong-Yeop', 'Oh, Somi', 'Kim, Sujong', 'Koh, Youngil', 'Kim, Inho']","['Liu Y', 'Shin DY', 'Oh S', 'Kim S', 'Koh Y', 'Kim I']",,"['Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Pharmaceutical Division, Komipharm International Co., Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170601,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Ergocalciferols)', '0 (Sodium Compounds)', '3DIZ9LF5Y9 (1 alpha-hydroxyergocalciferol)', '48OVY2OC72 (sodium arsenite)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenites/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Ergocalciferols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Sodium Compounds/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,2017/06/07 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2017/06/07 06:00'],"['2016/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/or.2017.5688 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2017 Jul;38(1):481-487. doi: 10.3892/or.2017.5688.

In F-MuLV-induced erythroleukemia, Fli1 insertional activation producing high expression of this transcription factor required to promote proliferation. How deregulated Fli1 expression alters the balance between erythroid differentiation and proliferation is unknown. To address this issue, we exogenously overexpressed Fli1 in an erythroleukemic cell harboring activation of spi1/PU.1, another ETS gene involved in erythroleukemogenesis. While the proliferation in culture remains unaffected, Fli1 overexpression imparts morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics of immature erythroid progenitors. Fli1 overexpression in erythroleukemic cells increased the numbers of erythroid colonies on methylcellulose and reduced tumorigenicity as evidenced by increase latency of erythroleukemogenesis in mice inoculated with these cells. Although all transplanted mice developed enlargement of the spleen and liver due to leukemic infiltration, Fli1 overexpression altered the hematopoietic phenotype, significantly increasing the expression of regulatory hematopoietic genes cKIT, SCA-1, CD41 and CD71. In contrast, expression of Spi1/PU.1 in a Fli1 producing erythroleukemia cell line in which fli1 is activated, resulted in increased proliferation through activation of growth promoting proteins MAPK, AKT, cMYC and JAK2. Importantly, these progenitors express high levels of markers such as CD71 and TER119 associated with more mature erythroid cells. Thus, Fli1 overexpression induces a de-differentiation program by reverting CFU-E to BFU-E erythroid progenitor activity, while Spi1/PU.1 promoting maturation from BFU-E to CFU-E.","['Vecchiarelli-Federico, Laura M', 'Liu, Tangjingjun', 'Yao, Yao', 'Gao, Yuanyuan', 'Li, Yanmei', 'Li, You-Jun', 'Ben-David, Yaacov']","['Vecchiarelli-Federico LM', 'Liu T', 'Yao Y', 'Gao Y', 'Li Y', 'Li YJ', 'Ben-David Y']",,"['Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1L7, Canada.', 'The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academic of Sciences, Guiyang, Guizhou 550014, P.R.

Despite improved remission rates, current treatment regimens for AML are often associated with a very poor prognosis and adverse effects, necessitating more effective and safer agents. B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins regulate apoptotic pathway that can be targeted with small molecule inhibitors. APG-1252-12A is a Bcl-2 homology (BH)-3 mimetic that specifically binds to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, which has shown efficacy in some Bcl-2 dependent hematological cancers. In this study, we investigated whether APG-1252-12A inhibits the growth of five leukemia cell lines in a concentration- or time-dependent manner by MTS assay. Following treatment of AML cell line HL-60 with this compound, cell apoptosis was detected using flow cytometry and nuclear condensation was observed after Hoechst 33258 dye. Immunoblotting for cytochrome c, cleaved caspase-3 and PARP-1 cleavage was used to demonstrate the mechanism of inducing mitochondria-dependent apoptosis by APG-1252-12A. Our findings showed that this new compound inhibited cell proliferation in five leukemia cell lines and induced apoptotic death. There was a link between the level of Bcl-2 protein and IC50. APG-1252-12A targeted mitochondria and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis by inducing the HL-60 cell cytochrome c released, PARP cleavage and caspase activation.

Herein, we determined the effect of butein, a bioactive plant polyphenol, on cell growth, apoptosis and signaling pathways in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and on tumor growth in SCID mice. Treatment with butein caused a decrease in viability of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. T cells cultured with butein showed obvious apoptosis morphology, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase with activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9. Pretreatment of cells with caspase inhibitor partially blocked butein-induced inhibition of cell viability. Butein also resulted in cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. Butein markedly downregulated the protein expression levels of CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1, cyclin D2, cyclin E, survivin, XIAP, c-IAP2 and phospho-pRb. Butein also inhibited i) total and phospho-protein levels of IkappaB kinase (IKK)alpha and IKKbeta, ii) degradation and phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha, iii) JunB and JunD, iv) total and phospho-protein levels of Akt, v) phosphorylation of RelA, vi) heat shock protein 90, and vii) DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB and AP-1. In mice harboring ATLL xenograft tumors, butein caused a significant inhibition of tumor growth and reduced serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain and soluble cluster of differentiation 30. Considered together, the results indicated that butein has antiproliferative and proapoptotic properties through the suppression of NF-kappaB, AP-1 and Akt signaling in HTLV-1-infected T cells, both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting its therapeutic potential against HTLV-1-associated diseases including ATLL.","['Ishikawa, Chie', 'Senba, Masachika', 'Mori, Naoki']","['Ishikawa C', 'Senba M', 'Mori N']",,"['Department of Microbiology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa 903-0215, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8523, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa 903-0215, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170602,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Chalcones)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '4WVS5M0LGF (butein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chalcones/*administration & dosage', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology/virology', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology/virology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2017/06/07 06:00,2018/05/26 06:00,['2017/06/07 06:00'],"['2017/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.2017.4026 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2017 Aug;51(2):633-643. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2017.4026.

Beside the advantages of the drug, some problems arising from the dose-related side effects are challenging issues during the treatment. Accordingly, the classification of patients to dexamethasone sensitive and resistance groups can help to select optimizing the therapeutic dose with the lowest adverse effects particularly in sensitive cases. For this purpose, we investigated inhibited proliferation and induced cytotoxicity in NALM-6 cells, as sensitive cells, after dexamethasone treatment. In addition, comparative protein expression analysis using the 2DE-MALDI-TOF MS technique was performed to identify the specific altered proteins. In addition, we evaluated mRNA expression levels of the identified proteins in bone-marrow samples from pediatric ALL patients using the real-time q-PCR method. Eventually, proteomic analysis revealed a combination of biomarkers, including capping proteins (CAPZA1 and CAPZB), chloride channel (CLIC1), purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), and proteasome activator (PSME1), in response to the dexamethasone treatment. In addition, our results indicated low expression of identified proteins at both the mRNA and protein expression levels after drug treatment. Moreover, quantitative real-time PCR data analysis indicated that independent of the molecular subtypes of the leukemia, CAPZA1, CAPZB, CLIC1, and PNP expression levels were lower in ALL samples than normal samples, although PSME1 expression level was higher in ALL samples than normal samples. Furthermore, the expression level of all proteins (except PSME1) was different between high-risk and standard-risk patients that suggesting the prognostic value of them.

Four years later, the patient noticed a firm and painless lump in the left breast, which was diagnosed as ductal carcinoma in situ based on a percutaneous biopsy of the mass. Simple resection and sentinel lymph node biopsy of the left breast were then performed. Pathological studies revealed a medium-grade intraductal carcinoma, with local infiltration associated with invasive micropapillary carcinoma.

METHODS: We e-mailed a questionnaire to member institutions of the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group in September, 2013. The questionnaire consisted of 50 multiple-choice questions covering therapeutic environment, antimicrobial prophylaxis, screening test during neutropenia, empirical therapy for febrile neutropenia, and the use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor. The results were compared to those of previous surveys conducted in 2001 and 2007, and also to the recommendations described in the guidelines. RESULTS: Usable responses were received from 141 out of 222 (63.5%) institutions. Chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia was performed in protective environment in 90% of the institutions, which increased compared to previous survey (76%). Fluoroquinolones and fluconazole were the most commonly used antimicrobial agents for antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis, followed by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and itraconazole, respectively. In empirical therapy for febrile neutropenia, monotherapy with beta-lactum antibiotics was the first-line therapy in most of the institutions. While empirical antifungal therapy was adopted for persistent fever in more than half of the institutions, preemptive/presumptive therapy was also used in approximately 40% of the institutions. Most of the clinicians were reluctant to use granulocyte-colony stimulating factor routinely in chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: This study clarified the current clinical practices of infectious complications during chemotherapy for acute leukemia and would provide important information for the development of a suitable guideline in Japan.","['Kimura, Shun-Ichi', 'Fujita, Hiroyuki', 'Kato, Hideaki', 'Hiramoto, Nobuhiro', 'Hosono, Naoko', 'Takahashi, Tsutomu', 'Shigeno, Kazuyuki', 'Hatsumi, Naoko', 'Minamiguchi, Hitoshi', 'Miyatake, Junichi', 'Handa, Hiroshi', 'Akiyama, Nobu', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Yoshida, Minoru', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Kimura SI', 'Fujita H', 'Kato H', 'Hiramoto N', 'Hosono N', 'Takahashi T', 'Shigeno K', 'Hatsumi N', 'Minamiguchi H', 'Miyatake J', 'Handa H', 'Akiyama N', 'Kanda Y', 'Yoshida M', 'Kiyoi H', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Naoe T']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6084-6863'],"['Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Saiseikai Yokohama Nanbu Hospital, Yokohama, Japan. fujitah@nanbu.saiseikai.or.jp.', 'Department of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology/Hematology, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hamamatsu Medical Center, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Leukemia Research Center, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sakai Hospital Kinki University Faculty of Medicine, Sakai, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Teikyo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Japan.', 'Fourth Department of Internal Medicine, Teikyo University School of Medicine, Mizonokuchi hospital, Kawasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Molecular Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170606,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infections/etiology/pathology/*therapy', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,2017/06/07 06:00,2018/03/23 06:00,['2017/06/07 06:00'],"['2017/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-017-3775-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-017-3775-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2017 Nov;25(11):3515-3521. doi: 10.1007/s00520-017-3775-8.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients diagnosed with T-ALL and treated in Sultan Qaboos University Hospital and Royal Hospital in Oman between 2004 and 2010. The diagnosis of T-ALL was established using French-American-British classification or World Health Organization criteria. Patients were considered having myeloid antigen expression if they expressed CD13, CD33, or both (My+ and My-). RESULTS: Of the 39 patients, 38 were included in the study (25 patients with My- and median age of 18.4 years, 13 patients with My+ and median age of 22.0 years). Median follow-up was 12 months. Thirty-two out of the total cohort were eligible for response-rate assessment. Twenty-nine patients (90.6%) achieved CR with one or two courses of chemotherapy with similar CR rates between the two groups (p = 0.880). Twenty-five percent (5/20) of the patients with My- required two courses of induction, whereas 58.3% (7/12) of My+ required two courses of induction and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.040). In the multivariable analysis; age, gender, initial white blood cell count, central nervous system disease, and myeloid antigen expression were not statistically significant predictors of CR. The EFS and OS were similar between the My+ and My- groups p = 0.180 and p = 0.440, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with T-ALL with myeloid antigen expression need more courses of induction; however, rates of CR, EFS, and OS are not different from those without myeloid antigen expression. Larger prospective studies are required to confirm these findings.","['Al-Zaabi, Mohamed', 'Al-Khabori, Murtadha', 'Fawaz, Naglaa', 'Al-Lamki, Sulayma', 'Al-Riyami, Arwa', 'Al-Huneini, Mohammed', 'Al-Muslahi, Muhanna', 'Alkindi, Salam']","['Al-Zaabi M', 'Al-Khabori M', 'Fawaz N', 'Al-Lamki S', 'Al-Riyami A', 'Al-Huneini M', 'Al-Muslahi M', 'Alkindi S']",,"['Hematology Residency Training Program, Oman Medical Specialty Board, Muscat, Oman.', 'Department of Hematology, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman.', 'Department of Hematology, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Royal Hospital, Muscat, Oman.', 'Department of Hematology, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman.', 'Department of Hematology, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Royal Hospital, Muscat, Oman.', 'Department of Hematology, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Oman,Oman Med J,Oman medical journal,101526350,,,,PMC5447802,2017/06/07 06:00,2017/06/07 06:01,['2017/06/07 06:00'],"['2017/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.5001/omj.2017.36 [doi]', 'OMJ-D-16-00098 [pii]']",ppublish,Oman Med J. 2017 May;32(3):189-193. doi: 10.5001/omj.2017.36.,['NOTNLM'],"['Antigens', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Patient Outcome Assessment', 'T-Lymphocytes']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, some cancer cells such as THP-1 leukaemia cells have been shown to be resistant towards plasma-induced cell death, thereby serving as a good model for optimizing plasmas in order to foster pro-apoptotic anticancer effects. A helium/oxygen radio frequency driven atmospheric plasma profoundly induced apoptosis in THP-1 cells whereas helium, humidified helium, and humidified helium/oxygen plasmas were inefficient. Hydrogen peroxide - previously shown as central plasma-derived agent - did not participate in the killing reaction but our results suggest hypochlorous acid to be responsible for the effect observed. Proteomic analysis of THP-1 cells exposed to He/O2 plasma emphasized a prominent growth retardation, cell stress, apoptosis, and a pro-immunogenic profile. Altogether, a plasma setting that inactivates previously unresponsive leukaemia cells is presented. Crucial reactive species in the plasma and liquid environment were identified and discussed, deciphering the complexity of plasma from the gas phase into the liquid down to the cellular response mechanism. These results may help tailoring plasmas for clinical applications such as oxidation-insensitive types of cancer.","['Bekeschus, Sander', 'Wende, Kristian', 'Hefny, Mohamed Mokhtar', 'Rodder, Katrin', 'Jablonowski, Helena', 'Schmidt, Anke', 'Woedtke, Thomas von', 'Weltmann, Klaus-Dieter', 'Benedikt, Jan']","['Bekeschus S', 'Wende K', 'Hefny MM', 'Rodder K', 'Jablonowski H', 'Schmidt A', 'Woedtke TV', 'Weltmann KD', 'Benedikt J']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8773-8862', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5217-0683']","['Leibniz-Institute for Plasma Science and Technology (INP Greifswald) ZIK plasmatis, Greifswald, Germany. sander.bekeschus@inp-greifswald.de.', 'Leibniz-Institute for Plasma Science and Technology (INP Greifswald) ZIK plasmatis, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Coupled Plasma-Solid State Systems, Faculty of Physics and Astronomy, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', 'Basic Science Department, Faculty of Engineering and Technology, Future University in Egypt, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Leibniz-Institute for Plasma Science and Technology (INP Greifswald) ZIK plasmatis, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute for Plasma Science and Technology (INP Greifswald) ZIK plasmatis, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute for Plasma Science and Technology (INP Greifswald) ZIK plasmatis, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute for Plasma Science and Technology (INP Greifswald) ZIK plasmatis, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Institute for Hygiene and Environmental Medicine, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute for Plasma Science and Technology (INP Greifswald) ZIK plasmatis, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Coupled Plasma-Solid State Systems, Faculty of Physics and Astronomy, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170605,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Plasma Gases)', '206GF3GB41 (Helium)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Helium/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Oxygen/*chemistry', 'Plasma Gases/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Proteomics/methods', 'THP-1 Cells']",PMC5459849,2017/06/07 06:00,2018/12/19 06:00,['2017/06/07 06:00'],"['2016/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-03131-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-03131-y [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Jun 5;7(1):2791. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-03131-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular mechanisms underlying these subtypes are incompletely understood. Here, we present a comprehensive whole-genome sequencing analysis of somatically acquired genetic events from 46 CLL patients, including a systematic comparison of coding and non-coding single-nucleotide variants, copy number variants and structural variants, regions of kataegis and mutation signatures between IgHV(mut) and IgHV(unmut) subtypes. We demonstrate that one-quarter of non-coding mutations in regions of kataegis outside the Ig loci are located in genes relevant to CLL. We show that non-coding mutations in ATM may negatively impact on ATM expression and find non-coding and regulatory region mutations in TCL1A, and in IgHV(unmut) CLL in IKZF3, SAMHD1,PAX5 and BIRC3. Finally, we show that IgHV(unmut) CLL is dominated by coding mutations in driver genes and an aging signature, whereas IgHV(mut) CLL has a high incidence of promoter and enhancer mutations caused by aberrant activation-induced cytidine deaminase activity. Taken together, our data support the hypothesis that differences in clinical outcome and biological characteristics between the two subgroups might reflect differences in mutation distribution, incidence and distinct underlying mutagenic mechanisms.","['Burns, A', 'Alsolami, R', 'Becq, J', 'Stamatopoulos, B', 'Timbs, A', 'Bruce, D', 'Robbe, P', 'Vavoulis, D', 'Clifford, R', 'Cabes, M', 'Dreau, H', 'Taylor, J', 'Knight, S J L', 'Mansson, R', 'Bentley, D', 'Beekman, R', 'Martin-Subero, J I', 'Campo, E', 'Houlston, R S', 'Ridout, K E', 'Schuh, A']","['Burns A', 'Alsolami R', 'Becq J', 'Stamatopoulos B', 'Timbs A', 'Bruce D', 'Robbe P', 'Vavoulis D', 'Clifford R', 'Cabes M', 'Dreau H', 'Taylor J', 'Knight SJL', 'Mansson R', 'Bentley D', 'Beekman R', 'Martin-Subero JI', 'Campo E', 'Houlston RS', 'Ridout KE', 'Schuh A']",,"['Department of Molecular Haematology, Oxford Molecular Diagnostics Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Molecular Haematology, Oxford Molecular Diagnostics Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'Nuffield Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'King Abdulaziz University, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Illumina Cambridge Ltd, Saffron Walden, UK.', 'Department of Molecular Haematology, Oxford Molecular Diagnostics Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Molecular Haematology, Oxford Molecular Diagnostics Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Molecular Haematology, Oxford Molecular Diagnostics Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Molecular Haematology, Oxford Molecular Diagnostics Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Molecular Haematology, Oxford Molecular Diagnostics Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Molecular Haematology, Oxford Molecular Diagnostics Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Illumina Cambridge Ltd, Saffron Walden, UK.', ""Biomedical Epigenomics Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Biomedical Epigenomics Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Hematopathology Unit, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Division of Molecular Pathology, the Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'Department of Molecular Haematology, Oxford Molecular Diagnostics Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Molecular Haematology, Oxford Molecular Diagnostics Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'Department of Health/United Kingdom', '090532/Z/09/Z/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170606,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.5.- (SAM Domain and HD Domain-Containing Protein 1)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cytidine Deaminase/genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'SAM Domain and HD Domain-Containing Protein 1/genetics', 'Whole Genome Sequencing/methods']",PMC5808074,2017/06/07 06:00,2019/01/03 06:00,['2017/06/07 06:00'],"['2017/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017177 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.177 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Feb;32(2):332-342. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.177.

Through a meta-anlysis of these data with data from MRC Myeloma IX trial, totalling 1905 newly diagnosed MM patients (NDMM), we confirm the association of t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), del(17p) and gain(1q21) with poor prognosis with hazard ratios (HRs) for OS of 1.60 (P=4.77 x 10(-7)), 1.74 (P=0.0005), 1.90 (P=0.0089), 2.10 (P=8.86 x 10(-14)) and 1.68 (P=2.18 x 10(-14)), respectively.

This prompted us to design a risk- and age-adapted protocol (Programa Espanol de Tratamientos en Hematologia (PETHEMA)/HOVON LPA2005), with dose reduction of consolidation chemotherapy. Patients aged 60 years reported to the PETHEMA registry and were treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) plus anthracycline-based regimens according to three consecutive PETHEMA trials that were included. We compared the long-term outcomes of the LPA2005 trial with the preceding PETHEMA trials using non-age-adapted schedules (LPA96&LPA99). From 1996 to 2012, 389 older patients were registered, of whom 268 patients (69%) were eligible. Causes of ineligibility were secondary APL (19%), and unfit for chemotherapy (11%). Median age was 67 years, without relevant differences between LPA2005 and LPA96&LPA99 cohorts. Overall, 216 patients (81%) achieved complete remission with no differences between trials. The 5-year NRM, cumulative incidence of relapse, disease-free survival and overall survival in the LPA2005 vs the LPA96&99 were 5 vs 18% (P=0.15), 7 vs 12% (P=0.23), 87 vs 69% (P=0.04) and 74 vs 60% (P=0.06).

Herein, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between the prognostic significance of ERG expression and CN-AML. METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed database and other search engines were used to identify the studies between January 2005 and November 2016. A total of 667 CN-AML patients were collected from seven published studies. Of the 667 patients underwent intensive chemotherapy, 429 had low expression of ERG and 238 had high expression of ERG. Summary odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the ERG expression and CN-AML were calculated using fixed- or random-effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed using Chi-squared-based Q- statistic test and I2 statistics. All statistical analyses were performed using R.3.3.1 software packages (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and RevMan5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark). RESULTS: Overall, patients with high ERG expression had a worse relapse (OR = 2.5127, 95% CI: 1.5177-4.1601, P = 0.0003) and lower complete remission (OR = 0. 3495, 95% CI: 0.2418-0.5051, P< 0.0001). With regard to the known molecular markers, both internal tandem duplications of the fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 gene (OR = 3.8634, 95% CI: 1.8285-8.1626, P = 0.004) and brain and acute leukemia, cytoplasmic (OR = 3.1538, 95% CI: 2.0537-4.8432, P< 0.0001) were associated with the ERG expression. In addition, the results showed a statistical significance between French-American-British (FAB) classification subtype (minimally differentiated AML and AML without maturation, OR = 4.7902, 95% CI: 2.7772-8.2624, P< 0.0001; acute monocytic leukemia, OR = 0.2324, 95% CI: 0.0899-0.6006, P = 0.0026) and ERG expression. CONCLUSION: High ERG expression might be used as a strong adverse prognostic factor in CN-AML.","['Fang, Jian-Fei', 'Yuan, Hai-Ning', 'Song, Yong-Fei', 'Sun, Pei-Bei', 'Zheng, Xiao-Liang', 'Wang, Xiao-Ju']","['Fang JF', 'Yuan HN', 'Song YF', 'Sun PB', 'Zheng XL', 'Wang XJ']",,"['Center for Molecular Medicine, Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310013; Institute of Lung Cancer, Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310013, China.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine, Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310013, China.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine, Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310013, China.', 'Department of Reproductive Physiology, Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310013, China.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine, Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310013, China.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine, Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310013; Institute of Lung Cancer, Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310013, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG/metabolism']",PMC5463480,2017/06/07 06:00,2018/04/10 06:00,['2017/06/07 06:00'],"['2017/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['ChinMedJ_2017_130_12_1481_207474 [pii]', '10.4103/0366-6999.207474 [doi]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2017 Jun 20;130(12):1481-1490. doi: 10.4103/0366-6999.207474.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Dictyostelium discoideum, polyphosphate is used as a secreted signal that inhibits cytokinesis in an autocrine negative feedback loop. To elucidate how cells respond to this unusual signal, we undertook a proteomic analysis of cells treated with physiological levels of polyphosphate and observed that polyphosphate causes cells to decrease levels of actin cytoskeleton proteins, possibly explaining how polyphosphate inhibits cytokinesis. Polyphosphate also causes proteasome protein levels to decrease, and in both Dictyostelium and human leukemia cells, decreases proteasome activity and cell proliferation. Polyphosphate also induces Dictyostelium cells to begin development by increasing expression of the cell-cell adhesion molecule CsA (also known as CsaA) and causing aggregation, and this effect, as well as the inhibition of proteasome activity, is mediated by Ras and Akt proteins. Surprisingly, Ras and Akt do not affect the ability of polyphosphate to inhibit proliferation, suggesting that a branching pathway mediates the effects of polyphosphate, with one branch affecting proliferation, and the other branch affecting development.","['Suess, Patrick M', 'Watson, Jacob', 'Chen, Wensheng', 'Gomer, Richard H']","['Suess PM', 'Watson J', 'Chen W', 'Gomer RH']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3381-541X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2361-4307']","['Department of Biology, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843-3474, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843-3474, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843-3474, USA.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicine, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China.', 'Department of Biology, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843-3474, USA rgomer@tamu.edu.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM102280/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM118355/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20170605,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Polyphosphates)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Dictyostelium/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Polyphosphates/*metabolism', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",PMC5536921,2017/06/07 06:00,2018/09/12 06:00,['2017/06/07 06:00'],"['2017/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['jcs.203372 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.203372 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2017 Jul 15;130(14):2394-2404. doi: 10.1242/jcs.203372.

Rituximab (RTX) is frequently considered as its ""ancestor"" and OBZ clinical development was justified by the importance of FcgammaRIIIA-mediated mechanisms in RTX clinical activity. However, RTX differs from OBZ in 2 critical independent properties: being a type I anti-CD20 mAb and not being Fc-optimized. Moreover, the use of a different dosing regimen for RTX and OBZ further complicates any interpretation of clinical results. The results obtained for OBZ in CLL provide new arguments for FcgammaRIIIA-mediated mechanisms when the target antigen is expressed at a low density. Results of OBZ in FL confirm the interest for FcgammaRIIIA-mediated mechanisms, with some limitations, some of them being possibly due to lack of OBZ-induced complement activation. The situation in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is deceiving, as the possible gains of activity of OBZ appear to be annihilated by the lack of complement activation. Although RTX was by chance an anti-CD20 mAb with equilibrated pharmacodynamic properties, the reinforcement of some of these properties, which has been done at the expense of complement activation, has conferred an advantage in some B-cell disorders while restricting OBZ indications. The OBZ story nicely demonstrates that the future of naked mAbs is to design agents with optimized and tailored properties, and that this must be done step by step, with a full clinical validation.","['Cartron, Guillaume', 'Watier, Herve']","['Cartron G', 'Watier H']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2139-4171'],"[""Departement d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU), Montpellier, France."", 'Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 5235, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'UMR CNRS 7292, Universite Francois Rabelais, Tours, France; and.', ""Laboratoire d'Immunologie, CHU, Tours, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170605,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (FCGR3A protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'O43472U9X8 (obinutuzumab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/blood/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/blood/*drug therapy', 'Receptors, IgG/blood', 'Rituximab/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",,2017/06/07 06:00,2017/08/11 06:00,['2017/06/07 06:00'],"['2017/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33129-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-03-771832 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Aug 3;130(5):581-589. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-03-771832.

Single hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been functionally shown to generate all mature cell types for the lifetime of the organism. Differentiation of HSCs toward alternative lineages must be balanced at the population level by the fate decisions made by individual cells. Transcription factors play a key role in regulating these decisions and operate within organized regulatory programs that can be modeled as transcriptional regulatory networks. As dysregulation of single HSC fate decisions is linked to fatal malignancies such as leukemia, it is important to understand how these decisions are controlled on a cell-by-cell basis. Here we developed and applied a network inference method, exploiting the ability to infer dynamic information from single-cell snapshot expression data based on expression profiles of 48 genes in 2,167 blood stem and progenitor cells. This approach allowed us to infer transcriptional regulatory network models that recapitulated differentiation of HSCs into progenitor cell types, focusing on trajectories toward megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors and lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors. By comparing these two models, we identified and subsequently experimentally validated a difference in the regulation of nuclear factor, erythroid 2 (Nfe2) and core-binding factor, runt domain, alpha subunit 2, translocated to, 3 homolog (Cbfa2t3h) by the transcription factor Gata2. Our approach confirms known aspects of hematopoiesis, provides hypotheses about regulation of HSC differentiation, and is widely applicable to other hierarchical biological systems to uncover regulatory relationships.","['Hamey, Fiona K', 'Nestorowa, Sonia', 'Kinston, Sarah J', 'Kent, David G', 'Wilson, Nicola K', 'Gottgens, Berthold']","['Hamey FK', 'Nestorowa S', 'Kinston SJ', 'Kent DG', 'Wilson NK', 'Gottgens B']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6302-5705'],"['Department of Haematology, Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge CB2 0XY, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge CB2 0XY, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge CB2 0XY, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge CB2 0XY, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge CB2 0XY, United Kingdom bg200@cam.ac.uk nkw22@cam.ac.uk.', 'Department of Haematology, Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge CB2 0XY, United Kingdom bg200@cam.ac.uk nkw22@cam.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom', 'Department of Health/United Kingdom', 'Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'MR/M008975/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_PC_12009/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['0 (Transcription Factors)'],IM,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism/physiology']",PMC5468644,2017/06/07 06:00,2018/05/17 06:00,['2017/06/07 06:00'],"['2017/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['1610609114 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1610609114 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2017 Jun 6;114(23):5822-5829. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1610609114.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Boolean network', '*gene regulatory networks', '*hematopoiesis', '*single cell', '*stem progenitor cells']",['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although KIT(D816V) has been found in melanoma, its function and involvement in this malignancy is not understood. Here we show that KIT(D816V) induces tyrosine phosphorylation of MITF through a triple protein complex formation between KIT, MITF, and SRC family kinases. In turn, phosphorylated MITF activates target genes that are involved in melanoma proliferation, cell-cycle progression, suppression of senescence, survival, and invasion. By blocking the triple protein complex formation, thus preventing MITF phosphorylation, the cells became hypersensitive to SRC inhibitors. We have therefore delineated a mechanism behind the oncogenic effects of KIT(D816V) in melanoma and provided a rationale for the heightened SRC inhibitor sensitivity in KIT(D816V) transformed cells.Implications: This study demonstrates that an oncogenic tyrosine kinase mutant, KIT(D816V), can alter the transcriptional program of the transcription factor MITF in melanoma Mol Cancer Res; 15(9); 1265-74.

CD123, which is specifically overexpressed on AML cells, plays an important role in cell cycling and enhances the cell resistance to the apoptotic stimuli. Given such a unique role of CD123 in AML cells, we aim to develop a novel drug targeting delivery system using CD123 monoclonal antibody (mAb) in this study. On the basis of the daunorubicin (DNR) loaded PEGylated liposomes (DNR-LP), a post-insertion method was applied to covalently attach the anti-CD123 mAb onto the surface of the liposomes to obtain the anti-CD123 mAb modified immunoliposomes (CD123-ILP). Immunoliposomes with different anti-CD123 mAb density (mAb/liposomal S100PC, molar ratio, 0.06%, L-CD123-ILP and 0.14%, H-CD123-ILP) were prepared, respectively. The expressions of CD123 in KG-1a, Kasumi-1, HL-60, NB4 and THP-1 cells were determined by flow cytometry. The cell binding and uptake assays revealed that CD123-ILP was internalized into the CD123(+) AML cells, while the MTT assay indicated that CD123-ILP had stronger inhibitory effect on the growth of THP-1 and KG-1a cells, in which CD123 were highly expressed. Furthermore, in vitro drug release studies of DNR-LP and CD123-ILP showed a sustained release profile for both systems, which were further confirmed by in vivo pharmacokinetics study of liposomal DNR in rats. In this study, we reported the development of CD123-ILP for the first time by our best knowledge, which offered a promising drug targeting delivery system against CD123(+) AML cells.","['Wang, Yin', 'Liu, Furong', 'Wang, Qiantao', 'Xiang, Honglin', 'Jin, Hui', 'Li, Hui', 'Mao, Shengjun']","['Wang Y', 'Liu F', 'Wang Q', 'Xiang H', 'Jin H', 'Li H', 'Mao S']",,"['Key Laboratory of Drug Targeting and Drug Delivery System, Ministry of Education & West China School of Pharmacy, Sichuan University, No.17, Section 3, Southern Renmin Road, Chengdu 610041, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Drug Targeting and Drug Delivery System, Ministry of Education & West China School of Pharmacy, Sichuan University, No.17, Section 3, Southern Renmin Road, Chengdu 610041, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Drug Targeting and Drug Delivery System, Ministry of Education & West China School of Pharmacy, Sichuan University, No.17, Section 3, Southern Renmin Road, Chengdu 610041, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Drug Targeting and Drug Delivery System, Ministry of Education & West China School of Pharmacy, Sichuan University, No.17, Section 3, Southern Renmin Road, Chengdu 610041, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Drug Targeting and Drug Delivery System, Ministry of Education & West China School of Pharmacy, Sichuan University, No.17, Section 3, Southern Renmin Road, Chengdu 610041, PR China.

Secondary objectives were to describe reasons for non-enrollment and factors associated with enrollment on trials. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included children newly diagnosed with cancer between 0 and 14 years of age and diagnosed from 2001 to 2012. We used data from the Cancer in Young People in Canada (CYP-C) national pediatric cancer population-based database. CYP-C captures all cases of pediatric cancer (0-14 years) diagnosed and treated at one of the 17 tertiary pediatric oncology centers in Canada. Non-enrollment was evaluated using univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: There were 9204 children with cancer included, of whom 2533 (27.5%) were enrolled on a clinical trial. The most common reasons cited for non-enrollment were lack of an available trial (52.2%) and physician choice (11.2%). In multiple regression, Asian and Arab/west Asian race were associated with lower enrollment (P = 0.006 and P = 0.032 respectively). All cancer diagnoses were more likely to be enrolled compared to astrocytoma and children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia had an almost 18-fold increased odds of enrollment compared to astrocytoma (P < 0.0001). Greater distance from the tertiary care center was independently associated with non-enrollment (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In Canada, 27.5% of children with cancer are enrolled onto therapeutic clinical trials and lack of an available trial is the most common reason contributing to non-enrollment. Future research should better understand reasons for lack of trial availability and physician preferences to not offer trials.","['Pole, Jason D', 'Barber, Randy', 'Bergeron, Rose-Emilie', 'Carret, Anne Sophie', 'Dix, David', 'Kulkarni, Ketan', 'Martineau, Emilie', 'Randall, Alicia', 'Stammers, David', 'Strahlendorf, Caron', 'Strother, Douglas R', 'Truong, Tony H', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Pole JD', 'Barber R', 'Bergeron RE', 'Carret AS', 'Dix D', 'Kulkarni K', 'Martineau E', 'Randall A', 'Stammers D', 'Strahlendorf C', 'Strother DR', 'Truong TH', 'Sung L']",,"['Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario, 480 University Avenue, Suite 1014, Toronto, M5G 1V2, Canada.', 'C17 Research Council, ECHA, 11405-87 Avenue, Edmonton, T6G 1C9, Canada.', ""Montreal Children's Hospital, 1001 Boulevard Decarie, Montreal, H4A 3J1, Canada."", 'Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, 3175 Chemin Cote Sainte-Catherine, Montreal, H1T 3C5, Canada.', ""BC Children's Hospital, 4480 Oak Street Room B315, Vancouver, V6H 3V4, Canada."", 'IWK Health Centre, 5850/5950 University Avenue, Halifax, B3K 6R8, Canada.', 'Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec-Universite Laval, 2705 Boulevard Laurier, Quebec City, G1V 4G2, Canada.', 'IWK Health Centre, 5850/5950 University Avenue, Halifax, B3K 6R8, Canada.', 'Royal University Hospital, 103 Hospital Drive, Saskatoon, S7N 0W8, Canada.', ""BC Children's Hospital, 4480 Oak Street Room B315, Vancouver, V6H 3V4, Canada."", ""Alberta Children's Hospital, 2888 Shaganappi Trail N.W, Calgary, T3B 6A8, Canada."", ""Alberta Children's Hospital, 2888 Shaganappi Trail N.W, Calgary, T3B 6A8, Canada."", 'The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, M5G 1X8, Canada. lillian.sung@sickkids.ca.', 'Child Health Evaluative Sciences, 686 Bay Street, Toronto, M5G 0A4, Canada. lillian.sung@sickkids.ca.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170605,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Astrocytoma/drug therapy', 'Canada', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology/*methods', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', '*Patient Selection', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC5460360,2017/06/07 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2017/06/07 06:00'],"['2017/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-017-3390-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-017-3390-6 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2017 Jun 5;17(1):402. doi: 10.1186/s12885-017-3390-6.,['NOTNLM'],"['Canada', 'Cancer', 'Children', 'Clinical trial enrollment', 'Population-based']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnostic criteria exclude the presence of lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, infections, autoimmune diseases or any sign of a lymphoproliferative disorder. This prospective study was designed in order to evaluate the frequency of MBL in blood donors in Turkey. METHODS: The diagnosis of MBL was identified by flow cytometry method based on the International Familial CLL Consortium Report. A total of 999 volunteers [median age 34 (18-78) years; male/female: 705/294] were included in the study. RESULTS: Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis was demonstrated in 18 cases (1.8%). A total of 16 cases (1.6%) was evaluated as CLL-like MBL, while 2 (0.2%) had a non-CLL-like phenotype. The subjects were divided into three groups according to age, as <40 years, 40-60 years and >60 years. The prevalence of MBL was 1.1% below 40 years, 0.6% between 40 and 60 years and 0.1% in cases over 60 years, without statistical significance (p > 0.05). DISCUSSION: The sensitivity of the flow cytometry method is essential and may be responsible for the variations in the prevalence of MBL in different populations which can also be attributed to study design, higher detection rates in the elderly and families with genetic predisposition to CLL. CONCLUSION: Large population-based studies and standardized laboratory methods are needed to determine the potential risk factors of progression to CLL, including molecular markers and genetic profile.","['Yagci, Munci', 'Yegin, Zeynep Arzu', 'Yenicesu, Idil', 'Suyani, Elif', 'Ulu, Bahar Uncu', 'Inci, Kamil', 'Cetin, Zeynep', 'Yilmaz, Zeynep', 'Kursunoglu, Nevruz', 'Ozkurt, Zubeyde Nur']","['Yagci M', 'Yegin ZA', 'Yenicesu I', 'Suyani E', 'Ulu BU', 'Inci K', 'Cetin Z', 'Yilmaz Z', 'Kursunoglu N', 'Ozkurt ZN']",,"['a Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology , Gazi University , Ankara , Turkey.', 'a Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology , Gazi University , Ankara , Turkey.', 'b Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Blood Bank , Gazi University , Ankara , Turkey.', 'a Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology , Gazi University , Ankara , Turkey.', 'c Faculty of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine , Gazi University , Ankara , Turkey.', 'c Faculty of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine , Gazi University , Ankara , Turkey.', 'c Faculty of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine , Gazi University , Ankara , Turkey.', 'a Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology , Gazi University , Ankara , Turkey.', 'a Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology , Gazi University , Ankara , Turkey.', 'a Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology , Gazi University , Ankara , Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170605,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,IM,"['Blood Donors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytosis/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Turkey']",,2017/06/07 06:00,2018/07/06 06:00,['2017/06/07 06:00'],"['2017/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2017.1335969 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2018 Jan;23(1):25-29. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2017.1335969.

Therapies engaging endogenous T-cells against acute lymphoblastic leukemia are emerging for children and adults with various poor prognostic factors, thus accurate knowledge of immunotherapies is necessary for their effective implementation in the future. In this review, we evaluate clinical trial data regarding chimeric antigen receptor T-cells and blinatumomab, for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Summary In the relapsed or refractory setting, response rates rapidly diminish after subsequent lines of chemotherapy and cumulative toxicities may cause significant patient harm. Immunotherapies provide an approach to improve response rates and minimize traditional toxicities via novel mechanisms of action. Two therapies targeting CD19 antigens expressed on B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia lineages, chimeric antigen receptor T-cells, and blinatumomab have induced complete remissions among high-risk patient populations, especially those refractory to multiple therapies. Adverse effects such as cytokine release syndrome and neurologic sequelae remain serious precautions of each therapy. Conclusion Knowledge of immunotherapy mechanisms and clinical outcomes associated with immunotherapies is critical for the optimization of treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Future use of chimeric antigen receptor T-cells and blinatumomab demands proper assessment of a patient's disease and treatment history in addition to unique monitoring and supportive care interventions.","['DasGupta, Ryan K', 'Marini, Bernard L', 'Rudoni, Joslyn', 'Perissinotti, Anthony J']","['DasGupta RK', 'Marini BL', 'Rudoni J', 'Perissinotti AJ']",,"['1 Department of Pharmacy, The James Cancer Hospital at The Ohio State University, USA.', '2 Department of Pharmacy, University of Michigan Health System, USA.', '3 Division of Pharmacy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, USA.', '2 Department of Pharmacy, University of Michigan Health System, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170605,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/administration & dosage', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,2017/06/07 06:00,2018/10/03 06:00,['2017/06/07 06:00'],"['2017/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155217713363 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2018 Sep;24(6):453-467. doi: 10.1177/1078155217713363.

Of many etiologies of cancer, an unexplored area is the variations of genes implicated in methylation reaction. OBJECTIVE: The study evaluated the association of BHMT (rs3733890) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), followed by in-silico characterization of variations in BHMT gene. METHODS: BHMT [rs3733890; c.742G > A, which substitutes an arginine by a glutamine at codon 239 (R239Q)] was screened by Tetra-primer Amplification Refractory Mutation System PCR (T-ARMS-PCR) and confirmed using DNA sequencing. In-silico analysis was conducted using bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: BHMT (rs3733890) showed an insignificant association with both childhood and adult ALL. Bioinformatics analysis showed that 18 nsSNPs are deleterious, 3 SNPs in 3'-UTR (rs59109725, rs116634518 and rs138578732) alter the miRNA-binding site, and 11 CNVs are present in the BHMT gene. As consequence of BHMT (rs3733890) polymorphism the free energy changes from -101210.1 kJ/mol to -200021.8 kJ/mol. CONCLUSIONS: BHMT (rs3733890) polymorphism showed no association with ALL. Hence this investigation needs further evaluation in larger sample size and effect of other SNPs, CNVs and miRNA's is required to elucidate the role of BHMT gene in ALL development.","['Bellampalli, Ravishankara', 'Vohra, Manik', 'Sharma, Kashish', 'Bhaskaranand, Nalini', 'Bhat, Kamalakshi G', 'Prasad, Krishna', 'Sharma, Anu R', 'Satyamoorthy, Kapaettu', 'Rai, Padmalatha S']","['Bellampalli R', 'Vohra M', 'Sharma K', 'Bhaskaranand N', 'Bhat KG', 'Prasad K', 'Sharma AR', 'Satyamoorthy K', 'Rai PS']",,"['Department of Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Manipal University, Manipal, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Manipal University, Manipal, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Manipal University, Manipal, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Manipal University, Manipal, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Manipal University, Manipal, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal University, Mangalore, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal University, Mangalore, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Medicine, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal University, Mangalore, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Manipal University, Manipal, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, School of Life Sciences, Manipal University, Manipal, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Manipal University, Manipal, Karnataka, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,"['EC 2.1.1.5 (BHMT protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.5 (Betaine-Homocysteine S-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Betaine-Homocysteine S-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Young Adult']",,2017/06/07 06:00,2018/05/04 06:00,['2017/06/07 06:00'],"['2017/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['CBM160186 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-160186 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biomark. 2017 Jul 4;19(4):393-401. doi: 10.3233/CBM-160186.,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'BHMT gene', 'SNPs', 'T-ARMS-PCR']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Strategies for their use to achieve more complex tasks like regional exchanges for gene humanization or the establishment of conditional alleles are still emerging. To optimize Cas9-assisted targeting, we measured the relationship between targeting frequency and homology length in targeting constructs using a hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase assay in mouse embryonic stem cells. Targeting frequency with supercoiled plasmids improved steeply up to 2 kb total homology and continued to increase with even longer homology arms, thereby implying that Cas9-assisted targeting efficiencies can be improved using homology arms of 1 kb or greater. To humanize the Kmt2d gene, we built a hybrid mouse/human targeting construct in a bacterial artificial chromosome by recombineering. To simplify the possible outcomes, we employed a single Cas9 cleavage strategy and best achieved the intended 42 kb regional exchange with a targeting construct including a very long homology arm to recombine approximately 42 kb away from the cleavage site. We recommend the use of long homology arm targeting constructs for accurate and efficient complex genome engineering, particularly when combined with the simplifying advantages of using just one Cas9 cleavage at the genome target site.","['Baker, Oliver', 'Tsurkan, Sarah', 'Fu, Jun', 'Klink, Barbara', 'Rump, Andreas', 'Obst, Mandy', 'Kranz, Andrea', 'Schrock, Evelin', 'Anastassiadis, Konstantinos', 'Stewart, A Francis']","['Baker O', 'Tsurkan S', 'Fu J', 'Klink B', 'Rump A', 'Obst M', 'Kranz A', 'Schrock E', 'Anastassiadis K', 'Stewart AF']",,"['Stem Cell Engineering, Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, BioInnovationsZentrum, Tatzberg 47, Dresden 01307, Germany.', 'Genomics, Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, BioInnovationsZentrum, Tatzberg 47, Dresden 01307, Germany.', 'Genomics, Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, BioInnovationsZentrum, Tatzberg 47, Dresden 01307, Germany.', 'Genomics, Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, BioInnovationsZentrum, Tatzberg 47, Dresden 01307, Germany.', ""Shandong University-Helmholtz Joint Institute of Biotechnology, State Key Laboratory of Microbial Technology, Shandong University, Shanda Nanlu 27, 250100 Jinan, People's Republic of China."", 'Institute for Clinical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Fetscherstrasse 74, Dresden 01307, Germany.', 'Institute for Clinical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Fetscherstrasse 74, Dresden 01307, Germany.', 'Stem Cell Engineering, Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, BioInnovationsZentrum, Tatzberg 47, Dresden 01307, Germany.', 'Genomics, Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, BioInnovationsZentrum, Tatzberg 47, Dresden 01307, Germany.', 'Genomics, Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, BioInnovationsZentrum, Tatzberg 47, Dresden 01307, Germany.', 'Institute for Clinical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Fetscherstrasse 74, Dresden 01307, Germany.', 'Stem Cell Engineering, Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, BioInnovationsZentrum, Tatzberg 47, Dresden 01307, Germany.', 'Genomics, Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, BioInnovationsZentrum, Tatzberg 47, Dresden 01307, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2D protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Endonucleases/metabolism', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Engineering/*methods', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Hybridization, Genetic', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics']",PMC5570031,2017/06/06 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2017/06/06 06:00'],"['2017/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['3861267 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkx497 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2017 Jul 27;45(13):8105-8115. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkx497.,,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2017.

Several methods have been proposed for such inference from high-dimensional single-cell data. They typically assign each cell to a branch in a differentiation trajectory. However, they commonly assume specific geometries such as tree-like developmental hierarchies and lack statistically sound methods to decide on the number of branching events. Results: We present K-Branches, a solution to the above problem by locally fitting half-lines to single-cell data, introducing a clustering algorithm similar to K-Means. These halflines are proxies for branches in the differentiation trajectory of cells. We propose a modified version of the GAP statistic for model selection, in order to decide on the number of lines that best describe the data locally. In this manner, we identify the location and number of subgroups of cells that are associated with branching events and full differentiation, respectively.

Here, we demonstrate that these INoBs also contain SUMO-1 and UBC9, the E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme. Furthermore, whereas wild type SUMO-1 localized in INoBs, a SUMO-1 mutant, which is unable to conjugate with proteins, does not, suggesting the presence of SUMOylated proteins at INoBs. Moreover, depletion of the SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9 or the sumo hydrolase SENP2 changed p21Cip1 intracellular distribution. In addition to SUMO-1 and p21Cip1, cell cycle regulators and DNA damage checkpoint proteins, including Cdk2, Cyclin E, PCNA, p53 and Mdm2, and PML were also detected in INoBs. Importantly, depletion of UBC9 or p21Cip1 impacted INoB biogenesis and the nucleolar accumulation of the cell cycle regulators and DNA damage checkpoint proteins following DNA damage. The impact of p21Cip1 and SUMO-1 on the accumulation of proteins in INoBs extends also to CRM1, a nuclear exportin that is also important for protein translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus. Thus, SUMO and p21Cip1 regulate the transit of proteins through the nucleolus, and that disruption of nucleolar export by DNA damage induces SUMO and p21Cip1 to act as hub proteins to form a multiprotein complex in the nucleolus.","['Brun, Sonia', 'Abella, Neus', 'Berciano, Maria T', 'Tapia, Olga', 'Jaumot, Montserrat', 'Freire, Raimundo', 'Lafarga, Miguel', 'Agell, Neus']","['Brun S', 'Abella N', 'Berciano MT', 'Tapia O', 'Jaumot M', 'Freire R', 'Lafarga M', 'Agell N']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1205-6074'],"['Departament Biomedicina, Universitat de Barcelona, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Departament Biomedicina, Universitat de Barcelona, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Departamento de Anatomia y Biologia Celular, Universidad de Cantabria-IDIVAL, Santander, Spain.', 'Departamento de Anatomia y Biologia Celular, Universidad de Cantabria-IDIVAL, Santander, Spain.', 'Departament Biomedicina, Universitat de Barcelona, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Unidad de Investigacion, Hospital Universitario de Canarias, Instituto de Tecnologias Biomedicas, Tenerife, Spain.', 'Departamento de Anatomia y Biologia Celular, Universidad de Cantabria-IDIVAL, Santander, Spain.', 'Departament Biomedicina, Universitat de Barcelona, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170605,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (SUMO1 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (SENP2 protein, human)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleolus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclin E/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/deficiency/*genetics', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Karyopherins/genetics/metabolism', 'Organelle Biogenesis', 'Organelles/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/genetics/metabolism', 'SUMO-1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/deficiency/genetics']",PMC5459497,2017/06/06 06:00,2017/09/20 06:00,['2017/06/06 06:00'],"['2017/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0178925 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-03200 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Jun 5;12(6):e0178925. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0178925. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mechanisms underlying ALL cell death and the contribution of the bone marrow microenvironment to drug response/resistance remain unclear. The role of the microenvironment and the identification of chemoresistance determinants were studied by transcriptomic analysis in ALL cells treated with Dexamethasone (Dex), and Etoposide (Etop) grown in the presence or absence of bone marrow conditioned media (CM). The necroptotic (RIPK1) and the apoptotic (caspase-8/3) markers were downregulated by CM, whereas the inhibitory effects of chemotherapy on the autophagy marker Beclin-1 (BECN1) were reduced suggesting CM exerts cytoprotective effects. GCs upregulated the RIPK1 ubiquitinating factor BIRC3 (cIAP2), in GC-sensitive (CEM-C7-14) but not in resistant (CEM-C1-15) cells. In addition, CM selectively affected GR phosphorylation in a site and cell-specific manner. GR is recruited to RIPK1, BECN1 and BIRC3 promoters in the sensitive but not in the resistant cells with phosphorylated GR forms being generally less recruited in the presence of hormone. FACS analysis and caspase-8 assays demonstrated that CM promoted a pro-survival trend. High molecular weight proteins reacting with the RIPK1 antibody were modified upon incubation with the BIRC3 inhibitor AT406 in CEM-C7-14 cells suggesting that they represent ubiquitinated forms of RIPK1. Our data suggest that there is a correlation between microenvironment-induced ALL proliferation and altered response to chemotherapy.","['Qattan, Malak Yahia', 'Bakker, Emyr Yosef', 'Rajendran, Ramkumar', 'Chen, Daphne Wei-Chen', 'Saha, Vaskar', 'Liu, Jizhong', 'Zeef, Leo', 'Schwartz, Jean-Marc', 'Mutti, Luciano', 'Demonacos, Constantinos', 'Krstic-Demonacos, Marija']","['Qattan MY', 'Bakker EY', 'Rajendran R', 'Chen DW', 'Saha V', 'Liu J', 'Zeef L', 'Schwartz JM', 'Mutti L', 'Demonacos C', 'Krstic-Demonacos M']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3914-4488'],"['College of Applied Medical Sciences and Community Services (CAMS&CS), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'School of Environment and Life Sciences, University of Salford, Salford, United Kingdom.', 'School of Pharmacy, International Medical University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Tata Translational Cancer Research Centre, Kolkata, India.', 'Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'School of Environment and Life Sciences, University of Salford, Salford, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'School of Environment and Life Sciences, University of Salford, Salford, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170605,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Azocines)', '0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Benzhydryl Compounds)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0', '(N-benzhydryl-5-(2-(methylamino)propanamido)-3-(3-methylbutanoyl)-6-oxodecahydrop', 'yrrolo(1,2-a)(1,5)diazocine-8-carboxamide)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (BIRC3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (RIPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Azocines/pharmacology', 'Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein', 'Beclin-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Benzhydryl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Necrosis/chemically induced/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*drug effects/genetics', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",PMC5459454,2017/06/06 06:00,2017/09/19 06:00,['2017/06/06 06:00'],"['2017/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0178606 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-09893 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Jun 5;12(6):e0178606. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0178606. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently found an intravascular lymphocytic accumulation of non-neoplastic nature in a uterine cervix. The aim of the study was to define the frequency and the nature of this observation in the uterine cervix. Thirty cervical excision specimens including 23 cone biopsies and 7 hysterectomies were examined for the presence of intravascular accumulation of lymphocytes. Intravascular accumulation of lymphocytes was observed in 9 of the 30 specimens (30%). These were small-sized or medium-sized lymphocytes accumulating in lymphatic channels. The lymphocytes showed no atypia or mitotic activity. Intravascular lymphocytic accumulation was more common in cases with severe cervicitis (P<0.0001). Immunohistochemically, there was a mixed population of lymphocytes that were CD20 and CD3 positive; they were negative for CD30. Similar but larger lymph-node-like structures were noted inside the paracervical tissue in cases of wide excision. Intralymphatic accumulation of small nonatypical lymphocytes sometimes forming small corpuscles is a frequent and benign finding of the uterine cervix.","['Karpathiou, Georgia', 'Dal, Pierre', 'Chauleur, Celine', ""Peoc'h, Michel""]","['Karpathiou G', 'Dal P', 'Chauleur C', ""Peoc'h M""]",,"['Departments of Pathology (G.K, P.D.C., M.P.)

We show here significantly higher in vitro relative responses (RR) to bi-directional mismatches compared with uni-directional HvG or GvH mismatches in a total of 420 one-way mixed lymphocyte reactions between 10/10 matched pairs (RR 27.5 vs 7.5 vs 15.5, respectively, P<0.001). However, in 3281 8/8 matched UD HCT for leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome, the hazards of transplant-related mortality (TRM) were similar for uni-directional HvG or GvH mismatches and bi-directional mismatches (hazard ratio (HR) 1.32, P=0.001 vs HR 1.28, P=0.005 and HR 1.34, P=0.046), compared with permissive mismatches. Similar results were observed for overall survival.

The outcomes of 110 high-risk acute leukemia patients undergoing haplo-HSCT were compared with 69 contemporaneous high-risk patients receiving HLA-matched sibling transplantation using uniform IDA-intensified regimens. The relapse incidence of haplo-HSCT was 23.4%, and 3-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) achieved 62.9%, 59.1%, respectively. The cumulative incidences of II-IV and III-IV aGvHD were 28.6 and 14.3%, while limited and extensive cGvHD were 19.4, 13.8%. All these results were equivalent to those of concurrent identical sibling transplantation. Three-year OS and DFS for patients in advance stage reached 48.5, 47.3%. Furthermore, the relapse, 3-year OS of positive minimal residual disease (MRD) patients did not differ from negative MRD patients (18.9% vs 11.5%, 63.6% vs 69.6%), indicating our intensified haplo-HSCT technique could circumvent the dismal prognosis of MRD. These data provide reinforcing evidence that our haplo-HSCT system could dramatically improve the survival of high-risk acute leukemia with low relapse and acceptable transplantation-related mortality, and might be a promising therapeutic option for high-risk patients.","['Zhang, R', 'Shi, W', 'Wang, H-F', 'You, Y', 'Zhong, Z-D', 'Li, W-M', 'Zhang, C', 'Lu, X', 'Wang, Y-D', 'Zheng, P', 'Fang, J', 'Hong, M', 'Wu, Q-L', 'Xia, L-H']","['Zhang R', 'Shi W', 'Wang HF', 'You Y', 'Zhong ZD', 'Li WM', 'Zhang C', 'Lu X', 'Wang YD', 'Zheng P', 'Fang J', 'Hong M', 'Wu QL', 'Xia LH']",,"['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170605,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9927MT646M (Basiliximab)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Basiliximab', 'Child', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology/*therapy', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Siblings', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Young Adult']",,2017/06/06 06:00,2018/06/13 06:00,['2017/06/06 06:00'],"['2017/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['bmt2017100 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2017.100 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2017 Sep;52(9):1253-1260. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2017.100.

The combination of TKI with chemotherapy has improved response rates and allowed more patients to proceed to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT). Older patients have excellent responses to TKI and corticosteroids or in combination with minimal chemotherapy. This raises the question as to whether patients require full-intensity chemotherapy with TKI to achieve molecular remissions. The pediatricians have proposed that cure is achievable without alloHCT in children. These results have suggested that many patients may not require traditional chemotherapy in addition to TKI to achieve remission, and that patients who achieve a negative minimal residual disease state may not require alloHCT. The data in support of these questions is presented here and a suggested future clinical trial design based on these data is proposed.","['Litzow, M R', 'Fielding, A K', 'Luger, S M', 'Paietta, E', 'Ofran, Y', 'Rowe, J M', 'Goldstone, A H', 'Tallman, M S', 'Lazarus, H M']","['Litzow MR', 'Fielding AK', 'Luger SM', 'Paietta E', 'Ofran Y', 'Rowe JM', 'Goldstone AH', 'Tallman MS', 'Lazarus HM']",,"['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'University College, London, UK.', 'University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Rambam Healthcare Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'University College, London, UK.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['13920/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', '9609/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170605,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",,2017/06/06 06:00,2018/08/07 06:00,['2017/06/06 06:00'],"['2016/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/29 00:00 [revised]', '2016/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['bmt2017110 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2017.110 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2017 Dec;52(12):1592-1598. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2017.110.

The modern therapeutic approach for yolk sac tumour (YST) is highly curative. Because YST takes on a large morphological spectrum, it can be confused for other GCT subtypes as well as somatic carcinomas, particularly when YST presents in an extragonadal or a metastatic setting. Currently available immunohistochemical markers are limited by suboptimal sensitivity and specificity. We reported recently that ZBTB16 is a sensitive and specific marker for testicular YST. ZBTB16 is absent in other GCTs and in most common somatic carcinomas, including those of gastrointestinal, pancreatobillary, respiratory, genitourinary and gynaecological tracts. The purpose of this study is to investigate the diagnostic utility of ZBTB16 in the settings of metastatic and extragonadal YST. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 32 archived metastatic and four extragonadal primary YSTs as well as 51 somatic malignancies for their immunohistochemical expression of ZBTB16. For comparison, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and glypican-3 were also studied in parallel. Our results demonstrated an overall sensitivity of 91.6% for ZBTB16 in detecting metastatic and extragonadal YSTs. The non-YST elements (teratoma and embryonal carcinoma) in 15 YST-containing metastatic mixed GCTs were non-reactive. With the exception of occasional myoepithelial cells of salivary gland carcinoma, all the 51 somatic malignancies were negative for ZBTB16. CONCLUSIONS: ZBTB16 is a sensitive and specific marker for YST and is diagnostically superior to AFP and glypican-3 in metastatic and extragonadal settings.","['Xiao, Guang-Qian', 'Priemer, David S', 'Wei, Christina', 'Aron, Manju', 'Yang, Qi', 'Idrees, Muhammad T']","['Xiao GQ', 'Priemer DS', 'Wei C', 'Aron M', 'Yang Q', 'Idrees MT']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2111-5897'],"['Department of Pathology, Keck Medical Center of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Keck Medical Center of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Keck Medical Center of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170719,England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,"['0 (AFP protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (TUBGCP3 protein, human)', '0 (alpha-Fetoproteins)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Endodermal Sinus Tumor/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/*metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'alpha-Fetoproteins/metabolism']",,2017/06/06 06:00,2018/06/12 06:00,['2017/06/06 06:00'],"['2017/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2017/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/his.13276 [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 2017 Oct;71(4):562-569. doi: 10.1111/his.13276.

A patient-centered approach is important for the appropriate management of chronic myeloid leukemia and optimization of long-term treatment outcomes. The pharmacist plays a key role in treatment selection, monitoring drug-drug interactions, identification and management of adverse events, and educating patients on adherence. The combination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with unique safety profiles and individual patients with unique medical histories can make managing treatment difficult. This review will provide up-to-date information regarding tyrosine kinase inhibitor-based treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. Management strategies for adverse events and considerations for drug-drug interactions will not only vary among patients but also across tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Drug-drug interactions can be mild to severe. In instances where co-administration of concomitant medications cannot be avoided, it is critical to understand how drug levels are impacted and how subsequent dose modifications ensure therapeutic drug levels are maintained. An important component of patient-centered management of chronic myeloid leukemia also includes educating patients on the significance of early and regular monitoring of therapeutic milestones, emphasizing the importance of adhering to treatment in achieving these targets, and appropriately modifying treatment if these clinical goals are not being met. Overall, staying apprised of current research, utilizing the close pharmacist-patient relationship, and having regular interactions with patients, will help achieve successful long-term treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in the age of BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Cuellar, Sandra', 'Vozniak, Michael', 'Rhodes, Jill', 'Forcello, Nicholas', 'Olszta, Daniel']","['Cuellar S', 'Vozniak M', 'Rhodes J', 'Forcello N', 'Olszta D']",,"['1 Department of Pharmacy Practice, University of Illinois at Chicago College of Pharmacy, USA.', '2 Pharmacy Department, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, USA.', '3 Department of Pharmacy, University of Louisville Hospital, USA.', '4 Department of Pharmacy Services, Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale New Haven, USA.', '5 Joliet Oncology & Hematology Associates Ltd, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170604,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use']",PMC6094551,2017/06/06 06:00,2018/10/03 06:00,['2017/06/06 06:00'],"['2017/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155217710553 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2018 Sep;24(6):433-452. doi: 10.1177/1078155217710553.

The frequency, sites and outcome of relapsed ALL in children of northeast Mexico over a decade was documented. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 246 children belonging to a low-income group <16 years with de novo ALL during 2004-2015 was performed. Five-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Data on time, site, response to therapy and final outcome of relapse were analyzed. Hazard ratios (HRs) of relapse and death were estimated by the Cox regression model. Very early relapse was defined as that occurring in <18 months, early relapse between 18 and 36 months, and late relapse >36 months from diagnosis, respectively. RESULTS: Eighty-seven (35.4%) children relapsed. Five-year OS was 82.6% in children without relapse vs. 42% for relapsed patients. Bone marrow (BM) was the most frequent site of relapse (51.72%). Isolated central nervous system (CNS) relapses occurred in 29.9%. Five-year OS was 11.2% for BM and 15.5% for early relapse. HR of relapse for organomegaly was 3.683, 2.247 for an initial white blood cell count >50 000 x 10(9)/l and 1.169 for positive minimal residual disease status. CONCLUSION: A high rate of very early, CNS, and BM relapse with a considerably low 5-year OS requiring reassessment of therapy was documented. Organomegaly at diagnosis was a highly significant clinical predictor for relapse.","['Jaime-Perez, Jose Carlos', 'Pinzon-Uresti, Monica Andrea', 'Jimenez-Castillo, Raul Alberto', 'Colunga-Pedraza, Julia Esther', 'Gonzalez-Llano, Oscar', 'Gomez-Almaguer, David']","['Jaime-Perez JC', 'Pinzon-Uresti MA', 'Jimenez-Castillo RA', 'Colunga-Pedraza JE', 'Gonzalez-Llano O', 'Gomez-Almaguer D']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6804-9095', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0460-6427']","['a Department of Hematology , Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez University Hospital of the School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon , Monterrey , Mexico.', 'a Department of Hematology , Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez University Hospital of the School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon , Monterrey , Mexico.', 'a Department of Hematology , Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez University Hospital of the School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon , Monterrey , Mexico.', 'a Department of Hematology , Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez University Hospital of the School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon , Monterrey , Mexico.', 'a Department of Hematology , Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez University Hospital of the School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon , Monterrey , Mexico.', 'a Department of Hematology , Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez University Hospital of the School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon , Monterrey , Mexico.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170603,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Latin America', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2017/06/06 06:00,2018/07/06 06:00,['2017/06/06 06:00'],"['2017/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2017.1333294 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2018 Jan;23(1):1-9. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2017.1333294.

We performed a meta-analysis of evidence from 13 clinical trials to assess effectiveness and safety of Ofatumumab-based therapy in patients with CLL. METHODS: Relevant publications from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched. The primary efficacy outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The second endpoint was the adverse events. RESULTS: The pooled efficacy analysis showed that there were no significant difference in PFS [hazard ratios (HR) = 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.47-1.63, p = 0.677, I(2) = 94.9%] and OS (HR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.70-1.36, p = 0.878, I(2) = 58.7%) between Ofatumumab-based therapy and non-Ofatumumab therapy. The pooled toxicity analysis showed that Ofatumumab-based therapy was associated with an increased risk of infusion-related reaction but decreased risk of thrombocytopenia and anemia compared with non-Ofatumumab-based therapy. Moreover, infections, and infusion-related reaction occurred more frequently in participants with single Ofatumumab studies. DISCUSSION: Our analysis showed PFS was statistically significantly improved with Ofatumumab-based treatments (including Ofatumumab alone, Ofatumumab plus chemotherapy) for CLL compared with observation or chemotherapy-based regimen groups. Ofatumumab had no statistically significant improvement on the OS of patients with CLL. The Ofatumumab-based therapy could generally decrease the risk of adverse effects except infusion-related reaction and infections.","['Wu, Yougen', 'Wang, Yang', 'Gu, Yuting', 'Xia, Ju', 'Kong, Xiaoyang', 'Qian, Qingqing', 'Hong, Yang']","['Wu Y', 'Wang Y', 'Gu Y', 'Xia J', 'Kong X', 'Qian Q', 'Hong Y']",,"[""a Medical Institution Conducting Clinical Trials for Human Used Drug, The Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai , Fudan University , Shanghai , China."", 'b Department of General Psychiatry, Shanghai Mental Health Center , Shanghai Jiaotong University , Shanghai , China.', ""a Medical Institution Conducting Clinical Trials for Human Used Drug, The Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai , Fudan University , Shanghai , China."", ""a Medical Institution Conducting Clinical Trials for Human Used Drug, The Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai , Fudan University , Shanghai , China."", ""c Department of Hematology, The Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai , Fudan University , Shanghai , China."", ""a Medical Institution Conducting Clinical Trials for Human Used Drug, The Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai , Fudan University , Shanghai , China."", ""a Medical Institution Conducting Clinical Trials for Human Used Drug, The Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai , Fudan University , Shanghai , China."", ""d Department of Osteology, The Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai , Fudan University , Shanghai , China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20170603,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Survival Analysis']",,2017/06/06 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/06/06 06:00'],"['2017/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2017.1333974 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2017 Dec;22(10):578-584. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2017.1333974.

We conducted a prospective cohort study that systematically followed 1143 patients diagnosed with CLL between June 2002 and November 2014. Comorbid health conditions at the time of CLL diagnosis and their relationship to survival and cause of death were evaluated. Collectively, 1061 (93%) patients had at least one co-morbid health condition at the time of CLL diagnosis (median number 3). Despite this, 89% of patients had a low-intermediate Charlson Comorbidity Index score (CCI) at diagnosis. After a median follow-up of 6 years, 225 patients have died. Death was due to CLL progression in 85 (46%) patients, infection in 14 (8%) patients, other cancer in 35 (19%) patients and comorbid health conditions in 50 (27%) patients. Higher CCI score and a greater number of major comorbid health conditions at the time of CLL diagnosis was associated with shorter non-CLL specific survival, but not with shorter CLL-specific survival on multivariate analysis. In conclusion, CLL and CLL-related complications (infections and second cancers) are the overwhelming cause of death in patients with CLL, regardless of CCI score and number of comorbid health conditions at diagnosis.","['Strati, Paolo', 'Parikh, Sameer A', 'Chaffee, Kari G', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Achenbach, Sara J', 'Cerhan, James R', 'Slager, Susan L', 'Shanafelt, Tait D']","['Strati P', 'Parikh SA', 'Chaffee KG', 'Kay NE', 'Call TG', 'Achenbach SJ', 'Cerhan JR', 'Slager SL', 'Shanafelt TD']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7445-1459'],"['Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA015083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20170604,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Aged', 'Cause of Death', 'Comorbidity', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minnesota/epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies']",PMC6377071,2017/06/06 06:00,2017/09/20 06:00,['2017/06/06 06:00'],"['2017/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14785 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2017 Aug;178(3):394-402. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14785.

There are germline genetic alterations that significantly increase the risk of developing hematopoietic malignancies in childhood. In this review, we describe a number of these hereditary disorders and their clinical features. These predispositions to cancer syndromes can be attributed to DNA repair/genetic instability, RAS pathway dysfunction, bone marrow failure, telomeropathies, immunodeficiencies, transcription factor abnormalities, pure familial leukemia, and aneuploidy. We focus especially on acute myeloid leukemia associated with Down syndrome, but also include other hereditary syndromes in this review. Recent advances in high-throughput genotyping technology have identified new genetic variations prone to human leukemia. Understanding of the mechanism of leukemia development in these hereditary syndromes allows us to gain insight into leukemogenesis in general and suggests therapeutic strategies based on these findings.","['Saida, Satoshi']",['Saida S'],,"['Oncogenesis and Development Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bldg 49, RM 4A25 49 Convent DR, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA. satoshi.saida@nih.gov.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan. satoshi.saida@nih.gov.', 'Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Tokyo, Japan. satoshi.saida@nih.gov.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,['EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)'],IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/genetics/metabolism', 'Genetic Diseases, Inborn/*complications/genetics/metabolism', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary/complications/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'ras Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",,2017/06/06 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2017/06/06 06:00'],"['2017/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11864-017-0485-x [doi]', '10.1007/s11864-017-0485-x [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2017 Jul;18(7):41. doi: 10.1007/s11864-017-0485-x.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Down syndrome', '*Leukemia', '*Predisposition', '*TAM', '*Transient leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this review was to introduce various inactivated genes and evaluate their possible role in leukemia pathogenesis and prognosis. By searching the mesh words ""Gene, Silencing AND Leukemia"" in PubMed website, relevant English articles dealt with human subjects as of 2000 were included in this study. Gene inactivation in leukemia is largely mediated by promoter's hypermethylation of gene involving in cellular functions such as cell cycle, apoptosis, and gene transcription. Inactivated genes, such as ASPP1, TP53, IKZF1 and P15, may correlate with poor prognosis in acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), respectively. Gene inactivation may play a considerable role in leukemia pathogenesis and prognosis, which can be considered as complementary diagnostic tests to differentiate different leukemia types, determine leukemia prognosis, and also detect response to therapy. In general, this review showed some genes inactivated only in leukemia (with differences between B-ALL, T-ALL, CLL, AML and CML). These differences could be of interest as an additional tool to better categorize leukemia types. Furthermore; based on inactivated genes, a diverse classification of Leukemias could represent a powerful method to address a targeted therapy of the patients, in order to minimize side effects of conventional therapies and to enhance new drug strategies.","['Heidari, Nazanin', 'Abroun, Saeid', 'Bertacchini, Jessika', 'Vosoughi, Tina', 'Rahim, Fakher', 'Saki, Najmaldin']","['Heidari N', 'Abroun S', 'Bertacchini J', 'Vosoughi T', 'Rahim F', 'Saki N']",,"['Health Research Institute, Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Signal Transduction Unit, Department of Surgery, Medicine, Dentistry and Morphology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Health Research Institute, Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Health Research Institute, Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Health Research Institute, Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170517,Iran,Cell J,Cell journal,101566618,,,,PMC5448318,2017/06/06 06:00,2017/06/06 06:01,['2017/06/06 06:00'],"['2016/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.22074/cellj.2017.4908 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell J. 2017 Spring;19(Suppl 1):9-26. doi: 10.22074/cellj.2017.4908.

To clarify the reason, we examined the biologically active compounds in the rhizome collected at Iwate and compared them from the other area in literature. METHODS: The acetonitrile extract from northern part of Japan was purified by bioassay-guided separation using antiproliferative activity to human leukemia HL-60 cell, and protodioscin (PD) was isolated and identified by instrumental analyses as the major active compound. RESULTS: PD known as a saponin with four sugar moieties, an inhibitor for platelet aggregation, and a low density lipoprotein (LPL) lowering agent, displayed strong growth inhibitory effect to HL-60. The literature search suggested that the rhizome from other area contained dioscin and other saponins with three sugar moieties as their major component. We assume that the edible and health promoting effect of the rhizome in the particular area is partially derived from these different components. CONCLUSION: We were interested in the differences of utilization in the rhizome of wild yam Dioscorea tokoro, and examined the chemical composition in the rhizome to find protodioscin as antiproliferative compound to HL-60. In the report from other area, the rhizome exhibited dioscin as the major compound. Our study indicated that the protodioscin/dioscin composition varied regionally, although the reason is still needs to be investigated.","['Oyama, Manami', 'Tokiwano, Tetsuo', 'Kawaii, Satoru', 'Yoshida, Yasunori', 'Mizuno, Kouichi', 'Oh, Keimei', 'Yoshizawa, Yuko']","['Oyama M', 'Tokiwano T', 'Kawaii S', 'Yoshida Y', 'Mizuno K', 'Oh K', 'Yoshizawa Y']",,"['Laboratory of Bio-organic Chemistry, Akita Prefectural University, Akita, 010-0195, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Bio-organic Chemistry, Akita Prefectural University, Akita, 010-0195, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Bio-organic Chemistry, Tokyo Denki University, Hatoyama, Saitama, 350-0394, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Horticultural Crop Production Management, Akita Prefectural University, Ogata, 010-0444, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Bio-organic Chemistry, Akita Prefectural University, Akita, 010-0195, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Bio-organic Chemistry, Akita Prefectural University, Akita, 010-0195, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Bio-organic Chemistry, Akita Prefectural University, Akita, 010-0195, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United Arab Emirates,Curr Bioact Compd,Current bioactive compounds,101240239,,,,PMC5396219,2017/06/06 06:00,2017/06/06 06:01,['2017/06/06 06:00'],"['2016/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/27 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2174/1573407213666170113123428 [doi]', 'CBC-13-170 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Bioact Compd. 2017 Jun;13(2):170-174. doi: 10.2174/1573407213666170113123428.,['NOTNLM'],"['Dioscorea tokoro', 'HL-60', 'Protodioscin', 'antiproliferation', 'dioscin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FLV was passaged twice in BALB/c mice. The infected mice were divided into six groups of ten mice based on their weights. The groups included the normal control group; virus control group; AZT group; high- (2.8 g/kg), medium- (1.4 g/kg), and low-dose (0.7 g/kg) Fuzheng Paidu tablet groups; and Fuzheng Paidu decoction (10 g/kg) group. The mice were administered Fuzheng Paidu tablets via gavage for 21 days. The body weight and changes in the thymus, spleen, and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes of each mouse were measured. RESULTS: The splenic weight of the virus control group is significantly higher than that of the normal control group, with significant splenomegaly. In addition, the splenic inhibition indices of the AZT group and the high- and medium-dose Fuzheng Paidu tablet groups were approximately 93.80%, 37.80%, and 28.07%, respectively. Furthermore, the high and medium dose Fuzheng Paidu tablets could increase the thymus weights of the infected mice. CONCLUSION: Fuzheng Paidu tablets could inhibit splenomegaly, lower the splenic indices, and increase the thymic weights and thymic indices of FLV-induced immunodeficient mice.","['Miao, Mingsan', 'Wang, Ting', 'Lou, Xin', 'Bai, Ming', 'Xi, Peng', 'Liu, Baosong', 'Chang, Bingjie']","['Miao M', 'Wang T', 'Lou X', 'Bai M', 'Xi P', 'Liu B', 'Chang B']",,"['Departments of Science and Technology, Henan University of Chinese Medicine, Zhengzhou 450000, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Henan University of Chinese Medicine, Zhengzhou 450000, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Henan University of Chinese Medicine, Zhengzhou 450000, China.', 'Departments of Science and Technology, Henan University of Chinese Medicine, Zhengzhou 450000, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Henan University of Chinese Medicine, Zhengzhou 450000, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Henan University of Chinese Medicine, Zhengzhou 450000, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Henan University of Chinese Medicine, Zhengzhou 450000, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170509,Saudi Arabia,Saudi Pharm J,Saudi pharmaceutical journal : SPJ : the official publication of the Saudi Pharmaceutical Society,9705695,,,,PMC5447433,2017/06/06 06:00,2017/06/06 06:01,['2017/06/06 06:00'],"['2017/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.jsps.2017.04.038 [doi]', 'S1319-0164(17)30099-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Saudi Pharm J. 2017 May;25(4):644-648. doi: 10.1016/j.jsps.2017.04.038.

In up to 40% of systemic mastocytosis cases, an associated clonal hematological disease of non-mast cell lineage, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), is diagnosed before, simultaneously with, or after the diagnosis of SM. Herein, we report a case of a 30-year-old man diagnosed with AML with inv(16) (p13;q22) CBFB:MYH11. Associated mastocytosis was not noted at diagnosis and was only detected in the bone marrow at time of remission after successful chemotherapy. The diagnosis of mastocytosis was based on the demonstration of a multifocal dense mast cell infiltrate in the marrow biopsy with aberrant immunophenotype, with coexpression of tryptase, CD117, and CD25. The mast cells showed atypical morphology mostly with irregular nuclear contour, bilobed or multilobed nuclei with cytoplasmic hypogranulation or irregular metachromatic granule distribution, and some cells with eccentric nucleus or spindle shape. Reexamination of the pretherapeutic bone marrow with immunostain for tryptase and CD25 revealed that mastocytosis was present from the start but masked by extensive blast proliferation. This case indicates that mast cell infiltrates are sometimes underappreciated at the original diagnosis of AML with inv(16) and that the concurrent diagnosis of SM with AML requires a high index of suspicion supported with comprehensive morphologic and immunohistochemical evaluation for a neoplastic mast cell proliferation.","['Hilmi, Feryal Abbas Ibrahim', 'Al-Sabbagh, Ahmad', 'Soliman, Dina Sameh', 'Sabah, Hesham Al', 'Ismail, Omar Mohammad', 'Yassin, Mohamed', 'El-Omri, Halima']","['Hilmi FAI', 'Al-Sabbagh A', 'Soliman DS', 'Sabah HA', 'Ismail OM', 'Yassin M', 'El-Omri H']",,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20170330,United States,Clin Med Insights Blood Disord,Clinical medicine insights.

Less frequently, HT may result in a high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) with MYC and B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (BCL2) and/or BCL6 gene rearrangements, also known as ""double-hit"" or ""triple-hit"" lymphomas. In the 2016 revision of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of lymphoid neoplasms, the category B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable was eliminated due to its vague criteria and limiting diagnostic benefit. Instead, the WHO introduced the HGBL category, characterized by MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements. Cases that present as an intermediate phenotype of DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma (BL) will fall within this HGBL category. Very rarely, HT results in both the intermediate DLBCL and BL phenotypes and exhibits lymphoblastic features, in which case the WHO recommends that this morphologic appearance should be noted. In comparison with de novo patients with DLBCL, NOS, those with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 gene rearrangements have a worse prognosis. A 63-year-old woman presented with left neck adenopathy. Laboratory assessments, including complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, serum lactate dehydrogenase, and beta2-microglobulin, were all normal. A whole-body computerized tomographic (CT) scan revealed diffuse adenopathy above and below the diaphragm. An excisional node biopsy showed grade 3A nodular FL. The Ki67 labeling index was 40% to 50%. A bone marrow biopsy showed a small focus of paratrabecular CD20+ lymphoid aggregates. She received 6 cycles of bendamustine (90 mg/m2 on days +1 and +2) and rituximab (375 mg/m2 on day +2), with each cycle delivered every 4 weeks. A follow-up CT scan at completion of therapy showed a partial response with resolution of axillary adenopathy and a dramatic shrinkage of the large retroperitoneal nodes. After 18 months, she had crampy abdominal pain in the absence of B symptoms. Positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-d-glucose integrated with CT (18F-FDG PET/CT) scan showed widespread adenopathy, diffuse splenic involvement, and substantial marrow involvement. Biopsy of a 2.4-cm right axillary node (SUVmax of 16.1) showed involvement by grade 3A FL with a predominant nodular pattern of growth. A bone marrow biopsy once again showed only a small focus of FL. She received idelalisib (150 mg twice daily) and rituximab (375 mg/m2, monthly) beginning May 2015. After 4 cycles, a repeat CT scan showed a complete radiographic response. Idelalisib was subsequently held while she received corticosteroids for immune-mediated colitis. A month later, she restarted idelalisib with a 50% dose reduction. After 2 weeks, she returned to clinic complaining of bilateral hip and low lumbar discomfort but no B symptoms. A restaging 18F-FDG PET/CT in January 2016 showed dramatic marrow uptake. A bone marrow aspirate showed sheets of tumor cells representing a spectrum from intermediate-sized cells with lymphoblastic features to very large atypical cells with multiple nucleoli. Two distinct histologies were present; one remained consistent with the patient's known FL with a predominant nodular pattern and the other consistent with HT (the large atypical cells expressed PAX5, CD10, BCL2, and c-MYC and were negative for CD20, MPO, CD34, CD30, and BCL6). Focal areas showed faint, heterogeneous expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase best seen on the clot section. Ki67 proliferation index was high (4+/4). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed 2 populations with MYC amplification and/or rearrangement and no evidence of BCL6 rearrangement; a karyotype analysis showed a complex abnormal female karyotype with t(14;18) and multiple structural and numerical abnormalities. She started dose-adjusted rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin with concomitant prophylactic intrathecal methotrexate and cytarabine. She had but a short-lived response before dying in hospice from progressive lymphoma. Whether idelalisib could provide a microenvironment for selection of more aggressive clones needs to be addressed. Our patient's clinical course is confounded by the incorporation of idelalisib while being further complicated by the complexity of HT and the mechanisms in which first-line chemotherapy regimens affect double-hit lymphoma.","['Bischin, Alina M', 'Dorer, Russell', 'Aboulafia, David M']","['Bischin AM', 'Dorer R', 'Aboulafia DM']",,"['School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Virginia Mason Medical Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Virginia Mason Medical Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20170228,United States,Clin Med Insights Blood Disord,Clinical medicine insights.

BCR-ABL1-expressing leukemic cells are highly dependent on double-strand break (DSB) repair signals for their survival. Here we report that a first-in-class HDAC1,2 selective inhibitor and doxorubicin (a hyper-CVAD chemotherapy regimen component) impair DSB repair networks in Ph+ B-cell precursor ALL cells using common as well as distinct mechanisms. The HDAC1,2 inhibitor but not doxorubicin alters nucleosomal occupancy to impact chromatin structure, as revealed by MNase-Seq. Quantitative mass spectrometry of the chromatin proteome along with functional assays showed that the HDAC1,2 inhibitor and doxorubicin either alone or in combination impair the central hub of DNA repair, the Mre11-Rad51-DNA ligase 1 axis, involved in BCR-ABL1-specific DSB repair signaling in Ph+ B-cell precursor ALL cells. HDAC1,2 inhibitor and doxorubicin interfere with DISC (DNA damage-induced transcriptional silencing in cis)) or transcriptional silencing program in cis around DSB sites via chromatin remodeler-dependent and -independent mechanisms, respectively, to further impair DSB repair. HDAC1,2 inhibitor either alone or when combined with doxorubicin decreases leukemia burden in vivo in refractory Ph+ B-cell precursor ALL patient-derived xenograft mouse models. Overall, our novel mechanistic and preclinical studies together demonstrate that HDAC1,2 selective inhibition can overcome DSB repair 'addiction' and provide an effective therapeutic option for Ph+ B-cell precursor ALL.","['Tharkar-Promod, S', 'Johnson, D P', 'Bennett, S E', 'Dennis, E M', 'Banowsky, B G', 'Jones, S S', 'Shearstone, J R', 'Quayle, S N', 'Min, C', 'Jarpe, M', 'Mosbruger, T',

Therefore, the molecular mechanism underlying AML needs to be further investigated. Here in this study, we identify the interferon-regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) as a novel regulator in human AML. We show that IRF2 knockdown inhibits growth, colony formation of OCI/AML-2, OCI/AML-3, and THP-1 cells. In addition, IRF2 knockdown induces apoptosis of AML cells by regulating the apoptotic effectors Bcl-2, Bax and Caspase 3. Further mechanism analysis shows that inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphatase, type-II (INPP4B) contributes to the effects of IRF2 on apoptosis and growth of AML cells. IRF2 binds INPP4B promoter and promotes INPP4B expression in AML cells. Restoration of the expression of INPP4B blocks the effects of IRF2 knockdown on apoptosis and colony formation in OCI/AML-2 and OCI/AML-3 cells. In conclusion, IRF2 serves as an important regulator in AML by targeting INPP4B. Therefore, IRF2 may be a potential target for AML treatment.","['Zhang, Feng', 'Zhu, Junfeng', 'Li, Jiajia', 'Zhu, Fangbing', 'Zhang, Pingping']","['Zhang F', 'Zhu J', 'Li J', 'Zhu F', 'Zhang P']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu 233004, Anhui, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu 233004, Anhui, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu 233004, Anhui, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu 233004, Anhui, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu 233004, Anhui, PR China.

It is also being evaluated in numerous clinical trials for treating patients with various hematologic malignancies. As with any targeted cancer therapy, it is critically important to identify potential mechanisms of resistance, both for patient stratification and developing strategies to overcome resistance, either before it develops or as it emerges. METHODS: In order to gain a more comprehensive insight into the nature of venetoclax resistance mechanisms, we evaluated the changes in the BCL-2 family members at the genetic and expression levels in seven different venetoclax-resistant derived leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. RESULTS: Gene and protein expression analyses identified a number of different alterations in the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members. In the resistant derived cells, an increase in either or both the anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-XL or MCL-1, which are not targeted by venetoclax was observed, and either concomitant or exclusive with a decrease in one or more pro-apoptotic proteins. In addition, mutational analysis also revealed a mutation in the BH3 binding groove (F104L) that could potentially interfere with venetoclax-binding. Not all changes may be causally related to venetoclax resistance and may only be an epiphenomenon. For resistant cell lines showing elevations in BCL-XL or MCL-1, strong synergistic cell killing was observed when venetoclax was combined with either BCL-XL- or MCL-1-selective inhibitors, respectively. This highlights the importance of BCL-XL- and MCL-1 as causally contributing to venetoclax resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Overall our study identified numerous changes in multiple resistant lines; the changes were neither mutually exclusive nor universal across the cell lines tested, thus exemplifying the complexity and heterogeneity of potential resistance mechanisms. Identifying and evaluating their contribution has important implications for both patient selection and the rational development of strategies to overcome resistance.","['Tahir, Stephen K', 'Smith, Morey L', 'Hessler, Paul', 'Rapp, Lisa Roberts', 'Idler, Kenneth B', 'Park, Chang H', 'Leverson, Joel D', 'Lam, Lloyd T']","['Tahir SK', 'Smith ML', 'Hessler P', 'Rapp LR', 'Idler KB', 'Park CH', 'Leverson JD', 'Lam LT']",,"['AbbVie Oncology, North Waukegan Road North, Chicago, IL, 60064-6098, USA.', 'AbbVie Oncology, North Waukegan Road North, Chicago, IL, 60064-6098, USA.', 'AbbVie Oncology, North Waukegan Road North, Chicago, IL, 60064-6098, USA.', 'AbbVie Oncology, North Waukegan Road North, Chicago, IL, 60064-6098, USA.', 'AbbVie Oncology, North Waukegan Road North, Chicago, IL, 60064-6098, USA.', 'AbbVie Oncology, North Waukegan Road North, Chicago, IL, 60064-6098, USA.', 'AbbVie Oncology, North Waukegan Road North, Chicago, IL, 60064-6098, USA.', 'AbbVie Oncology, North Waukegan Road North, Chicago, IL, 60064-6098, USA.

We hereby present this review to better characterize the coexistence of these entities as well as the salient features, the treatment options, and the overall prognosis. A search of PUBMED, Medline, and EMBASE databases via OVID engine for primary articles and case reports under keywords ""germ cell tumors"" and ""acute myeloid leukemia"" revealed a total of 26 cases in English that reported MGCT and M7 leukemia. The median age at diagnosis of MGCT was 24 (13-36) years. All cases were stage III. All cases of MGCT were of non-seminomatous origin and one case was unclassified. MGCT occurred prior to the diagnosis of leukemia in 46% of cases and concomitantly in 31% of cases. M7 leukemia was never reported prior to the appearance of MGCT. Complex cytogenetics and hyperdiploidy were the most commonly reported cytogenetic abnormalities. In the 23 cases where the treatment regimen was available, platinum-based chemotherapy directed towards management of the germ cell tumors was used initially in 21 cases and leukemia-directed treatment was used initially in 2 cases only. The median time from diagnosis of MGCT to development of M7 leukemia was 5 (2.25-39) months. Median time to death from the initial diagnosis of MGCT was 6 (0.5-60) months. Patients with a history of MGCT are at higher risk of developing M7 leukemia. They need long-term follow-up with a particular attention to the development of hematological malignancies. The overall prognosis remains poor.","['Mukherjee, Sarbajit', 'Ibrahimi, Sami', 'John, Sonia', 'Adnan, Mohammed Muqeet', 'Scordino, Teresa', 'Khalil, Mohammad O', 'Cherry, Mohamad']","['Mukherjee S', 'Ibrahimi S', 'John S', 'Adnan MM', 'Scordino T', 'Khalil MO', 'Cherry M']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology Section, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, 800 N.E.10th Street, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.

Interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) has been used in combination with the anti-retroviral drug zidovudine to treat patients with ATL. However, the efficacy of long-term therapy is significantly limited due to the systemic toxicity of IFNalpha. METHODS: We utilized phage display library screening to identify short peptides that specifically bind to Jurkat T lymphocyte leukemia cells. By fusing the Jurkat-binding peptide to the C-terminus of IFNalpha, we constructed an engineered chimeric IFNalpha molecule (IFNP) for the treatment of ATL. RESULTS: We found that IFNP exhibited significantly higher activity than wild type IFNalpha in inhibiting the growth of leukemia cells and inducing cell blockage at the G0/G1 phase. The synthetic IFNP molecule exerted its antitumor activity by upregulating the downstream genes involved in the STAT1 pathway and in apoptosis. Using a cell receptor binding assay, we showed that this Jurkat-binding peptide facilitated the binding affinity of IFNalpha to the cell surface type I IFN receptor. CONCLUSION: The isolated Jurkat-binding peptide significantly potentiates the therapeutic activity of IFNalpha in T lymphocyte leukemia cells. The engineered IFNP molecule may prove to a novel antitumor approach in the treatment of patients with ATL.","['Yu, Dehai', 'Du, Zhonghua', 'Li, Wei', 'Chen, Huaqiu', 'Ye, Songgen', 'Hoffman, Andrew R', 'Cui, Jiuwei', 'Hu, Ji-Fan']","['Yu D', 'Du Z', 'Li W', 'Chen H', 'Ye S', 'Hoffman AR', 'Cui J', 'Hu JF']",,"['Stem Cell and Cancer Center, First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Center, First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Center, First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Center, First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Center, First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Stanford University Medical School, Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research, Palo Alto, California, USA.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Center, First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Center, First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Stanford University Medical School, Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research, Palo Alto, California, USA.']",['eng'],['I01 BX002905/BX/BLRD VA/United States'],['Journal Article'],20170605,Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Genes, Synthetic/genetics', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*genetics', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptides/administration & dosage/*genetics', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Zidovudine/administration & dosage']",,2017/06/05 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2017/06/05 06:00'],"['2016/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['000477601 [pii]', '10.1159/000477601 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2017;42(2):519-529. doi: 10.1159/000477601.

CDC was analyzed in normal human serum (NHS) and serum from an individual genetically deficient for C9. Hx-7D8 was able to kill up to 80% of CLL cells in complete absence of C9. We conclude that the narrow C5b-8 pores formed without C9 are sufficient for CDC due to efficient antibody-mediated hexamer formation. In the absence of C9, we observed transient intracellular increases of Ca(2+) during CDC (as assessed with FLUO-4) that were extended in time. This suggests that small C5b-8 pores allow Ca(2+) to enter the cell, while dissipation of the fluorescent signal accompanying cell disintegration is delayed. The Ca(2+) signal is retained concomitantly with TOPRO-3 (viability dye) staining, thereby confirming that Ca(2+) influx represents the most proximate mediator of cell death by CDC.","['Taylor, Ronald P', 'Lindorfer, Margaret A', 'Cook, Erika M', 'Beurskens, Frank J', 'Schuurman, Janine', 'Parren, Paul W H I', 'Zent, Clive S', 'VanDerMeid, Karl R', 'Burack, Richard', 'Mizuno, Masashi', 'Morgan, B Paul']","['Taylor RP', 'Lindorfer MA', 'Cook EM', 'Beurskens FJ', 'Schuurman J', 'Parren PWHI', 'Zent CS', 'VanDerMeid KR', 'Burack R', 'Mizuno M', 'Morgan BP']",,"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, USA.

Increasing evidence has demonstrated that busulfan may induce testicular dysfunction by targeting genes that are expressed in the testis. Here, we showed that spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 2 (Sat2) was present in testicular Sertoli cells, and its expression was significantly increased by busulfan treatment. To investigate the implications of Sat2 upregulation for cell growth and function, a Sat2-overexpressing TM4 Sertoli cell model was established. Increased Sat2 expression led to inhibited cell proliferation and arrested cell cycle. Based on iTRAQ proteomics analysis, we revealed that Sat2 overexpression is detrimental to cell cycle progression and cell communication, and notably, Sat2 may disturb protein metabolic processes by altering translation regulation and protein complex subunit organization. In summary, the present study provides evidence that Sat2 upregulation induces alterations in the growth and function of Sertoli cells. In testis tissue subjected to busulfan, increased expression of Sat2 can cause cellular injury and subsequent organ damage, which could lead to male infertility. Therefore, Sat2 may be a novel molecular target for treating busulfan-induced testicular toxicity.","['Xian, Yi', 'Wu, Mingjun', 'Liu, Yaping', 'Hao, Jie', 'Wu, Yu', 'Liao, Xiaogang', 'Li, Gang']","['Xian Y', 'Wu M', 'Liu Y', 'Hao J', 'Wu Y', 'Liao X', 'Li G']",,"['Institute of Life Sciences, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Institute of Life Sciences, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Institute of Life Sciences, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Institute of Life Sciences, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Institute of Life Sciences, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Institute of Life Sciences, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.

Though great progress has been made for improvement in clinical treatment during the past decades, some children with ALL still relapsed. Glucocorticoid (GC) resistance is an important clinical problem for ALL treatment failure. Therefore, further understanding of the mechanism of GC resistance and exploring novel therapeutic strategies are crucial for improving treatment outcome. The reported involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in drug resistance implied that deregulated miRNA expression might contribute to GC treatment response of ALL. However, individual miRNAs and their functional mechanisms potentially involved in the GC response are still largely unknown. In the present study, we found that miR-124 was up-regulated in prednisone insensitive human ALL cell line and prednisone-poor response ALL patients. Furthermore, it was found that miR-124 might contribute to GC resistance by promoting proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis of ALL cells. Importantly, we validated that miR-124, targeted and decreased the expression of glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), prevented the inhibitory effect of GC in ALL. These findings strongly suggest that miR-124 is critical in poor GC response and may serve as a potential therapeutic target in ALL with poor GC resistance.","['Liang, Yan-Ni', 'Tang, Yan-Lai', 'Ke, Zhi-Yong', 'Chen, Yue-Qin', 'Luo, Xue-Qun', 'Zhang, Hua', 'Huang, Li-Bin']","['Liang YN', 'Tang YL', 'Ke ZY', 'Chen YQ', 'Luo XQ', 'Zhang H', 'Huang LB']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, 58 Zhong shan Er Lu, Guangzhou 510080, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, 58 Zhong shan Er Lu, Guangzhou 510080, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, 58 Zhong shan Er Lu, Guangzhou 510080, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, 58 Zhong shan Er Lu, Guangzhou 510080, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Diagnostics, Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Guangdong Medical University, No. 1 Xincheng Road, Dongguan 523808, China.

Here we aimed to reveal the expression and role of CR3 and CR4 in human B cells. In B cells of healthy donors CR3 and CR4 are scarcely expressed. However, two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) characterized by a peculiar immune-phenotype containing both CD5-positive and CD5-negative B cell populations made possible to study these molecules in distinct B cell subsets. We found that CD11b and CD11c were expressed on both CD5-positive and CD5-negative B cells, albeit to different extents. Our data suggest that these receptors are involved in spreading, since this activity of CpG-activated B cells on fibrinogen could be partially blocked by monoclonal antibodies specific for CD11b or CD11c. CpG-stimulation lead to proliferation of both CD5-positive and CD5-negative B cells of the patients with a less pronounced effect on the CD5-positive cells. In contrast to normal B cells, CLL B cells of both patients reacted to CpG-stimulation with robust IL-10 production. The concomitant, suboptimal stimulus via the BCR and TLR9 exerted either a synergistic enhancing effect or resulted in inhibition of proliferation and IL-10 production of patients' B cells. Our data obtained studying B cells of leukemic patients point to the role of CR3 and probably CR4 in the interaction of tumor cells with the microenvironment and suggest the involvement of IL-10 producing B cells in the pathologic process.","['Uzonyi, Barbara', 'Macsik-Valent, Bernadett', 'Lukacsi, Szilvia', 'Kiss, Richard', 'Torok, Katalin', 'Kremlitzka, Mariann', 'Bajtay, Zsuzsa', 'Demeter, Judit', 'Bodor, Csaba', 'Erdei, Anna']","['Uzonyi B', 'Macsik-Valent B', 'Lukacsi S', 'Kiss R', 'Torok K', 'Kremlitzka M', 'Bajtay Z', 'Demeter J', 'Bodor C', 'Erdei A']",,"['MTA-ELTE Immunology Research Group, Department of Immunology, Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Immunology, Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Immunology, Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-SE ""Lendulet"" Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, 1st Department of Pathology, and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Immunology, Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-ELTE Immunology Research Group, Department of Immunology, Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Immunology, Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.', '1st Department of Internal Medicine, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-SE ""Lendulet"" Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, 1st Department of Pathology, and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-ELTE Immunology Research Group, Department of Immunology, Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary; Department of Immunology, Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.

However, the specific molecular regulatory mechanisms of the endometrial capacity remain poorly understood. Here, we examined activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) expression in human endometria and the functional effect of ATF3 on embryo attachment in vitro. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to assess the ATF3 expression patterns in human endometria. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), western blotting and immunofluorescence (IF) studies were applied to explore ATF3 expression in Ishikawa cells upon estrogen (E2) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) treatment. qRT-PCR and western blotting were performed to inspect LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor) expression after enhancement or inhibition of ATF3, and a luciferase reporter assay and ChIP-PCR were used to confirm the regulatory mechanism of ATF3 to LIF. Endometrial epithelial capacity was assessed by an in vitro model of attachment of BeWo spheroids to Ishikawa cells. Western blotting was performed to compare the expression of ATF3 in endometrial samples of recurrent implantation failure (RIF) patients with that in samples from fertile women (FER) who had undergone no less than one successful embryo transplantation. RESULTS: ATF3 was located in human endometrial epithelial cells and stromal cells and was significantly induced by E2 and MPA in Ishikawa cells. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of ATF3 in Ishikawa cells activated LIF promoter activity and enhanced its expression. Accordingly, the stimulation of BeWo spheroid adhesion promoted by ATF3 was inhibited by pretreatment with a specific antibody against LIF via the antibody-blocking assay. Moreover, ATF3 was aberrantly decreased in the endometria of RIF patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that ATF3 plays a significant role in regulating human endometrial receptivity and embryo attachment in vitro via up-regulation of leukemia inhibitory factor.

We performed a retrospective study of adult acute leukemia patients who were treated at our institution between November 1999 and May 2005. Medical records of 139 patients with an initial VTE were reviewed and followed up to May 2010 for VTE recurrence. Of these 139 patients [86 with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 53 with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)], 27 (19.4%, 16 AML and 11 ALL) had VTE recurrence. The overall incidence rate of VTE was 8.6 per 100 person-years (median follow-up time: 0.9years). It was 5.9 and 12.4 per 100 person-years among ALL and AML patients, respectively. The cumulative proportion of recurrent VTE was 2.16%, 10.9%, 16.6%, 25.9%, 30.6%, and 34.2% at 1month, 6months, 1year, 3years, 5years, and 7years, respectively. In a multivariate Cox hazards model, significant predictors for VTE recurrence included catheter thrombosis [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR)]:6.3, 95%CI:1.17-34.0), prior history of hematologic cancer (aHR:4.2, 95%CI:1.5-11.2), chronic lung disease (aHR: 3.4, 95%CI:0.92-12.5), psychological disorder (aHR: 4.3, 95%CI:1.5-12.2), and liver disease (aHR: 3.8, 95%CI: 1.04-14.3). VTE recurrence is common among adult acute leukemia patients and it continues up to 7years after the initial episode. Catheter thrombosis, a history of hematologic malignancy antecedent to acute leukemia, and lung, liver and psychiatric co-morbidities increase the patient risk for VTE recurrence.

To examine how TCR specificity determines iNKT function, we used somatic cell nuclear transfer to generate three lines of mice cloned from iNKT nuclei. Each line uses the invariant Valpha14Jalpha18 TCRalpha paired with unique Vbeta7 or Vbeta8.2 subunits. We examined tissue homing, expression of PLZF, T-bet, and RORgammat, and cytokine profiles and found that, although monoclonal iNKT cells differentiated into all functional subsets, the NKT17 lineage was reduced or expanded depending on the TCR expressed. We examined iNKT thymic development in limited-dilution bone marrow chimeras and show that higher TCR avidity correlates with higher PLZF and reduced T-bet expression. iNKT functional subsets showed distinct tissue distribution patterns. Although each individual monoclonal TCR showed an inherent subset distribution preference that was evident across all tissues examined, the iNKT cytokine profile differed more by tissue of origin than by TCR specificity.","['Clancy-Thompson, Eleanor', 'Chen, Gui Zhen', 'Tyler, Paul M', 'Servos, Mariah M', 'Barisa, Marta', 'Brennan, Patrick J', 'Ploegh, Hidde L', 'Dougan, Stephanie K']","['Clancy-Thompson E', 'Chen GZ', 'Tyler PM', 'Servos MM', 'Barisa M', 'Brennan PJ', 'Ploegh HL', 'Dougan SK']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5483-7178', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7846-6810']","['Department of Cancer Immunology and Virology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology and Virology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology and Virology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology and Virology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215.', 'Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02242; and.', ""Division of Rheumatology, Immunology, and Allergy, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02215."", 'Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02242; and.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology and Virology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215; Stephanie_dougan@dfci.harvard.edu.', 'Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02242; and.']",['eng'],"['K08 AI102945/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA207021/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170602,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 3)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', '0 (T-box transcription factor TBX21)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/physiology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cytokines/genetics/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Interleukin-10/immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-17/immunology/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*immunology', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 3/genetics/immunology', 'Nuclear Transfer Techniques', 'Organ Specificity', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'T-Box Domain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology']",PMC5518629,2017/06/04 06:00,2017/09/28 06:00,['2017/06/04 06:00'],"['2017/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1700214 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1700214 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2017 Jul 1;199(1):159-171. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1700214.

SRF-Mkl1 is sensitive to the mechanical properties of the extracellular environment; but how cells sense and transduce mechanical cues to modulate SRF-Mkl1-dependent gene expression is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that the nuclear lamina-associated inner nuclear membrane protein Emerin stimulates SRF-Mkl1-dependent gene activity in a substrate stiffness-dependent manner. Specifically, Emerin was required for Mkl1 nuclear accumulation and maximal SRF-Mkl1-dependent gene expression in response to serum stimulation of cells grown on stiff substrates but was dispensable on more compliant substrates. Focal adhesion area was also reduced in cells lacking Emerin, consistent with a role for Emerin in sensing substrate stiffness. Expression of a constitutively active form of Mkl1 bypassed the requirement for Emerin in SRF-Mkl1-dependent gene expression and reversed the focal adhesion defects evident in Emd(KO) fibroblasts. Together, these data indicate that Emerin, a conserved nuclear lamina protein, couples extracellular matrix mechanics and SRF-Mkl1-dependent transcription.","['Willer, Margaret K', 'Carroll, Christopher W']","['Willer MK', 'Carroll CW']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7492-5696'],"['Dept.

Mutations of FLT3 resulting in constitutive signaling are common in AML, including internal tandem duplication (ITD) in the juxtamembrane domain in 25% of patients and point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain in 5%. Patients with AML with FLT3-ITD have a high relapse rate and short relapse-free and overall survival after chemotherapy and after transplant. A number of inhibitors of FLT3 signaling have been identified and are in clinical trials, both alone and with chemotherapy, with the goal of improving clinical outcomes in patients with AML with FLT3 mutations. While inhibitor monotherapy produces clinical responses, they are usually incomplete and transient, and resistance develops rapidly. Diverse combination therapies have been suggested to potentiate the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors and to prevent development of resistance or overcome resistance. Combinations with epigenetic therapies, proteasome inhibitors, downstream kinase inhibitors, phosphatase activators, and other drugs that alter signaling are being explored. This review summarizes the current status of translational and clinical research on FLT3 inhibitors in AML, and discusses novel combination approaches. Mol Cancer Ther; 16(6); 991-1001.

Currently, there are no available disease-modifying therapies for CMML, nor are there preclinical models that fully recapitulate the unique features of CMML. Through use of immunocompromised mice with transgenic expression of human GM-CSF, interleukin-3, and stem cell factor in a NOD/SCID-IL2Rgamma(null) background (NSGS mice), we demonstrate remarkable engraftment of CMML and JMML providing the first examples of serially transplantable and genetically accurate models of CMML. Xenotransplantation of CD34(+) cells (n = 8 patients) or unfractionated bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (n = 10) resulted in robust engraftment of CMML in BM, spleen, liver, and lung of recipients (n = 82 total mice). Engrafted cells were myeloid-restricted and matched the immunophenotype, morphology, and genetic mutations of the corresponding patient. Similar levels of engraftment were seen upon serial transplantation of human CD34(+) cells in secondary NSGS recipients (2/5 patients, 6/11 mice), demonstrating the durability of CMML grafts and functionally validating CD34(+) cells as harboring the disease-initiating compartment in vivo. Successful engraftments of JMML primary samples were also achieved in all NSGS recipients (n = 4 patients, n = 12 mice). Engraftment of CMML and JMML resulted in overt phenotypic abnormalities and lethality in recipients, which facilitated evaluation of the JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor pacritinib in vivo. These data reveal that NSGS mice support the development of CMML and JMML disease-initiating and mature leukemic cells in vivo, allowing creation of genetically accurate preclinical models of these disorders.","['Yoshimi, Akihide', 'Balasis, Maria E', 'Vedder, Alexis', 'Feldman, Kira', 'Ma, Yan', 'Zhang, Hailing', 'Lee, Stanley Chun-Wei', 'Letson, Christopher', 'Niyongere, Sandrine', 'Lu, Sydney X', 'Ball, Markus', 'Taylor, Justin', 'Zhang, Qing', 'Zhao, Yulong', 'Youssef, Salma', 'Chung, Young Rock', 'Zhang, Xiao Jing', 'Durham, Benjamin H', 'Yang, Wendy', 'List, Alan F', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Klimek, Virginia', 'Berger, Michael F', 'Stieglitz, Elliot', 'Padron, Eric', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar']","['Yoshimi A', 'Balasis ME', 'Vedder A', 'Feldman K', 'Ma Y', 'Zhang H', 'Lee SC', 'Letson C', 'Niyongere S', 'Lu SX', 'Ball M', 'Taylor J', 'Zhang Q', 'Zhao Y', 'Youssef S', 'Chung YR', 'Zhang XJ', 'Durham BH', 'Yang W', 'List AF', 'Loh ML', 'Klimek V', 'Berger MF', 'Stieglitz E', 'Padron E', 'Abdel-Wahab O']",,"['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H.

CML therapy based on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is highly effective in inducing remission but not in targeting leukemia stem cells (LSCs), which sustain minimal residual disease and are responsible for CML relapse following discontinuation of treatment. The identification of molecules capable of targeting LSCs appears therefore of primary importance to aim at CML eradication. LSCs home in bone marrow areas at low oxygen tension, where HSCs are physiologically hosted. This study addresses the effects of pharmacological inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a critical regulator of LSC survival, on the maintenance of CML stem cell potential. We found that the HIF-1 inhibitor acriflavine (ACF) decreased survival and growth of CML cells. These effects were paralleled by decreased expression of c-Myc and stemness-related genes. Using different in vitro stem cell assays, we showed that ACF, but not TKIs, targets the stem cell potential of CML cells, including primary cells explanted from 12 CML patients. Moreover, in a murine CML model, ACF decreased leukemia development and reduced LSC maintenance. Importantly, ACF exhibited significantly less-severe effects on non-CML hematopoietic cells in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we propose ACF, a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug for nononcological use in humans, as a novel therapeutic approach to prevent CML relapse and, in combination with TKIs, enhance induction of remission.","['Cheloni, Giulia', 'Tanturli, Michele', 'Tusa, Ignazia', 'Ho DeSouza, Ngoc', 'Shan, Yi', 'Gozzini, Antonella', 'Mazurier, Frederic', 'Rovida, Elisabetta', 'Li, Shaoguang', 'Dello Sbarba, Persio']","['Cheloni G', 'Tanturli M', 'Tusa I', 'Ho DeSouza N', 'Shan Y', 'Gozzini A', 'Mazurier F', 'Rovida E', 'Li S', 'Dello Sbarba P']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7682-3826', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2642-1706', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6984-7096', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5949-3239', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6411-569X']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche Sperimentali e Cliniche ""Mario Serio"", Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA.', 'Istituto Toscano Tumori, Tuscany, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche Sperimentali e Cliniche ""Mario Serio"", Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Florence, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche Sperimentali e Cliniche ""Mario Serio"", Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Florence, Italy.', 'Istituto Toscano Tumori, Tuscany, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA.', 'Unita Funzionale di Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi (AOUC), Florence, Italy; and.', 'Equipe Niche Leucemique et Metabolisme Oxydatif, Genetique, Immunotherapie, Chimie et Cancer, Unite Mixte de Recherche 7292, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Universite Francois-Rabelais de Tours, Tours, France.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche Sperimentali e Cliniche ""Mario Serio"", Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Florence, Italy.', 'Istituto Toscano Tumori, Tuscany, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche Sperimentali e Cliniche ""Mario Serio"", Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Florence, Italy.', 'Istituto Toscano Tumori, Tuscany, Italy.']",['eng'],['R01 CA176179/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170602,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '1T3A50395T (Acriflavine)']",IM,"['Acriflavine/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Survival', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology']",PMC5942867,2017/06/04 06:00,2017/08/11 06:00,['2017/06/04 06:00'],"['2016/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33137-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-10-745588 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Aug 3;130(5):655-665. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-10-745588.

Therefore, pediatric-inspired therapies have been successfully implemented in the young adult population, leading to decreased criteria for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. More recently, a high prevalence of Philadelphia-like ALL has been identified in the AYA population, which opens the door to the combination of target therapy similar to Philadelphia-positive ALL.

Herein, we demonstrate here the presence of a novel spliced isoform of TIN2S in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), related to deletion of exon 2 in the TIN2 gene. The expressions of spliced TIN2S mRNA varied widely in CLL and there was an inverse relationship between the mRNA levels of full-length TIN2S and the spliced moiety. Small amounts of spliced TIN2S were also observed in normal B cells but not in T cells. Spliced TIN2S appeared dysfunctional, as immunoprecipitation studies showed the typical association of TRF2 and TIN2 in normal lymphocytes but not in CLL cells. Moreover, whereas TRF2 localized to the nucleus in normal lymphocytes, it was present in both nuclei and cytoplasm in CLL cells. The levels of spliced TIN2S increased with age and in 3 of 8 patients increased over time. The presence of the spliced variant failed to be related to telomere length in CLL suggesting other functions for this protein.

In the analysis of these screens, transposon insertion sites are typically identified by targeted DNA-sequencing and subsequently assigned to predicted target genes using heuristics. As such, these approaches provide no direct evidence that insertions actually affect their predicted targets or how transcripts of these genes are affected. To address this, we developed IM-Fusion, an approach that identifies insertion sites from gene-transposon fusions in standard single- and paired-end RNA-sequencing data. We demonstrate IM-Fusion on two separate transposon screens of 123 mammary tumors and 20 B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias, respectively. We show that IM-Fusion accurately identifies transposon insertions and their true target genes. Furthermore, by combining the identified insertion sites with expression quantification, we show that we can determine the effect of a transposon insertion on its target gene(s) and prioritize insertions that have a significant effect on expression. We expect that IM-Fusion will significantly enhance the accuracy of cancer gene discovery in forward genetic screens and provide initial insight into the biological effects of insertions on candidate cancer genes.","['de Ruiter, Julian R', 'Kas, Sjors M', 'Schut, Eva', 'Adams, David J', 'Koudijs, Marco J', 'Wessels, Lodewyk F A', 'Jonkers, Jos']","['de Ruiter JR', 'Kas SM', 'Schut E', 'Adams DJ', 'Koudijs MJ', 'Wessels LFA', 'Jonkers J']",,"['Division of Molecular Pathology and Cancer Genomics Netherlands, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, Amsterdam 1066 CX, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Molecular Carcinogenesis and Cancer Genomics Netherlands, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, Amsterdam 1066 CX, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Molecular Pathology and Cancer Genomics Netherlands, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, Amsterdam 1066 CX, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Molecular Pathology and Cancer Genomics Netherlands, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, Amsterdam 1066 CX, The Netherlands.', 'Experimental Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton CB10 1SA, UK.', 'Division of Molecular Pathology and Cancer Genomics Netherlands, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, Amsterdam 1066 CX, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Molecular Carcinogenesis and Cancer Genomics Netherlands, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, Amsterdam 1066 CX, The Netherlands.', 'Faculty of EEMCS, Delft University of Technology, Mekelweg 4, Delft 2628 CD, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Molecular Pathology and Cancer Genomics Netherlands, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, Amsterdam 1066 CX, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['13031/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', '319661/European Research Council/International']",['Journal Article'],,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosome Mapping/methods', '*DNA Transposable Elements', 'Datasets as Topic', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Software']",PMC5499543,2017/06/03 06:00,2017/10/12 06:00,['2017/06/03 06:00'],"['2016/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['3859747 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkx461 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2017 Jul 7;45(12):7064-7077. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkx461.,,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2017.

Patients and methods: In a double-blind multicentre Phase 3 study, patients received prophylactic liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) at 5 mg/kg intravenously or placebo twice weekly in a 2:1 random allocation during remission-induction treatment. The primary endpoint was the development of proven or probable IFD. Secondary endpoints included those focused on the safety and tolerability of prophylactic L-AMB. Results: Three hundred and fifty-five patients from 86 centres in Europe and South America received at least one dose of L-AMB ( n = 237) or placebo ( n = 118). Rates of proven and probable IFD assessed independently were 7.9% (18/228) in the L-AMB group and 11.7% (13/111) in the placebo group ( P = 0.24). Rates of possible IFD were 4.8% (11/228) in the L-AMB and 5.4% (6/111) in the placebo group ( P = 0.82). The remission-induction phase was a median of 22 days for both groups. Overall mortality was similar between the groups: 7.2% (17/237) for L-AMB and 6.8% (8/118) for placebo ( P = 1.00). Hypokalaemia and creatinine increase were significantly more frequent with L-AMB. Conclusions: The IFD rate among adult patients undergoing remission-induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed ALL was 11.7% in the placebo group, and was not significantly different in patients receiving L-AMB, suggesting that the L-AMB regimen studied is not effective as prophylaxis against IFD. The IFD rate appears higher than previously reported, warranting further investigation. Tolerability of L-AMB was what might be expected. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal antifungal strategy during remission-induction chemotherapy of ALL.","['Cornely, Oliver A', 'Leguay, Thibaut', 'Maertens, Johan', 'Vehreschild, Maria J G T', 'Anagnostopoulos, Achilles', 'Castagnola, Carlo', 'Verga, Luisa', 'Rieger, Christina', 'Kondakci, Mustafa', 'Harter, Georg', 'Duarte, Rafael F', 'Allione, Bernardino', 'Cordonnier, Catherine', 'Heussel, Claus Peter', 'Morrissey, C Orla', 'Agrawal, Samir G', 'Donnelly, J Peter', 'Bresnik, Mark', 'Hawkins, Michael J', 'Garner, Will', 'Gokbuget, Nicola']","['Cornely OA', 'Leguay T', 'Maertens J', 'Vehreschild MJGT', 'Anagnostopoulos A', 'Castagnola C', 'Verga L', 'Rieger C', 'Kondakci M', 'Harter G', 'Duarte RF', 'Allione B', 'Cordonnier C', 'Heussel CP', 'Morrissey CO', 'Agrawal SG', 'Donnelly JP', 'Bresnik M', 'Hawkins MJ', 'Garner W', 'Gokbuget N']",,"['Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), Department I of Internal Medicine, Clinical Trials Centre Cologne (ZKS), Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO KolnBonn), German Centre for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Bonn-Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', ""Service d'hematologie clinique et Therapie cellulaire, Hopital du Haut-Leveque, CHU de Bordeaux, France."", 'KU Leuven-University of Leuven, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University Hospitals Leuven, Department of Hematology, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Haematology Department - BMT Unit, George Papanicolaou Hospital, Thessaloniki 57010, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico S.

Immunophenotyping allows for accurate and efficient differentiation of many B-LPDs. Recently, we showed that CD200 is highly expressed in hairy cell leukemia (HCL) but not in marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL), or hairy cell leukemia-variant (HCL-v). Here, we assessed the usefulness of a flow cytometric panel combining CD200 and CD1d with CD25, CD103, and CD11c to distinguish CD10-, CD5- B-LPDs. Methods: We analyzed the expression of CD200 and CD1d by flow cytometric analysis in 79 cases of CD10-, CD5- mature B-LPDs. Results: Distinct patterns of CD200 and CD1d expression were seen in the examined B-LPDs. HCL showed bright positivity for CD200 along with positive staining for CD1d, whereas HCL-v showed low levels of expression for both markers. LPL demonstrated positive staining for CD200 in combination with dim to negative staining for CD1d. In contrast, MZL was commonly positive for CD1d and negative for CD200. Conclusions: Flow cytometric analysis of CD200 and CD1d, along with CD25, CD103, and CD11c, can aid in the diagnosis of CD10-, CD5- mature B-LPDs.","['Mason, Emily F', 'Pozdnyakova, Olga', 'Li, Betty', 'Dudley, Graham', 'Dorfman, David M']","['Mason EF', 'Pozdnyakova O', 'Li B', 'Dudley G', 'Dorfman DM']",,"[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD1d)', 'UQ4V77A8VA (antigens, CD200)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD1d/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Prognosis']",,2017/06/03 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2017/06/03 06:00'],"['2017/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['3860185 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcp/aqx041 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2017 Jul 1;148(1):33-41. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqx041.,['NOTNLM'],"['Flow cytometry', 'Hairy cell leukemia', 'Hairy cell leukemia-variant', 'Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma', 'Marginal zone lymphoma']",,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2017.

The aim of the present study was to compare the characteristics, the response to treatment and the survival of advanced-stage cHL treated with adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD) between cART-treated HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed advanced-stage cHL patients from a single institution, uniformly treated with ABVD. All HIV-positive patients received cART concomitantly with ABVD. RESULTS: A total of 69 patients were included in the study: 21 were HIV-positive and 48 were HIV-negative. HIV-positive patients had more aggressive features at cHL diagnosis, such as worse performance status, more frequent bone marrow involvement and mixed cellularity histologic subtype. There were no differences in complete response rate (89% in HIV-positive vs. 91% in HIV-negative), P = 1; disease-free survival (DFS) [10-year DFS probability (95% CI) 70% (41-99%) vs. 74% (57-91%)], P = 0.907 and overall survival (OS) [10-year OS probability (95% CI) 73% (52-94%) vs. 68% (51-85%)], P = 0.904.

Starting with predicted functional germline variants obtained through whole-exome sequencing (WES) data of the Quebec childhood ALL cohort we performed exome-wide association studies with ASNase-related toxicities. A subset of top-ranking variants was further confirmed by genotyping (N=302) followed by validation in an independent replication group (N=282); except for thrombosis which was not available for that dataset. SNPs in 12 genes were associated with ASNase complications in discovery cohort including 3 that were associated with allergy, 3 with pancreatitis and 6 with thrombosis. The risk was further increased through combined SNPs effect (p</=0.002), suggesting synergistic interactions between the SNPs identified in each of the studied toxicities. Interestingly, rs3809849 in the MYBBP1A gene was associated with allergy (p= 0.0006), pancreatitis (p=0.002), thrombosis (p=0.02), event-free survival (p=0.02) and overall survival (p=0.003). Furthermore, rs11556218 in IL16 and rs34708521 in SPEF2 were both associated with thrombosis (p=0.01 and p=0.03, respectively) and pancreatitis (p=0.02). The association of SNPs in MYBBP1A, SPEF2 and IL16 geneswith pancreatitis was replicated in the validation cohort (p </=0.05) as well as in combined cohort (p=0.0003, p=0.008 and p=0.02, respectively). The synergistic effect of combining risk loci had the highest power to predict the development of pancreatitis in both cohorts and was further potentiated in the combined cohort (p=1x10-8).The present work demonstrates that using WES data is a successful ""hypothesis-free"" strategy for identifying significant genetic markers modulating the effect of the treatment in childhood ALL.","['Abaji, Rachid', 'Gagne, Vincent', 'Xu, Chang Jiang', 'Spinella, Jean-Francois', 'Ceppi, Francesco', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Leclerc, Jean-Marie', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Kutok, Jeffery L', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Krajinovic, Maja']","['Abaji R', 'Gagne V', 'Xu CJ', 'Spinella JF', 'Ceppi F', 'Laverdiere C', 'Leclerc JM', 'Sallan SE', 'Neuberg D', 'Kutok JL', 'Silverman LB', 'Sinnett D', 'Krajinovic M']",,"['Research Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Research Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Research Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Research Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Research Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Research Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Research Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Research Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Research Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', '*Pharmacogenomic Variants', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Whole Exome Sequencing']",PMC5546438,2017/06/03 06:00,2018/03/30 06:00,['2017/06/03 06:00'],"['2017/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/30 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['17959 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.17959 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jul 4;8(27):43752-43767. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.17959.,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'asparaginase', 'exome-wide association', 'pharmacogenetics', 'whole-exome sequencing']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Metabolic reprogramming is crucial for tumor progression to foster cancer cells growth and proliferation, and is regulated by mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as well as the oncogenes Myc and hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha). We hypothesized that 6-MP impacts metabolic remodeling through its action on nucleotide synthesis. The aim of our study is to provide a comprehensive characterization of the metabolic changes induced by 6-MP in leukemic T cells. Our results indicate that exposition to 6-MP rapidly reduces intracellular ATP concentration, leading to the activation of AMPK. In turn, mTOR, an AMPK target, was inhibited, and the expression of HIF-1alpha and Myc was reduced upon 6-MP incubation. As a consequence of these inhibitions, glucose and glutamine fluxes were strongly decreased. Notably, no difference was observed on glucose uptake upon exposition to 6-MP. In conclusion, our findings provide new insights into how 6-MP profoundly impacts cellular energetic metabolism by reducing ATP production and decreasing glycolytic and glutaminolytic fluxes, and how 6-MP modifies human leukemic T cells metabolism with potential antiproliferative effects.","['Fernandez-Ramos, Ana A', 'Marchetti-Laurent, Catherine', 'Poindessous, Virginie', 'Antonio, Samantha', 'Laurent-Puig, Pierre', 'Bortoli, Sylvie', 'Loriot, Marie-Anne', 'Pallet, Nicolas']","['Fernandez-Ramos AA', 'Marchetti-Laurent C', 'Poindessous V', 'Antonio S', 'Laurent-Puig P', 'Bortoli S', 'Loriot MA', 'Pallet N']",,"['INSERM UMR-S 1147, Centre Universitaire des Saints-Peres, 75006 Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75006 Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1147, Centre Universitaire des Saints-Peres, 75006 Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75006 Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1147, Centre Universitaire des Saints-Peres, 75006 Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75006 Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75006 Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1124, Centre Universitaire des Saints-Peres, 75006 Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1147, Centre Universitaire des Saints-Peres, 75006 Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75006 Paris, France.', 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou, Service de Biochimie, 75015 Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75006 Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1124, Centre Universitaire des Saints-Peres, 75006 Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1147, Centre Universitaire des Saints-Peres, 75006 Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75006 Paris, France.', 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou, Service de Biochimie, 75015 Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1147, Centre Universitaire des Saints-Peres, 75006 Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75006 Paris, France.', 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou, Service de Biochimie, 75015 Paris, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '415SHH325A (Adenosine Monophosphate)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate/metabolism', 'Adenosine Monophosphate/metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Energy Metabolism/*drug effects', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Mercaptopurine/*pharmacology', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways/drug effects', 'Stress, Physiological/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/*physiology']",PMC5522126,2017/06/03 06:00,2018/04/07 06:00,['2017/06/03 06:00'],"['2016/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['17889 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.17889 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jun 27;8(26):43048-43060. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.17889.,['NOTNLM'],"['6-mercaptopurine', 'Jurkat T cell line', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'energetic failure', 'metabolic checkpoints']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The collagen receptor uPARAP/Endo180 is overexpressed by malignant cells in several non-epithelial cancers, notably including sarcomas, glioblastomas and subsets of acute myeloid leukemia. In contrast, in healthy adult individuals, expression is restricted to minor subsets of mesenchymal cells. Functionally, uPARAP/Endo180 is a rapidly recycling endocytic receptor that delivers its cargo directly into the endosomal-lysosomal system, thus opening a potential route of entry into receptor-positive cells. This combination of specific expression and endocytic function appears well suited for targeting of uPARAP/Endo180-positive cancers by antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) mediated drug delivery. Therefore, we utilized a specific monoclonal antibody against uPARAP/Endo180, raised through immunization of a uPARAP/Endo180 knock-out mouse, which reacts with both the human and the murine receptor, to construct a uPARAP-directed ADC. This antibody was coupled to the highly toxic dolastatin derivative, monomethyl auristatin E, via a cathepsin-labile valine-citrulline linker. With this ADC, we show strong and receptor-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro in uPARAP/Endo180-positive cancer cell lines of sarcoma, glioblastoma and leukemic origin. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potency of the ADC in vivo in a xenograft mouse model with human uPARAP/Endo180-positive leukemic cells, obtaining a complete cure of all tested mice following intravenous ADC treatment with no sign of adverse effects. Our study identifies uPARAP/Endo180 as a promising target for novel therapy against several highly malignant cancer types.","['Nielsen, Christoffer Fagernaes', 'van Putten, Sander Maarten', 'Lund, Ida Katrine', 'Melander, Maria Carlsen', 'Norregaard, Kirstine Sandal', 'Jurgensen, Henrik Jessen', 'Reckzeh, Kristian', 'Christensen, Kristine Rothaus', 'Ingvarsen, Signe Ziir', 'Gardsvoll, Henrik', 'Jensen, Kamilla Ellermann', 'Hamerlik, Petra', 'Engelholm, Lars Henning', 'Behrendt, Niels']","['Nielsen CF', 'van Putten SM', 'Lund IK', 'Melander MC', 'Norregaard KS', 'Jurgensen HJ', 'Reckzeh K', 'Christensen KR', 'Ingvarsen SZ', 'Gardsvoll H', 'Jensen KE', 'Hamerlik P', 'Engelholm LH', 'Behrendt N']",,"['The Finsen Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Biotech Research and Innovation Center (BRIC), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'The Finsen Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Biotech Research and Innovation Center (BRIC), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'The Finsen Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Biotech Research and Innovation Center (BRIC), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'The Finsen Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Biotech Research and Innovation Center (BRIC), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'The Finsen Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Biotech Research and Innovation Center (BRIC), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'The Finsen Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Biotech Research and Innovation Center (BRIC), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Proteases and Tissue Remodeling Section, Oral and Pharyngeal Cancer Branch, NIDCR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.', 'The Finsen Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Biotech Research and Innovation Center (BRIC), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Experimental Animal Models Section, Department of Veterinary Disease Biology, University of Copenhagen, DK-1871 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.', 'The Finsen Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Biotech Research and Innovation Center (BRIC), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'The Finsen Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Biotech Research and Innovation Center (BRIC), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.', 'The Finsen Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Biotech Research and Innovation Center (BRIC), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'The Finsen Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Biotech Research and Innovation Center (BRIC), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Endo180)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (MRC2 protein, human)', '0 (Mannose-Binding Lectins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Survival', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Endocytosis', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Mannose-Binding Lectins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Mitogen/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Sarcoma/drug therapy/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5546505,2017/06/03 06:00,2018/04/07 06:00,['2017/06/03 06:00'],"['2016/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['17883 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.17883 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jul 4;8(27):44605-44624. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.17883.,['NOTNLM'],"['antibody-drug conjugate', 'glioblastoma', 'leukemia', 'sarcoma', 'uPARAP']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BM-A progressively increase with aging, eventually occupying up to 50% of BM cavities. In this work, the role played by BM-A was explored by studying primary human BM-A isolated from hip surgery patients at the molecular level, through microarray analysis, and at the functional level, by assessing their relationship with primary human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) by the long-term culture initiating cell (LTC-IC) assay. Findings demonstrated that BM-A are capable of supporting HSC survival in the LTC-IC assay, since after 5 weeks of co-culture, HSC were still able to proliferate and differentiate. Furthermore, critical molecules such as C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12), interleukin (IL)-8, colony-stimulating factor 3 (CSF3), and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), were expressed at similar levels in BM-A and in primary human BM mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC), whereas IL-3 was higher in BM-A. Interestingly, BM-A displayed a different gene expression profile compared with subcutaneous adipose tissue adipocytes (AT-A) collected from abdominal surgery patients, especially in terms of regulation of lipid metabolism, stemness genes, and white-to-brown differentiation pathways. Accordingly, analysis of the gene pathways involved in hematopoiesis regulation showed that BM-A are more closely related to BM-MSC than to AT-A. The present data suggest that BM-A play a supporting role in the hematopoietic niche and directly sustain HSC survival.","['Mattiucci, Domenico', 'Maurizi, Giulia', 'Izzi, Valerio', 'Cenci, Lorenzo', 'Ciarlantini, Marco', 'Mancini, Stefania', 'Mensa, Emanuela', 'Pascarella, Raffaele', 'Vivarelli, Marco', 'Olivieri, Attilio', 'Leoni, Pietro', 'Poloni, Antonella']","['Mattiucci D', 'Maurizi G', 'Izzi V', 'Cenci L', 'Ciarlantini M', 'Mancini S', 'Mensa E', 'Pascarella R', 'Vivarelli M', 'Olivieri A', 'Leoni P', 'Poloni A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4221-4125'],"['Dipartimento Scienze Cliniche e Molecolari, Clinica di Ematologia, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy.', 'Dipartimento Scienze Cliniche e Molecolari, Clinica di Ematologia, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy.', 'Faculty of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Center for Cell-Matrix Research and Biocenter Oulu, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.', 'Dipartimento Scienze Cliniche e Molecolari, Clinica di Ematologia, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy.', 'Dipartimento Scienze Cliniche e Molecolari, Clinica di Ematologia, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy.', 'Dipartimento Scienze Cliniche e Molecolari, Clinica di Ematologia, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy.', 'Cardiology Unit, Italian National Research Center on Aging (INRCA-IRCCS), Experimental Models in Clinical Pathology, INRCA-IRCCS National Institute, Ancona, Italy.', 'Orthopedic and Traumatology Department, Ospedali Riuniti, Ancona, Italy.', 'Hepatobiliary and Abdominal Transplantation Surgery, Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy.', 'Dipartimento Scienze Cliniche e Molecolari, Clinica di Ematologia, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy.', 'Dipartimento Scienze Cliniche e Molecolari, Clinica di Ematologia, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy.', 'Dipartimento Scienze Cliniche e Molecolari, Clinica di Ematologia, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20170803,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCL8 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Adipocytes/metabolism/*physiology', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/*physiology', '*Cell Communication', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/metabolism', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Niche', 'Subcutaneous Fat/cytology/physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptome']",,2017/06/03 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/06/03 06:00'],"['2017/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.26037 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2018 Feb;233(2):1500-1511. doi: 10.1002/jcp.26037.

Here we present data on the potential clinical activity of the monoclonal antibody CSL362, which binds to CD123 with high affinity. We first validated the expression of CD123 by 100% (52/52) of patient samples and the correlation of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations with the high frequency of CD123 in AML. In vitro studies demonstrated that CSL362 potently induced antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) of AML blasts including CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(+) LSCs by natural killer cells (NKs). Importantly, compared with healthy donor (HD) NKs, NKs drawn from AML patients in remission had a comparable ADCC activity against leukemic cells; of note, during remission, immature NKs were five times higher in AML patients than that in HDs. Significantly, we report a case where leukemic cells were resistant to autologous ADCC; however, the blasts were effectively lysed by CSL362 together with donor-derived NKs after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These studies highlight CSL362 as a promising therapeutic option following chemotherapy and transplant so as to improve the outcome of AML patients.","['Xie, L H', 'Biondo, M', 'Busfield, S J', 'Arruda, A', 'Yang, X', 'Vairo, G', 'Minden, M D']","['Xie LH', 'Biondo M', 'Busfield SJ', 'Arruda A', 'Yang X', 'Vairo G', 'Minden MD']",,"['Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'CSL Limited, Bio21 Institute, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'CSL Limited, Bio21 Institute, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'CSL Limited, Bio21 Institute, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170602,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,"['0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",PMC5520399,2017/06/03 06:00,2018/03/21 06:00,['2017/06/03 06:00'],"['2017/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201752 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2017.52 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2017 Jun 2;7(6):e567. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2017.52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Owing to rarity of this disease, the clinical features and overall outcomes are yet to be clarified. OBJECTIVE: To define clinical characteristics, epidemiology, pathologic findings, treatment options and outcomes in MS. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 23 patients diagnosed with MS at our institute over a period of 13 years (2002-2015). RESULTS: MS presented mostly as a manifestation of relapsed acute myeloid leukemia, seen in 39% of patients. Skin and subcutaneous soft tissues were the most common sites of anatomic involvement (69.5%). Ninety five percent (n = 19) were positive for classical myeloid markers with either cytochemical staining (chloracetate-esterase, MPO), flow-cytometry (CD33, CD34, CD13 and CD117), or immunohistochemistry (CD34, CD43, CD68 and lysozyme). Of these, 52% were positive for CD33 (n = 12), 35% for CD68 (n = 8), 30% for CD34 (n = 7), and 26% for lysozyme (n = 6). Cytogenetic abnormalities were seen in 63% (n = 12/19) patients on bone-marrow aspirate, with five patients displaying a complex (n = 3) or monosomal (n = 2) karyotype. Twenty seven percent patients with a normal karyotype had presence of deleterious mutations (FLT3, ASXL, STAG and JAK2) on further testing with myeloid mutation panel. The Median overall survival (OS) of the entire cohort was 15.9 months (95% CI, 7.4-24.4 months). The OS was significantly better for patients <65 years (24.6 vs. 3.4 months, p = 0.009) of age, and for those attaining a complete remission (CR) to induction therapy (25.7 vs. 0.8 months, p < 0.001). All patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant attained long-term remissions, with a median follow-up of 54 (range 32-120) months. CONCLUSION: Failure to achieve CR with induction therapy, and age >65 years are associated with poor outcomes in MS. Allogeneic stem-cell transplant in first remission appears to be the most effective modality for achieving long-term remissions.","['Kaur, Varinder', 'Swami, Arjun', 'Alapat, Daisy', 'Abdallah, Al Ola', 'Motwani, Pooja', 'Hutchins, Laura F', 'Jethava, Yogesh']","['Kaur V', 'Swami A', 'Alapat D', 'Abdallah AO', 'Motwani P', 'Hutchins LF', 'Jethava Y']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6480-7204'],"['a Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Emily Couric Cancer Center , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA , USA.', 'b Division of Hematology and Oncology , Winthrop P.

Anti-CD123 antibodies conjugated to Mal-PEG2000-DSPE were incorporated into normal niosomes (NS) via a post insertion method to afford antibody-modified niosomes (CD123-NS). Next, NS was modified with varying densities of antibody (0.5 or 2%, antibody/Span 80, molar ratio), thus providing L-CD123-NS and H-CD123-NS. We studied the effect of antibody density on the uptake efficiency of niosomes in NB4 and THP-1 cells, on which CD123 express differently. Our results demonstrate CD123-NS showed significantly higher uptake efficiency than NS in AML cells, and the uptake efficiency of CD123-NS has been ligand density-dependent. Also, AML cells preincubated with anti-CD123 antibody showed significantly reduced cellular uptake of CD123-NS compared to control. Further study on the uptake mechanism confirmed a receptor-mediated endocytic process. Daunorubicin (DNR)-loaded H-CD123-NS demonstrated a 2.45- and 3.22-fold higher cytotoxicity, compared to DNR-loaded NS in NB4 and THP-1 cells, respectively. Prolonged survival time were observed in leukemic mice treated with DNR-H-CD123-NS. Collectively, these findings support that the CD123-NS represent a promising delivery system for the treatment of AML.","['Liu, Fu-Rong', 'Jin, Hui', 'Wang, Yin', 'Chen, Chen', 'Li, Ming', 'Mao, Sheng-Jun', 'Wang, Qiantao', 'Li, Hui']","['Liu FR', 'Jin H', 'Wang Y', 'Chen C', 'Li M', 'Mao SJ', 'Wang Q', 'Li H']",,"['a Key Laboratory of Drug Targeting and Drug Delivery System, Ministry of Education and West China School of Pharmacy , Sichuan University , Chengdu , China.', 'a Key Laboratory of Drug Targeting and Drug Delivery System, Ministry of Education and West China School of Pharmacy , Sichuan University , Chengdu , China.', 'a Key Laboratory of Drug Targeting and Drug Delivery System, Ministry of Education and West China School of Pharmacy , Sichuan University , Chengdu , China.', 'a Key Laboratory of Drug Targeting and Drug Delivery System, Ministry of Education and West China School of Pharmacy , Sichuan University , Chengdu , China.', 'a Key Laboratory of Drug Targeting and Drug Delivery System, Ministry of Education and West China School of Pharmacy , Sichuan University , Chengdu , China.', 'a Key Laboratory of Drug Targeting and Drug Delivery System, Ministry of Education and West China School of Pharmacy , Sichuan University , Chengdu , China.', 'a Key Laboratory of Drug Targeting and Drug Delivery System, Ministry of Education and West China School of Pharmacy , Sichuan University , Chengdu , China.', 'b Department of Hematology , Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences and Sichuan Provincial People Hospital , Chengdu , China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Drug Deliv,Drug delivery,9417471,"['0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Liposomes)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Daunorubicin', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Liposomes', 'Mice']",PMC8244627,2017/06/03 06:00,2017/12/13 06:00,['2017/06/03 06:00'],"['2017/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/10717544.2017.1333170 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Deliv. 2017 Nov;24(1):882-890. doi: 10.1080/10717544.2017.1333170.,['NOTNLM'],"['CD123', 'Niosome', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'daunorubicin', 'drug targeting']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing have led to the identification of various miRNAs implicated in the pathogenesis of AML. We found in this study that miR-650, a miRNA that was traditionally considered to participate in the onset of hepatocellular carcinoma, might play a significant role in AML development and progression. METHODS:: qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of miR-650 and Gfi1 in AML patients and healthy controls. Next, a luciferase assay was conducted to verify the target effect of miR-650 on Gfi1. Moreover, the CCK-8 assay was performed to evaluate the effect of miR-650 on the proliferation of AML cells in the presence and absence of Gfi1. RESULTS:: miR-650 was downregulated in AML whereas Gfi1 was upregulated. miR-650 could negatively regulate Gfi1 via direct targeting of its 3'-UTR, which was confirmed by luciferase assay. In addition, overexpression of miR-650 reduced cell proliferation in K562 cells, whereas an increase in cell proliferation was observed when K562 cells were transfected with miR-650 inhibitor, which was compromised in response to the knockdown of Gfi1. CONCLUSIONS:: Our research demonstrated that miR-650 modulates cell proliferation in AML through affecting the expression of Gfi1, which occurs by direct target action.","['Yuan, Changyong', 'Xu, Liming', 'Du, Pengcheng', 'Pang, Jinling']","['Yuan C', 'Xu L', 'Du P', 'Pang J']",,"[""1 Department of Hemopathology, Dezhou People's Hospital, Dezhou - China."", ""1 Department of Hemopathology, Dezhou People's Hospital, Dezhou - China."", ""2 Pharmaceutical Preparation Section, Dezhou People's Hospital, Dezhou - China."", ""3 Endoscopy Center, Dezhou People's Hospital, Dezhou - China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180509,United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GFI1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN650 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2017/06/03 06:00,2018/11/27 06:00,['2017/06/03 06:00'],"['2017/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['1D591D61-BB5E-476E-9D87-C6554A6180F8 [pii]', '10.5301/tj.5000643 [doi]']",ppublish,Tumori. 2018 Oct;104(5):369-374. doi: 10.5301/tj.5000643.

The patient being reported was a known case of CML in remission with history of painless sudden loss of vision in both eyes. Cases of leukemia can present with visual loss due to multiple ocular manifestations of leukemia itself or side effects of modern drugs used for its treatment. Clinical examination and multimodal imaging of our patient were suggestive of concurrent development of VKH. The patient was started on oral steroids, to which he showed a good response. Thus, the cases of CML may rarely develop concurrent ocular disorders not related to leukemia. These associated ocular disorders need to be distinguished from the ocular manifestations of leukemia itself.

The receipt of chemotherapy or hematopoietic cell transplantation is low, and the choices between intensive or low-intensity chemotherapy is often not clear. Geriatric and multidisciplinary interventions targeted to optimize functional status and improve management of comorbidities may enhance chemotherapy tolerance. Comprehensive geriatric assessment, and other integrated risk assessment models have been developed to predict the risk of chemotherapy-related toxicities and survival, and may guide therapy assignment. Development of low intensity but effective therapy is a major need. Deeper understanding of the molecular biology of AML has allowed several novel therapies to enter clinical trials in recent years.

No trials directly comparing their efficacy are available. Therefore a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was performed to provide insight into their relative efficacy in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). MAIC attempts to adjust for between-trial differences in factors known or suspected to influence treatment effects, to minimize bias. METHODS: A MAIC within a Bayesian framework was conducted using individual patient data from the RESONATE-2 study of ibr versus chlorambucil and published data from the CLL11 study of obi versus chlorambucil. Both studies were conducted in patients ineligible for full-dose fludarabine-based therapy. After matching, the reweighted adjusted relative efficacy measure of ibr versus chlorambucil from RESONATE-2 [hazard ratio (HR), 95% credible interval (CrI)] was compared with that of obi versus chlorambucil from CLL11 for each endpoint, using a Bayesian indirect comparison. RESULTS: Our results suggest that in a population with similar average baseline characteristics to CLL11, ibr would improve PFS and OS outcomes compared to obi. Before matching, the HRs for ibr versus obi were 0.48 [CrI = 0.22-1.02, p(HR <1) = 97%], 0.85 [CrI = 0.44-1.63, p(HR <1) = 69%], and 0.40 [CrI = 0.10-1.54, p(HR <1) = 91%] for PFS by investigator assessment, PFS by independent review committee, and OS, respectively. After matching on all available characteristics the HRs decreased to 0.12 [CrI = 0.02-0.97, p(HR <1) = 98%], 0.24 [CrI = 0.04-1.35, p(HR <1) = 95%], and 0.21 [CrI = <0.01-8.89, p(HR <1) = 79%], respectively. There was a large variance around the treatment effect for OS due to the low number of deaths. CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that ibrutinib is highly likely to provide greater PFS benefit than obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil in older or less fit patients with previously untreated CLL. There is also an indication of improvement in OS, albeit with a higher uncertainty due to the low number of events.

In this study, the cytotoxic effects of crude ethanolic and fractional extracts including hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol fractions from M. siamensis flowers were investigated in order to determine their effect on WT1 expression in Molt4 and K562 cells and Bcr/Abl expression in K562 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The flowers of M. siamensis were extracted using ethanol. The ethanol flower extract was further fractionated with hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol. Cytotoxic effects were measured by the MTT assay. Bcr/Abl and WT1 protein levels after treatments were determined by Western blotting. The total cell number was determined via the typan blue exclusion method. RESULTS: The hexane fraction showed the strongest cytotoxic activity on Molt4 and K562 cells, with IC50 values of 2.6 and 77.6 mug/ml, respectively. The hexane extract decreased Bcr/Abl protein expression in K562 cells by 74.6% and WT1 protein expressions in Molt4 and K562 cells by 68.4 and 72.1%, respectively. Total cell numbers were decreased by 66.2 and 48.7% in Molt4 and K562 cells, respectively. Mammea E/BB (main active compound) significantly decreased both Bcr/Abl and WTlprotein expressions by 75 and 49.5%, respectively when compared to vehicle control. CONCLUSION: The hexane fraction from M. siamensis flowers inhibited cell proliferation via the suppression of WT1 expression in Molt4 and K562 cells and Bcr/Abl expression in K562 cells. The active compound may be mammea E/BB. Extracts from M. siamensis flowers show promise as naturally occurring anti-cancer drugs.","['Sangkaruk, Rungkarn', 'Rungrojsakul, Methee', 'Tima, Singkome', 'Anuchapreeda, Songyot']","['Sangkaruk R', 'Rungrojsakul M', 'Tima S', 'Anuchapreeda S']",,"['Division of Clinical Microscopy, Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200 Thailand.', 'Alternative Medical College, Chandrakasem Rajabhat University, Bangkok 10900, Thailand.', 'Division of Clinical Microscopy, Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200 Thailand.', 'Division of Clinical Microscopy, Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200 Thailand.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170113,Nigeria,Afr J Tradit Complement Altern Med,"African journal of traditional, complementary, and alternative medicines : AJTCAM",101232990,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Flowers', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', '*Mammea', 'Medicine, Traditional', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/metabolism', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/metabolism', 'Thailand', 'WT1 Proteins/*metabolism']",PMC5446439,2017/06/03 06:00,2017/08/17 06:00,['2017/06/03 06:00'],"['2017/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.21010/ajtcam.v14i2.3 [doi]', 'AJTCAM-14-16 [pii]']",epublish,Afr J Tradit Complement Altern Med. 2017 Jan 13;14(2):16-24. doi: 10.21010/ajtcam.v14i2.3. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcr/Abl', 'K562', 'Mammea siamensis', 'Molt4', 'WT1', 'flower', 'leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More recently, investigators have shown that D2HG is produced by mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes associated with a variety of human malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia, glioblastoma multiforme, and cholangiocarcinoma (Cairns and Mak, 2013; Dang et al., 2009; Ward et al., 2010). By contrast, we and others have shown that L2HG accumulates in response to cellular reductive stressors like hypoxia, activation of hypoxia inducible factors, and mitochondrial electron transport chain defects (Oldham et al., 2015; Reinecke et al., 2011; Intlekofer et al., 2015; Mullen et al., 2015). Each enantiomer is produced and metabolized in independent biochemical pathways in reactions catalyzed by separate enzymes and utilizing different cofactors with presumably different consequences for cellular metabolism (Kranendijk et al., 2012). Therefore, as research into the roles of D2HG and L2HG in human metabolism continues, it becomes increasingly important for investigators to consider each enantiomer independently (Struys, 2013). Several methods for quantification of biochemically relevant enantiomers in general have been developed and typically include enzymatic assays using enzymes specific for one enantiomeric species or the other, the use of chiral chromatography medium to facilitate chromatographic separation of enantiomers prior to spectroscopy, or the use of chiral derivatization reagents to convert a mixture of enantiomers to diastereomers with differing physical and chemical properties facilitating their chromatographic separation. In this protocol, we report the adaptation of a previously published derivatization method using diacetyl-l-tartaric anhydride (DATAN) for the quantification of 2HG enantiomers (Figure 1) (Oldham et al., 2015; Struys et al., 2004).","['Oldham, William M', 'Loscalzo, Joseph']","['Oldham WM', 'Loscalzo J']",,"[""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", ""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""]",['eng'],"['P50 GM107618/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 HL061795/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007633/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL108630/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],,United States,Bio Protoc,Bio-protocol,101635102,,,,PMC5448426,2017/06/03 06:00,2017/06/03 06:01,['2017/06/03 06:00'],"['2017/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.21769/BioProtoc.1908 [doi]'],ppublish,Bio Protoc. 2016 Aug 20;6(16). doi: 10.21769/BioProtoc.1908.,,,,,,['NIHMS845831'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These short-chain ceramides are ubiquitously found in foods ranging from eggs to soybeans. As the ceramide fatty acid chain length increases, there is an increase in the melting temperature of the organogel and a decrease in the elastic modulus. Gelation ability is lost at 2 wt% when the fatty acid chain length increases to six carbons; however, organogels form at 5 wt% up to 18 carbons. Short-chain ceramides, C2, decrease cell viability of colon, prostate, ovarian, and leukemia cell lines, while ceramides with long-chain fatty acids, C18, do not affect the viability of these cancer cell lines. This suggests that a bioactive spreadable fat, with no trans or added saturated fat, with the potential to alter the viability of cancer cell growth, is possible.","['Rogers, Michael A', 'Spagnuolo, Paul A', 'Wang, Tzu-Min', 'Angka, Leonard']","['Rogers MA', 'Spagnuolo PA', 'Wang TM', 'Angka L']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8324-6054'],"['Department of Food Science University of Guelph Guelph ON Canada.', 'Department of Food Science University of Guelph Guelph ON Canada.', 'Department of Food Science Rutgers University New Brunswick NJ USA.', 'Department of Food Science University of Guelph Guelph ON Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20161023,United States,Food Sci Nutr,Food science & nutrition,101605473,,,,PMC5448365,2017/06/03 06:00,2017/06/03 06:01,['2017/06/03 06:00'],"['2016/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/19 00:00 [revised]', '2016/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1002/fsn3.433 [doi]', 'FSN3433 [pii]']",epublish,Food Sci Nutr. 2016 Oct 23;5(3):579-587. doi: 10.1002/fsn3.433. eCollection 2017 May.,['NOTNLM'],"['*apoptosis', '*ceramides', '*oleogel', '*organogel', '*sphingolipids']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, an attempt has been made to examine and integrate the global DNA methylation changes with gene expression profile and their impact on clinical outcome in early stage CLL patients. RESULTS: The integration of DNA methylation profile (n = 14) with the gene expression profile (n = 21) revealed 142 genes as hypermethylated-downregulated and; 62 genes as hypomethylated-upregulated in early stage CLL patients compared to CD19+ B-cells from healthy individuals. The mRNA expression levels of 17 genes identified to be differentially methylated and/or differentially expressed was further examined in early stage CLL patients (n = 93) by quantitative real time PCR (RQ-PCR). Significant differences were observed in the mRNA expression of MEIS1, PMEPA1, SOX7, SPRY1, CDK6, TBX2, and SPRY2 genes in CLL cells as compared to B-cells from healthy individuals. The analysis in the IGHV mutation based categories (Unmutated = 39, Mutated = 54) revealed significantly higher mRNA expression of CRY1 and PAX9 genes in the IGHV unmutated subgroup (p < 0.001). The relative risk of treatment initiation was significantly higher among patients with high expression of CRY1 (RR = 1.91, p = 0.005) or PAX9 (RR = 1.87, p = 0.001). High expression of CRY1 (HR: 3.53, p < 0.001) or PAX9 (HR: 3.14, p < 0.001) gene was significantly associated with shorter time to first treatment. The high expression of PAX9 gene (HR: 3.29, 95% CI 1.172-9.272, p = 0.016) was also predictive of shorter overall survival in CLL. CONCLUSIONS: The DNA methylation changes associated with mRNA expression of CRY1 and PAX9 genes allow risk stratification of early stage CLL patients. This comprehensive analysis supports the concept that the epigenetic changes along with the altered expression of genes have the potential to predict clinical outcome in early stage CLL patients.","['Rani, Lata', 'Mathur, Nitin', 'Gupta, Ritu', 'Gogia, Ajay', 'Kaur, Gurvinder', 'Dhanjal, Jaspreet Kaur', 'Sundar, Durai', 'Kumar, Lalit', 'Sharma, Atul']","['Rani L', 'Mathur N', 'Gupta R', 'Gogia A', 'Kaur G', 'Dhanjal JK', 'Sundar D', 'Kumar L', 'Sharma A']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5364-4086'],"['Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr. B.R.A.IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, 110029 India.', 'Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr. B.R.A.IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, 110029 India.', 'Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr. B.R.A.IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, 110029 India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dr. B.R.A.IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, 110029 India.', 'Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr. B.R.A.IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, 110029 India.', 'Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology, DBT-AIST International Laboratory of Advanced Biomedicine (DAILAB), Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, Hauz Khas, New Delhi, 110016 India.', 'Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology, DBT-AIST International Laboratory of Advanced Biomedicine (DAILAB), Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, Hauz Khas, New Delhi, 110016 India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dr. B.R.A.IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, 110029 India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dr. B.R.A.IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, 110029 India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170530,Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CRY1 protein, human)', '0 (Cryptochromes)', '0 (PAX9 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX9 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Cryptochromes/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Epigenomics/*methods', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'PAX9 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC5450117,2017/06/03 06:00,2018/03/15 06:00,['2017/06/03 06:00'],"['2016/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13148-017-0356-0 [doi]', '356 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2017 May 30;9:57. doi: 10.1186/s13148-017-0356-0. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Circadian rhythm', '*PAX9', '*Promoter methylation', '*Transcription factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NK cells can respond rapidly to transformed and stressed cells and have the intrinsic potential to extravasate and reach their targets in almost all body tissues. In addition to donor-derived primary NK cells, also the established NK cell line NK-92 is being developed for adoptive immunotherapy, and general safety of infusion of irradiated NK-92 cells has been established in phase I clinical trials with clinical responses observed in some of the cancer patients treated. To enhance their therapeutic utility, NK-92 cells have been modified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) composed of a tumor-specific single chain fragment variable antibody fragment fused via hinge and transmembrane regions to intracellular signaling moieties such as CD3zeta or composite signaling domains containing a costimulatory protein together with CD3zeta. CAR-mediated activation of NK cells then bypasses inhibitory signals and overcomes NK resistance of tumor cells. In contrast to primary NK cells, CAR-engineered NK-92 cell lines suitable for clinical development can be established from molecularly and functionally well-characterized single cell clones following good manufacturing practice-compliant procedures. In preclinical in vitro and in vivo models, potent antitumor activity of NK-92 variants targeted to differentiation antigens expressed by hematologic malignancies, and overexpressed or mutated self-antigens associated with solid tumors has been found, encouraging further development of CAR-engineered NK-92 cells.

Elucidation of the BaP mechanism of action is required in order to understand how to maximise the clinical benefit. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, Synchrotron radiation FTIR (S-FTIR) and Raman microspectroscopy are powerful complementary techniques which were employed to probe the biochemical composition of two AML cell lines in the presence and absence of BaP.

It has been thought that HDACs associate with corepressor complexes and repress gene transcription; however, in this study, we have found that PU.1-a key master regulator for hematopoietic self-renewal and lineage specification-requires HDAC activity for gene activation. Deregulated PU.1 gene expression is linked to dysregulated hematopoiesis and the development of leukemia. In this study, we used erythroid differentiation as a model to analyze how the PU.1 gene is regulated. We found that active HDAC1 is directly recruited to active PU.1 promoter in progenitor cells, whereas acetylated HDAC1, which is inactive, is on the silenced PU.1 promoter in differentiated erythroid cells. We then studied the mechanism of HDAC1-mediated activation. We discovered that HDAC1 activates PU.1 gene transcription via deacetylation of TATA-binding protein-associated factor 9 (TAF9), a component in the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex. Treatment with HDAC inhibitor results in an increase in TAF9 acetylation. Acetylated TAF9 does not bind to the PU.1 gene promoter and subsequently leads to the disassociation of the TFIID complex and transcription repression. Thus, these results demonstrate a key role for HDAC1 in PU.1 gene transcription and, more importantly, uncover a novel mechanism of TFIID recruitment and gene activation.-Jian, W., Yan, B., Huang, S., Qiu, Y.

Defined by a persistent peripheral blood monocytosis >/=1 x 10(9)/L and monocytes accounting for >/=10% of the white blood cells, this aging-associated disease combines cell proliferation as a consequence of myeloid progenitor hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor with myeloid cell dysplasia and ineffective hematopoiesis. The only curative option for CMML remains allogeneic stem cell transplantation. When transplantation is excluded, CMML is stratified into myelodysplastic (white blood cell count <13 x 10(9)/L) and proliferative (white blood cell count >/=13 x 10(9)/L) CMML. In the absence of poor prognostic factors, the management of myelodysplastic CMML is largely inspired from myelodysplastic syndromes, relying on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents to cope with anemia, and careful monitoring and supportive care, whereas the management of proliferative CMML usually relies on cytoreductive agents such as hydroxyurea, although ongoing studies will help delineate the role of hypomethylating agents in this patient population. In the presence of excessive blasts and other poor prognostic factors, hypomethylating agents are the preferred option, even though their impact on leukemic transformation and survival has not been proved. The therapeutic choice is illustrated by 4 clinical situations among the most commonly seen. Although current therapeutic options can improve patient's quality of life, they barely modify disease evolution. Improved understanding of CMML pathophysiology will hopefully lead to the exploration of novel targets that potentially would be curative.","['Solary, Eric', 'Itzykson, Raphael']","['Solary E', 'Itzykson R']",,"['Department of Hematology and.', 'INSERM U1170, Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, Villejuif, France.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universite Paris-Sud, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France; and.', 'Department of Hematology, Hopital Saint Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170601,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Hematinics)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clinical Decision-Making', 'Cytotoxins/therapeutic use', '*Disease Management', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematinics/therapeutic use', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Quality of Life', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2017/06/03 06:00,2017/08/16 06:00,['2017/06/03 06:00'],"['2017/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33212-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-04-736421 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Jul 13;130(2):126-136. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-04-736421.

The first clues about the genetic mechanisms underlying familial leukemia emerged in 1990 when Li-Fraumeni syndrome was linked to TP53 mutations. Since this discovery, many other genes associated with hereditary predisposition to leukemia have been identified. Although several of these disorders also predispose individuals to solid tumors, certain conditions exist in which individuals are specifically at increased risk to develop myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and/or acute leukemia. The increasing identification of affected individuals and families has raised questions around the efficacy, timing, and optimal methods of surveillance. As part of the AACR Childhood Cancer Predisposition Workshop, an expert panel met to review the spectrum of leukemia-predisposing conditions, with the aim to develop consensus recommendations for surveillance for pediatric patients. The panel recognized that for several conditions, routine monitoring with complete blood counts and bone marrow evaluations is essential to identify disease evolution and enable early intervention with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, for others, less intensive surveillance may be considered. Because few reports describing the efficacy of surveillance exist, the recommendations derived by this panel are based on opinion, and local experience and will need to be revised over time. The development of registries and clinical trials is urgently needed to enhance understanding of the natural history of the leukemia-predisposing conditions, such that these surveillance recommendations can be optimized to further enhance long-term outcomes.

In patients in chronic phase, other malignancies are among the most common causes of death, raising concerns on the relationship between these deaths and the off-target effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We analyzed the incidence of second primary malignancies, and related mortality, in 514 chronic myeloid leukemia patients enrolled in clinical trials in which imatinib was given as first-line treatment. We then compared the observed incidence and mortality with those expected in the age- and sex-matched Italian general population, calculating standardized incidence and standardized mortality ratios. After a median follow-up of 74 months, 5.8% patients developed second primary malignancies. The median time from chronic myeloid leukemia to diagnosis of the second primary malignancies was 34 months. We did not find a higher incidence of second primary malignancies compared to that in the age- and sex-matched Italian general population, with standardized incidence ratios of 1.06 (95% CI: 0.57-1.54) and 1.61 (95% CI: 0.92-2.31) in males and females, respectively. Overall, 3.1% patients died of second primary malignancies. The death rate in patients with second primary malignancies was 53% (median overall survival: 18 months). Among females, the observed cancer-related mortality was superior to that expected in the age- and sex-matched Italian population, with a standardized mortality ratio of 2.41 (95% CI: 1.26 - 3.56). In conclusion, our analysis of patients with imatinib-treated chronic myeloid leukemia did not reveal a higher incidence of second primary malignancies; however, the outcome of second primary malignancies in such patients was worse than expected.

In vivo modeling of bona fide chromosomal translocations in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells is challenging but essential to determine their actual leukemogenic potential. We therefore developed an advanced lentiviral CRISPR-Cas9 vector that efficiently transduced human CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and induced the t(11;19)/MLL-ENL translocation. Leveraging this system, we could demonstrate that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells harboring the translocation showed only a transient clonal growth advantage in vitro In contrast, t(11;19)/MLL-ENL-harboring CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells not only showed long-term engraftment in primary immunodeficient recipients, but t(11;19)/MLL-ENL also served as a first hit to initiate a monocytic leukemia-like disease. Interestingly, secondary recipients developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia with incomplete penetrance. These findings indicate that environmental cues not only contribute to the disease phenotype, but also to t(11;19)/MLL-ENL-mediated oncogenic transformation itself. Thus, by investigating the true chromosomal t(11;19) rearrangement in its natural genomic context, our study emphasizes the importance of environmental cues for the pathogenesis of pediatric leukemias, opening an avenue for novel treatment options.","['Reimer, Jana', 'Knoss, Sabine', 'Labuhn, Maurice', 'Charpentier, Emmanuelle M', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Klusmann, Jan-Henning', 'Heckl, Dirk']","['Reimer J', 'Knoss S', 'Labuhn M', 'Charpentier EM', 'Gohring G', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Klusmann JH', 'Heckl D']",,"['Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, Berlin, Germany.', 'The Laboratory for Molecular Infection Medicine Sweden, Umea University, Sweden.', 'Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Germany.', 'Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Germany Heckl.Dirk@mh-hannover.de Klusmann.Jan-Henning@mh-hannover.', 'Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Germany Heckl.Dirk@mh-hannover.de Klusmann.Jan-Henning@mh-hannover.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170601,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['*CRISPR-Cas Systems', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Translocation, Genetic']",PMC5685230,2017/06/03 06:00,2018/05/08 06:00,['2017/06/03 06:00'],"['2017/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.164046 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.164046 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2017 Sep;102(9):1558-1566. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.164046.

Ultrasensitive detection of minimal residual disease would enable better patient risk stratification and could open opportunities for early therapeutic intervention. Herein we apply single molecule molecular inversion probe capture, a technology combining multiplexed targeted sequencing with error correction schemes based on molecular barcoding, in order to detect mutations identifying minimal residual disease with ultrasensitive and quantitative precision. We designed a single molecule molecular inversion probe capture panel spanning >50 kb and targeting 32 factors relevant to acute myeloid leukemia pathogenesis. We demonstrate linearity and quantitative precision over 100-fold relative abundance of mutant cells (1 in 100 to 1 in 1,500), with estimated error rates approaching 1 in 1,200 base pairs sequenced and maximum theoretical limits of detection exceeding 1 in 60,000 mutant alleles. In 3 of 4 longitudinally collected specimens from patients with acute myeloid leukemia, we find that single molecule molecular inversion probe capture detects somatic mutations identifying minimal residual disease at substantially earlier time points and with greater sensitivity than clinical diagnostic approaches used as current standard of care (flow cytometry and conventional molecular diagnosis), and identifies persisting neoplastic cells during clinical remission. In 2 patients, single molecule molecular inversion probe capture detected heterogeneous, subclonal acute myeloid leukemia populations carrying distinct mutational signatures. Single molecule molecular inversion probe technology uniquely couples scalable target enrichment with sequence read error correction, providing an integrated, ultrasensitive approach for detecting minimal residual disease identifying mutations.","['Waalkes, Adam', 'Penewit, Kelsi', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Wu, David', 'Salipante, Stephen J']","['Waalkes A', 'Penewit K', 'Wood BL', 'Wu D', 'Salipante SJ']",,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA stevesal@uw.edu.']",['eng'],['R33 CA192980/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20170601,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Molecular Probes)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Probes/*chemistry', 'Neoplasm, Residual/blood/diagnosis']",PMC5685235,2017/06/03 06:00,2018/05/08 06:00,['2017/06/03 06:00'],"['2017/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.169136 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.169136 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2017 Sep;102(9):1549-1557. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.169136.

Previously we have reported that the transcriptional regulator megakaryocytic leukemia 1 (MKL1) plays a role programming cellular inflammatory response by modulating NF-kappaB activity. Here we report that MKL1 was acetylated in vivo and pro-inflammatory stimuli (TNF-alpha and LPS) augmented MKL1 acetylation accompanying increased MKL1 binding to NF-kappaB target promoters. Further analysis revealed that the lysine acetyltransferase PCAF mediated MKL1 acetylation: TNF-alpha and LPS promoted the interaction between MKL1 and PCAF whereas depletion of PCAF abrogated the induction of MKL1 acetylation by TNF-alpha and LPS. Acetylation of MKL1 was necessary for MKL1 to activate the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes because mutation of four conserved lysine residues in MKL1 attenuated its capacity as a trans-activator of NF-kappaB target genes. Mechanistically, MKL1 acetylation served to promote MKL1 nuclear enrichment, to enhance the MKL1-NF-kappaB interaction, and to stabilize the binding of MKL1 on target promoters. In conclusion, our data unveil an important pathway that contributes to the transcriptional regulation of inflammatory response.","['Yu, Liming', 'Li, Zilong', 'Fang, Mingming', 'Xu, Yong']","['Yu L', 'Li Z', 'Fang M', 'Xu Y']",,"['Department of Pathophysiology, Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease and Molecular Intervention, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease and Molecular Intervention, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Nursing, Jiangsu Jiankang Vocational College, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease and Molecular Intervention, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.

The disease course is often heterogeneous and management can range from observation alone through to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. As of 2017, the only approved medication for MF remains the JAK Inhibitor (JAKi), ruxolitinib (Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland; Incyte, Wilmington, Detroit, USA) although several others have reached advanced stages of clinical trials. Areas covered: In this review, we focus on the management of both common and uncommon side effects arising from the use of currently approved and clinical trial JAKi. Most of the discussion concerns ruxolitinib although we also cover both pacritinib (CTI BioPharma) and momelotinib (Gilead Sciences, Foster City, California) which have been in recent large, multinational phase III trials. The various approaches to management of JAKi-related side effects are discussed - with particular emphasis to anaemia, thrombocytopaenia and infection risk. Expert commentary: JAK inhibitors are effective in many individuals with MF and have revolutionized the current treatment paradigm. The side effect profile, in the most, is predictable and manageable with high degrees of clinical surveillance and dose modifications.","['Saeed, Iram', 'McLornan, Donal', 'Harrison, Claire N']","['Saeed I', 'McLornan D', 'Harrison CN']",,"[""a Department of Haematological Medicine , King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust , London , UK."", ""a Department of Haematological Medicine , King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust , London , UK."", ""b Department of Haematology , Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust , London , UK."", ""a Department of Haematological Medicine , King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust , London , UK.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170619,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,"['0', '(11-(2-pyrrolidin-1-ylethoxy)-14,19-dioxa-5,7,26-triazatetracyclo(19.3.1.1(2,6).1', '(8,12))heptacosa-1(25),2(26),3,5,8,10,12(27),16,21,23-decaene)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Bridged-Ring Compounds)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '6O01GMS00P', '(N-(cyanomethyl)-4-(2-((4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl)amino)-4-pyrimidinyl)benzamide)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Anemia/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Benzamides/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bridged-Ring Compounds/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Infections/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Janus Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Nitriles', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*complications/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Thrombocytopenia/diagnosis/etiology/therapy']",,2017/06/03 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2017/06/03 06:00'],"['2017/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2017.1337507 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2017 Jul;10(7):617-625. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2017.1337507.

However, not many studies have documented morphological changes in bone marrow biopsies produced during Imatinib therapy with reference to myelofibrosis. AIM: To document the morphological changes produced in the bone marrow during Imatinib therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This longitudinal study followed up 75 Philadelphia Chromosome Positive Chronic Myeloid Leukemia with chronic phase(Ph+ CML- CP) patients sequentially, receiving 400-600mg Imatinib over a period of 12 or more months. Haematologic parameters were measured at admission, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 or more months. Morphologic changes in bone marrow aspirate and biopsy were evaluated at admission, 6 months and >/=12 months of treatment in accordance with National Comprehensive Cancer Network(NCCN) guidelines. RESULTS: Complete Haematologic Response (CHR) was seen in 47.1%, 80%, 85.4%, 90.4% at >/=1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months respectively after therapy. It was noted that patients not showing CHR by 3 months were less likely to show CHR at 6 months and beyond. Bone marrow aspirates and biopsies showed reduction in cellularity and myeloid precursors with regeneration of erythroid precursors in 70-83% at >/=12 months. A significant decrease in myelofibrosis (p-value< 0.04) was noted as early as 6 months. Mild to moderate hypoplasia was noted in 31.8% of biopsies within 6 months. Pseudo gaucher cells and benign lymphoid nodules were also seen. CONCLUSION: Sequential analysis showed that Imatinib reduced the grade of myelofibrosis significantly (p-value< 0.04). It also prevented development of myelofibrosis in patients who did not have it at presentation. Hence Imatinib is effective when used early in the course of CML-CP.","['Narang, Neha Chopra', 'Rusia, Usha', 'Sikka, Meera', 'Kotru, Mrinalini']","['Narang NC', 'Rusia U', 'Sikka M', 'Kotru M']",,"['Senior Resident, Department of Pathology, University College of Medical Sciences & Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Dilshad Garden, Shahadra, Delhi, India.', 'Professor, Department of Pathology, University College of Medical Sciences & Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Dilshad Garden, Shahadra, Delhi, India.', 'Director Professor and Head, Department of Pathology, University College of Medical Sciences & Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Dilshad Garden, Shahadra, Delhi, India.', 'Professor, DM Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, University College of Medical Sciences & Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Dilshad Garden, Shahadra, Delhi, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170401,India,J Clin Diagn Res,Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR,101488993,,,,PMC5449791,2017/06/03 06:00,2017/06/03 06:01,['2017/06/03 06:00'],"['2016/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7860/JCDR/2017/25173.9650 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Diagn Res. 2017 Apr;11(4):EC25-EC29. doi: 10.7860/JCDR/2017/25173.9650.

Occupational histories for cases and controls were obtained from census records in 1960, 1970, 1980/1981, and 1990. Exposure to selected solvents was estimated by using the NOCCA job-exposure matrix (NOCCA-JEM). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated by using conditional logistic regression models. Overall, nonsignificant CLL risk elevations were observed for methylene chloride, perchloroethylene, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane. Compared to unexposed, significantly increased risks were observed for cumulative perchloroethylene exposure </=13.3 ppm-years (OR = 1.85, 95% CI 1.16-2.96) and average life-time perchloroethylene exposure </=2.5 ppm (1.61, 95% CI 1.01-2.56) among women, and cumulative methylene chloride exposure </=12.5 ppm-years (OR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.01-1.41) and 12.5-74.8 ppm-years (OR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.01-1.51) among men in an analysis with 5 years lag-time, though without dose-response pattern. Decreased CLL risk was observed for aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbon solvents and toluene. This study did not support associations for solvent exposure and CLL. Observed weak associations for methylene chloride, perchloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane exposures, aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbons and toluene were not consistent across sexes, and showed no gradient with amount of exposure.","['Talibov, Madar', 'Auvinen, Anssi', 'Weiderpass, Elisabete', 'Hansen, Johnni', 'Martinsen, Jan-Ivar', 'Kjaerheim, Kristina', 'Tryggvadottir, Laufey', 'Pukkala, Eero']","['Talibov M', 'Auvinen A', 'Weiderpass E', 'Hansen J', 'Martinsen JI', 'Kjaerheim K', 'Tryggvadottir L', 'Pukkala E']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6548-358X'],"['Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland.', 'Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland.', 'Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Research, Cancer Registry of Norway, Institute of Population-Based Cancer Research, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Community Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Tromso, The Arctic University of Norway, Tromso, Norway.', 'Genetic Epidemiology Group, Folkhalsan Research Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'The Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Cancer Registry of Norway, Oslo, Norway.', 'Cancer Registry of Norway, Oslo, Norway.', 'Icelandic Cancer Registry, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland.', 'Finnish Cancer Registry, Institute for Statistical and Epidemiological Cancer Research, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170615,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated)', '0 (Trichloroethanes)', '113C650IR1 (1,1,1-trichloroethane)', '588X2YUY0A (Methylene Chloride)', 'TJ904HH8SN (Tetrachloroethylene)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated/*poisoning', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Methylene Chloride/poisoning', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries/epidemiology', 'Tetrachloroethylene/poisoning', 'Trichloroethanes/poisoning']",,2017/06/02 06:00,2017/10/03 06:00,['2017/06/02 06:00'],"['2017/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.30814 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2017 Sep 15;141(6):1140-1147. doi: 10.1002/ijc.30814.

The prevailing concern about selective reporting bias is the possibility of results being modified towards specific conclusions. In this study, we evaluate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in hematology journals, a group in which selective outcome reporting has not yet been explored. METHODS: Our primary goal was to examine discrepancies between the reported primary and secondary outcomes in registered and published RCTs concerning hematological malignancies reported in hematology journals with a high impact factor. The secondary goals were to address whether outcome reporting discrepancies favored statistically significant outcomes, whether a pattern existed between the funding source and likelihood of outcome reporting bias, and whether temporal trends were present in outcome reporting bias. For trials with major outcome discrepancies, we contacted trialists to determine reasons for these discrepancies. Trials published between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2015 in Blood; British Journal of Haematology; American Journal of Hematology; Leukemia; and Haematologica were included. RESULTS: Of 499 RCTs screened, 109 RCTs were included. Our analysis revealed 118 major discrepancies and 629 total discrepancies. Among the 118 discrepancies, 30 (25.4%) primary outcomes were demoted, 47 (39.8%) primary outcomes were omitted, and 30 (25.4%) primary outcomes were added. Three (2.5%) secondary outcomes were upgraded to a primary outcome. The timing of assessment for a primary outcome changed eight (6.8%) times. Thirty-one major discrepancies were published with a P-value and twenty-five (80.6%) favored statistical significance. A majority of authors whom we contacted cited a pre-planned subgroup analysis as a reason for outcome changes. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that outcome changes occur frequently in hematology trials. Because RCTs ultimately underpin clinical judgment and guide policy implementation, selective reporting could pose a threat to medical decision making.","['Wayant, Cole', 'Scheckel, Caleb', 'Hicks, Chandler', 'Nissen, Timothy', 'Leduc, Linda', 'Som, Mousumi', 'Vassar, Matt']","['Wayant C', 'Scheckel C', 'Hicks C', 'Nissen T', 'Leduc L', 'Som M', 'Vassar M']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8829-8179'],"['Department of Institutional Research, Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences, Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States of America.', 'Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona, United States of America.', 'Department of Institutional Research, Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences, Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States of America.', 'Department of Institutional Research, Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences, Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States of America.', 'Internal Medicine, Oklahoma State University Medical Center, Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States of America.', 'Internal Medicine, Oklahoma State University Medical Center, Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States of America.', 'Department of Institutional Research, Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences, Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States of America.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20170601,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['*Hematology', 'Humans', '*Publication Bias', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",PMC5453439,2017/06/02 06:00,2017/09/28 06:00,['2017/06/02 06:00'],"['2017/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0178379 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-03801 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Jun 1;12(6):e0178379. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0178379. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Growing clinical experience in the neurology of transplantation has led to appreciation of the diverse clinical and radiographic spectrum of calcineurin inhibitor-related posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Novel autoimmune phenomena illustrate the delicate balance between adequate immunosuppression and necessary host inflammatory defenses that can lead to organ rejection. The spectrum of infectious complications has changed with the evolution of new conditioning regimens. SUMMARY: Neurologic problems remain an important source of morbidity and mortality, both in the immediate transplantation period and for years after the procedure. As perioperative management has reduced the incidence of acute infections, graft versus host disease, and organ rejection, problems of long-term survivors require neurologic input into multidisciplinary management of chronic neurologic conditions impacting quality of life.","['Pruitt, Amy A']",['Pruitt AA'],,,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Continuum (Minneap Minn),"Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.)",9509333,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease/complications/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Liver Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Quality of Life']",,2017/06/02 06:00,2018/06/29 06:00,['2017/06/02 06:00'],"['2017/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1212/CON.0000000000000473 [doi]', '00132979-201706000-00014 [pii]']",ppublish,"Continuum (Minneap Minn). 2017 Jun;23(3, Neurology of Systemic Disease):802-821. doi: 10.1212/CON.0000000000000473.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While leptomeningeal metastasis is the most common complication of lymphoma and leukemia and peripheral neuropathy is the most common complication of paraproteinemic disorders, clinicians need to be familiar with the diverse neurologic complications of these disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Lymphomatous nervous system involvement can be difficult to diagnose, especially when it is the presenting symptom. CSF cytology and flow cytometry, as well as the imaging pattern, assist in diagnosis. Neurologic complications are less common in Hodgkin lymphoma; however, some unique paraneoplastic syndromes are associated with Hodgkin lymphoma, including primary central nervous system angiitis, limbic encephalitis, and cerebellar degeneration. Recent reports suggest that anti-metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) antibodies are associated with limbic encephalitis and that anti-Tr antibodies are associated with cerebellar degeneration in Hodgkin lymphoma. Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal plasma cell disorder, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome is often misdiagnosed as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). A lambda protein, thrombocytosis, and elevated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can all be helpful clues in diagnosis. Early recognition is important, as the neuropathy responds to radiation therapy or chemotherapy. SUMMARY: Neurologic involvement can occur throughout the disease course in lymphoma and leukemia, including at presentation, with systemic progression, and at relapse. In paraproteinemias, the peripheral neuropathy phenotype, monoclonal protein type, and associated autonomic and systemic features aid in identification of an underlying plasma cell disorder.","['Mauermann, Michelle L']",['Mauermann ML'],,,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Continuum (Minneap Minn),"Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.)",9509333,,IM,"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Lymphoma/complications/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Nervous System Diseases/complications/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Paraproteinemias/complications/*diagnosis/therapy']",,2017/06/02 06:00,2018/06/29 06:00,['2017/06/02 06:00'],"['2017/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1212/CON.0000000000000468 [doi]', '00132979-201706000-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,"Continuum (Minneap Minn). 2017 Jun;23(3, Neurology of Systemic Disease):669-690. doi: 10.1212/CON.0000000000000468.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the first adult AML cohort in which the influence of these SNPs in cytarabine efficacy and toxicity was analyzed. Six of polymorphisms with clinical significance in the previous study [rs12036333, rs10758713, rs9883101, rs6550826, IRX2: rs2897047, mutated in colorectal cancers (MCC): rs7729269] were analyzed in a cohort of 225 adult patients at initial diagnosis of AML treated with an induction scheme of idarubicin plus cytarabine. The variant alleles of rs12036333 and rs10758713 confirmed the previous associations with lower survival rates. The minor alleles of rs9883101 and rs6550826 were also related to lower survival, in concordance with higher cytarabine-induced cytotoxicity observed in pediatric patients. However, discordant findings between AML adult and pediatric population were observed with IRX2 rs2897047, showing higher survival in heterozygous genotype carriers. The heterozygous genotype of MCC rs7729269 was associated with higher cytarabine-induced toxicities (renal, hepatic, lung, skin toxicities), whereas lower time to thrombocytopenia recovery was associated with the MCC rs7729269 minor allele. This study confirms the influence in survival rates of these polymorphisms in an adult AML population. Novel associations between MCC SNPs and cytarabine toxicities were reported and should be validated in prospective studies involving larger groups of patients.","['Megias-Vericat, Juan E', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Herrero, Maria J', 'Moscardo, Federico', 'Boso, Virginia', 'Martinez-Cuadron, David', 'Poveda, Jose L', 'Sanz, Miguel A', 'Alino, Salvador F']","['Megias-Vericat JE', 'Montesinos P', 'Herrero MJ', 'Moscardo F', 'Boso V', 'Martinez-Cuadron D', 'Poveda JL', 'Sanz MA', 'Alino SF']",,"['aPharmacogenetics Unit, Institute for Health Research La Fe and Drug Clinical Area bDepartment of Pharmacy, Drug Clinical Area cDepartment of Hematology dClinical Pharmacology Unit, Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe eDepartment of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad de Valencia, Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Pharmacogenet Genomics,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,101231005,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cytarabine/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', '*Induction Chemotherapy', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,2017/06/02 06:00,2018/01/09 06:00,['2017/06/02 06:00'],"['2017/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/09 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/FPC.0000000000000286 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacogenet Genomics. 2017 Jul;27(7):270-274. doi: 10.1097/FPC.0000000000000286.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pathway Enrichment, Sub-Network Enrichment, and Gene-Gene Interaction analysis were conducted to study the pathogenic profile of the candidate genes, with four metrics proposed and validated for each gene. By using our approach, a scalable CLL genetic database was developed including CLL-related genes, pathways, diseases and information of supporting references. The CLL case/control classification supported the effectiveness of the four proposed metrics, which successfully identified nine well-studied CLL genes (i.e., TNF, BCL2, TP53, VEGFA, P2RX7, AKT1, SYK, IL4, and MDM2) and highlighted two newly reported CLL genes (i.e., PDGFRA and CSF1R).

28570036,,Publisher,,,,,,1993,SAMD9L Ataxia-Pancytopenia Syndrome,,,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: SAMD9L ataxia-pancytopenia (ATXPC) syndrome is characterized by cerebellar ataxia, variable hematologic cytopenias, and predisposition to marrow failure, myelodysplasia, and myeloid leukemia, sometimes associated with monosomy 7. The onset of hematologic abnormalities has been reported as early as age three months. The cytopenias in all cell lineages range from mild to very severe. Onset of neurologic impairment is variable. Nystagmus, dysmetria, increased deep tendon reflexes, and clonus are common. Gait impairment and other neurologic abnormalities are slowly progressive. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of SAMD9L-ATXPC syndrome is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous germline gain-of-abnormal-function pathogenic variant in SAMD9L on molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Red cell or platelet transfusions as needed for cytopenias; evaluation and treatment for additional unrelated causes of anemia; standard treatment for neutropenia; bone marrow transplantation and/or chemotherapy for myelodysplasia and leukemia; consideration of riluzole to improve ataxia symptoms; supportive management for ataxia to prevent falls and injury; speech and language therapy with consideration of alternative communication methods, as needed for dysarthria; modify food consistency to reduce aspiration risk for those with dysphagia; nutrition assessment with consideration of nutritional and vitamin supplementation to meet dietary needs in those with poor weight gain or weight loss. Surveillance: Annual complete blood count with more frequent monitoring for any identified cytopenia; prompt evaluation for clinical signs or symptoms of cytopenia; annual evaluation of gait, coordination, and progression of ataxia; assessment for alternative communication method, speech therapy, and signs and symptoms of aspiration risk as per symptom progression. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, anticoagulants, and thrombolytic agents are contraindicated if thrombocytopenia is present and should be used with caution given the fluctuating nature of the cytopenias; avoid alcohol and medications that cause sedation, which can increase problems with gait and coordination. Pregnancy management: Anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia may increase the risk of pregnancy complications. GENETIC COUNSELING: SAMD9L-ATXPC syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Each child of an individual with SAMD9L-ATXPC syndrome has a 50% chance of inheriting the SAMD9L pathogenic variant; intrafamilial clinical variability has been observed. Once the SAMD9L pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk for SAMD9L-ATXPC syndrome and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.","['Raskind, Wendy H', 'Chen, Dong-Hui', 'Bird, Thomas']","['Raskind WH', 'Chen DH', 'Bird T']",,,['eng'],['HHSN276201400262U/NLM NIH HHS/United States'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Seattle (WA),,,,,,,,2021/02/04 06:01,2021/02/04 06:01,,,['NBK435692 [bookaccession]'],,,['NLM'],"['SAMD9L-ATXPC Syndrome', 'SAMD9L-ATXPC Syndrome', 'Sterile alpha motif domain-containing protein 9-like', 'SAMD9L', 'SAMD9L Ataxia-Pancytopenia Syndrome']",,"['Copyright (c) 1993-2022, University of Washington, Seattle.

Here, we report the role of miR-128a/Lin28A axis in blocking cell differentiation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by abnormally controlled proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells accompanied by partial or total inability to undergo terminal differentiation. First, we found Lin28A underexpressed in blast cells from AML patients and AML cell lines as compared with CD34+ normal precursors. In vitro transfection of Lin28A in NPM1-mutated OCI-AML3 cell line significantly triggered cell-cycle arrest and myeloid differentiation, with increased expression of macrophage associate genes (EGR2, ZFP36 and ANXA1). Furthermore, miR-128a, a negative regulator of Lin28A, was found overexpressed in AML cells compared with normal precursors, especially in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and in 'AML with maturation' (according to 2016 WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia). Its forced overexpression by lentiviral infection in OCI-AML3 downregulated Lin28A with ensuing repression of macrophage-oriented differentiation. Finally, knockdown of miR-128a in OCI-AML3 and in APL/AML leukemic cells (by transfection and lentiviral infection, respectively) induced myeloid cell differentiation and increased expression of Lin28A, EGR2, ZFP36 and ANXA1, reverting myeloid differentiation blockage. In conclusion, our findings revealed a new mechanism for AML differentiation blockage, suggesting new strategies for AML therapy based upon miR-128a inhibition.","['De Luca, Luciana', 'Trino, Stefania', 'Laurenzana, Ilaria', 'Tagliaferri, Daniela', 'Falco, Geppino', 'Grieco, Vitina', 'Bianchino, Gabriella', 'Nozza, Filomena', 'Campia, Valentina', ""D'Alessio, Francesca"", 'La Rocca, Francesco', 'Caivano, Antonella', 'Villani, Oreste', 'Cilloni, Daniela', 'Musto, Pellegrino', 'Del Vecchio, Luigi']","['De Luca L', 'Trino S', 'Laurenzana I', 'Tagliaferri D', 'Falco G', 'Grieco V', 'Bianchino G', 'Nozza F', 'Campia V', ""D'Alessio F"", 'La Rocca F', 'Caivano A', 'Villani O', 'Cilloni D', 'Musto P', 'Del Vecchio L']",,"['Laboratory of Preclinical and Translational Research, IRCCS - Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata (CROB), Rionero in Vulture 85028, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Preclinical and Translational Research, IRCCS - Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata (CROB), Rionero in Vulture 85028, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Preclinical and Translational Research, IRCCS - Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata (CROB), Rionero in Vulture 85028, Italy.', ""Biogem Scarl, Istituto di Ricerche Genetiche 'Gaetano Salvatore', Ariano Irpino 83031, Italy."", ""Biogem Scarl, Istituto di Ricerche Genetiche 'Gaetano Salvatore', Ariano Irpino 83031, Italy."", 'Laboratory of Clinical Research and Advanced Diagnostics, IRCCS - Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata (CROB), Rionero in Vulture 85028, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Research and Advanced Diagnostics, IRCCS - Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata (CROB), Rionero in Vulture 85028, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Research and Advanced Diagnostics, IRCCS - Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata (CROB), Rionero in Vulture 85028, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Orbassano 10043, Italy.', 'CEINGE Biotecnologie Avanzate scarl, Naples 80147, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Preclinical and Translational Research, IRCCS - Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata (CROB), Rionero in Vulture 85028, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Preclinical and Translational Research, IRCCS - Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata (CROB), Rionero in Vulture 85028, Italy.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology, IRCCS - Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata (CROB), Rionero in Vulture 85028, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Orbassano 10043, Italy.', 'Scientific Direction, IRCCS - Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata (CROB), Rionero in Vulture 85028, Italy.', 'CEINGE Biotecnologie Avanzate scarl, Naples 80147, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnologies, University of Naples Federico II, Napoli 80138, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170601,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Annexin A1)', '0 (Antagomirs)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (EGR2 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 2)', '0 (LIN28B protein, human)', '0 (MIRN128 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tristetraprolin)', '0 (ZFP36 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Annexin A1/genetics/metabolism', 'Antagomirs/genetics/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Early Growth Response Protein 2/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Vectors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tristetraprolin/genetics/metabolism']",PMC5520910,2017/06/02 06:00,2018/03/07 06:00,['2017/06/02 06:00'],"['2017/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2017253 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2017.253 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2017 Jun 1;8(6):e2849. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2017.253.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Known that CD44 has the specific binding sites for a natural ligand hyaluronan (HA), we investigated biological effects of HA with different molecular sizes on MLL+ALL cell lines, and found that the addition of ultra-low-molecular-weight (ULMW)-HA strongly suppressed their thymidine uptakes. The MLL+ALL cell line lacking surface CD44 expression established by genome editing showed no suppression of thymidine uptake. Surface CD44-high B-precursor ALL cell lines other than MLL+, but not T-ALL cell lines, were also suppressed in their thymidine uptakes. The inhibition of thymidine uptakes was because of induction of cell death, but dead cells lacked features of apoptosis on cytospin smears and flow cytometric analysis. The cell death was neither blocked by pan-caspase inhibitor nor autophagy inhibitor, but was completely blocked by necrosis inhibitor necrostatin-1. Necrotic cell death was further supported by a marked release of a high-mobility protein group B1 and morphological changes on transmission electron microscopy. Elevation of intracellular reactive oxygen species production suggested a role for inducing this necrotic cell death. ULMW-HA-triggered cell death was similarly demonstrated in surface CD44-high primary B-precursor leukemia cells. Assuming that ULMW-HA is abundantly secreted at the site of infection and inflammation, this study sheds light on understanding the mechanism of a transient inflammation-associated remission of leukemia. Further, the CD44-targeting may become an effective approach in future for the treatment of refractory B-precursor ALL by its capability of predominantly eradicating CD44-high leukemia-initiating cells.","['Kasai, Shin', 'Furuichi, Yoshiyuki', 'Ando, Norie', 'Kagami, Keiko', 'Abe, Masako', 'Nakane, Takaya', 'Goi, Kumiko', 'Inukai, Takeshi', 'Saitoh, Sei', 'Ohno, Shinichi', 'Okazaki, Shogo', 'Nagano, Osamu', 'Saya, Hideyuki', 'Sugita, Kanji']","['Kasai S', 'Furuichi Y', 'Ando N', 'Kagami K', 'Abe M', 'Nakane T', 'Goi K', 'Inukai T', 'Saitoh S', 'Ohno S', 'Okazaki S', 'Nagano O', 'Saya H', 'Sugita K']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6610-1902'],"['Departments of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Departments of Anatomy and Molecular Histology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Departments of Anatomy and Molecular Histology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170601,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (CD44 protein, human)', '0 (HMGB1 Protein)', '0 (HMGB1 protein, human)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (necrostatin-1)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'HMGB1 Protein/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hyaluronic Acid/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Molecular Weight', 'Necrosis/chemically induced/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/agonists/metabolism', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",PMC5520907,2017/06/02 06:00,2018/03/07 06:00,['2017/06/02 06:00'],"['2017/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2017249 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2017.249 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2017 Jun 1;8(6):e2857. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2017.249.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we reviewed the medical records of patients younger than 18 yr with newly diagnosed ALL in our hospitals from 2002 to 2013. According to the nationwide protocol (TPOG-ALL-2002), each patient received four courses of HDMTX (2.5 or 5 g/m(2)) during consolidation therapy. HDMTX courses with glutamine therapy were as the glutamine group, and intravenous glutamine (0.4 g/kg/day) was started within 48 h after the initiation of HDMTX for 3 consecutive days. HDMTX courses without glutamine were as the control group. A total of 347 HDMTX courses were administrated in the 96 children with ALL during the study period. The incidence of oral mucositis was significantly lower in the glutamine group than in the control group (3.8% vs. 17.6%; P = 0.004). In the glutamine group, no patients suffered from severe oral mucositis. No severe adverse effects associated with glutamine administration were noted.

Although most successful at detection of squamous lesions, the Pap may also detect metastatic carcinomas, sarcomas, and melanomas. We report two rare cases of myeloid sarcoma (MS) of the uterine cervix identified on screening Pap smears with concurrent confirmatory cervical biopsies. The purpose of our study is to identify and report cytologic features of MS on Pap smears utilizing a liquid-based ThinPrep method, which has not been previously documented in literature. Two Pap smears were identified from the pathology laboratory information system, both with positive cervical biopsy findings of MS. Both women, age 40 and 39, presented with ureteral obstruction, hydronephrosis, and past medical histories significant for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). On imaging, cervical masses were identified, and subsequent work-up with Pap smears and biopsies were performed. Cytologic examination of the ThinPrep Pap smears were negative for squamous intraepithelial lesion. Atypical hematologic cells were seen in the background with irregular nuclear contours, increased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios, variably prominent nucleoli, and variable amounts of agranular cytoplasm. The biopsy confirmed these findings to represent MS. MS is defined as a tumor mass of myeloblasts or immature myeloid cells occurring in an extramedullary site. This rarely involves the female genital tract, about 50 reported cases. Although very rare, MSs in the setting of a history of AML are able to be identified on liquid-based ThinPrep smears.","['Snider, Jessica S', 'Eichel, Yekaterina', 'Caudell, Alisa M', 'Chajewski, Olga S', 'Yang, Jack', 'Lindsey, Kathryn G']","['Snider JS', 'Eichel Y', 'Caudell AM', 'Chajewski OS', 'Yang J', 'Lindsey KG']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9797-4527'],"['Medical University of South Carolina, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Medical University of South Carolina, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Medical University of South Carolina, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Medical University of South Carolina, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Medical University of South Carolina, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Medical University of South Carolina, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Charleston, South Carolina.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20170531,United States,Diagn Cytopathol,Diagnostic cytopathology,8506895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Papanicolaou Test', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*pathology/secondary', 'Vaginal Smears']",,2017/06/02 06:00,2018/05/04 06:00,['2017/06/02 06:00'],"['2017/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/dc.23763 [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Cytopathol. 2017 Oct;45(10):953-957. doi: 10.1002/dc.23763.

We observed extensive inter-individual variation in the level of infection (LI) by assessing differences in proviral load in peripheral blood. This phenotypic variation appears to be determined by host genetics variants, especially those located in the BoLA-DRB3 MHCII molecule. We performed an association study using sequencing-based typed BOLA-DRB3 alleles from over 800 Holstein and Holstein x Jersey cows considering LI in vivo and accounting for filial relationships. The DBR3*0902 allele was associated with a low level of infection (LLI) (<1% of circulating infected B-cells), whereas the DRB3*1001 and DRB3*1201 alleles were related to a high level of infection (HLI). We found evidence that 13 polymorphic positions located in the pockets of the peptide-binding cleft of the BOLA-DRB3 alleles were associated with LI. DRB3*0902 had unique haplotypes for each of the pockets: Ser(13) -Glu(70) -Arg(71) -Glu(74) (pocket 4), Ser(11) -Ser(30) (pocket 6), Glu(28) -Trp(61) -Arg(71) (pocket 7) and Asn(37) -Asp(57) (pocket 9), and all of them were significantly associated with LLI.

Mortality has declined over the last few years, but this impact is apparent only in the young, fit AML population. Outcomes for the elderly remain poor, with less than 20% 5-year overall survival rates. Hence, there is an unmet need to identify treatment strategies to maximize benefit in this age group. RECENT FINDINGS: Elderly AML is a difficult entity to treat due to both disease and patient-related factors. Treatment of this group has a lot of inter-physician and inter-institutional variability. Several objective criteria to assess biological age, impact of co-morbidities, and fitness have been published, which could be utilized to make management decisions. For old and unfit AML patients, a variety of novel therapeutic agents are currently being investigated. Objective analysis of biological age should include assessment of fitness, frailty, and co-morbidities in elderly AML. Future areas of research include development of an objective risk-based approach and its validation in clinical trials, development of novel therapeutic agents, and improvement in supportive care measures.","['Mangaonkar, Abhishek A', 'Patnaik, Mrinal M']","['Mangaonkar AA', 'Patnaik MM']",,"['Department of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st street SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st street SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.

At this age, many patients cannot bear an intensive chemoimmunotherapy like fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR), and therapeutic decisions are commonly complicated by a high burden of accompanying comorbidities. Clinical trials, on the other hand, are mostly designed to include a far healthier and younger trial population, with a median age in most studies well below 70 years, leading to an insufficient reflection of clinical reality. With the introduction of new targeted therapies, treatment of CLL is currently undergoing a profound change. New compounds like ibrutinib or idelalisib have enlarged the therapeutic options in treating CLL. However, so far, these oral medications imply continuous intake by the patient, which will at some point lead to the issue of adherence in most patients. In addition, long-term experiences are largely missing. In this setting, one of the oldest chemoactive substances remains a viable option for many CLL patients and their treating physicians: bendamustine, a nitrogen-mustard derivative, has proven to be a safe and efficient agent for treatment of CLL in the first- and second-line setting. In particular, there is some evidence that the substance is relatively well tolerated in elderly and unfit patients. In this review, we summarize the current data on bendamustine in the treatment of elderly and unfit patients with CLL and aim to provide a concise analysis and outlook on the current and future role of this substance in the era of new targeted agents.","['Al-Sawaf, Othman', 'Cramer, Paula', 'Goede, Valentin', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Pflug, Natali']","['Al-Sawaf O', 'Cramer P', 'Goede V', 'Hallek M', 'Pflug N']",,"['1st Department of Internal Medicine and Centre for Integrated Oncology CIO Koln/Bonn, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany German CLL Study Group (GCLLSG), Cologne, Germany.', '1st Department of Internal Medicine and Centre for Integrated Oncology CIO Koln/Bonn, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany German CLL Study Group (GCLLSG), Cologne, Germany.', 'German CLL Study Group (GCLLSG), Cologne, Germany.', '1st Department of Internal Medicine and Centre for Integrated Oncology CIO Koln/Bonn, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany German CLL Study Group (GCLLSG), Cologne, Germany.', 'Klinik I fur Innere Medizin, Kerpener Strasse 62, 50937 Koln, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170330,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,,PMC5424860,2017/06/02 06:00,2017/06/02 06:01,['2017/06/02 06:00'],"['2017/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620717699365 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620717699365 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2017 Jun;8(6):197-205. doi: 10.1177/2040620717699365.

Although induction therapy leads to complete remission (CR) for most patients, refractoriness to chemotherapy or relapse after initial response is associated with poor outcomes. The 1-year survival rates after first relapse have been reported at 29%, declining to 11% at 5 years. Prognosis is particularly poor among older patients whose higher prevalence of unfavorable cytogenetics and high frequency of comorbidities diminish their ability to tolerate intensive chemotherapy. There is no standard of care for relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML, and no new therapies have shown consistently superior outcomes in this setting in over two decades. Vosaroxin is an anticancer quinolone derivative (AQD) that was evaluated in combination with cytarabine for the treatment of R/R AML in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III VALOR study (n = 711). Compared with placebo/cytarabine, the vosaroxin/cytarabine regimen demonstrated favorable CR rates and survival in patients 60 years of age, with toxicities similar to other AML regimens. Here we review outcomes of recent studies of commonly used chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of R/R AML and evaluate the results of the VALOR trial in the context of the current treatment landscape.","['Sedov, Valeriy', 'Stuart, Robert K']","['Sedov V', 'Stuart RK']",,"['Medical University of South Carolina, 173 Ashley Avenue, Basic Science Building, Suite 102, Charleston, SC 29425-6350, USA.', 'Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170421,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,,PMC5424861,2017/06/02 06:00,2017/06/02 06:01,['2017/06/02 06:00'],"['2016/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620717703012 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620717703012 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2017 Jun;8(6):185-195. doi: 10.1177/2040620717703012.

It is highly expressed in more than 80% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, both in bone marrow (BM) and in peripheral blood (PB), and it is used as a powerful and independent marker of minimal residual disease (MRD); we have determined the expression levels of the WT1 by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) in PB and BM in 126 newly diagnosed AML patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was done in molecular pathology and cancer research center from April 2014 to June 2015, RQ-PCR method was used to determine the WT1 gene expression in BM and/or PB samples from 126 patients of AML, we cloned both WT1 and ABL genes for creating a standard curve, and we calculate copy number of WT1 genes in patients. RESULTS: A total of 126 AML patients consist of 70 males (55.6%) and 56 females (44.4%), with a median age of 26 years; 104 (81%) patients out of 126 show overexpression of WT1 gene. We also concomitant monitoring of fusion transcripts (PML RARa, AML1-ETO, MLL-MLL, CBFb-MYH11, or DEK-CAN) in our patients, the AML1-ETO group showing remarkably low levels of WT1 compared with other fusion transcript and the CBFB-MYH11 showing high levels of WT1. CONCLUSION: We conclude that WT1 expression by RQ-PCR in AML patients may be employed as an independent tool to detect MRD in the majority of normal karyotype AML patients.","['Ayatollahi, Hossein', 'Sadeghian, Mohammad Hadi', 'Naderi, Mahmood', 'Jafarian, Amir Hossein', 'Shams, Seyyede Fatemeh', 'Motamedirad, Neda', 'Sheikhi, Maryam', 'Bahrami, Afsane', 'Shakeri, Sepideh']","['Ayatollahi H', 'Sadeghian MH', 'Naderi M', 'Jafarian AH', 'Shams SF', 'Motamedirad N', 'Sheikhi M', 'Bahrami A', 'Shakeri S']",,"['Department of Hematopathology and Blood Banking, Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Hematopathology and Blood Banking, Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Liver and Pancreatobiliary Diseases Research Center, Digestive Disease Research Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematopathology and Blood Banking, Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Modern Sciences and Technologies, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170426,India,J Res Med Sci,Journal of research in medical sciences : the official journal of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences,101235599,,,,PMC5426094,2017/06/02 06:00,2017/06/02 06:01,['2017/06/02 06:00'],"['2016/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/07 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/jrms.JRMS_448_16 [doi]', 'JRMS-22-54 [pii]']",epublish,J Res Med Sci. 2017 Apr 26;22:54. doi: 10.4103/jrms.JRMS_448_16. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Wilms tumor gene', 'minimal residual disease', 'real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction']",['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that alternative splicing of the negative regulator of NF-kappaB and tumor suppressor gene CYLD regulates the pool of CD5(+) B cells through sustained canonical NF-kappaB signaling. Reinforced canonical NF-kappaB activity leads to the development of B1 cell-associated tumor formation in aging mice by promoting survival and proliferation of CD5(+) B cells, highly reminiscent of human B-CLL. We show that a substantial number of CLL patient samples express sCYLD, strongly implicating a role for it in human B-CLL. We propose that our new CLL-like mouse model represents an appropriate tool for studying ubiquitination-driven canonical NF-kappaB activation in CLL.

GATA transcription factors are zinc finger DNA-binding proteins that play crucial roles in various biological processes, including hematopoiesis. Among GATA family proteins, GATA-1, GATA-2, and GATA-3 are essential for hematopoiesis. GATA-1 functions to promote development of erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, eosinophils, and mast cells. Mutations in GATA-1 are associated with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), congenital erythroid hypoplasia (Diamond-Blackfan anemia; DBA), and X-linked anemia and/or thrombocytopenia. Conversely, GATA-2 functions early in hematopoiesis and is required for maintenance and expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and/or multipotent progenitors. GATA-2 mutations are associated with immunodeficiency, lymphedema, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and leukemia. Furthermore, decreased GATA-2 expression may contribute to the pathophysiology of aplastic anemia. GATA-3 has an important role in T cell development, and has been suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology of acute lymphoblastic leukemias.

These disorders are phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous. Monogenic causes of CAKUT in humans and mice have been identified. However, despite high-throughput sequencing studies, the cause of the disease remains unknown in most patients, and several studies support more complex inheritance and the role of environmental factors and/or epigenetics in the pathophysiology of CAKUT. Here, we report the targeted exome sequencing of 330 genes, including genes known to be involved in CAKUT and candidate genes, in a cohort of 204 unrelated patients with CAKUT; 45% of the patients were severe fetal cases. We identified pathogenic mutations in 36 of 204 (17.6%) patients. These mutations included five de novo heterozygous loss of function mutations/deletions in the PBX homeobox 1 gene (PBX1), a gene known to have a crucial role in kidney development. In contrast, the frequency of SOX17 and DSTYK variants recently reported as pathogenic in CAKUT did not indicate causality. These findings suggest that PBX1 is involved in monogenic CAKUT in humans and call into question the role of some gene variants recently reported as pathogenic in CAKUT. Targeted exome sequencing also proved to be an efficient and cost-effective strategy to identify pathogenic mutations and deletions in known CAKUT genes.","['Heidet, Laurence', 'Moriniere, Vincent', 'Henry, Charline', 'De Tomasi, Lara', 'Reilly, Madeline Louise', 'Humbert, Camille', 'Alibeu, Olivier', 'Fourrage, Cecile', 'Bole-Feysot, Christine', 'Nitschke, Patrick', 'Tores, Frederic', 'Bras, Marc', 'Jeanpierre, Marc', 'Pietrement, Christine', 'Gaillard, Dominique', 'Gonzales, Marie', 'Novo, Robert', 'Schaefer, Elise', 'Roume, Joelle', 'Martinovic, Jelena', 'Malan, Valerie', 'Salomon, Remi', 'Saunier, Sophie', 'Antignac, Corinne', 'Jeanpierre, Cecile']","['Heidet L', 'Moriniere V', 'Henry C', 'De Tomasi L', 'Reilly ML', 'Humbert C', 'Alibeu O', 'Fourrage C', 'Bole-Feysot C', 'Nitschke P', 'Tores F', 'Bras M', 'Jeanpierre M', 'Pietrement C', 'Gaillard D', 'Gonzales M', 'Novo R', 'Schaefer E', 'Roume J', 'Martinovic J', 'Malan V', 'Salomon R', 'Saunier S', 'Antignac C', 'Jeanpierre C']",,"[""Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, Centre de reference des Maladies Renales Hereditaires de l'Enfant et de l'Adulte, Paris, France."", 'Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, Service de Nephrologie Pediatrique.', ""Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, Centre de reference des Maladies Renales Hereditaires de l'Enfant et de l'Adulte, Paris, France."", 'Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, Departement de Genetique, and.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale Unite Mixte de Recherche 1163, Laboratory of Hereditary Kidney Diseases.', 'Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cite University, Paris, France.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale Unite Mixte de Recherche 1163, Laboratory of Hereditary Kidney Diseases.', 'Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cite University, Paris, France.', 'Paris Diderot University, Paris, France.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale Unite Mixte de Recherche 1163, Laboratory of Hereditary Kidney Diseases.', 'Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cite University, Paris, France.', 'Paris Diderot University, Paris, France.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale Unite Mixte de Recherche 1163, Laboratory of Hereditary Kidney Diseases.', 'Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cite University, Paris, France.', 'Genomic Platform, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale Unite Mixte de Recherche 1163, Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cite University, and.', 'Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, Departement de Genetique, and.', 'Bioinformatic Plateform, Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cite University, Imagine Institute, Paris, France.', 'Genomic Platform, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale Unite Mixte de Recherche 1163, Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cite University, and.', 'Bioinformatic Plateform, Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cite University, Imagine Institute, Paris, France.', 'Bioinformatic Plateform, Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cite University, Imagine Institute, Paris, France.', 'Bioinformatic Plateform, Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cite University, Imagine Institute, Paris, France.', 'Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cite University, Paris, France.', 'Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, Departement de Genetique, Hopital Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Unite de nephrologie pediatrique and.', 'Service de Genetique clinique, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire de Reims, Reims, France.', 'Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, Departement de Genetique Medicale, Hopital Armand Trousseau and Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire de Lille, Hopital Jeanne de Flandre, Service de Nephrologie Pediatrique, Lille, France.', ""Service de Genetique Medicale, Institut de Genetique Medicale d'Alsace, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France."", 'Unite de Genetique Medicale, Centre Hospitalier Intercommunal Poissy, St. Germain en Laye, Poissy, France;

Thus, ongoing clinical trials are testing mTOR inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy in B-ALL. However, the combination of mTOR inhibitors with standard of care chemotherapy drugs has not been studied extensively in high-risk B-ALL subtypes. Therefore, we tested whether mTOR inhibition can augment the efficacy of current chemotherapy agents in Ph(+) and Ph-like B-ALL models. Surprisingly, inhibiting mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) protected B-ALL cells from killing by methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine, two antimetabolite drugs used in maintenance chemotherapy. The cytoprotective effects correlated with decreased cell-cycle progression and were recapitulated using cell-cycle inhibitors, palbociclib or aphidicolin. Dasatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor currently used in Ph(+) patients, inhibits ABL kinase upstream of mTOR. Dasatinib resistance is mainly caused by ABL kinase mutations, but is also observed in a subset of ABL unmutated cases. We identified dasatinib-resistant Ph+ cell lines and patient samples in which dasatinib can effectively reduce ABL kinase activity and mTORC1 signaling without causing cell death. In these cases, dasatinib protected leukemia cells from killing by 6-mercaptopurine. Using xenograft models, we observed that mTOR inhibition or dasatinib increased the numbers of leukemia cells that emerge after cessation of chemotherapy treatment.

We aimed to examine the effects of treatment de-escalation as a prelude to complete cessation, not only in patients with MR4 or greater, but also in those with MMR but not MR4. METHODS: We did this interim analysis of a non-randomised, phase 2 trial at 20 hospitals in the UK. We recruited patients (aged >/=18 years) with chronic myeloid leukaemia in first chronic phase who had received TKI for 3 years or more and were either in stable MR4 (BCR-ABL1:ABL1 ratio <0.01%; MR4 cohort) or in stable MMR (BCR-ABL1:ABL1 ratio consistently <0.1%) but not MR4 (MMR cohort) for 12 months or longer. Participants received half their standard TKI dose (imatinib 200 mg daily, dasatinib 50 mg daily, or nilotinib 200 mg twice daily) for 12 months. Molecular recurrence was defined as loss of MMR (BCR-ABL1:ABL1 ratio >0.1%) on two consecutive samples. The primary endpoint of this interim analysis was the proportion of patients who lost MMR on de-escalation and regained MMR on TKI resumption. Analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01804985. FINDINGS: Between Dec 16, 2013 and April 10, 2015, we enrolled 174 patients into the MMR cohort (n=49) or the MR4 cohort (n=125). During the 12 months of half-dose therapy, 12 patients (7%) had molecular recurrence, all of whom regained MMR within 4 months of full-dose TKI resumption (median time to recovery 77 days). Recurrence was significantly lower in the MR4 cohort (three [2%; 90% CI 0.2-4.8] of 121 evaluable patients) than in the MMR cohort (nine [19%; 90% CI 9.5-28.0] of 48 evaluable patients; hazard ratio 0.12, 90% CI 0.04-0.37; p=0.0007), but was unrelated to previous TKI or TKI therapy duration. Adverse events (eg, lethargy, diarrhoea, rash, and nausea) improved during the first 3 months of de-escalation, though not thereafter. 16 serious adverse events were reported, including one fatality due to worsening pre-existing peripheral arterial occlusive disease in a patient who had received only imatinib. INTERPRETATION: TKI de-escalation is safe for most patients with excellent responses to TKI therapy, and is associated with improvement in symptoms. These findings show that lower TKI doses might maintain responses in these patients, implying that such patients could be unnecessarily overtreated. Studies of more ambitious de-escalation are warranted.

They have an active role in mucosal immune response both mechanically and by interaction with other cells with cytokine release. Defensins are microbicidal peptides that are expressed in various cells and are thought to be effective in the first line defense against pathogens. IL-12 and IL-10, showing proinflamatory and antiinflamatory activities, respectively, are actors of the cellular immunity and limit the infection of the host without causing immunopathology. The aim of this study was to observe the differences in the release of IL-12 and IL-10 and the expression of human beta-defensin-3 (hBD-3) inCaco-2 (human colon epidermal adenocarcinoma cell) and THP-1 (human leukemia monocytic cell) cell lines cultured alone or in co-culture, by the stimulation of Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites either in direct contact with the cells or separated by an insert filter from the cells. Twenty-four hours after the addition of RH strain tachyzoites to the cells, the supernatants were collected from the experiment wells, and commercial ELISA kits (Invitrogen) were used according to the manufacturers instructions to measure IL-12 and IL-10 levels. HBD-3 expression of cells collected from the experiment wells afterfour and 24 hourswere analyzed by using real time PCR. For this procedure, complementary c-DNA was obtained (Transcriptor High Fidelity cDNA Synthesis Kit, Roche Diagnostics, Germany)after the extraction of RNA with a commercial kit (High pure RNA isolation kit, Roche Diagnostics, Germany). IL-12 was higher than IL-10 in all experiment wells. IL-12 was induced more in the co-culture wells where Caco-2 and THP-1 cells were challenged together, than the wells in which the cells infected with T.gondii tachyzoites alone. No differences in respect to cytokine response were observed between the cells with which tachyzoites were in contact and the cells which were separated from the parasites with an insert. In hBD-3 experiments, Caco-2 and THP-1 cells interacted in co-culture wells when infected with tachyzoites and displayed a higher level of hBD-3 expression than the condition when they were infected alone. This study showed that, IL-12 release and hBD-3 expression, which play a role in innate immunity, are greater when various antigens of T.gondii interacted with stimulated mononuclear cell and epithelial cells.","['Aral Akarsu, Gulay', 'Biriken, Derya', 'Karahan, Zeynep Ceren']","['Aral Akarsu G', 'Biriken D', 'Karahan ZC']",,"['Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Microbiology, Division of Medical Parasitology, Ankara, Turkey. gakarsu@yahoo.com.']",['tur'],,['Journal Article'],,Turkey,Mikrobiyol Bul,Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,7503830,"['0 (DEFB103A protein, human)', '0 (beta-Defensins)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",IM,"['Caco-2 Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-12/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/*immunology/parasitology', 'Toxoplasma/*immunology', 'beta-Defensins/*metabolism']",,2017/06/02 06:00,2017/11/08 06:00,['2017/06/02 06:00'],"['2017/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/08 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Mikrobiyol Bul. 2017 Apr;51(2):156-164.,,,,,,,Caco-2 insan kolon epidermal adenokarsinom ve THP-1 insan losemi monosit hucre dizilerinin cesitli kosullarda Toxoplasma gondii'ye karsi sitokin yanitlarinin ve insan beta-defensin-3 ekspresyon degisikliklerinin arastirilmasi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fludarabine/cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil and bendamustine are commonly used as a backbone, depending on the patient's age and general health. The advent of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab and obinutuzumab, altered the face of treatment, and chemoimmunotherapy still forms the current standard first-line approach. However, the landscape is changing following the emergence of novel targeted agents, such as ibrutinib, idelalisib and venetoclax, which offer the chance for improved efficacy over standard therapy alone, with no substantial increase in toxicity. This review focuses on the role of chemotherapy in CLL, discussing the characteristics that define a state-of-the art chemotherapy, the current role of chemotherapy in the treatment of CLL, within the context of guidelines, and its future role in a setting in which chemotherapy-free regimens are being increasingly investigated.","['Wendtner, Clemens-Martin', 'Gregor, Michael']","['Wendtner CM', 'Gregor M']",,"['a Klinikum Schwabing, Department of Internal Medicine I , Academic Teaching Hospital of University of Munich , Munich , Germany.', 'b Division of Hematology , Luzerner Kantonsspital , Lucerne , Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170601,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2017/06/02 06:00,2018/08/01 06:00,['2017/06/02 06:00'],"['2017/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2017.1330474 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2018 Feb;59(2):300-310. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2017.1330474.

It has also been confirmed that roscovitine can downregulate the expression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 protein to inhibit inflammation. In the present study, roscovitine was used to treat inflammation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced model mice. At the cellular level, Leydig cells isolated from mouse testis were assessed for inflammatory factors. It was revealed that roscovitine successfully reduced inflammation-associated injury induced by LPS pretreatment. At the molecular level, roscovitine was found to exert this effect through promotion of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first to suggest that roscovitine has a protective role in Leydig cells through its anti-inflammatory action.","['Xie, Tiancheng', 'Hu, Guanghui', 'Dong, Binbin', 'Yan, Yangye', 'Liu, Min', 'Yao, Xudong', 'Zheng, Junhua', 'Xu, Yunfei']","['Xie T', 'Hu G', 'Dong B', 'Yan Y', 'Liu M', 'Yao X', 'Zheng J', 'Xu Y']",,"[""Department of Urology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University, School of Medicine, Shanghai 200072, P.R.

Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to examine the CpG island methylation status of the SFRP1 gene in leukemia cell lines. In addition, the effects on Jurkat cells of treatment with different concentrations of As2O3 for 48 h were investigated. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was employed to measure the expression of mRNAs, while western blot analysis was used to examine protein expression in cells. The SFRP1 gene was methylated in Jurkat cells. However, both methylated and unmethylated SFRP1 genes were detected in HL60 and K562 cells. In normal bone marrow mononuclear cells, the SFRP1 gene was unmethylated. Following treatment with As2O3 for 48 h, the SFRP1 gene was demethylated, and the mRNA and protein expression levels of the SFRP1 gene were increased. By contrast, the mRNA and protein expression levels of beta-catenin and cyclin Dl were downregulated. The protein expression of c-myc was also downregulated, but As2O3 exhibited no significant effect on the mRNA expression of c-myc. Abnormal methylation of the SFRP1 gene was detected in Jurkat cells. These results suggest that As2O3 activates SFRP1 gene expression at the mRNA and protein levels in Jurkat cells by demethylation of the SFRP1 gene. Furthermore, they indicate that As2O3 regulates WNT target genes and controls the growth of Jurkat cells through the WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway.","['Wang, Yan', 'Wang, Zunsong', 'Li, Hong', 'Xu, Wenwei', 'Dong, Lin', 'Guo, Yan', 'Feng, Saran', 'Bi, Kehong', 'Zhu, Chuansheng']","['Wang Y', 'Wang Z', 'Li H', 'Xu W', 'Dong L', 'Guo Y', 'Feng S', 'Bi K', 'Zhu C']",,"['Department of Hematology, Qianfoshan Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250014, P.R.

Methods: Clinical features and therapeutic effect were retrospectively analyzed in 53 AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation diagnosed in Henan Cancer Hospital from January 2013 to August 2016. The biological characteristics and clinical efficacy of chemotherapy in combination with or without Sorafeinb were analyzed. Results: FLT3-ITD mutation was identified in 53 AML patients, 22 cases (41.5%) were M(5) subtype. The median of the peripheral WBC was 61.00 (0.98-920.00) x10(9)/L, and there were 50 (94.3%) patients with WBC>10x10(9)/L. The median of blast cell in bone marrow was 0.730 (0.234-0.966) . The total remission rate of all these 53 patients was 56.6% (30/53) . The complete remission (CR) rates in patients treated with chemotherapy in combination with sorafenib and patients with chemotherapy alone were 86.4% (19/22) and 35.5% (11/31) , respectively.

Methods: A total of 38 times of bleeding in 31 patients with hematological disease treated with rFa were analyzed retrospectively. Results: The clinical effective rate of rFa for bleeding management in acquired hemophilia A (AHA) patients/hemophilia patients with inhibitor, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients and patients with non-APL leukemia was 90% (9/10) , 71.4% (5/7) and 60.0% (3/5) , respectively, which was higher than that in patients following HSCT (30.8%) . The clinical effective rate of rFa for patients with bleeding score of 2 (100.0%) was higher than that with 3 (66.7%) and 4 (54.1%) . The effective rate of rFa was 25.0% (2/5) in 5 patients with cerebral hemorrhage, 66.7% (6/9) in 9 patients with hematuria and 41.7% in 12 patients with gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The curative effect for 3 patients with joints and muscle bleeding and 5 patients with skin, nasal, pharyngeal and gum bleeding was excellent. Following HSCT, among patients with bleeding score of 4 points, high dose and repeated use of rFa did not necessarily achieve a good effect. Among AHA/hemophilia patients with inhibitors and patients with acute leukemia who had bleeding score of 4 points, the use of low dose Fa could achieve good therapeutic effect, however the efficacy of lowest dose (22.5 mug/kg) rFa was poor. Conclusions: The hemostasis efficacy of rFa is affected by various factors such as diseases, bleeding sites, bleeding score and so on. The use of rFa can achieve good efficacy for bleeding management in AHA patients/hemophilia patients with inhibitor, APL patients and patients with non-APL leukemia. However the efficacy of rFa for bleeding of patients after HSCT is poor. Early use of rFa is important for successful hemostatic treatment.

Our in silico and wet-bench analyses indicate that non-mutated IDH1 mRNA and protein are commonly overexpressed in primary GBMs. We show that genetic and pharmacologic inactivation of IDH1 decreases GBM cell growth, promotes a more differentiated tumor cell state, increases apoptosis in response to targeted therapies, and prolongs the survival of animal subjects bearing patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). On a molecular level, diminished IDH1 activity results in reduced alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG) and NADPH production, paralleled by deficient carbon flux from glucose or acetate into lipids, exhaustion of reduced glutathione, increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and enhanced histone methylation and differentiation marker expression.

We used a novel approach for evaluating venetoclax pharmacokinetics using only sparse sampling in 155 patients enrolled in a phase 2, multicenter, open-label study in CLL patients with the 17p deletion. Patients received venetoclax doses within 30 min after the completion of breakfast or the first meal of the day, with no specific recommendations for the fat content in the meal. Blood samples for venetoclax assay were collected during the ramp-up period and on day 1 of weeks 8, 12, 16, 24, and every 12 weeks thereafter. The mean postdose (8 h) plasma venetoclax concentrations increased with increasing weekly venetoclax dose during the ramp-up period to reach 1.89 microg/ml on week 5 day 1 at the 400 mg dose. The mean predose concentration at the 400 mg dose ranged between 0.69 and 0.99 microg/ml across visits between weeks 8 and 120. Repeated-measures analysis detected no statistical significance (P>/=0.05) for the mean predose concentrations at any of the times tested from weeks 8 to 24. The study shows that the pharmacokinetic profile of venetoclax in CLL patients with the 17p deletion is comparable to the overall CLL as well as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patient populations. Furthermore, no specific recommendation in terms of fat content in the meal is needed for the intake of venetoclax in patients with CLL.","['Salem, Ahmed Hamed', 'Dunbar, Martin', 'Agarwal, Suresh K']","['Salem AH', 'Dunbar M', 'Agarwal SK']",,"['aAbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, USA bDepartment of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics']",,2017/06/01 06:00,2017/12/07 06:00,['2017/06/01 06:00'],"['2017/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/CAD.0000000000000522 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2017 Sep;28(8):911-914. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000522.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first formulation marketed in the United States (original BDM) was a lyophilized product requiring reconstitution prior to dilution to the final admixture. A liquid formulation of BDM was subsequently introduced that did not require reconstitution before dilution. Both formulations are administered as a 500 mL admixture with a recommended infusion time of 30 or 60 minutes for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, respectively. A newer liquid BDM formulation (rapid BDM) is a ready-to-dilute solution not requiring reconstitution that dilutes into an admixture of only 50 mL and can be safely administered in a shorter infusion time (10 minutes). Rapid BDM admixture also has longer stability at room temperature than both lyophilized and liquid BDM formulations (6 vs 2 to 3 hours). This phase 1, open-label, randomized, crossover (3-period, partially replicated) study, conducted in ""end-of-life"" cancer patients at 10 oncology centers in the United States, demonstrates that rapid BDM is bioequivalent to original BDM as determined by area under the curve. Expected differences in maximum plasma concentration and time to maximum plasma concentration were observed between study treatments, given the substantially shorter infusion time of rapid BDM. No clinically relevant differences in other evaluated pharmacokinetic parameters were found. Rapid BDM infusions were safe and tolerable for cancer patients in this study. The overall safety profiles of the 2 BDM formulations were comparable, with no new safety signals identified and no differences in infusion-related adverse events.","['Cheung, Eric M', 'Edenfield, William J', 'Mattar, Bassam', 'Anthony, Stephen P', 'Mutch, Peter J', 'Chanas, Brian', 'Smith, Mark', 'Hepner, Adrian']","['Cheung EM', 'Edenfield WJ', 'Mattar B', 'Anthony SP', 'Mutch PJ', 'Chanas B', 'Smith M', 'Hepner A']",,"['The Oncology Institute, Long Beach, CA, USA.', 'Greenville Health System Cancer Institute, Greenville, SC, USA.', 'Cancer Center of Kansas, Wichita, KS, USA.', 'Texas Oncology, Dallas, TX, USA.', 'Arizona Oncology, Sedona, AZ, USA.', 'ICON plc, Marlow, UK.', 'Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Woodcliff Lake, NJ, USA.', 'Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Woodcliff Lake, NJ, USA.', 'Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Woodcliff Lake, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20170531,England,J Clin Pharmacol,Journal of clinical pharmacology,0366372,['981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Area Under Curve', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Availability', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical/methods', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injection Site Reaction/etiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Therapeutic Equivalency']",,2017/06/01 06:00,2018/05/31 06:00,['2017/06/01 06:00'],"['2016/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcph.942 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharmacol. 2017 Nov;57(11):1400-1408. doi: 10.1002/jcph.942.

Molecular defects promoting the constitutive activation of canonical and non-canonical NF-kappaB signaling pathways contribute to many diseases, including cancer, diabetes, chronic inflammation, and autoimmunity. In the present review, we focus our attention on the mechanisms of NF-kappaB deregulation in hematological malignancies. Key positive regulators of NF-kappaB signaling can act as oncogenes that are often prone to chromosomal translocation, amplifications, or activating mutations. Negative regulators of NF-kappaB have tumor suppressor functions, and are frequently inactivated either by genomic deletions or point mutations. NF-kappaB activation in tumoral cells is also driven by the microenvironment or chronic signaling that does not rely on genetic alterations.","['Imbert, Veronique', 'Peyron, Jean-Francois']","['Imbert V', 'Peyron JF']",,"[""Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire, INSERM U1065, Universite Cote d'Azur, 06204 Nice, France.

Upon administration, these modified T cells traffic to, and recognize, cancer cells in an HLA-independent manner. CAR T-cell therapy has shown remarkable success in the treatment of CD-19-expressing B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia. However, clinical gains to the same magnitude have not been reported in solid tumors. Several known obstacles to CAR T-cell therapy for solid tumors include target antigen identification, effective trafficking to the tumor, robust activation, proliferation, and in vivo cytotoxicity. Beyond these T-cell intrinsic properties, a complex and dynamic immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in solid tumors hinders T-cell efficacy. Notable advancements in CAR design to include multiple costimulatory molecules, ligands, and soluble cytokines have shown promise in preclinical models, and some of these are currently in early-phase clinical trials. In this review, we discuss selected solid tumor malignancies and relevant preclinical data and highlight clinical trial results that are available. Furthermore, we outline some obstacles to CAR T-cell therapy for each tumor and propose strategies to overcome some of these limitations.","['Yeku, Oladapo', 'Li, Xinghuo', 'Brentjens, Renier J']","['Yeku O', 'Li X', 'Brentjens RJ']",,"['From the Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY; Center for Cell Engineering, and Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'From the Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY; Center for Cell Engineering, and Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'From the Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY; Center for Cell Engineering, and Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['R25 CA020449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA138738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA190174/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA059350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],,United States,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

Patient-reported outcome (PRO) tools are readily available for use in the clinic and provide complementary information on the tolerance of TKIs. Effectively managing adverse events of TKIs can improve compliance and quality of life. Discontinuation of TKIs is the next frontier in CML. In select patients with sustained deep molecular remission, a discontinuation of TKI is associated with a durable treatment-free remission in approximately 50%. Patient engagement in their discontinuation can be achieved through a provider multi-team coaching, is complementary to the available guidelines, and may provide an additional safety net so that these discontinuations remain safe when applied in general practices.","['Khoury, Hanna Jean', 'Williams, Loretta A', 'Atallah, Ehab', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger']","['Khoury HJ', 'Williams LA', 'Atallah E', 'Hehlmann R']",,"['From the Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, GA; The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; Medizinische Fakultat Mannheim der Universitat Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.', 'From the Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, GA; The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; Medizinische Fakultat Mannheim der Universitat Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.', 'From the Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, GA; The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; Medizinische Fakultat Mannheim der Universitat Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.', 'From the Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, GA; The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; Medizinische Fakultat Mannheim der Universitat Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

Work in this area, however, has faced challenges in identifying when treatment is complete for many forms of cancer. Acknowledging this challenge, the scope of survivorship research is often expanded to include patients also receiving maintenance or prophylactic therapy. Inherent in this expanded definition is the recognition that for many individuals, cancer is a chronic disease requiring extended treatment over many years. Three distinct patient populations can be identified for which extended treatment poses important survivorship care needs that, to date, have not been adequately addressed. The first group includes patients receiving extended endocrine therapy, such as women with breast cancer receiving tamoxifen and/or aromatase inhibitors as well as men with prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy. The second group includes patients receiving extended targeted therapy to control disease, as exemplified by patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia receiving treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. A key issue in both of these patient groups is the need to identify and address factors that contribute to difficulties in maintaining high levels of adherence to the prescribed therapy over extended periods of time. The third group includes patients receiving novel therapies for advanced or metastatic cancer that can extend life for prolonged periods. A key issue for this group is the need to understand and address their unique supportive care needs.","['Jacobsen, Paul B', 'Nipp, Ryan D', 'Ganz, Patricia A']","['Jacobsen PB', 'Nipp RD', 'Ganz PA']",,"['From the Healthcare Delivery Research Program, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD; Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, Fielding School of Public Health and the David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.', 'From the Healthcare Delivery Research Program, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD; Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, Fielding School of Public Health and the David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.', 'From the Healthcare Delivery Research Program, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD; Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, Fielding School of Public Health and the David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

Rare cases of transformation to Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) have been reported in the literature with an estimated prevalence of 0.4%. We report a case of a 67-year-old female with CLL treated with the novel Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor, ibrutinib, who subsequently presented with intractable fevers. Bone marrow trephine, and lymph node biopsy revealed classical HL with negative immuno-histochemistry for Btk in HL cells, on a backdrop of CLL. The patient commenced treatment with Adriamycin, Vinblastine and Dacarbazine (AVD), which resulted in an excellent response. Hodgkin transformation of CLL is rare with a single retrospective study of 4121 CLL patients reporting only 18 cases. Btk expression in HL cells is recently recognised in classical HL; however, the majority of HLs are Btk negative. Given that Btk inhibitors have recently been shown to induce genomic instability in B cells, in the context of their widespread use, such emerging cases are increasingly relevant.","['Glavey, Siobhan', 'Quinn, John', 'McCloy, Mary', 'Sargent, Jeremy', 'McCartney, Yvonne', 'Catherwood, Mark', 'Marafioti, Teresa', 'Leader, Mary', 'Murphy, Philip', 'Thornton, Patrick']","['Glavey S', 'Quinn J', 'McCloy M', 'Sargent J', 'McCartney Y', 'Catherwood M', 'Marafioti T', 'Leader M', 'Murphy P', 'Thornton P']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8585-5849'],"['Department of Haematology, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Department of Haematology, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Department of Haematology, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, Ireland.', 'Department of Haematology, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, Ireland.', 'Department of Histopathology, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Department of Haemato-Oncology, Belfast City Hospital, Belfast, UK.', 'Department of Histopathology, University College Hospital, London, UK.', 'Department of Histopathology, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Department of Haematology, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Department of Haematology, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20170705,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*diagnosis/*etiology', 'Piperidines', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",,2017/06/01 06:00,2018/05/22 06:00,['2017/06/01 06:00'],"['2017/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.12911 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2017 Oct;99(4):378-380. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12911.

As a result, these patients may be a part of the increasing population requiring total knee arthroplasty (TKA); however, they might be at a higher risk of adverse perioperative outcomes. The purpose of this study was to determine the perioperative outcomes (complications, length of stay [LOS], and costs) of patients with hematologic malignancies following TKA. This study used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) to identify patients who underwent TKA in the United States from 2000 to 2011. Patients diagnosed with any hematologic malignancy (N = 24,714) were then stratified by Hodgkin's disease (N = 791), Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (N = 7,096), plasma cell dyscrasias (N = 1,621), leukemia (N = 8,005), myeloproliferative disease (N = 5,746), and/or myelodysplastic syndromes (N = 1,608) for determining the complications that occurred during admission. Propensity matching was performed for demographics, hospital characteristics, and comorbidities, which yielded 24,491 patients with any hematologic malignancy and 24,458 control patients. Additionally, propensity matching was performed for the hematologic malignancy subtypes. Multivariable regression models were used to analyze the surgical and medical complications, LOS, and costs. The annual frequency of THA in patients with any hematologic malignancy increased from 2000 to 2011 (p < 0.0001). Hematologic malignancies were associated with an increased risk of any surgery-related complication (odds ratio [OR] = 1.31, p < 0.0001) and any general medical complication (OR = 1.38, p < 0.0001). Patients with any hematologic malignancy had increased odds of complications, including acute postoperative anemia (OR = 1.29, p < 0.0001), hematoma/seroma (OR = 1.65, p < 0.02), peripheral vascular disease (OR = 2.23, p = 0.046), deep venous thrombosis (DVT) (OR = 1.95, p = 0.02), and blood transfusion (OR = 1.61, p < 0.0001). Hematologic malignancies were associated with an increased incremental LOS (0.13 d, p < 0.0001) and an increased incremental cost ($788, p < 0.0001). Thus, we conclude that following TKA, patients with hematologic malignancies are at an increased risk of perioperative complications, longer LOS, and higher costs. The risk quantification for adverse perioperative outcomes in association with an increased cost may help design different risk stratification and reimbursement methods in such patients when undergoing TKA.","['Newman, Jared M', 'Wagner, Timothy C', 'Naziri, Qais', 'North, W Trevor', 'Navale, Suparna M', 'Klika, Alison K', 'Barsoum, Wael K', 'Higuera, Carlos A']","['Newman JM', 'Wagner TC', 'Naziri Q', 'North WT', 'Navale SM', 'Klika AK', 'Barsoum WK', 'Higuera CA']",,"['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, State University of New York Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, Michigan.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170523,Germany,J Knee Surg,The journal of knee surgery,101137599,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee/*adverse effects/economics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Comorbidity', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Joint Diseases/economics/epidemiology/*surgery', 'Knee Joint/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications/economics/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,2017/06/01 06:00,2018/08/28 06:00,['2017/06/01 06:00'],"['2017/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-0037-1603335 [doi]'],ppublish,J Knee Surg. 2018 Apr;31(4):291-301. doi: 10.1055/s-0037-1603335.

No specific tools have been defined for risk stratification in SMF. To develop a prognostic model for predicting survival, we studied 685 JAK2, CALR, and MPL annotated patients with SMF. Median survival of the whole cohort was 9.3 years (95% CI: 8-not reached-NR-). Through penalized Cox regressions we identified negative predictors of survival and according to beta risk coefficients we assigned 2 points to hemoglobin level <11 g/dl, to circulating blasts 3%, and to CALR-unmutated genotype, 1 point to platelet count <150 x 10(9)/l and to constitutional symptoms, and 0.15 points to any year of age. Myelofibrosis Secondary to PV and ET-Prognostic Model (MYSEC-PM) allocated SMF patients into four risk categories with different survival (P<0.0001): low (median survival NR; 133 patients), intermediate-1 (9.3 years, 95% CI: 8.1-NR; 245 patients), intermediate-2 (4.4 years, 95% CI: 3.2-7.9; 126 patients), and high risk (2 years, 95% CI: 1.7-3.9; 75 patients). Finally, we found that the MYSEC-PM represents the most appropriate tool for SMF decision-making to be used in clinical and trial settings.","['Passamonti, F', 'Giorgino, T', 'Mora, B', 'Guglielmelli, P', 'Rumi, E', 'Maffioli, M', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Caramella, M', 'Komrokji, R', 'Gotlib, J', 'Kiladjian, J J', 'Cervantes, F', 'Devos, T', 'Palandri, F', 'De Stefano, V', 'Ruggeri, M', 'Silver, R T', 'Benevolo, G', 'Albano, F', 'Caramazza, D', 'Merli, M', 'Pietra, D', 'Casalone, R', 'Rotunno, G', 'Barbui, T', 'Cazzola, M', 'Vannucchi, A M']","['Passamonti F', 'Giorgino T', 'Mora B', 'Guglielmelli P', 'Rumi E', 'Maffioli M', 'Rambaldi A', 'Caramella M', 'Komrokji R', 'Gotlib J', 'Kiladjian JJ', 'Cervantes F', 'Devos T', 'Palandri F', 'De Stefano V', 'Ruggeri M', 'Silver RT', 'Benevolo G', 'Albano F', 'Caramazza D', 'Merli M', 'Pietra D', 'Casalone R', 'Rotunno G', 'Barbui T', 'Cazzola M', 'Vannucchi AM']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6449-0596', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1809-284X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3739-7502', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6575-8766']","['Hematology, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Insubria, Ospedale di Circolo, ASST Sette Laghi, Varese, Italy.', 'Institute of Neurosciences, National Research Council of Italy, Padova, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Insubria, Ospedale di Circolo, ASST Sette Laghi, Varese, Italy.', 'CRIMM-Centro Ricerca e Innovazione delle Malattie Mieloproliferative, Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Azienda ospedaliera-Universitaria Careggi, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Universita di Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Insubria, Ospedale di Circolo, ASST Sette Laghi, Varese, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology-Hematology, University of Milan and BMT Unit, ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy.', 'Ospedale Niguarda Ca Granda, Milano, Italy.', 'Moffit Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, USA.', 'Hopital Saint-Louis et Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', 'Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospitals Leuven and Laboratory of Experimental Transplantation, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Policlinico S.

We apply MiSL to 12 different cancers and predict 145,891 SL partners for 3,120 mutations, including known mutation-specific SL partners. Comparisons with functional screens show that MiSL predictions are enriched for SLs in multiple cancers. We extensively validate a SL interaction identified by MiSL between the IDH1 mutation and ACACA in leukaemia using gene targeting and patient-derived xenografts. Furthermore, we apply MiSL to pinpoint genetic biomarkers for drug sensitivity. These results demonstrate that MiSL can accelerate precision oncology by identifying mutation-specific targets and biomarkers.","['Sinha, Subarna', 'Thomas, Daniel', 'Chan, Steven', 'Gao, Yang', 'Brunen, Diede', 'Torabi, Damoun', 'Reinisch, Andreas', 'Hernandez, David', 'Chan, Andy', 'Rankin, Erinn B', 'Bernards, Rene', 'Majeti, Ravindra', 'Dill, David L']","['Sinha S', 'Thomas D', 'Chan S', 'Gao Y', 'Brunen D', 'Torabi D', 'Reinisch A', 'Hernandez D', 'Chan A', 'Rankin EB', 'Bernards R', 'Majeti R', 'Dill DL']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8677-3423'],"['Department of Computer Science, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Cancer Institute, and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5G 2M9.', 'Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, USA.', 'Division of Molecular Carcinogenesis, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, Amsterdam 1066 CX, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Cancer Institute, and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Cancer Institute, and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Cancer Institute, and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA.', 'Division of Radiation and Cancer Biology, Department of Radiation Oncology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA.', 'Division of Radiation and Cancer Biology, Department of Radiation Oncology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA.', 'Division of Molecular Carcinogenesis, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, Amsterdam 1066 CX, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Cancer Institute, and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA.', 'Department of Computer Science, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA188055/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'J 3358/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'R21 CA195127/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA149145/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA198291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K99 CA207731/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170531,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Precision Medicine/methods', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Synthetic Lethal Mutations/*genetics', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",PMC5460027,2017/06/01 06:00,2018/11/20 06:00,['2017/06/01 06:00'],"['2017/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/20 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms15580 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms15580 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2017 May 31;8:15580. doi: 10.1038/ncomms15580.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oncostatin M (OSM), a member of the IL-6 family, has recently been shown to induce a distinct number of classical interferon stimulated genes (ISG). Most of them are involved in antigen processing and presentation. However, induction of retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptors (RLR) has not been investigated. Here we report that OSM has the capability to induce the expression of the DExD/H-Box RNA helicases RIG-I and melanoma differentiation antigen 5 (MDA5) as well as of the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor (IRF)1, IRF7 and IRF9 in primary fibroblasts. Induction of the helicases depends on tyrosine as well as serine phosphorylation of STAT1. Moreover, we could show that the OSM-induced STAT1 phosphorylation is predominantly counter-regulated by a strong STAT3-dependent SOCS3 induction, as Stat3 as well as Socs3 knock-down results in an enhanced and prolonged helicase and IRF expression. Other factors involved in regulation of STAT1 or IRF1 activity, like protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2), promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML) or small ubiquitin-related modifier 1 (SUMO1), play a minor role in OSM-mediated induction of RLR. Remarkably, OSM and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) synergize to mediate transcription of RLR and pre-treatment of fibroblasts with OSM fosters the type I interferon production in response to a subsequent encounter with double-stranded RNA. Together, these findings suggest that the OSM-induced JAK/STAT1 signalling is implicated in virus protection of non-professional immune cells and may cooperate with interferons to enhance RLR expression in these cells.","['Hergovits, Sabine', 'Mais, Christine', 'Haan, Claude', 'Costa-Pereira, Ana P', 'Hermanns, Heike M']","['Hergovits S', 'Mais C', 'Haan C', 'Costa-Pereira AP', 'Hermanns HM']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6617-1668'],"['Medical Clinic and Policlinic II, Division of Hepatology, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic II, Division of Hepatology, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'University of Luxembourg, Life Sciences Research Unit-Signal Transduction Laboratory, Belvaux, Luxembourg.', 'Department of Oncology, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic II, Division of Hepatology, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170530,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (IRF1 protein, human)', '0 (IRF7 protein, human)', '0 (IRF9 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-7)', '0 (Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3, gamma Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (DDX58 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (IFIH1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD Box Protein 58)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (Interferon-Induced Helicase, IFIH1)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DEAD Box Protein 58/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/immunology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1/genetics/immunology', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-7/genetics/immunology', 'Interferon-Induced Helicase, IFIH1/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/immunology', 'Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3, gamma Subunit/genetics/immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics/immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lung/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oncostatin M/*pharmacology', 'Osteoblasts/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/*genetics/immunology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein/genetics/immunology']",PMC5661242,2017/06/01 06:00,2018/06/13 06:00,['2017/06/01 06:00'],"['2017/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.13221 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2017 Nov;21(11):3087-3099. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.13221.

Outcomes in adult patients with T-ALL/LBL remain unsatisfactory; early relapse following intensive induction chemotherapy is a concern, and patients with relapsed or refractory disease have a poor prognosis. Romidepsin is a potent, class 1 selective histone deacetylase inhibitor approved for the treatment of patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma who have had >/=1 prior therapy and patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma who have had >/=1 prior systemic therapy. Here, we report the case of an adult patient with T-ALL refractory to induction hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD). Treatment with romidepsin was initiated, and romidepsin in combination with hyper-CVAD resulted in complete remission, with mild tumor lysis syndrome as the only detectable additional toxicity. The patient eventually underwent allogeneic stem cell transplant while in first complete remission. Prior studies have shown that romidepsin is capable of inducing durable responses with manageable toxicities in patients with mature T-cell lymphomas. This case study describes the successful use of romidepsin in combination with hyper-CVAD in an adult patient with refractory T-ALL and highlights the activity of romidepsin in the T-cell lineage.

It was previously thought that hematopoietic stresses such as infection or other inflammatory stimuli, are mostly recognized by terminally differentiated immune cells, i.e., front-line defenders at the local site of reaction, and that they produce factors that directly act on hematopoietic stem and progenitors (HSPCs) in BM and subsequently stimulate them to rebuild and sustain the hemato-lymphatic system. However, accumulating evidence now indicates that primitive HSPCs, as well as microenvironmental cells in BM are also able to sense systemically migrating hematopoietic stress signals, and respond by orchestrating on-site hematopoiesis via direct and indirect mechanisms. While inflammation has many beneficial roles in activating the immune system for defense or facilitating tissue repair, it also shows detrimental effects if sustained chronically, i.e., might lead to HSPC damage as bone marrow failure or leukemia. Thus, inflammation requires tight control of initiation and termination in time and space dependent manner.","['Takizawa, Hitoshi', 'Manz, Markus G']","['Takizawa H', 'Manz MG']",,"['International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, 860-0811, Japan. htakizawa@kumamoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, CH-8091, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170530,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', '*Cellular Microenvironment/genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/etiology/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', '*Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*etiology/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Niche/genetics']",,2017/06/01 06:00,2017/07/08 06:00,['2017/06/01 06:00'],"['2017/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-017-2266-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-017-2266-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2017 Jul;106(1):27-33. doi: 10.1007/s12185-017-2266-5.

A total of 258 differentiallyexpressed genes (DEGs) were identified between these two groups, from which 139 DEGs were upregulated and 119 were downregulated. Several candidate genes that were associated with cyclophosphamide resistance were also identified. These DEGs were subsequently classified using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment pathway analysis. A total of 487 biological processes and 17 KEGG pathways were revealed to be enriched. Furthermore, an interaction network was established to identify the core genes that regulated cyclophosphamide resistance. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A (STAT5A), FYN protooncogene, Src family tyrosine kinase and spleen associated tyrosine kinase were revealed to be the hub genes in multiple enriched biological processes and signaling pathways, indicating that these were involved in mediating cyclophosphamide sensitivity in CML cells. The expression levels of 5 DEGs were also confirmed in two human CML cell lines (K562 and KU812) by reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, selective knockdown of STAT5A and S100 calcium binding protein A4 (S100A4) recovered cyclophosphamide sensitivity in K562 cells, suggesting their involvement in drug resistance. The present study identified several potential genes and pathways contributing to cyclophosphamide resistance, and confirmed the involvement of STAT5A and S100A4 in drug resistance. These results enable improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying drug resistance in CML cells.","['He, Xiao', 'Deng, Yuying', 'Yue, Wei']","['He X', 'Deng Y', 'Yue W']",,"[""Blood Transfusion Department, The First People's Hospital of Yancheng City, Yancheng, Jiangsu 224006, P.R.

Although various molecular targeted drugs are being researched and developed for melanoma patients, their efficacy appears to be unsatisfactory. Over the past few years, several reports have demonstrated that Coptidis Rhizoma water extracts (CR) or its major active chemical component, berberine, has anticancer activities in various types of cancer, including melanoma. However, their underlying mechanisms have not been well understood. In the present study, we determined that CR suppressed melanoma cell viability, which was mainly mediated through apoptosis. In addition, the expression levels of anti-apoptotic proteins, BCL2A1, MCL1 and BCL-w, were strongly suppressed by CR treatment. Furthermore, multi-domain pro-apoptotic proteins BAX and BAK were activated by CR treatment and were also required for the CR-induced apoptosis. Collectively, CR or some formulations containing CR, may be effective safe treatment strategies for human melanoma.","['Xu, Xiaoou', 'Yokoyama, Satoru', 'Hayakawa, Yoshihiro', 'Saiki, Ikuo']","['Xu X', 'Yokoyama S', 'Hayakawa Y', 'Saiki I']",,"['Division of Pathogenic Biochemistry, Institute of Natural Medicine, University of Toyama, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Division of Pathogenic Biochemistry, Institute of Natural Medicine, University of Toyama, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Division of Pathogenic Biochemistry, Institute of Natural Medicine, University of Toyama, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Division of Pathogenic Biochemistry, Institute of Natural Medicine, University of Toyama, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170526,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2-related protein A1)', '0 (BCL2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0I8Y3P32UF (Berberine)', 'CXS4LJR7EL (Coptidis rhizoma extract)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Berberine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coptis chinensis', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*metabolism']",,2017/06/01 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2017/06/01 06:00'],"['2016/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/or.2017.5672 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2017 Jul;38(1):538-544. doi: 10.3892/or.2017.5672.

We have investigated the effect of pairing cannabinoids and assessed their anticancer activity in cell line models. Those most effective were then used with the common anti-leukaemia drugs cytarabine and vincristine, and the effects of this combination therapy on cell death studied in vitro. Results show a number of cannabinoids could be paired together to generate an effect superior to that achieved if the components were used individually. For example, in HL60 cells, the IC50 values at 48 h for cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) when used alone were 8 and 13 microM, respectively; however, if used together, it was 4 microM. Median-effect analysis confirmed the benefit of using cannabinoids in pairs, with calculated combination indices being <1 in a number of cases. The most efficacious cannabinoid-pairs subsequently synergised further when combined with the chemotherapy agents, and were also able to sensitise leukaemia cells to their cytotoxic effects. The sequence of administration of these drugs was important though; using cannabinoids after chemotherapy resulted in greater induction of apoptosis, whilst this was the opposite when the schedule of administration was reversed. Our results suggest that when certain cannabinoids are paired together, the resulting product can be combined synergistically with common anti-leukaemia drugs allowing the dose of the cytotoxic agents to be dramatically reduced yet still remain efficacious. Nevertheless, the sequence of drug administration is crucial to the success of these triple combinations and should be considered when planning such treatments.","['Scott, Katherine A', 'Dalgleish, Angus G', 'Liu, Wai M']","['Scott KA', 'Dalgleish AG', 'Liu WM']",,"[""Department of Oncology, Institute for Infection and Immunity, St George's, University of London, London SW17 0RE, UK."", ""Department of Oncology, Institute for Infection and Immunity, St George's, University of London, London SW17 0RE, UK."", ""Department of Oncology, Institute for Infection and Immunity, St George's, University of London, London SW17 0RE, UK.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170529,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cannabinoids)', '7J8897W37S (Dronabinol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cannabinoids/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Dronabinol/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2017/06/01 06:00,2018/07/18 06:00,['2017/06/01 06:00'],"['2017/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.2017.4022 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2017 Jul;51(1):369-377. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2017.4022.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential roles of CEBPA-mediated upregulation of PLIN2 in the process of CML development by regulating the GSK3 and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways. We found that both CEBPA and PLIN2 were expressed at significantly higher levels in CML. Simultaneously, we found that CEBPA upregulated the expression of PLIN2 and that there was a positive correlation between CEBPA and PLIN2 in CML patients. CEBPA promoted the progression of CML by upregulating PLIN2. We also found that PLIN2 increased the expression levels of AKT, p-AKT, GSK-3beta, beta-catenin and Axin2/Conductin as well as promoted the progression of CML via the GSK3 and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways in vitro. Furthermore, we found that CEBPA-mediated upregulation of PLIN2 expression promotes tumor growth via GSK3 and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in vivo. Therefore, our study provided a new theoretical basis for CML treatment through the CEBPA/PLIN2 axis.","['Sun, Chengming', 'Luan, Shuping', 'Zhang, Guili', 'Wang, Na', 'Shao, Huiyuan', 'Luan, Caifu']","['Sun C', 'Luan S', 'Zhang G', 'Wang N', 'Shao H', 'Luan C']",,"['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital Affiliated to Qingdao University Medical CollegeYantai 264000, Shandong Province, China.', ""Rongcheng Shidao People's HospitalWeihai 264200, Shandong Province, China."", 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital Affiliated to Qingdao University Medical CollegeYantai 264000, Shandong Province, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital Affiliated to Qingdao University Medical CollegeYantai 264000, Shandong Province, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital Affiliated to Qingdao University Medical CollegeYantai 264000, Shandong Province, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital Affiliated to Qingdao University Medical CollegeYantai 264000, Shandong Province, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170501,United States,Am J Cancer Res,American journal of cancer research,101549944,,,,PMC5446474,2017/06/01 06:00,2017/06/01 06:01,['2017/06/01 06:00'],"['2017/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/01 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Cancer Res. 2017 May 1;7(5):1054-1067. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['CEBPA', 'chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'lncRNA PLIN2']",['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ofatumumab was licensed on the basis of an uncontrolled Phase II study, Hx-CD20-406, in which patients receiving ofatumumab survived for a median of 13.9 months. However, the lack of an internal control arm presents an obstacle for the estimation of comparative effectiveness. METHODS: The objective of the study was to present a method to estimate the cost effectiveness of ofatumumab in the treatment of DR-CLL. As no suitable historical control was available for modelling, the outcomes from non-responders to ofatumumab were used to model the effect of best supportive care (BSC). This was done via a Cox regression to control for differences in baseline characteristics between groups. This analysis was included in a partitioned survival model built in Microsoft((R)) Excel with utilities and costs taken from published sources, with costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were discounted at a rate of 3.5% per annum. RESULTS: Using the outcomes seen in non-responders, ofatumumab is expected to add approximately 0.62 life years (1.50 vs. 0.88). Using published utility values this translates to an additional 0.30 QALYs (0.77 vs. 0.47). At the list price, ofatumumab had a cost per QALY of pound130,563, and a cost per life year of pound63,542. The model was sensitive to changes in assumptions regarding overall survival estimates and utility values. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential of using data for non-responders to model outcomes for BSC in cost-effectiveness evaluations based on single-arm trials. Further research is needed on the estimation of comparative effectiveness using uncontrolled clinical studies.","['Hatswell, Anthony J', 'Thompson, Gwilym J', 'Maroudas, Penny A', 'Sofrygin, Oleg', 'Delea, Thomas E']","['Hatswell AJ', 'Thompson GJ', 'Maroudas PA', 'Sofrygin O', 'Delea TE']",,"['University College London, London, UK.0000000121901201grid.83440.3b', 'GlaxoSmithKline UK, Stockley Park West, Uxbridge, UK.0000 0001 2162 0389grid.418236.a', 'BresMed, 84 Queen Street, Sheffield, S1 2DW UK.', 'Global Health Outcomes, GlaxoSmithKline, Uxbridge, UK.0000 0001 2162 0389grid.418236.a', 'GlaxoSmithKline UK, Stockley Park West, Uxbridge, UK.0000 0001 2162 0389grid.418236.a', 'Interdepartmental Group in Biostatistics, University of California, Berkeley, CA USA.0000 0001 2181 7878grid.47840.3f', 'Policy Analysis Inc.

Conditioning for HCT-ASCT consisted of rituximab 375 mg/m(2), carmustine 400 mg/m(2) and thiotepa (4 x 5 mg/kg). Patients commenced HCT-ASCT irrespective of response after induction. Patients not achieving complete remission (CR) after HCT-ASCT received whole-brain radiotherapy. Primary end point was CR after HCT-ASCT. We enrolled 39 patients; median age and Karnofsky performance score are 57 years and 90%, respectively. About 28 patients had relapsed and 8 refractory disease. About 22 patients responded to induction and 32 patients commenced HCT-ASCT. About 22 patients (56.4%) achieved CR after HCT-ASCT. Respective 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 46.0% (median PFS 12.4 months) and 56.4%; median OS not reached. We recorded four treatment-related deaths. Thiotepa-based HCT-ASCT is an effective treatment option in eligible patients with r/r PCNSL. Comparative studies are needed to further scrutinise the role of HCT-ASCT in the salvage setting.","['Kasenda, B', 'Ihorst, G', 'Schroers, R', 'Korfel, A', 'Schmidt-Wolf, I', 'Egerer, G', 'von Baumgarten, L', 'Roth, A', 'Bloehdorn, J', 'Mohle, R', 'Binder, M', 'Keller, U', 'Lamprecht, M', 'Pfreundschuh, M', 'Valk, E', 'Fricker, H', 'Schorb, E', 'Fritsch, K', 'Finke, J', 'Illerhaus, G']","['Kasenda B', 'Ihorst G', 'Schroers R', 'Korfel A', 'Schmidt-Wolf I', 'Egerer G', 'von Baumgarten L', 'Roth A', 'Bloehdorn J', 'Mohle R', 'Binder M', 'Keller U', 'Lamprecht M', 'Pfreundschuh M', 'Valk E', 'Fricker H', 'Schorb E', 'Fritsch K', 'Finke J', 'Illerhaus G']",,"['Department of Haematology/Oncology, Klinikum Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology & Institute for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Clinical Trials Unit, Medical Centre - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Ruhr-University of Bochum, Knappschaftskrankenhaus Bochum-Langendreer, Bochum, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite University Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO), University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Neurology, University Hospital Munich LMU, Munich, Germany.', 'Medical Faculty, Department of Haematology, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, University Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.', 'III Medical Department, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin I, Universitat des Saarlandes, Homburg, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology/Oncology, Klinikum Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology/Oncology, Klinikum Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170531,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Brain/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/mortality/*pathology/*therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/diagnostic imaging/mortality/*pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Retreatment', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2017/06/01 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2017/06/01 06:00'],"['2017/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017170 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.170 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Dec;31(12):2623-2629. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.170.

The objective of our study was to determine the molecular and cytogenetic responses, survival endpoints (event-free survival, failure-free survival, transformation-free survival, overall survival), and safety of innovator and generic brands of imatinib. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, data from 1812 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia treated with frontline imatinib mesylate (innovator/generic) at a single institution between 2008 and 2014 is included. Of these, 445 were excluded owing to inadequate data and follow-up, and a further 156 were excluded as they were in either the accelerated phase or blast crisis at diagnosis. Thus, data from 1067 patients who were treated with Gleevec (Novartis), and 144 patients with Veenat (NATCO) were available for analysis, and included in the study. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in event-free survival (P = .05), failure-free survival (P = .07), transformation-free survival (P = .12), or overall survival (P = .24) between the 2 groups. The frequency of reported nonhematologic adverse events and hematologic adverse events was comparable between the study groups. CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study showed comparable efficacy and safety of the generic and innovator versions of imatinib in the treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Danthala, Madhav', 'Gundeti, Sadashivudu', 'Kuruva, Siva Prasad', 'Puligundla, Krishna Chaitanya', 'Adusumilli, Praveen', 'Karnam, Ashok Pillai', 'Bala, Stalin', 'Konatam, Meher Lakshmi', 'Maddali, Lakshmi Srinivas', 'Digumarti, Raghunadha Rao']","['Danthala M', 'Gundeti S', 'Kuruva SP', 'Puligundla KC', 'Adusumilli P', 'Karnam AP', 'Bala S', 'Konatam ML', 'Maddali LS', 'Digumarti RR']",,"[""Department of Medical Oncology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, India.

This study aimed to improve our understanding of real-world practice patterns and outcomes of CLL patients with 11q- in a population-based setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The British Columbia CLL Database was used to identify patients with 11q-. Overall survival (OS) and treatment-free survival (TFS) were assessed after adjustment for prognostic factors. RESULTS: Of 1044 patients in the database, 125 had 11q- (12%). Sixty-nine patients had 11q- identified before therapy initiation and had a median OS and TFS of 14.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.3-18.1) and 2.5 (95% CI, 1.5-3.6) years. Patient with copresence of 11q- and deletion 17p had a markedly worse prognosis, with median OS of 4.9 versus 14.7 years (P < .001). Most treated patients (33 of 52) received fludarabine with or without rituximab (FR). Patients treated with FR had a median OS of 12.8 years (standard error, 1.0), which was not statistically different from those treated with alkylator-containing therapy (P = .35). CONCLUSION: Although median TFS of 11q- patients in this cohort was short at 2.5 years, OS remains long at 14.7 years, even when most patients received initial treatment without alkylators.","['Goy, Jennifer', 'Gillan, Tanya L', 'Bruyere, Helene', 'Huang, Steven J T', 'Hrynchak, Monica', 'Karsan, Aly', 'Ramadan, Khaled', 'Connors, Joseph', 'Toze, Cynthia L', 'Gerrie, Alina S']","['Goy J', 'Gillan TL', 'Bruyere H', 'Huang SJT', 'Hrynchak M', 'Karsan A', 'Ramadan K', 'Connors J', 'Toze CL', 'Gerrie AS']",,"['Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of BC, British Columbia Cancer Agency, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

We investigated whether implantation failures prompted by endosulfan are associated with aberrant ERalpha uterine expression and DNA methylation status during the pre-implantation period. ERalpha-dependent target genes that play a crucial role in the uterine receptivity for embryo attachment and implantation were also investigated. Newborn female rats received corn oil (vehicle, Control), 6 mug/kg/d of endosulfan (Endo6) or 600 mug/kg/d of endosulfan (Endo600) on postnatal days (PND) 1, 3, 5, and 7. On PND90, females were made pregnant and on gestational day 5 (GD5, pre-implantation period) uterine samples were collected. ERalpha expression was assessed at protein and mRNA levels by immunohistochemistry and real time RT-PCR, respectively. ERalpha transcript variants mRNA containing alternative 5'-untranslated regions (5'UTRs) were also evaluated. We searched for predicted transcription factors binding sites in ERalpha regulatory regions and assessed their methylation status by Methylation-Sensitive Restriction Enzymes-PCR technique (MSRE-PCR). The expression of the ERalpha-dependent uterine target genes, i.e. mucin-1 (MUC-1), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), was assessed by real time RT-PCR. Both doses of endosulfan increased the expression of ERalpha and its transcript variants ERalpha-OS, ERalpha-O, ERalpha-OT and ERalpha-E1. Moreover, a decreased DNA methylation levels were detected in some ERalpha regulatory regions, suggesting an epigenetic up-regulation of it transcription. ERalpha overexpression was associated with an induction of its downstream genes, MUC-1 and IGF-1, suggesting that endosulfan might alter the uterine estrogenic pathway compromising uterine receptivity. These alterations could account, at least in part, for the endosulfan-induced implantation failures.","['Milesi, Maria M', 'Varayoud, Jorgelina', 'Ramos, Jorge G', 'Luque, Enrique H']","['Milesi MM', 'Varayoud J', 'Ramos JG', 'Luque EH']",,"['Instituto de Salud y Ambiente del Litoral (ISAL), Facultad de Bioquimica y Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Nacional del Litoral, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET), Santa Fe, Argentina.

Apart from that, apoptosis can be induced by various external stimuli such as hyperthermia, ionizing radiation, and electric fields. Despite advantages, both physical and pharmacological approaches bear some limitations as well. The rationale of this study was to overcome the limitations by combining hyperthermia and apoptotic modulator 'bortezomib' (Velcade). Two types of human blood cancer cell lines were utilized: human leukemic monocyte lymphoma cell U937 line and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) derived from the patient diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. Prior to apoptosis experiments, cytotoxicity tests were performed at three types of temperature regimes (40 degrees , 42 degrees and 44 degrees C). We observed a gradual inhibition of cell viability correlating with an increase of temperature and drug concentration in both cell lines. However, there was no significant difference between sham group and groups of leukemic PMBCs treated by high temperature (44 degrees C) and bortezomib. In U937 cells, combined treatment by heat shock and bortezomib led to an increase the number of cells underwent the late apoptosis stage. At the same time, similar treatment of PMBCs resulted in the stimulation of early apoptosis. Our data suggest that combination of bortezomib and hyperthermia enhances apoptosis induction in human cancer white blood cells, indicating a therapeutic potential for blood cancer therapy.","['Saliev, Timur', 'Feril, Loreto B Jr', 'Begimbetova, Dinara', 'Baiskhanova, Dinara', 'Klodzinskyi, Anton', 'Bobrova, Xeniya', 'Aipov, Rassulbek', 'Baltabayeva, Tolkyn', 'Tachibana, Katsuro']","['Saliev T', 'Feril LB Jr', 'Begimbetova D', 'Baiskhanova D', 'Klodzinskyi A', 'Bobrova X', 'Aipov R', 'Baltabayeva T', 'Tachibana K']",,"['National Laboratory Astana, Nazarbayev University, Astana, Kazakhstan.

The aim of the study was to analyze results of unmanipulated haploidentical allo-SCT (haplo-SCT) for adults with ALL and to identify prognostic factors. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis on 208 adults transplanted in EBMT centers from 2007 to 2014. RESULTS: Median age at haplo-SCT was 32 years and median follow-up, 31 months. Forty-four percent of the patients were in first complete remission (CR1). Stem cell source was the bone marrow (BM) for 43% and peripheral blood (PB) for 57% of patients. Myeloablative conditioning (MAC) was used for 66% and reduced intensity regimen (RIC) for 34% of patients. GVHD prophylaxis was based on post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) for 118 (57%) or on anti-thymocyte-globulin (ATG) for 90 (43%) plus standard prophylaxis. One hundred eighty-four (92%) patients achieved engraftment. Cumulative incidence (CI) of grade II-IV acute-graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) was 31%, grade III-IV 11%, and chronic GVHD 29%. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse-incidence (RI) were 32 and 37%, respectively. Overall survival (OS), leukemia-free survival (LFS), and GVHD-free, relapse-free-survival (GRFS) at 3 years were 33, 31, and 26%. For patients in CR1, OS, LFS, and GRFS were 52, 47, and 40%, respectively. Disease status was the main factor associated with transplant outcomes. Use of BM was independently associated with improvement in NRM, acute GVHD, GRFS, LFS, and OS. CONCLUSIONS: Unmanipulated haplo-SCT may be considered a valid option for adult patients with high-risk ALL lacking HLA identical donor preferably in early disease status.","['Santoro, Nicole', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Gulbas, Zafer', 'Huang, He', 'Afanasyev, Boris', 'Arcese, William', 'Wu, Depei', 'Koc, Yener', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Santarone, Stella', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Santoro N', 'Ruggeri A', 'Labopin M', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Ciceri F', 'Gulbas Z', 'Huang H', 'Afanasyev B', 'Arcese W', 'Wu D', 'Koc Y', 'Tischer J', 'Santarone S', 'Giebel S', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5705-8084'],"['Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Hopital Saint-Antoine, 184 Rue du Faubourg Saint Antoine, 75012, Paris, France. nicole.santoro24@gmail.com.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy. nicole.santoro24@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Hopital Saint-Antoine, 184 Rue du Faubourg Saint Antoine, 75012, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Hopital Saint-Antoine, 184 Rue du Faubourg Saint Antoine, 75012, Paris, France.', 'ALWP office, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology II, Ospedale San Martino, Genova, Italy.', 'Universita cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology Department, Anadolu Medical Center Hospital, Kocaeli, Turkey.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', ""Hematology and Transplantology, Ratsa Gorbacheva Memorial Children's Institute, Saint Petersburg State Medical Pavlov University, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation."", 'Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Department of Hematology, Tor Vergata ""University Hospital"", Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Medical Park Hospitals, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Hospital of Munich-Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Trasfusional Medicine, Lund University, Ospedale Civile, Pescara, Italy.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Onco-Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center M.

Applied in a number of fields, it has become particularly useful in medicine to estimate the survival rate of patients on the basis of their condition, examination results, and undergoing treatment. The recent developments in the next generation sequencing open new opportunities in survival study as they allow vast amount of genome-, transcriptome-, and proteome-related features to be investigated. These include single nucleotide and structural variants, expressions of genes and microRNAs, DNA methylation, and many others. RESULTS: We present LR-Rules, a new algorithm for rule induction from survival data. It works according to the separate-and-conquer heuristics with a use of log-rank test for establishing rule body. Extensive experiments show LR-Rules to generate models of superior accuracy and comprehensibility. The detailed analysis of rules rendered by the presented algorithm on four medical datasets concerning leukemia as well as breast, lung, and thyroid cancers, reveals the ability to discover true relations between attributes and patients' survival rate. Two of the case studies incorporate features obtained with a use of high throughput technologies showing the usability of the algorithm in the analysis of bioinformatics data. CONCLUSIONS: LR-Rules is a viable alternative to existing approaches to survival analysis, particularly when the interpretability of a resulting model is crucial. Presented algorithm may be especially useful when applied on the genomic and proteomic data as it may contribute to the better understanding of the background of diseases and support their treatments.","['Wrobel, Lukasz', 'Gudys, Adam', 'Sikora, Marek']","['Wrobel L', 'Gudys A', 'Sikora M']",,"['Institute of Informatics, Silesian Univ. of Technology, Akademicka 16, Gliwice, 44-100, Poland. lukasz.wrobel@polsl.pl.', 'Institute of Informatics, Silesian Univ. of Technology, Akademicka 16, Gliwice, 44-100, Poland.', 'Institute of Innovative Technologies, EMAG, Leopolda 31, Katowice, 40-189, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170530,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Transcriptome']",PMC5450332,2017/06/01 06:00,2017/10/25 06:00,['2017/06/01 06:00'],"['2016/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12859-017-1693-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12859-017-1693-x [pii]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2017 May 30;18(1):285. doi: 10.1186/s12859-017-1693-x.,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'High throughput sequencing', 'Log-rank test', 'Rule induction', 'Separate-and-conquer', 'Survival analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined the frequency and prognostic impact of somatic mutations in children and adult cases with B-ALL treated with Spanish PETHEMA and SEHOP protocols. METHODS: Mutational status of hotspot regions of TP53, JAK2, PAX5, LEF1, CRLF2 and IL7R genes was determined by next-generation deep sequencing in 340 B-ALL patients (211 children and 129 adults). The associations between mutation status and clinicopathological features at the time of diagnosis, treatment outcome and survival were assessed. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed to identify independent prognostic factors associated with overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and relapse rate (RR). RESULTS: A mutation rate of 12.4% was identified. The frequency of adult mutations was higher (20.2% vs 7.6%, P=0.001). TP53 was the most frequently mutated gene (4.1%), followed by JAK2 (3.8%), CRLF2 (2.9%), PAX5 (2.4%), LEF1 (0.6%) and IL7R (0.3%). All mutations were observed in B-ALL without ETV6-RUNX1 (P=0.047) or BCR-ABL1 fusions (P<0.0001). In children, TP53mut was associated with lower OS (5-year OS: 50% vs 86%, P=0.002) and EFS rates (5-year EFS: 50% vs 78.3%, P=0.009) and higher RR (5-year RR: 33.3% vs 18.6% P=0.037), and was independently associated with higher RR (hazard ratio (HR)=4.5; P=0.04). In adults, TP53mut was associated with a lower OS (5-year OS: 0% vs 43.3%, P=0.019) and a higher RR (5-year RR: 100% vs 61.4%, P=0.029), whereas JAK2mut was associated with a lower EFS (5-year EFS: 0% vs 30.6%, P=0.035) and a higher RR (5-year RR: 100% vs 60.4%, P=0.002). TP53mut was an independent risk factor for shorter OS (HR=2.3; P=0.035) and, together with JAK2mut, also were independent markers of poor prognosis for RR (TP53mut: HR=5.9; P=0.027 and JAK2mut: HR=5.6; P=0.036). CONCLUSIONS: TP53mut and JAK2mut are potential biomarkers associated with poor prognosis in B-ALL patients.","['Forero-Castro, Maribel', 'Robledo, Cristina', 'Benito, Rocio', 'Bodega-Mayor, Irene', 'Rapado, Inmaculada', 'Hernandez-Sanchez, Maria', 'Abaigar, Maria', 'Maria Hernandez-Sanchez, Jesus', 'Quijada-Alamo, Miguel', 'Maria Sanchez-Pina, Jose', 'Sala-Valdes, Monica', 'Araujo-Silva, Fernanda', 'Kohlmann, Alexander', 'Luis Fuster, Jose', 'Arefi, Maryam', 'de Las Heras, Natalia', 'Riesco, Susana', 'Rodriguez, Juan N', 'Hermosin, Lourdes', 'Ribera, Jordi', 'Camos Guijosa, Mireia', 'Ramirez, Manuel', 'de Heredia Rubio, Cristina Diaz', 'Barragan, Eva', 'Martinez, Joaquin', 'Ribera, Jose M', 'Fernandez-Ruiz, Elena', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus-Maria']","['Forero-Castro M', 'Robledo C', 'Benito R', 'Bodega-Mayor I', 'Rapado I', 'Hernandez-Sanchez M', 'Abaigar M', 'Maria Hernandez-Sanchez J', 'Quijada-Alamo M', 'Maria Sanchez-Pina J', 'Sala-Valdes M', 'Araujo-Silva F', 'Kohlmann A', 'Luis Fuster J', 'Arefi M', 'de Las Heras N', 'Riesco S', 'Rodriguez JN', 'Hermosin L', 'Ribera J', 'Camos Guijosa M', 'Ramirez M', 'de Heredia Rubio CD', 'Barragan E', 'Martinez J', 'Ribera JM', 'Fernandez-Ruiz E', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM']",,"['IBSAL, IBMCC, University of Salamanca, CSIC, Cancer Research Center, Campus Miguel de Unamuno, Salamanca 37007, Spain.', 'School of Biological Sciences (GICBUPTC research group), Universidad Pedagogica y Tecnologica de Colombia (UPTC), Avenida Central del Norte 39-115, Tunja 150003, Colombia.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, University of Salamanca, CSIC, Cancer Research Center, Campus Miguel de Unamuno, Salamanca 37007, Spain.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, University of Salamanca, CSIC, Cancer Research Center, Campus Miguel de Unamuno, Salamanca 37007, Spain.', 'Molecular Biology Unit, Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Princesa (IIS-IP), Calle Diego de Leon, 62, Madrid 28006, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital 12 de Octubre, Avenida de Cordoba s/n, Madrid 28041, Spain.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, University of Salamanca, CSIC, Cancer Research Center, Campus Miguel de Unamuno, Salamanca 37007, Spain.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, University of Salamanca, CSIC, Cancer Research Center, Campus Miguel de Unamuno, Salamanca 37007, Spain.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, University of Salamanca, CSIC, Cancer Research Center, Campus Miguel de Unamuno, Salamanca 37007, Spain.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, University of Salamanca, CSIC, Cancer Research Center, Campus Miguel de Unamuno, Salamanca 37007, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital 12 de Octubre, Avenida de Cordoba s/n, Madrid 28041, Spain.', 'Molecular Biology Unit, Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Princesa (IIS-IP), Calle Diego de Leon, 62, Madrid 28006, Spain.', 'Molecular Biology Unit, Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Princesa (IIS-IP), Calle Diego de Leon, 62, Madrid 28006, Spain.', 'Personalised Healthcare and Biomarkers, Innovative Medicines and Early Development Biotech Unit, AstraZeneca, Darwin Building, 310 Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge CB4 0WG, UK.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncohematology, Hospital Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca, Ctra.

In summary healthy MNC show significantly more iNKT/NK/CIK cells compared with AML/ALL/CLL MNC, a shift in the iNKT cell composition is seen in healthy versus leukemic samples and iNKT/NK/CIK cell-proportions in AML/ALL/CLL MNC samples correlate with prognosis. ""Cocktail""-treated AML blasts lead to higher iNKT/NK/CIK cell frequencies and samples with antileukemic activity show significantly higher frequencies of iNKT/NK/CIK cells. Proportions of iNKT/NK/CIK cells should regularly be evaluated in AML/ALL/CLL diagnosis panels for quantitative/prognostic estimation of individual patients' antileukemic potential and their role in dendritic cells/leukemia-derived dendritic cells triggered immune surveillance.","['Boeck, Corinna L', 'Amberger, Daniel C', 'Doraneh-Gard, Fatemeh', 'Sutanto, Wishnu', 'Guenther, Thomas', 'Schmohl, Joerg', 'Schuster, Friedhelm', 'Salih, Helmut', 'Babor, Florian', 'Borkhardt, Arndt', 'Schmetzer, Helga']","['Boeck CL', 'Amberger DC', 'Doraneh-Gard F', 'Sutanto W', 'Guenther T', 'Schmohl J', 'Schuster F', 'Salih H', 'Babor F', 'Borkhardt A', 'Schmetzer H']",,"['*Department of Hematopoetic Cell Transplantation, Medicine Department 3, University Hospital of Munich, Munich daggerDepartment of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Tuebingen, Tuebingen double daggerDepartment of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital of Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cytokine-Induced Killer Cells/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",,2017/05/31 06:00,2018/03/20 06:00,['2017/05/31 06:00'],"['2017/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/CJI.0000000000000171 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother. 2017 Jul/Aug;40(6):224-248. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0000000000000171.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We described cancers in pediatric recipients and compared incidence to the general population. METHODS: The US transplant registry was linked to 16 cancer registries to identify cancer diagnoses among recipients <18 years old at transplant. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were estimated by dividing observed cancer counts among recipients by expected counts based on the general population rates. Cox regression was used to estimate the associations between recipient characteristics and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) risk. RESULTS: Among 17 958 pediatric recipients, 392 cancers were diagnosed, of which 279 (71%) were NHL. Compared with the general population, incidence was significantly increased for NHL (SIR = 212, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 188-238), Hodgkin's lymphoma (SIR = 19, 95% CI = 13-26), leukemia (SIR = 4, 95% CI = 2-7), myeloma (SIR = 229, 95% CI = 47-671), and cancers of the liver, soft tissue, ovary, vulva, testis, bladder, kidney, and thyroid. NHL risk was highest during the first year after transplantation among recipients <5 years old at transplant (SIR = 313), among recipients seronegative for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) at transplant (SIR = 446), and among intestine transplant recipients (SIR = 1280). In multivariable analyses, seronegative EBV status, the first year after transplantation, intestine transplantation, and induction immunosuppression were independently associated with higher NHL incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric recipients have a markedly increased risk for many cancers. NHL constitutes the majority of diagnosed cancers, with the highest risk occurring in the first year after transplantation. NHL risk was high in recipients susceptible to primary EBV infection after transplant and in intestine transplant recipients, perhaps due to EBV transmission in the donor organ.","['Yanik, Elizabeth L', 'Smith, Jodi M', 'Shiels, Meredith S', 'Clarke, Christina A', 'Lynch, Charles F', 'Kahn, Amy R', 'Koch, Lori', 'Pawlish, Karen S', 'Engels, Eric A']","['Yanik EL', 'Smith JM', 'Shiels MS', 'Clarke CA', 'Lynch CF', 'Kahn AR', 'Koch L', 'Pawlish KS', 'Engels EA']",,"['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland; yanike@wudosis.wustl.edu.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland.', 'Cancer Prevention Institute of California, Fremont, California.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa.', 'New York State Cancer Registry, Albany, New York.', 'Illinois State Cancer Registry, Springfield, Illinois; and.', 'New Jersey State Cancer Registry, Trenton, New Jersey.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland.']",['eng'],['P30 CA086862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/adverse effects', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Organ Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC5404730,2017/05/31 06:00,2017/08/11 06:00,['2017/05/31 06:00'],"['2017/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['peds.2016-3893 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2016-3893 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2017 May;139(5). pii: peds.2016-3893. doi: 10.1542/peds.2016-3893.,,,"['POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST: Dr Clarke is employed by GRAIL, Inc and has', 'received grant funding from Genentech; the other authors have indicated they have', 'no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.']",['Copyright (c) 2017 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.'],,,,,['Pediatrics. 2017 May;139(5):.

OBJECTIVES: The effect of COPD on alveolar macrophage (AM) microbicidal responses was investigated. METHODS: AMs were obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage from healthy donors or patients with COPD and challenged with opsonized serotype 14 Streptococcus pneumoniae. Cells were assessed for apoptosis, bactericidal activity, and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) production. A transgenic mouse line in which the CD68 promoter ensures macrophage-specific expression of human induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein Mcl-1 (CD68.hMcl-1) was used to model the molecular aspects of COPD. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: COPD AMs had elevated levels of Mcl-1, an antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 family member, with selective reduction of delayed intracellular bacterial killing. CD68.hMcl-1 AMs phenocopied the microbicidal defect because transgenic mice demonstrated impaired clearance of pulmonary bacteria and increased neutrophilic inflammation. Murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and human monocyte-derived macrophages generated mROS in response to pneumococci, which colocalized with bacteria and phagolysosomes to enhance bacterial killing. The Mcl-1 transgene increased oxygen consumption rates and mROS expression in mock-infected bone marrow-derived macrophages but reduced caspase-dependent mROS production after pneumococcal challenge. COPD AMs also increased basal mROS expression, but they failed to increase production after pneumococcal challenge, in keeping with reduced intracellular bacterial killing. The defect in COPD AM intracellular killing was associated with a reduced ratio of mROS/superoxide dismutase 2. CONCLUSIONS: Up-regulation of Mcl-1 and chronic adaption to oxidative stress alter mitochondrial metabolism and microbicidal function, reducing the delayed phase of intracellular bacterial clearance in COPD.","['Bewley, Martin A', 'Preston, Julie A', 'Mohasin, Mohammed', 'Marriott, Helen M', 'Budd, Richard C', 'Swales, Julie', 'Collini, Paul', 'Greaves, David R', 'Craig, Ruth W', 'Brightling, Christopher E', 'Donnelly, Louise E', 'Barnes, Peter J', 'Singh, Dave', 'Shapiro, Steven D', 'Whyte, Moira K B', 'Dockrell, David H']","['Bewley MA', 'Preston JA', 'Mohasin M', 'Marriott HM', 'Budd RC', 'Swales J', 'Collini P', 'Greaves DR', 'Craig RW', 'Brightling CE', 'Donnelly LE', 'Barnes PJ', 'Singh D', 'Shapiro SD', 'Whyte MKB', 'Dockrell DH']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2718-4861'],"['1 The Florey Institute for Host-Pathogen Interactions and.', '2 Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, University of Sheffield Medical School, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', '1 The Florey Institute for Host-Pathogen Interactions and.', '2 Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, University of Sheffield Medical School, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', '1 The Florey Institute for Host-Pathogen Interactions and.', '2 Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, University of Sheffield Medical School, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', '1 The Florey Institute for Host-Pathogen Interactions and.', '2 Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, University of Sheffield Medical School, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', '1 The Florey Institute for Host-Pathogen Interactions and.', '2 Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, University of Sheffield Medical School, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', '3 Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', '1 The Florey Institute for Host-Pathogen Interactions and.', '2 Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, University of Sheffield Medical School, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', '1 The Florey Institute for Host-Pathogen Interactions and.', '2 Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, University of Sheffield Medical School, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', '3 Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', '4 Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', '5 Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Geisel School of Medicine, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire.', '6 Instiute for Lung Heath, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom.', '7 Airway Disease National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', '7 Airway Disease National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', '8 Centre for Respiratory and Allergy, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', '9 Medicines Evaluation Unit, Manchester, United Kingdom.', '10 University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom.', '11 Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and.', '12 Department of Respiratory Medicine.', '13 MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, and.', '13 MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, and.', '14 Department of Infection Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['076945 /WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MR/N02995X/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'RG/15/10/31485/BHF_/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom', 'G0901963/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G1001372/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,9421642,['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Infective Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Macrophages, Alveolar/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/*metabolism/physiopathology']",PMC5649972,2017/05/31 06:00,2017/10/13 06:00,['2017/05/31 06:00'],"['2017/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1164/rccm.201608-1714OC [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2017 Oct 1;196(7):845-855. doi: 10.1164/rccm.201608-1714OC.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Streptococcus pneumoniae', '*apoptosis', '*mitochondrial reactive oxygen species']",,,,,,,['Sci Transl Med. 2017 Jun 21;9(395):.

Allopurinol is one of the most frequently reported drugs accounting for DRESS syndrome development. In contrast to allopurinol, DRESS syndrome induced by teicoplanin has not been reported frequently. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-year-old woman was admitted to receive FLAG chemotherapy regimen (fludarabine, cytarabine (high-dose Ara-C), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) for relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treatment. Allopurinol was initiated at a dose of 300 mg per day 48 hours before chemotherapy regimen initiation, for tumour lysis syndrome prophylaxis. Seven days after allopurinol initiation, the patient presented with fever, dyspnoea, shortening of breath, facial oedema, generalized pruritus, erythema and macular rash affecting the face, abdomen, trunk, upper and lower limbs and an elevation in hepatic enzymes. Allopurinol was immediately discontinued and intravenous hydrocortisone was started concomitantly alongside other supportive measures. About 72 hours later, pruritus, erythema and rash were ameliorated and abnormalities in liver tests were improved. Afterwards, teicoplanin administration led to severe deterioration of pruritus, erythema and rash; subsequently, serum alanine aminotransferase increased again and episodes of worsening dyspnea occurred. Signs of hypersensitivity reaction were reduced by discontinuation of teicoplanin and supportive care. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: We report a case of allopurinol-induced DRESS syndrome, which was exacerbated by administration of teicoplanin. It can be suggested that the administration of drugs with high possibility of hypersensitivity reactions should be avoided during the acute phase of DRESS syndrome.","['Taghvaye Masoumi, H', 'Hadjibabaie, M', 'Zarif-Yeganeh, M', 'Arasteh, O']","['Taghvaye Masoumi H', 'Hadjibabaie M', 'Zarif-Yeganeh M', 'Arasteh O']",,"['Clinical Pharmacy Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Research Center for Rational Use of Drugs, and Clinical Pharmacy Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and SCT Research Center, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Clinical Pharmacy Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20170529,England,J Clin Pharm Ther,Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,8704308,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Gout Suppressants)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '61036-62-2 (Teicoplanin)', '63CZ7GJN5I (Allopurinol)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'FLAG protocol']",IM,"['Allopurinol/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Hypersensitivity Syndrome/*etiology', 'Female', 'Gout Suppressants/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Teicoplanin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",,2017/05/31 06:00,2018/05/11 06:00,['2017/05/31 06:00'],"['2017/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcpt.12556 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharm Ther. 2017 Oct;42(5):642-645. doi: 10.1111/jcpt.12556.

This study is the first to examine the role of LRF in CNS pathology. We first examined LRF expression in a murine viral model of spinal cord demyelination with clinically relevant lesion characteristics. LRF was rarely expressed in oligodendrocyte progenitors (OP) yet, was detected in nuclei of the majority of oligodendrocytes in healthy adult CNS and during remyelination. Plp/CreER(T) :Zbtb7a(fl/fl) mice were then used with cuprizone demyelination to determine the effect of LRF knockdown on oligodendrocyte repopulation and remyelination. Cuprizone was given for 6 weeks to demyelinate the corpus callosum. Tamoxifen was administered at 4, 5, or 6 weeks after the start of cuprizone. Tamoxifen-induced knockdown of LRF impaired remyelination during 3 or 6-week recovery periods after cuprizone. LRF knockdown earlier within the oligodendrocyte lineage using NG2CreER(T) :Zbtb7a(fl/fl) mice reduced myelination after 6 weeks of cuprizone. LRF knockdown from either the Plp/CreER(T) line or the NG2CreER(T) line did not significantly change OP or oligodendrocyte populations. In vitro promoter assays demonstrated the potential for LRF to regulate transcription of myelin-related genes and the notch target Hes5, which has been implicated in control of myelin formation and repair. In summary, in the oligodendrocyte lineage, LRF is expressed mainly in oligodendrocytes but is not required for oligodendrocyte repopulation of demyelinated lesions. Furthermore, LRF can modulate the extent of remyelination, potentially by contributing to interactions regulating transcription.","['Davidson, Nathan L', 'Yu, Fengshan', 'Kijpaisalratana, Naruchorn', 'Le, Tuan Q', 'Beer, Laurel A', 'Radomski, Kryslaine L', 'Armstrong, Regina C']","['Davidson NL', 'Yu F', 'Kijpaisalratana N', 'Le TQ', 'Beer LA', 'Radomski KL', 'Armstrong RC']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9624-623X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7296-6750']","['Program in Neuroscience, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy, Physiology, and Genetics, Uniformed Services, University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Anatomy, Physiology, and Genetics, Uniformed Services, University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy, Physiology, and Genetics, Uniformed Services, University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy, Physiology, and Genetics, Uniformed Services, University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Program in Neuroscience, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy, Physiology, and Genetics, Uniformed Services, University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170530,United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zbtb7a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Lineage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oligodendroglia/cytology/*metabolism', 'Remyelination/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",PMC5655903,2017/05/31 06:00,2018/06/09 06:00,['2017/05/31 06:00'],"['2016/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jnr.24083 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 2017 Dec;95(12):2391-2408. doi: 10.1002/jnr.24083.

METHODS: This study analyzed data from patients with AML who were enrolled in successive protocols (AML97 and AML02) to determine the contributors to the improved outcomes of the latter clinical trial. RESULTS: There were significant improvements in 5-year overall survival (48.9% vs 71.2%; P < .0001) and event-free survival (43.5% vs 61.8%; P = .002) from AML97 to AML02. The 5-year cumulative incidence of early death (ED)/treatment-related mortality (TRM) was reduced for patients treated in AML02 (18.5% vs 7.9%; P = .007). Although the overall incidence of refractory disease (6.5% vs 5.6%; P = .736) and relapse (29.3% vs 21.0%; P = .12) did not differ between the 2 studies, patients with low-risk AML who were treated in AML02 had a reduced incidence of relapse (27.3% vs 8.8%; P = .036). CONCLUSIONS: The improved outcomes of the AML02 trial resulted from improved disease control for low-risk patients and overall decreased ED/TRM. These results emphasize the importance of supportive-care measures throughout chemotherapy courses and hematopoietic cell transplantation and the value of treatment intensity for patients with low-risk AML while underscoring the need for novel therapy, rather than increased therapy intensity, for children with high-risk AML.

Specific data regarding the impact of different cytarabine schedules and/or antibacterial regimens for NEC are sparse. The aim of the study was to identify the predictors of outcome within 30 days of NEC onset. NEC episodes were retrospectively pinpointed among 440 patients with newly diagnosed AML hospitalized in our Institution, over a 10-year period, for receiving chemotherapy protocols with 100-6000 mg/m(2) daily of cytarabine. Two subgroups, survivors versus nonsurvivors, were compared by using logistic regression analysis. NEC was documented in 100 of 420 (23.8%) analyzed patients: 42.5% had received high-dose cytarabine, whereas 19% and 15% intermediate-dose and standard-dose cytarabine, respectively (P < 0.001). The 30-day NEC attributable mortality rate was 23%. In univariate analysis, antileukemic protocols containing robust dosages of cytarabine were significantly associated with high mortality (P < 0.001); whereas, standard-dose cytarabine and prompt initiation (at the ultrasonographic appearance of intestinal mural thickening) of NEC therapy with antibiotic combinations including tigecycline were significantly associated with low mortality. In multivariate analysis, high-dose cytarabine-containing chemotherapy was the independent predictor of poor outcome (odds ratio [OR]: 0.109; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.032-0.364; P < 0.001), whereas ultrasonography-driven NEC therapy with antibiotic regimens including tigecycline was associated with a favorable outcome (OR: 13.161; 95% CI: 1.587-109.17; P = 0.017). Chemotherapy schedules with robust dosages of cytarabine for AML remission are associated with a high rate of NEC incidence and attributable. Vigorous antibacterial therapy, triggered off pathologic ultrasonographic findings, with drug combinations which have broad antimicrobial coverage and good gut penetration, specifically those also including tigecycline, may be effective in improving 30-day survival rate after NEC onset.","['Pugliese, Novella', 'Salvatore, Paola', 'Iula, Dora Vita', 'Catania, Maria Rosaria', 'Chiurazzi, Federico', 'Della Pepa, Roberta', 'Cerchione, Claudio', 'Raimondo, Marta', 'Giordano, Claudia', 'Simeone, Luigia', 'Caruso, Simona', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Picardi, Marco']","['Pugliese N', 'Salvatore P', 'Iula DV', 'Catania MR', 'Chiurazzi F', 'Della Pepa R', 'Cerchione C', 'Raimondo M', 'Giordano C', 'Simeone L', 'Caruso S', 'Pane F', 'Picardi M']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2714-5109'],"['Departments of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University Medical School, Naples, Italy.', 'Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnology, Federico II University Medical School, Naples, Italy.', 'Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnology, Federico II University Medical School, Naples, Italy.', 'Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnology, Federico II University Medical School, Naples, Italy.', 'Departments of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University Medical School, Naples, Italy.', 'Departments of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University Medical School, Naples, Italy.', 'Departments of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University Medical School, Naples, Italy.', 'Departments of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University Medical School, Naples, Italy.', 'Departments of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University Medical School, Naples, Italy.', 'Departments of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University Medical School, Naples, Italy.', 'Departments of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University Medical School, Naples, Italy.', 'Departments of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University Medical School, Naples, Italy.', 'Advanced Biomedical Sciences, Federico II University Medical School, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170526,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '70JE2N95KR (Tigecycline)', 'FYY3R43WGO (Minocycline)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease Management', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Enterocolitis, Neutropenic/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minocycline/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Mortality', 'Remission Induction', 'Tigecycline', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ultrasonography', 'Workflow', 'Young Adult']",PMC5504336,2017/05/31 06:00,2018/03/30 06:00,['2017/05/31 06:00'],"['2016/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/10 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/30 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.1063 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2017 Jul;6(7):1500-1511. doi: 10.1002/cam4.1063.

Accumulating evidence suggests that EMT inducers also lead to a gain in mesenchymal properties and promote malignancy of nonepithelial tumors. In this review, we present and discuss current findings, illustrating the importance of EMT inducers in tumors originating from nonepithelial/mesenchymal tissues, including brain tumors, hematopoietic malignancies, and sarcomas. Among these tumors, the involvement of mesenchymal transition has been most extensively investigated in glioblastoma, providing proof for cell autonomous and microenvironment-derived stimuli that provoke EMT-like processes that regulate stem cell, invasive, and immunogenic properties as well as therapy resistance. The involvement of prominent EMT transcription factor families, such as TWIST, SNAI, and ZEB, in promoting therapy resistance and tumor aggressiveness has also been reported in lymphomas, leukemias, and sarcomas. A reverse process, resembling mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), seems particularly relevant for sarcomas, where (partial) epithelial differentiation is linked to less aggressive tumors and a better patient prognosis. Overall, a hybrid model in which more stable epithelial and mesenchymal intermediates exist likely extends to the biology of tumors originating from sources other than the epithelium. Deeper investigation and understanding of the EMT/MET machinery in nonepithelial tumors will shed light on the pathogenesis of these tumors, potentially paving the way toward the identification of clinically relevant biomarkers for prognosis and future therapeutic targets.","['Kahlert, Ulf D', 'Joseph, Justin V', 'Kruyt, Frank A E']","['Kahlert UD', 'Joseph JV', 'Kruyt FAE']",,"['Department of Neurosurgery, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170619,United States,Mol Oncol,Molecular oncology,101308230,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', '*Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', '*Neoplasms/diagnosis/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC5496495,2017/05/31 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2017/05/31 06:00'],"['2017/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1878-0261.12085 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Oncol. 2017 Jul;11(7):860-877. doi: 10.1002/1878-0261.12085.

Inhibitors of ABL tyrosine kinase, such as imatinib and dasatinib, exhibit remarkable therapeutic effects, although emergence of drug resistance hampers the therapy during long-term treatment. An alternative approach to treat CML is to downregulate the BCR-ABL protein. We have devised a protein knockdown system by hybrid molecules named Specific and Non-genetic inhibitor of apoptosis protein [IAP]-dependent Protein Erasers (SNIPER), which is designed to induce IAP-mediated ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of target proteins, and a couple of SNIPER(ABL) against BCR-ABL protein have been developed recently. In this study, we tested various combinations of ABL inhibitors and IAP ligands, and the linker was optimized for protein knockdown activity of SNIPER(ABL). The resulting SNIPER(ABL)-39, in which dasatinib is conjugated to an IAP ligand LCL161 derivative by polyethylene glycol (PEG) x 3 linker, shows a potent activity to degrade the BCR-ABL protein. Mechanistic analysis suggested that both cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1) and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) play a role in the degradation of BCR-ABL protein. Consistent with the degradation of BCR-ABL protein, the SNIPER(ABL)-39 inhibited the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and Crk like proto-oncogene (CrkL), and suppressed the growth of BCR-ABL-positive CML cells. These results suggest that SNIPER(ABL)-39 could be a candidate for a degradation-based novel anti-cancer drug against BCR-ABL-positive CML.","['Shibata, Norihito', 'Miyamoto, Naoki', 'Nagai, Katsunori', 'Shimokawa, Kenichiro', 'Sameshima, Tomoya', 'Ohoka, Nobumichi', 'Hattori, Takayuki', 'Imaeda, Yasuhiro', 'Nara, Hiroshi', 'Cho, Nobuo', 'Naito, Mikihiko']","['Shibata N', 'Miyamoto N', 'Nagai K', 'Shimokawa K', 'Sameshima T', 'Ohoka N', 'Hattori T', 'Imaeda Y', 'Nara H', 'Cho N', 'Naito M']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0451-1337'],"['Division of Molecular Target and Gene Therapy Products, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Pharmaceutical Research Division, Takeda Pharmaceutical, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Pharmaceutical Research Division, Takeda Pharmaceutical, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Pharmaceutical Research Division, Takeda Pharmaceutical, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Pharmaceutical Research Division, Takeda Pharmaceutical, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Target and Gene Therapy Products, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Target and Gene Therapy Products, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Pharmaceutical Research Division, Takeda Pharmaceutical, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Pharmaceutical Research Division, Takeda Pharmaceutical, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Pharmaceutical Research Division, Takeda Pharmaceutical, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Target and Gene Therapy Products, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170619,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (LCL161)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dasatinib/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Ligands', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Proteolysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Thiazoles/*chemistry', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects']",PMC5543464,2017/05/31 06:00,2017/09/29 06:00,['2017/05/31 06:00'],"['2017/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.13284 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2017 Aug;108(8):1657-1666. doi: 10.1111/cas.13284.

This study sought to investigate the association of EMD with outcomes following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). METHODS: This single-center retrospective study investigated the impact of EMD at diagnosis on the outcome of patients transplanted for AML in first complete remission (CR1). The study included 303 consecutive patients with AML transplanted in CR1, median age 51 years (range 18-71). RESULTS: EMD at diagnosis was documented in 39 patients (13%), either histologically (26 patients) or clinically/radiologically (13 patients). Among the 39 EMD patients, 16 had CNS disease, seven had gingival infiltration, and five had leukemia cutis. On univariate analysis, EMD had no significant impact on survival, with a 3-year OS of 55% (95% CI 38-69) compared to 48% for the non-EMD group (95% CI 42%-55%) (P=.84). Likewise, 3-year CIR was 18% vs 19% (P=.86) and 3-year NRM was 26% vs 33% (P=.83) for EMD vs non-EMD groups, respectively. Multivariate analysis confirmed these results.

In addition to the previous reports from aerial parts of this plant, studies related to antiproliferative or antimicrobial activity from the roots are warranted. OBJECTIVE: To investigate antiproliferative and antimicrobial activity of compounds/mixture (1-8) isolated and characterized from the roots of O. biennis L. A possible mechanism of antiproliferative activity was also studied by targeting ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and cathepsin D (CATD). STUDY DESIGN: Antiproliferative efficacy of the compounds/mixture was examined in selected cancer cell lines along with their probable mechanism of action. The antimicrobial activity was also studied against selected microbes (bacteria and fungi). METHODS: Antiproliferative potential was evaluated by MTT assay against selected cell lines. The mechanism of action was studied spectrophotometrically by targeting ODC and CATD using both an in-vitro and an in-silico approach. The antimicrobial efficiency was analysed using the disc diffusion and broth dilution methods. KEY FINDINGS: Oenotheralanosterol B (3) and the mixture of oenotheralanosterol A and oenotheralanosterol B (4) exhibited antiproliferative activity against breast, hepatic, prostate and leukaemia cancer cell lines as well as in mouse macrophages (IC50 8.35-49.69 mug/ml). Oenotheralanosterol B (3) and the mixture of oenotheralanosterol A and oenotheralanosterol B (4) displayed a strong molecular interaction with succinate dehydrogenase (binding energy -6.23 and -6.84 kcal/mol and Ki 27.03 and 9.6 mum, respectively). Oenotheralanosterol A (1), oenotheralanosterol B (3) and mixture of oenotheralanosterol A and oenotheralanosterol B (4) potently inhibited the ODC activity with IC50 ranging from 4.65 +/- 0.35 to 19.06 +/- 4.16 mug/ml and also showed a strong interaction with ODC (BE -4.17 to -4.46 kcal/mol). Oenotheralanosterol A (1), cetoleilyl diglucoside (2), oenotheralanosterol B (3), dihydroxyprenylxanthone acetylated (6) and dihydroxyprenylxanthone (7) inhibited CATD activity (IC50 3.95 +/- 0.49 to 24.35 +/- 2.89 mug/ml). The in-silico molecular interaction analysis of compounds with CATD revealed the non-specific interaction. A moderate antimicrobial activity was observed against selected microbes with a growth inhibition ranging from 6 to 14 mm and minimum inhibitory concentration between 125 and 500 mug/ml. Oenotheralanosterol B (3) and dihydroxyprenylxanthone acetylated (6) exhibited better antimicrobial activity with an MIC range from 62.50 to 500 mug/ml. CONCLUSION: Oenotheralanosterol B (3) exhibited stronger antiproliferative and antimicrobial potential with respect to the other compounds tested, whereas oenotheralanosterol A (1) was a potent inhibitor of ODC and CATD. Hence, it is suggested that these in-vitro findings could be studied further in vivo for biological activity, safety evaluation and derivatization to enhance potency and efficacy.","['Singh, Shilpi', 'Dubey, Vijaya', 'Singh, Dhananjay Kumar', 'Fatima, Kaneez', 'Ahmad, Ateeque', 'Luqman, Suaib']","['Singh S', 'Dubey V', 'Singh DK', 'Fatima K', 'Ahmad A', 'Luqman S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6568-8107'],"['Molecular Bioprospection Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.', 'Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.', 'Molecular Bioprospection Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.', 'Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.', 'Molecular Bioprospection Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.', 'Molecular Bioprospection Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.', 'Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.', 'Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.', 'Process Chemistry and Technology Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.', 'Molecular Bioprospection Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.', 'Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170529,England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'EC 3.4.23.5 (Cathepsin D)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Infective Agents/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Cathepsin D/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Oenothera biennis/*chemistry', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Plant Roots']",,2017/05/31 06:00,2018/05/02 06:00,['2017/05/31 06:00'],"['2016/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jphp.12753 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2017 Sep;69(9):1230-1243. doi: 10.1111/jphp.12753.

This study was designed to investigate the effects of ellipticine on the proliferation and apoptosis of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: RA-FLSs were exposed to different concentrations of ellipticine (i.e., 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 muM) for 24-72h and measured for viability, proliferation and apoptosis. The involvement of signal transducer and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling in the action of ellipticine was determined by Western blot analysis, luciferase reporter assay and rescue experiments. RESULTS: Ellipticine treatment significantly inhibited the viability and proliferation of RA-FLSs in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, ellipticine exposure did not alter the viability of normal human FLSs. Moreover, ellipticine triggered significant apoptosis and increased caspase-3 activity in RA-FLSs. Mechanistically, ellipticine reduced the phosphorylation of STAT3 and downregulated the expression of Mcl-1, cyclin D1 and Bcl-2. Luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that ellipticine treatment led to a significant inhibition of STAT3-mediated transcriptional activity in RA-FLSs. Overexpression of constitutively active STAT3 reversed the suppressive effects of ellipticine on RA-FLSs, which was accompanied by restoration of Mcl-1, cyclin D1 and Bcl-2. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Ellipticine shows anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on RA-FLSs through inhibition of the STAT3 pathway and may have therapeutic potential in RA.","['Wen, Hui-Long', 'Yang, Guang', 'Dong, Qi-Rong']","['Wen HL', 'Yang G', 'Dong QR']",,"['a Department of Orthopedics , The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , China.', 'a Department of Orthopedics , The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , China.', 'a Department of Orthopedics , The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170530,England,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol,Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology,8800150,"['0 (Ellipticines)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '117VLW7484 (ellipticine)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Ellipticines/*pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Synovial Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Synoviocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",,2017/05/31 06:00,2018/03/22 06:00,['2017/05/31 06:00'],"['2017/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08923973.2017.1327963 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol. 2017 Aug;39(4):219-224. doi: 10.1080/08923973.2017.1327963.

This phenomenon has been termed clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Frequency of such clonal somatic mutations increases with age: in 5-10% of people older than 70 years and around 20% of people older than 90 years. The most commonly mutated genes found in individuals with CHIP were epigenetic regulators, including DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), Ten-eleven-translocation 2 (TET2), and Additional sex combs-like 1 (ASXL1), which are also recurrently mutated in myeloid malignancies. Recent functional studies have uncovered pleiotropic effect of mutations in DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 in hematopoietic stem cell regulation and leukemic transformation. Of note, CHIP is associated with an increased risk of hematologic malignancy and all-cause mortality, albeit the annual risk of leukemic transformation was relatively low (0.5-1%). These findings suggest that clonal hematopoiesis per se may not be sufficient to engender preleukemic state. Further studies are required to decipher the exact mechanism by which preleukemic stem cells originate and transform into a full-blown leukemic state.","['Kunimoto, Hiroyoshi', 'Nakajima, Hideaki']","['Kunimoto H', 'Nakajima H']",,"['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Immune Regulation, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-9 Fukuura, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama, 236-0004, Japan. hnakajim@yokohama-cu.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170529,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Anemia, Aplastic/complications/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism', 'Clonal Evolution/genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mutation', '*Precancerous Conditions']",,2017/05/31 06:00,2017/07/08 06:00,['2017/05/31 06:00'],"['2017/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-017-2257-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-017-2257-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2017 Jul;106(1):34-44. doi: 10.1007/s12185-017-2257-6.

To overcome this resistance, we developed an innovative approach based on NK cell stimulation with Toll-like receptor (TLR)-activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). The translation of this approach into the clinic requires the production of high numbers of human pDC. Herein, we show that in vitro differentiation of cord blood CD34(+) progenitors in the presence of aryl hydrocarbon receptor antagonists gives rise to clinically relevant numbers of pDC, as about 10(8) pDC can be produced from a typical cord blood unit. Blocking the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway significantly increased the yield of pDC. When compared to pDC isolated from peripheral blood, in vitro differentiated pDC (ivD-pDC) exhibited an increased capacity to induce NK cell-mediated killing of ALL. Although ivD-pDC produced lower amounts of IFN-alpha than peripheral blood pDC upon TLR activation, they produced more IFN-lambda2, known to play a critical role in the induction of anti-tumoral NK cell functions. Both TLR-9 and TLR-7 ligands triggered pDC-induced NK cell activation, offering the possibility to use any clinical-grade TLR-7 or TLR-9 ligands in future clinical trials. Finally, adoptive transfer of ivD-pDC cultured in the presence of an AHR antagonist cured humanized mice with minimal ALL disease. Collectively, our results pave the way to clinical-grade production of sufficient numbers of human pDC for innate immunotherapy against ALL and other refractory malignancies.","['Diaz-Rodriguez, Yildian', 'Cordeiro, Paulo', 'Belounis, Assila', 'Herblot, Sabine', 'Duval, Michel']","['Diaz-Rodriguez Y', 'Cordeiro P', 'Belounis A', 'Herblot S', 'Duval M']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8702-7262'],"['Unite de recherche en hemato-oncologie Charles-Bruneau, Centre de Recherche du CHU Sainte-Justine, 3175, Cote Sainte-Catherine, Montreal, QC, H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Departement de Microbiologie, Infectiologie and Immunologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Unite de recherche en hemato-oncologie Charles-Bruneau, Centre de Recherche du CHU Sainte-Justine, 3175, Cote Sainte-Catherine, Montreal, QC, H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Unite de recherche en hemato-oncologie Charles-Bruneau, Centre de Recherche du CHU Sainte-Justine, 3175, Cote Sainte-Catherine, Montreal, QC, H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Departement de Microbiologie, Infectiologie and Immunologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Unite de recherche en hemato-oncologie Charles-Bruneau, Centre de Recherche du CHU Sainte-Justine, 3175, Cote Sainte-Catherine, Montreal, QC, H3T 1C5, Canada. sabine.herblot@umontreal.ca.', 'Departement de Microbiologie, Infectiologie and Immunologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada. sabine.herblot@umontreal.ca.', 'Departement de Pediatrie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada. sabine.herblot@umontreal.ca.', 'Unite de recherche en hemato-oncologie Charles-Bruneau, Centre de Recherche du CHU Sainte-Justine, 3175, Cote Sainte-Catherine, Montreal, QC, H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Departement de Microbiologie, Infectiologie and Immunologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Departement de Pediatrie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170529,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology']",PMC5626790,2017/05/31 06:00,2017/12/06 06:00,['2017/05/31 06:00'],"['2016/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00262-017-2022-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00262-017-2022-y [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2017 Oct;66(10):1307-1320. doi: 10.1007/s00262-017-2022-y.

TRIM22 is constitutively expressed in a subset of U937 cell clones poorly permissive to HIV-1 replication, whereas CIITA has been shown to inhibit virus multiplication in both T lymphocytic and myeloid cells, including poorly HIV-1 permissive U937 cells, by suppressing Tat-mediated transactivation of HIV-1 transcription. Therefore, we tested whether TRIM22 and CIITA could form a nuclear complex potentially endowed with HIV-1 repressive functions. Indeed, we observed that TRIM22, independent of its E3 ubiquitin ligase domain, interacts with CIITA and promotes its recruitment into nuclear bodies. Importantly, TRIM19/promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, another repressor of HIV-1 transcription also acting before proviral integration, colocalize in these nuclear bodies upon TRIM22 expression induced by IFN-gamma. Finally, tTRIM22 nuclear bodies also contained CyclinT1, a crucial elongation factor of HIV-1 primary transcripts. These findings show that TRIM22 nuclear bodies are a site of recruitment of factors crucial for the regulation of HIV-1 transcription and highlight the potential existence of a concerted action between TRIM22, CIITA, and TRIM19/PML to maintain a state of proviral latency, at least in myeloid cells.","['Forlani, Greta', 'Tosi, Giovanna', 'Turrini, Filippo', 'Poli, Guido', 'Vicenzi, Elisa', 'Accolla, Roberto S']","['Forlani G', 'Tosi G', 'Turrini F', 'Poli G', 'Vicenzi E', 'Accolla RS']",,"['Laboratory of General Pathology and Immunology, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy.', 'Laboratory of General Pathology and Immunology, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy.', 'Viral Pathogens and Biosafety Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'AIDS Immunopathogenesis Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'School of Medicine, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milano, Italy.', 'Viral Pathogens and Biosafety Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Laboratory of General Pathology and Immunology, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170515,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,PMC5430032,2017/05/31 06:00,2017/05/31 06:01,['2017/05/31 06:00'],"['2017/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/31 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2017.00564 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2017 May 15;8:564. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.00564. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['CIITA', 'CyclinT1', 'HIV-1 restriction factors', 'TRIM19/PML', 'nuclear bodies', 'tripartite motif-containing protein 22']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore conducted a phase 1/2 study of mitoxantrone, etoposide and cytarabine following 'priming' with 5-10 days of decitabine (dec/MEC) in 52 adults (median age 55 (range: 19-72) years) with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or other high-grade myeloid neoplasms. During dose escalation in cohorts of 6-12 patients, all dose levels were well tolerated. As response rates appeared similar with 7 and 10 days of decitabine, a 7-day course was defined as the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Among 46 patients treated at/above the RP2D, 10 (22%) achieved a complete remission (CR), 8 without measurable residual disease; five additional patients achieved CR with incomplete platelet recovery, for an overall response rate of 33%. Seven patients (15%) died within 28 days of treatment initiation. Infection/neutropenic fever, nausea and mucositis were the most common adverse events. While the CR rate compared favorably to a matched historic control population (observed/expected CR ratio=1.77), CR rate and survival were similar to two contemporary salvage regimens used at our institution (G-CLAC (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF); clofarabine; cytarabine) and G-CLAM (G-CSF; cladribine; cytarabine; mitoxantrone)).

The lipid-activated nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARdelta) accounts for a number of properties of aggressive cancers and was found to enhance Janus kinase (JAK)-mediated phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins in B lymphoma cell lines and primary CLL cells. Autocrine production of cytokines such as IL10 and interferon-beta was not increased by PPARdelta but signaling responses to these cytokines were amplified and associated with increased cholesterol biosynthesis and plasma membrane levels. Plasmalemmal cholesterol and STAT phosphorylation from type 1 interferons (IFNs) were increased by PPARdelta agonists, transgenes and exogenous cholesterol, and decreased by cyclodextrin, PPARD deletion and chemical PPARdelta inhibitors. Functional consequences of PPARdelta-mediated perturbation of IFN signaling included impaired upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules. These observations suggest PPARdelta modulates signaling processes in malignant B cells in part by altering cholesterol metabolism and changes the outcomes of signaling from cytokines such as IFNs. PPARdelta antagonists may have therapeutic activity as anti-leukemic signal transduction modulators.","['Sun, L', 'Shi, Y', 'Wang, G', 'Wang, X', 'Zeng, S', 'Dunn, S E', 'Fairn, G D', 'Li, Y-J', 'Spaner, D E']","['Sun L', 'Shi Y', 'Wang G', 'Wang X', 'Zeng S', 'Dunn SE', 'Fairn GD', 'Li YJ', 'Spaner DE']",,"['Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Human Anatomy, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Breast Surgery, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Toronto General Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', ""Keenan Research Centre for Biomedical Science, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."", 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Human Anatomy, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Center, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['MOP1304/CIHR/Canada', 'MOP 110952/CIHR/Canada', 'MOP133656 /CIHR/Canada']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170530,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (PPAR delta)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'PPAR delta/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",,2017/05/31 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2017/05/31 06:00'],"['2016/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017162 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.162 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Jan;32(1):184-193. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.162.

To determine the effects of molecular features including clonal hierarchy in CMML, we studied whole-exome and targeted next-generation sequencing data from 150 patients with robust clinical and molecular annotation assessed cross-sectionally and at serial time points of disease evolution. To identify molecular lesions unique to CMML, we compared it to the related myeloid neoplasms (N=586), including juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and primary monocytic acute myeloid leukemia and discerned distinct molecular profiles despite similar pathomorphological features. Within CMML, mutations in certain pathways correlated with clinical classification, for example, proliferative vs dysplastic features. While most CMML patients (59%) had ancestral (dominant/co-dominant) mutations involving TET2, SRSF2 or ASXL1 genes, secondary subclonal hierarchy correlated with clinical phenotypes or outcomes. For example, progression was associated with acquisition of new expanding clones carrying biallelic TET2 mutations or RAS family, or spliceosomal gene mutations. In contrast, dysplastic features correlated with mutations usually encountered in MDS (for example, SF3B1 and U2AF1). Classification of CMML based on hierarchies of ancestral and subclonal mutational events may correlate strongly with clinical features and prognosis.","['Patel, B J', 'Przychodzen, B', 'Thota, S', 'Radivoyevitch, T', 'Visconte, V', 'Kuzmanovic, T', 'Clemente, M', 'Hirsch, C', 'Morawski, A', 'Souaid, R', 'Saygin, C', 'Nazha, A', 'Demarest, B', 'LaFramboise, T', 'Sakaguchi, H', 'Kojima, S', 'Carraway, H E', 'Ogawa, S', 'Makishima, H', 'Sekeres, M A', 'Maciejewski, J P']","['Patel BJ', 'Przychodzen B', 'Thota S', 'Radivoyevitch T', 'Visconte V', 'Kuzmanovic T', 'Clemente M', 'Hirsch C', 'Morawski A', 'Souaid R', 'Saygin C', 'Nazha A', 'Demarest B', 'LaFramboise T', 'Sakaguchi H', 'Kojima S', 'Carraway HE', 'Ogawa S', 'Makishima H', 'Sekeres MA', 'Maciejewski JP']",,"['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Computer Science, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, and Cancer Genomics Project, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, and Cancer Genomics Project, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL118281/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL123904/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL128425/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170530,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clonal Evolution', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Genome-Wide Association Study', '*Genomics/methods', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Whole Exome Sequencing']",PMC8370480,2017/05/31 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2017/05/31 06:00'],"['2017/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017164 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.164 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Dec;31(12):2815-2823. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.164.

While it is understood that this fusion activates tyrosine kinase signaling, the mechanisms of transformation and importance of perturbation of EBF1 activity remain unknown. EBF1 is a nuclear transcription factor required for normal B-lineage specification, commitment and development. Conversely, PDGFRB is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is normally repressed in lymphocytes, yet PDGFRB remains a common fusion partner in leukemias. Here, we demonstrate that the EBF1-PDGFRB fusion results in loss of EBF1 function, multimerization and autophosphorylation of the fusion protein, activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) signaling and gain of interleukin-7 (IL-7)-independent cell proliferation. Deregulation and loss of EBF1 function is critically dependent on the nuclear export activity of the transmembrane (TM) domain of PDGFRB. Deletion of the TM domain partially rescues EBF1 function and restores IL-7 dependence, without requiring kinase inhibition. Moreover, we demonstrate that EBF1-PDGFRB synergizes with loss of IKAROS function in a fully penetrant B-ALL in vivo. Thus, we establish that EBF1-PDGFRB is sufficient to drive leukemogenesis through TM-dependent loss of transcription factor function, increased proliferation and synergy with additional genetic insults including loss of IKAROS function.","['Welsh, S J', 'Churchman, M L', 'Togni, M', 'Mullighan, C G', 'Hagman, J']","['Welsh SJ', 'Churchman ML', 'Togni M', 'Mullighan CG', 'Hagman J']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5436-8455'],"['Program in Molecular Biology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Program in Molecular Biology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Research, National Jewish Health, Denver, CO, USA.', 'University of Colorado Cancer Center, Colorado University Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI081878/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197695/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI056322/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI098417/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170530,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (EBF1 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (PDGFRB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Carcinogenesis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-7/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",PMC5709252,2017/05/31 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2017/05/31 06:00'],"['2017/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/10 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017166 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.166 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Jan;32(1):38-48. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.166.

We investigated the role of the MUC1 oncoprotein in modulating PD-L1 expression in AML. Silencing of MUC1 in AML cell lines suppressed PD-L1 expression without a decrease in PD-L1 mRNA levels, suggesting a post-transcriptional mechanism of regulation. We identified the microRNAs miR-200c and miR-34a as key regulators of PD-L1 expression in AML. Silencing of MUC1 in AML cells led to a marked increase in miR-200c and miR-34a levels, without changes in precursor microRNA, suggesting that MUC1 might regulate microRNA-processing. MUC1 signaling decreased the expression of the microRNA-processing protein DICER, via the suppression of c-Jun activity. NanoString (Seattle, WA, USA) array of MUC1-silenced AML cells demonstrated an increase in the majority of probed microRNAs. In an immunocompetent murine AML model, targeting of MUC1 led to a significant increase in leukemia-specific T cells. In concert, targeting MUC1 signaling in human AML cells resulted in enhanced sensitivity to T-cell-mediated lysis. These findings suggest MUC1 is a critical regulator of PD-L1 expression via its effects on microRNA levels and represents a potential therapeutic target to enhance anti-tumor immunity.","['Pyzer, A

METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 51 adult de novo patients with MDS (3 refractory anaemia (RA), 11 refractory anaemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), 28 refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD), 3 refractory anaemia with excess blasts type I (RAEB-I), 5 refractory anaemia with excess blasts type II (RAEB-II), and 1 chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) were evaluated. For karyotype, 16.2% patients were defined as very low prognosis, 59.5% low risk, 8.1% intermediate risk, 5.4% high risk and 10.8% very high risk. For bone marrow cellularity, 17.6%, 17.6% and 64.7% presented as hypocellular, normocellular and hypercellular, respectively. Patients with hypocellular MDS had significantly decreased expression of ATM (p=0.000), BRCA1 (p=0.014), BRCA2 (p=0.003), LIG4 (p=0.004) and ERCC8 (p=0.000) than those with normocellular/hypercellular bone marrow, whereas XPA (p=0.049) and XPC (p=0.000) genes were increased. In patients with hypoplastic MDS, a low expression of ATM (p=0.0268), LIG4 (p=0.0199) and ERCC8 (p=0.0493) was significantly associated with the presence of chromosomal abnormalities. We detected positive correlations between BRCA1 and BRCA2 (r=0.416; p=0.007), ATM and LIG4 (r=0.472; p=0.001), LIG4 and BRCA1 (r=0.333; p=0.026), LIG4 and BRCA2 (r=0.334; p=0.025), ATM and XPA (r=0.377; p=0.008), ATM and XPC (r=0.287; p=0.046), LIG4 and XPC (r=0.371; p=0.007) and XPA and XPC genes (r=0.895; p=0.0000). We also found among all patients evaluated that correlation with LIG4 occurred most often. CONCLUSIONS: These correlations demonstrate the important intrinsic relations between single and double DNA strand breaks genes in MDS, emphasising that these genes are related to MDS pathogenesis.","['Ribeiro, Howard L Jr', 'Maia, Allan Rodrigo S', 'de Oliveira, Roberta Taiane G', 'Costa, Marilia Braga', 'Farias, Izabelle Rocha', 'de Paula Borges, Daniela', 'de Sousa, Juliana Cordeiro', 'Magalhaes, Silvia Maria M', 'Pinheiro, Ronald F']","['Ribeiro HL Jr', 'Maia ARS', 'de Oliveira RTG', 'Costa MB', 'Farias IR', 'de Paula Borges D', 'de Sousa JC', 'Magalhaes SMM', 'Pinheiro RF']",,"['Cancer Cytogenomic Laboratory, Center for Research and Drug Development (NPDM), Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Post-Graduate Program in Medical Science, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Cancer Cytogenomic Laboratory, Center for Research and Drug Development (NPDM), Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Post-Graduate Program in Medical Science, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Cancer Cytogenomic Laboratory, Center for Research and Drug Development (NPDM), Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Post-Graduate Program in Medical Science, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Cancer Cytogenomic Laboratory, Center for Research and Drug Development (NPDM), Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Post-Graduate Program in Medical Science, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Cancer Cytogenomic Laboratory, Center for Research and Drug Development (NPDM), Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Post-Graduate Program in Medical Science, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Cancer Cytogenomic Laboratory, Center for Research and Drug Development (NPDM), Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Post-Graduate Program in Medical Science, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Cancer Cytogenomic Laboratory, Center for Research and Drug Development (NPDM), Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Post-Graduate Program in Medical Science, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Cancer Cytogenomic Laboratory, Center for Research and Drug Development (NPDM), Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Post-Graduate Program in Medical Science, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Cancer Cytogenomic Laboratory, Center for Research and Drug Development (NPDM), Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Post-Graduate Program in Medical Science, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Post-Graduate Program of Pathology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170529,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (BRCA1 Protein)', '0 (BRCA1 protein, human)', '0 (BRCA2 Protein)', '0 (BRCA2 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ERCC8 protein, human)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (LIG4 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (XPA protein, human)', '0 (Xeroderma Pigmentosum Group A Protein)', '156533-34-5 (XPC protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)', 'EC 6.5.1.1 (DNA Ligase ATP)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/genetics', 'BRCA1 Protein/genetics', 'BRCA2 Protein/genetics', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Breaks, Single-Stranded', 'DNA Ligase ATP/genetics', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Xeroderma Pigmentosum Group A Protein/genetics', 'Young Adult']",,2017/05/31 06:00,2017/11/08 06:00,['2017/05/31 06:00'],"['2016/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/21 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['jclinpath-2016-204269 [pii]', '10.1136/jclinpath-2016-204269 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2017 Nov;70(11):970-980. doi: 10.1136/jclinpath-2016-204269.

We integrate recent heavy ion data on liver, colorectal, intestinal, lung, and Harderian gland tumors with other data from fission neutron experiments into the model analysis. In an earlier work we introduced distinct QFs for leukemia and solid cancer risk predictions, and here we consider liver cancer risks separately because of the higher RBE's reported in mouse experiments compared to other tumors types, and distinct risk factors for liver cancer for astronauts compared to the U.S. POPULATION: The revised model is used to make predictions of fatal cancer and circulatory disease risks for 1-year deep space and International Space Station (ISS) missions, and a 940 day Mars mission. We analyzed the contribution of the various model parameter uncertainties to the overall uncertainty, which shows that the uncertainties in relative biological effectiveness (RBE) factors at high LET due to statistical uncertainties and differences across tissue types and mouse strains are the dominant uncertainty. NASA's exposure limits are approached or exceeded for each mission scenario considered. Two main conclusions are made: 1) Reducing the current estimate of about a 3-fold uncertainty to a 2-fold or lower uncertainty will require much more expansive animal carcinogenesis studies in order to reduce statistical uncertainties and understand tissue, sex and genetic variations. 2) Alternative model assumptions such as non-targeted effects, increased tumor lethality and decreased latency at high LET, and non-cancer mortality risks from circulatory diseases could significantly increase risk estimates to several times higher than the NASA limits.","['Cucinotta, Francis A', 'To, Khiet', 'Cacao, Eliedonna']","['Cucinotta FA', 'To K', 'Cacao E']",,"['Department of Health Physics and Diagnostic Sciences, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV, United States of America.

We analyzed the frequency, type and prognostic significance ofACA in adults (18-60 years) treated in the ALL-Ph-08 trial. Fifty-two out of 74 patients (70%) showed ACA and 19 (26%) presented monosomies associated with t(9;22) (monosomal karyotype, MK). Similar complete response (CR) rate, CR duration, overall survival and event-free survival (EFS) were observed in patients with or without ACA, but patients with MK showed shorter CR duration and EFS than the remaining. On multivariate analysis, the only variable with prognostic impact for CR duration and EFS was the presence of MK (p = .003 and p = .036, respectively). Although ACA associated with the Ph chromosome are frequent, only monosomies were associated with poor prognosis in this group of patients.","['Motllo, Cristina', 'Ribera, Josep-Maria', 'Morgades, Mireia', 'Granada, Isabel', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Mercadal, Santiago', 'Gonzalez-Campos, Jose', 'Moreno, Maria-Jose', 'Barba, Pere', 'Cervera, Marta', 'Barrios, Manuel', 'Novo, Andres', 'Bernal, Teresa', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus-Maria', 'Abella, Eugenia', 'Amigo, Maria-Luz', 'Tormo, Mar', 'Martino, Rodrigo', 'Lavilla, Esperanza', 'Bergua, Juan', 'Serrano, Alfons', 'Garcia-Belmonte, Daniel', 'Guardia, Ramon', 'Grau, Javier', 'Feliu, Evarist']","['Motllo C', 'Ribera JM', 'Morgades M', 'Granada I', 'Montesinos P', 'Mercadal S', 'Gonzalez-Campos J', 'Moreno MJ', 'Barba P', 'Cervera M', 'Barrios M', 'Novo A', 'Bernal T', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM', 'Abella E', 'Amigo ML', 'Tormo M', 'Martino R', 'Lavilla E', 'Bergua J', 'Serrano A', 'Garcia-Belmonte D', 'Guardia R', 'Grau J', 'Feliu E']",,"['a Department of Hematology , ICO-Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona , Barcelona , Spain.', 'a Department of Hematology , ICO-Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona , Barcelona , Spain.', 'a Department of Hematology , ICO-Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona , Barcelona , Spain.', 'a Department of Hematology , ICO-Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona , Barcelona , Spain.', 'b Department of Hematology , Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe , Valencia , Spain.', ""c ICO-Hospital Duran i Reynals, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat , Barcelona , Spain."", 'd Hospital Virgen del Rocio , Sevilla, Madrid , Spain.', 'e Hospital Virgen de la Victoria , Malaga , Spain.', ""f Hospital Valld'Hebron , Barcelona , Spain."", 'g ICO-Hospital Joan XXIII , Tarragona , Spain.', 'h Hospital Carlos Haya , Malaga , Spain.', 'i Hospital Son Espases , Palma de Mallorca, Palma , Spain.', 'j Hospital Central de Asturias , Oviedo , Spain.', 'k Hospital Clinico Universitario, IBSAL , Salamanca , Spain.', 'l Hospital del Mar , Barcelona , Spain.', 'm Hospital Morales Meseguer , Murcia , Spain.', 'n Hospital Clinico , Valencia , Spain.', 'o Hospital de Sant Pau , Barcelona , Spain.', 'p Hospital Xeral , Lugo , Spain.', 'q Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara , Caceres , Spain.', 'r Hospital Sanchinarro , Madrid , Spain.', 's Hospital La Zarzuela , Madrid , Spain.', 't Department of Hematology , ICO - Hospital Josep Trueta , Girona , Spain.', 'a Department of Hematology , ICO-Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona , Barcelona , Spain.', 'a Department of Hematology , ICO-Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona , Barcelona , Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170530,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monosomy', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2017/05/31 06:00,2018/08/01 06:00,['2017/05/31 06:00'],"['2017/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2017.1326596 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2018 Jan;59(1):146-154. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2017.1326596.

All six developed Wilms tumor. Constitutional mosaic aneuploidies, microcephaly, developmental delay and seizures, which are features of mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA) syndrome, were more variably present. Through functional studies, we show that TRIP13-mutant patient cells have no detectable TRIP13 and have substantial impairment of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), leading to a high rate of chromosome missegregation. Accurate segregation, as well as SAC proficiency, is rescued by restoring TRIP13 function. Individuals with biallelic TRIP13 or BUB1B mutations have a high risk of embryonal tumors, and here we show that their cells display severe SAC impairment. MVA due to biallelic CEP57 mutations, or of unknown cause, is not associated with embryonal tumors and cells from these individuals show minimal SAC deficiency. These data provide insights into the complex relationships between aneuploidy and carcinogenesis.","['Yost, Shawn', 'de Wolf, Bas', 'Hanks, Sandra', 'Zachariou, Anna', 'Marcozzi, Chiara', 'Clarke, Matthew', 'de Voer, Richarda', 'Etemad, Banafsheh', 'Uijttewaal, Esther', 'Ramsay, Emma', 'Wylie, Harriet', 'Elliott, Anna', 'Picton, Susan', 'Smith, Audrey', 'Smithson, Sarah', 'Seal, Sheila', 'Ruark, Elise', 'Houge, Gunnar', 'Pines, Jonathan', 'Kops, Geert J P L', 'Rahman, Nazneen']","['Yost S', 'de Wolf B', 'Hanks S', 'Zachariou A', 'Marcozzi C', 'Clarke M', 'de Voer R', 'Etemad B', 'Uijttewaal E', 'Ramsay E', 'Wylie H', 'Elliott A', 'Picton S', 'Smith A', 'Smithson S', 'Seal S', 'Ruark E', 'Houge G', 'Pines J', 'Kops GJPL', 'Rahman N']",,"['Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, Institute of Cancer Research, 15 Cotswold Road, London, SM2 5NG, UK.', 'Hubrecht Institute -

The diagnosis is established by clinical, radiologic, and histologic findings; ECD tumors contain foamy macrophages that are CD68+, CD163+, CD1a-, and frequently S100-. The purpose of this report is to describe the clinical and molecular variability of ECD. Sixty consecutive ECD patients (45 males, 15 females) were prospectively evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center between 2011 and 2015. Comprehensive imaging and laboratory studies were performed, and tissues were examined for BRAF V600E and MAPK pathway mutations. Mean age at first manifestations of ECD was 46 years; a diagnosis was established, on average, 4.2 years after initial presentation. Bone was the most common tissue affected, with osteosclerosis in 95% of patients. Other manifestations observed in one-third to two-thirds of patients include cardiac mass and periaortic involvement, diabetes insipidus, retro-orbital infiltration, retroperitoneal, lung, CNS, skin and xanthelasma, usually in combination. Methods of detection included imaging studies of various modalities. Mutation in BRAF V600E was detected in 51% of 57 biopsies. One patient had an ARAF D228V mutation, and one had an activating ALK fusion. Treatments included interferon alpha, imatinib, anakinra, cladribine, vemurafenib and dabrafenib with trametinib; eleven patients received no therapy. The diagnosis of ECD is elusive because of the rarity and varied presentations of the disorder. Identification of BRAF and other MAPK pathway mutations in biopsies improves ECD diagnosis, allows for development of targeted treatments, and demonstrates that ECD is a neoplastic disorder.","['Estrada-Veras, Juvianee I', ""O'Brien, Kevin J"", 'Boyd, Louisa C', 'Dave, Rahul H', 'Durham, Benjamin', 'Xi, Liqiang', 'Malayeri, Ashkan A', 'Chen, Marcus Y', 'Gardner, Pamela J', 'Alvarado-Enriquez, Jhonell R', 'Shah, Nikeith', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Gochuico, Bernadette R', 'Raffeld, Mark', 'Jaffe, Elaine S', 'Gahl, William A']","['Estrada-Veras JI', ""O'Brien KJ"", 'Boyd LC', 'Dave RH', 'Durham B', 'Xi L', 'Malayeri AA', 'Chen MY', 'Gardner PJ', 'Alvarado-Enriquez JR', 'Shah N', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Gochuico BR', 'Raffeld M', 'Jaffe ES', 'Gahl WA']",,"['Section on Human Biochemical Genetics, Medical Genetics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health. 10 Center Dr, Bldg 10, Room 3-2551, Bethesda, Maryland, USA, 20892.

While the treatment of NHL/leukemia of B-cell origin has much progressed with the introduction of targeted therapies, few treatment standards have been established for T-NHL/leukemia. As presentation in both B- and T-NHL/leukemia patients is often aggressive and as prognosis for relapsed disease is especially dismal, this cancer entity poses major challenges and requires innovative therapeutic approaches. In clinical trials, oncolytic viruses (OVs) have been used against refractory multiple myeloma (MM). In preclinical settings, a number of OVs have demonstrated a remarkable ability to suppress various types of hematological cancers. Most studies dealing with this approach have used MM or B- or myeloid-cell-derived malignancies as models. Only a few describe susceptibility of T-cell lymphoma/leukemia to OV infection and killing. The rat H-1 parvovirus (H-1PV) is an OV with considerable promise as a novel therapeutic agent against both solid tumors (pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma) and hematological malignancies. The present perspective article builds on previous reports of H-1PV-driven regression of Burkitt's lymphoma xenografts and on unpublished observations demonstrating effective killing by H-1PV of cells from CHOP-resistant diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. On the basis of these studies, H-1PV is proposed for use as an adjuvant to (chemo)therapeutic regimens. Furthermore, in the light of a recently completed first parvovirus clinical trial in glioblastoma patients, the advantages of H-1PV for systemic application are discussed.","['Angelova, Assia L', 'Witzens-Harig, Mathias', 'Galabov, Angel S', 'Rommelaere, Jean']","['Angelova AL', 'Witzens-Harig M', 'Galabov AS', 'Rommelaere J']",,"['Department of Tumor Virology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Virology, The Stephan Angeloff Institute of Microbiology, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'Department of Tumor Virology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170512,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC5427078,2017/05/30 06:00,2017/05/30 06:01,['2017/05/30 06:00'],"['2017/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2017.00093 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2017 May 12;7:93. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2017.00093. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['cutaneous T-cell lymphoma', 'diffuse large B-cell lymphoma', 'glioblastoma', 'oncolytic (parvo)virotherapy of hematological malignancies', 'oncolytic H-1 parvovirus', 'oncolytic virotherapy', 'pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This process is time-consuming, extremely tedious, and expensive and needs experienced experts in this field. Thus, a computer-aided diagnosis system that assists pathologists in the diagnostic process can be so effective. Segmentation of WBCs is usually a first step in developing a computer-aided diagnosis system. The main purpose of this paper is to segment WBCs from microscopic images. For this purpose, we present a novel combination of thresholding, k-means clustering, and modified watershed algorithms in three stages including (1) segmentation of WBCs from a microscopic image, (2) extraction of nuclei from cell's image, and (3) separation of overlapping cells and nuclei. The evaluation results of the proposed method show that similarity measures, precision, and sensitivity respectively were 92.07, 96.07, and 94.30% for nucleus segmentation and 92.93, 97.41, and 93.78% for cell segmentation.

Intensification of current chemotherapy regimens to improve the outcome in these children is often limited by the effects of drug resistance and cumulative toxicity. Hence, the search for newer agents and novel therapeutic approaches are urgently needed to formulate the next-generation early-phase clinical trials for these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive library of antimicrobials, including eight HIV protease inhibitors (nelfinavir [NFV], saquinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, amprenavir, atazanavir, lopinavir, and darunavir), was tested against a panel of pediatric leukemia cells by in vitro growth inhibition studies. Detailed target modulation studies were carried out by Western blot analyses. In addition, drug synergy experiments with conventional and novel antitumor agents were completed to identify effective treatment regimens for future clinical trials. RESULTS: Several of the HIV protease inhibitors showed cytotoxicity at physiologically relevant concentrations (half-maximal inhibitory concentration values ranging from 1-24 microM). In particular, NFV was found to exhibit the most potent antileukemic properties across all cell lines tested. Mechanistic studies show that NFV leads to the induction of autophagy and apoptosis possibly through the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Furthermore, interference with cell signaling pathways, including Akt and mTOR, was also noted. Finally, drug combination studies have identified agents with potential for synergy with NFV in its antileukemic activity. These include JQ1 (BET inhibitor), AT101 (Bcl-2 family inhibitor), and sunitinib (TK inhibitor). CONCLUSION: Here, we show data demonstrating the potential of a previously unexplored group of drugs to address an unmet therapeutic need in pediatric oncology. The data presented provide preclinical supportive evidence and rationale for future studies of these agents for refractory leukemia in children.","['Meier-Stephenson, Vanessa', 'Riemer, Justin', 'Narendran, Aru']","['Meier-Stephenson V', 'Riemer J', 'Narendran A']",,"['Department of Oncology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Alberta Children's Hospital."", 'Department of Oncology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Alberta Children's Hospital."", 'Department of Oncology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Alberta Children's Hospital."", 'Pediatric Oncology Experimental Therapeutics Investigators Consortium (POETIC) Laboratory, Calgary, AB, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170516,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC5440076,2017/05/30 06:00,2017/05/30 06:01,['2017/05/30 06:00'],"['2017/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S136484 [doi]', 'ott-10-2581 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2017 May 16;10:2581-2593. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S136484. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['HIV protease inhibitors', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'nelfinavir', 'pediatric leukemia']",['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, first, the interactions of MTX-DG liposomes with various human and mouse tumor cell lines were studied using fluorescence techniques. The liposomes composed of egg phosphatidylcholine (PC)/yeast phosphatidylinositol/MTX-DG, 8:1:1 by mol, were labeled with fluorescent analogs of PC and MTX-DG. Carcinoma cells accumulated 5 times more MTX-DG liposomes than the empty liposomes. Studies on inhibitors of liposome uptake and processing by cells demonstrated that the formulation used multiple mechanisms to deliver the prodrug inside the cell. According to the data from the present study, undamaged liposomes fuse with the cell membrane only 1.5-2 hours after binding to the cell surface, and then, the components of liposomal bilayer enter the cell separately. The study on the time course of plasma concentration in mice showed that the area under the curve of MTX generated upon intravenous injection of MTX-DG liposomes exceeded that of intact MTX 2.5-fold. These data suggested the advantage of using liposomal formulation to treat systemic manifestation of hematological malignancies. Indeed, the administration of MTX-DG liposomes to recipient mice bearing T-cell leukemic lymphoma using a dose-sparing regimen resulted in lower toxicity and retarded lymphoma growth rate as compared with MTX.","['Alekseeva, Anna A', 'Moiseeva, Ekaterina V', 'Onishchenko, Natalia R', 'Boldyrev, Ivan A', 'Singin, Alexander S', 'Budko, Andrey P', 'Shprakh, Zoya S', 'Molotkovsky, Julian G', 'Vodovozova, Elena L']","['Alekseeva AA', 'Moiseeva EV', 'Onishchenko NR', 'Boldyrev IA', 'Singin AS', 'Budko AP', 'Shprakh ZS', 'Molotkovsky JG', 'Vodovozova EL']",,"['M.M.

Here, we characterize cone differentiation in retinas derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Similar to in vivo development, a temporal pattern of progenitor marker expression is followed by the differentiation of early thyroid hormone receptor beta2-positive precursors and, subsequently, photoreceptors exhibiting cone-specific phototransduction-related proteins. We establish that stage-specific inhibition of the Notch pathway increases cone cell differentiation, while retinoic acid signaling regulates cone maturation, comparable with their actions in vivo. MESC-derived cones can be isolated in large numbers and transplanted into adult mouse eyes, showing capacity to survive and mature in the subretinal space of Aipl1(-/-) mice, a model of end-stage retinal degeneration. Together, this work identifies a robust, renewable cell source for cone replacement by purified cell suspension transplantation.","['Kruczek, Kamil', 'Gonzalez-Cordero, Anai', 'Goh, Debbie', 'Naeem, Arifa', 'Jonikas, Mindaugas', 'Blackford, Samuel J I', 'Kloc, Magdalena', 'Duran, Yanai', 'Georgiadis, Anastasios', 'Sampson, Robert D', 'Maswood, Ryea N', 'Smith, Alexander J', 'Decembrini, Sarah', 'Arsenijevic, Yvan', 'Sowden, Jane C', 'Pearson, Rachael A', 'West, Emma L', 'Ali, Robin R']","['Kruczek K', 'Gonzalez-Cordero A', 'Goh D', 'Naeem A', 'Jonikas M', 'Blackford SJI', 'Kloc M', 'Duran Y', 'Georgiadis A', 'Sampson RD', 'Maswood RN', 'Smith AJ', 'Decembrini S', 'Arsenijevic Y', 'Sowden JC', 'Pearson RA', 'West EL', 'Ali RR']",,"['Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London EC1V 9EL, UK.', 'Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London EC1V 9EL, UK.', 'Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London EC1V 9EL, UK.', 'Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London EC1V 9EL, UK.', 'Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London EC1V 9EL, UK.', 'Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London EC1V 9EL, UK.', 'Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London EC1V 9EL, UK.', 'Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London EC1V 9EL, UK.', 'Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London EC1V 9EL, UK.', 'Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London EC1V 9EL, UK.', 'Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London EC1V 9EL, UK.', 'Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London EC1V 9EL, UK.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Jules-Gonin Eye Hospital, University of Lausanne, 1004 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Jules-Gonin Eye Hospital, University of Lausanne, 1004 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Section, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London, London WC1N 1EH, UK.', 'Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London EC1V 9EL, UK.', 'Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London EC1V 9EL, UK.', 'Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London EC1V 9EL, UK; NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, City Road, London EC1V 2PD, UK.

Patients undergoing UD-HCT (n = 93) or HFD-HCT (n = 59) received RIC comprising busulfan, fludarabine, and ATG, 9 mg/kg, whereas those undergoing HCT from matched sibling donors (MSD, n = 85) received myeloablative busulfan and cyclophosphamide conditioning or aforementioned RIC with ATG, 4.5 mg/kg. For graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, cyclosporine and methotrexate were administered. The median follow-up period was 44.7 months after HCT for 161 survivors. For UD-HCT versus HFD-HCT, there were no significant differences in leukemia recurrence, nonrelapse mortality, relapse-free survival, grades 2 to 4 acute GVHD, and moderate-to-severe chronic GVHD. Furthermore, when the outcomes of UD-HCT and HFD-HCT were combined and compared with those of MSD-HCT, there were no significant differences in leukemia recurrence (3-year cumulative incidence, 30% versus 29%), nonrelapse mortality (3-year cumulative incidence, 7% versus 8%), relapse-free survival (3-year estimate, 63% versus 63%), and grades 2 to 4 acute GVHD (120-day cumulative incidence, 16% versus 13%). Moderate-to-severe chronic GVHD, however, occurred less frequently in UD/HFD-HCT (2-year cumulative incidence, 22% versus 40%; P = .006). The addition of ATG to conditioning regimen was a significant predictor for less chronic GVHD (subdistribution hazard ratio, .59). In AML in remission, UD/HFD-HCT after ATG-containing RIC achieved leukemia control equivalent to that of MSD-HCT. Despite HLA disparity in UD/HFD-HCT, chronic GVHD occurred less frequently after ATG-containing RIC, suggesting a strong GVHD-modulating effect of ATG.","['Lee, Kyoo-Hyung', 'Lee, Je-Hwan', 'Lee, Jung-Hee', 'Kim, Dae-Young', 'Park, Han-Seung', 'Choi, Eun-Ji', 'Ko, Sun-Hye', 'Seol, Miee', 'Lee, Young-Shin', 'Kang, Young-A', 'Jeon, Mijin', 'Baek, Seunghyun', 'Kang, You-Lee', 'Kim, Sung-Han', 'Yun, Sung-Cheol', 'Kim, Hawk', 'Jo, Jae-Cheol', 'Choi, Yunsuk', 'Joo, Young-Don', 'Lim, Sung-Nam']","['Lee KH', 'Lee JH', 'Lee JH', 'Kim DY', 'Park HS', 'Choi EJ', 'Ko SH', 'Seol M', 'Lee YS', 'Kang YA', 'Jeon M', 'Baek S', 'Kang YL', 'Kim SH', 'Yun SC', 'Kim H', 'Jo JC', 'Choi Y', 'Joo YD', 'Lim SN']",,"['Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Asan Medical Center, College of Medicine, University of Ulsan, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

Members of the Interleukin-6 (IL-6) family of cytokines trigger their effects through activation of intracellular cascades including the Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway. Functions of several STAT molecules in trophoblast cells have been described, but the role of STAT1 remained unclear. Here, potential functions of STAT1 and its activation by Oncostatin M (OSM) have been investigated in an in vitro model. STAT1 expression and phosphorylation were analyzed in human term placenta tissue by immunohistochemistry. HTR-8/SVneo cells (immortalized human extravillous trophoblast cells) were stimulated with OSM, IL-6, IL-11, Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) and Granulocyte Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor. Expression and phosphorylation of STAT1 were analyzed by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Fludarabine and STAT1 siRNA were employed for STAT1 depletion. STAT1 transcriptional activity was evaluated by DNA-binding capacity assay. Cell viability and invasion were assessed by MTS and Matrigel assays, respectively. STAT1 was expressed in villous and extravillous trophoblast cells. Low phosphorylation was detectable exclusively in extravillous trophoblast cells. Only OSM and LIF induced phosphorylation of STAT1 in the in vitro model. Challenge with OSM increased cell invasion but not proliferation. Inhibition of STAT1 by fludarabine treatment or STAT1 siRNA transfection reduced cell viability and invasiveness in presence and absence of OSM. These results indicate the potential involvement of STAT1 in the regulation of trophoblast behavior.

It is self-resolved in the majority of cases, but could result in chronic pancreatitis (CP) and increased risk of pancreatic cancer (PC). One of the early events in AP is premature activation of digestive pro-enzymes, including trypsinogen, inside pancreatic acinar cells (PACs) due to an excessive rise in the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration, which is the result of Ca(2+) release from internal stores followed by Ca(2+) entry through the store operated Ca(2+) channels in the plasma membrane. The leading causes of AP are high alcohol intake and biliary disease with gallstones obstruction leading to bile reflux into the pancreatic duct. Recently attention in this area of research turned to another cause of AP - Asparaginase based drugs - which have been used quite successfully in treatments of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Unfortunately, Asparaginase is implicated in triggering AP in 5-10% of cases as a side effect of the anti-cancer therapy. The main features of Asparaginase-elicited AP (AAP) were found to be remarkably similar to AP induced by alcohol metabolites and bile acids. Several potential therapeutic avenues in counteracting AAP have been suggested and could also be useful for dealing with AP induced by other causes. Another interesting development in this field includes recent research related to pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) that are much less studied in their natural environment but nevertheless critically involved in AP, CP and PC. This review will attempt to evaluate developments, approaches and potential therapies for AP and discuss links to other relevant diseases.","['Gerasimenko, J V', 'Peng, S', 'Tsugorka, T', 'Gerasimenko, O V']","['Gerasimenko JV', 'Peng S', 'Tsugorka T', 'Gerasimenko OV']",,"['Cardiff School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF10 3AX, Wales, UK.

These excesses have not been seen more recently. It is postulated that the former apparent increased risk was related to 'unusual population mixing', which is not present in recent years. This study investigated changes in measures of population mixing from 1951-2001. Comparisons were made between three specified areas. Area-based measures were calculated (migration, commuting, deprivation, population density). All areas have become more affluent, although Seascale was consistently the most affluent. Seascale has become less densely populated, with less migration into the ward and less diversity with respect to migrants' origin. There have been marked changes in patterns of population mixing throughout Cumbria. Lesser population mixing has been observed in Seascale in recent decades. Changes in pattern and nature of population mixing may explain the lack of recent excesses.","['McNally, Richard J Q', 'James, Peter W', 'Blakey, Karen', 'Basta, Nermine O', 'Norman, Paul D', 'Pearce, Mark S']","['McNally RJQ', 'James PW', 'Blakey K', 'Basta NO', 'Norman PD', 'Pearce MS']",,"['Institute of Health & Society, Newcastle University, Sir James Spence Institute, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Queen Victoria Road, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 4LP, England, UK.

Estimates of non-adherence to oral anti-cancer therapy range between 27% and 63% in studies of cancer patients. This represents a growing challenge, due to the paradigm shift in anti-cancer treatment from parenteral chemotherapy to oral anti-cancer drugs. The importance of adherence to medical treatment is highlighted by the World Health Organization which considers non-adherence to be a major public health concern. Studies in several malignancies have shown an adverse effect of nonadherence on treatment response, survival and quality of life, accompanied by an increase in health-care related costs. The clinical vignette accompanying this review demonstrates the complexity of management of adherence to oral anticancer therapy, through an example of an elderly chronic myeloid leukemia patient, non-adherent to serial tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, dasatinib). Her non-adherence was explained by subtle socio-demographic, patient-related and treatment-related factors, which in hindsight could have already been identified at diagnosis, resulting in preemptive management of these barriers and adherence. Routine management by the hematologist, using education alone resulted in improvement of adherence, which was predictably short-lived. Our use of a multilevel and multidisciplinary adherence-enhancing intervention, incorporating feedback based on electronic monitoring of adherence, resulted in improved adherence and treatment response in this patient. This exemplifies the contemporary evidence-based approach to non-adherence to oral-anticancer therapy.","['Ashkenazi, Sarit', 'Dreyer, Juliet', 'Raanani, Pia', 'Leader, Avi']","['Ashkenazi S', 'Dreyer J', 'Raanani P', 'Leader A']",,"['Hematology Institute, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petach Tikva, Israel.', 'Nursing, Davidoff Cancer Center, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petach Tikva, Israel.', 'Hematology Institute, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petach Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Hematology Institute, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petach Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['heb'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Israel,Harefuah,Harefuah,0034351,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', '*Medication Adherence', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Quality of Life']",,2017/05/30 06:00,2018/08/03 06:00,['2017/05/29 06:00'],"['2017/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/03 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Harefuah. 2017 Apr;156(4):254-258.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The plant Artemisia has been used in China for anti-cancer and anti-malaria applications. In Israel, Artemisia absinthium (""the Chiba"") is used to release abdominal pain. In attempts to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of this plant in CLL cells, we prepared a decoction of Artemisia leaves and after filtration used it as an inducer of apoptosis of B CLL cells. METHODS: CLL cells were collected from 7 patients in different stages of the disease. Apoptosis was measured using an annexin based flow cytometry assay. RESULTS: First a viability test showed that 100mul/106 cells was the most effective dilution for killing up to 70% cells after 48 hours of incubation. In these conditions Artemisia induced approximately 75% apoptosis in comparison to 32% in the cultures without Artemisia. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that decoction of Artemisia absinthium is a potent inducer of in vitro apoptosis of CLL cells. Our results provide a laboratory basis for further clinical application.","['Mirkin, Vita', 'Berrebi, Alain', 'Rakhman, Igor', 'Haran, Michal', 'Shvidel, Lev']","['Mirkin V', 'Berrebi A', 'Rakhman I', 'Haran M', 'Shvidel L']",,"['Davis Laboratory for Leukemia Research, Hematology Institute, Kaplan Medical Center Rehovot.', 'Davis Laboratory for Leukemia Research, Hematology Institute, Kaplan Medical Center Rehovot.', 'Davis Laboratory for Leukemia Research, Hematology Institute, Kaplan Medical Center Rehovot.', 'Davis Laboratory for Leukemia Research, Hematology Institute, Kaplan Medical Center Rehovot.', 'Davis Laboratory for Leukemia Research, Hematology Institute, Kaplan Medical Center Rehovot.']",['heb'],,['Journal Article'],,Israel,Harefuah,Harefuah,0034351,['0 (Plant Extracts)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', '*Artemisia/chemistry', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Israel', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology']",,2017/05/30 06:00,2018/08/07 06:00,['2017/05/29 06:00'],"['2017/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/07 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Harefuah. 2017 Feb;156(2):86-88.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Somatic, psychic and spiritual needs of these patients may differ from those of patients suffering from incurable solid tumours and are not comprehensively evaluated so far. METHODS: To address this question, data from charts of 123 patients who have died after allogeneic stem cell transplantation were extracted. In detail, the time line of the clinical course, the symptoms, the administered drugs and other applied procedures were analysed. RESULTS: Approximately one half of the patients, who have died after stem cell transplantation, did not live more than 5 months. Two-thirds of patients died within 14 months after SCT. 28.5% of the patients could not be discharged after transplantation. However, a significant proportion had a low ECOG-score (0-1) prior to death, indicating a high degree of mobility. Major symptoms were weakness, fatigue and need for aid at daily activities. Severe pain, dyspnoea and obstipation, as known from patients suffering from advanced solid tumours, were rare. In consequence, use of opioids seemed to be less frequent than in patients with solid tumours. Measures of intensive care and i.v.-drug administration were applied to a significant proportion of patients. CONCLUSION: The present investigation indicates that the somatic, psychic and spiritual end-of-life-care after allogeneic stem cell transplantation could be optimised. A significant problem for the transplantation team seems to be the realisation of necessity to switch the curative concept into a palliative ambition. Requirements are a subsequent prospectively conducted investigation and an intensification of cooperation between transplant and palliative care teams.","['Busemann, Christoph', 'Julich, Andreas', 'Buchhold, Britta', 'Schmidt, Vanessa', 'Schneidewind, Laila', 'Pink, Daniel', 'Schmidt, Christian Andreas', 'Neumann, Thomas', 'Kruger, William H']","['Busemann C', 'Julich A', 'Buchhold B', 'Schmidt V', 'Schneidewind L', 'Pink D', 'Schmidt CA', 'Neumann T', 'Kruger WH']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3427-3632'],"['Department of Internal Medicine C-Haematology, and Oncology, Stem Cell Transplantation, Palliative Care, University Hospital Greifswald, Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University, Ferdinand-Sauerbruch-Strasse, 17475, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine C-Haematology, and Oncology, Stem Cell Transplantation, Palliative Care, University Hospital Greifswald, Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University, Ferdinand-Sauerbruch-Strasse, 17475, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Psychology, University Hospital Greifswald, Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University, Ferdinand-Sauerbruch-Strasse, 17475, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine C-Haematology, and Oncology, Stem Cell Transplantation, Palliative Care, University Hospital Greifswald, Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University, Ferdinand-Sauerbruch-Strasse, 17475, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine C-Haematology, and Oncology, Stem Cell Transplantation, Palliative Care, University Hospital Greifswald, Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University, Ferdinand-Sauerbruch-Strasse, 17475, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine C-Haematology, and Oncology, Stem Cell Transplantation, Palliative Care, University Hospital Greifswald, Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University, Ferdinand-Sauerbruch-Strasse, 17475, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine C-Haematology, and Oncology, Stem Cell Transplantation, Palliative Care, University Hospital Greifswald, Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University, Ferdinand-Sauerbruch-Strasse, 17475, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine C-Haematology, and Oncology, Stem Cell Transplantation, Palliative Care, University Hospital Greifswald, Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University, Ferdinand-Sauerbruch-Strasse, 17475, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine C-Haematology, and Oncology, Stem Cell Transplantation, Palliative Care, University Hospital Greifswald, Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University, Ferdinand-Sauerbruch-Strasse, 17475, Greifswald, Germany. william.krueger@uni-greifswald.de.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170527,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Terminal Care/*methods', 'Young Adult']",PMC7101727,2017/05/30 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/05/29 06:00'],"['2017/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00432-017-2446-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-017-2446-y [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2017 Oct;143(10):2067-2076. doi: 10.1007/s00432-017-2446-y.

We hypothesized that the BCR-ABL1 levels during the first 3 months of therapy, and the kinetics of their descent in this period, could be predictive of deep molecular response thereafter. METHODS: This substudy of the ENEST1st trial included 60 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase treated with front-line nilotinib, and BCR-ABL1IS levels were measured using GUS as the control gene. The analysis included seven time points during the first trimester of treatment (baseline and fortnightly thereafter). RESULTS: The rates of MMR at 12 months, and of MR4 at 18 months (primary variable of the study), were 70 and 41%, respectively, similar to those obtained in the core study. BCR-ABL1IS </=10% was achieved at 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 months in 50, 70, 83 and 93% of the patients, respectively. The observed shape of the BCR-ABL1IS descent was biphasic, with a faster slope during the first trimester and a median halving time (HT) of 11 days, the shortest reported in the literature. An HT </=13 days was predictive of MMR at 12 months and MR4 at 18 months. CONCLUSIONS: The association of a shorter HT with response provides a rationale for exploring very early kinetics patterns in all patients treated with potent TKIs such as nilotinib.","['Steegmann, Juan Luis', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Gomez-Casares, Maria-Teresa', 'Garcia-Gutierrez, Valentin', 'Orti, Guillermo', 'Ramirez-Payer, Angel', 'Olavarria, Eduardo', 'Vall-Llovera, Ferran', 'Giraldo, Pilar', 'Conde, Eulogio', 'Vallansot, Rolando', 'Lopez-Lorenzo, Jose Luis', 'Palomera, Luis', 'Alvarez-Larran, Alberto', 'Conesa, Venancio', 'Bautista, Guiomar', 'Casas, Laura', 'Giles, Frank', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Casado-Montero, Luis Felipe']","['Steegmann JL', 'Colomer D', 'Gomez-Casares MT', 'Garcia-Gutierrez V', 'Orti G', 'Ramirez-Payer A', 'Olavarria E', 'Vall-Llovera F', 'Giraldo P', 'Conde E', 'Vallansot R', 'Lopez-Lorenzo JL', 'Palomera L', 'Alvarez-Larran A', 'Conesa V', 'Bautista G', 'Casas L', 'Giles F', 'Hochhaus A', 'Casado-Montero LF']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7799-5355'],"['Hematology Service, Advanced Therapies in Oncohematology, IIS-IP, Hospital de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain. jlsteegmann.hlpr@salud.madrid.org.', ""Unitat d' Hematopatologia, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Laboratorio de Hematologia, Biologia Molecular, Hospital Universitario de Gran Canaria Dr.Negrin, Las Palmas, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitari Vall d Hebron, VHIO, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitari Mutua Terrassa, Terrassa, Spain.', 'Instituto Investigacion Sanitaria Aragon (IIS Aragon), CIBERER, Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Hematologia, Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Spain.', 'Servei d Hematologia, ICO-Tarragona, Hospital Universitari Joan XXIII, Tarragona, Spain.', 'Hematologia, Clinica de la Concepcion, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Clinico Universitario Lozano Blesa, Instituto Investigacion (ISS) Aragon, Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital del Mar-IMIM, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Hematologia, Departament de Salut d'Elx, Hospital General, Elche, Spain."", 'Hematologia, Hospital Puerta de Hierro, Madrid, Spain.', 'Statistics Department, Dynamic Solutions, SL, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Division of Hematology Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, USA.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II.

Hence, this study aimed at the optimization of niclosamide derivatives for the development of new potential anticancer agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Niclosamide derivatives were synthesized and tested against a panel of human cancer cells: MDA and MCF7 breast cancer cells, PC3 and DU-145 prostate cancer cells, Hela cervical cancer cells, and HL-60 acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. They were also tested in nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkB), V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS), and mitochondria transmembrane potential (MTP) assays. RESULTS: N-(3,5-Bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-5-chloro-2-hydroxybenzamide exhibited the most significant cytotoxicity against HL-60 cells, while 5-chloro-N-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide was the most active in the NFkB assay and 5-chloro-N-(3,5-difluorophenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide in the MTP assay. 5-chloro-N-(2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide and 5-chloro-2-hydroxy-N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)benzamide inhibited both HL-60 cell proliferation and NFkB.

Beside Mer the family contains other two kinases, namely, Tyro3 and Axl, which are highly homologues with Mer and thus most existing small-molecule inhibitors show moderate or high promiscuity across the three kinases. Here, the structural basis and energetic property of selective binding of small-molecule inhibitors to the three kinases were investigated at molecular level. It is found that the selectivity is primarily determined by the size, shape and configuration of kinase's ATP-binding site; the Mer and Axl possess a small, closed active pocket as compared to the bulky, open pocket of Tyro3. The location and conformation of active-site residues of Mer and Axl are highly consistent, suggesting that small-molecule inhibitors generally have a low Mer-over-Axl selectivity and a high Mer-over-Tyro3 selectivity. We demonstrated that the difference in ATP binding potency to the three kinases is also responsible for inhibitor selectivity. We also found that the long-range interactions and allosteric effect arising from rest of the kinase's active site can indirectly influence inhibitor binding and selectivity.","['Liu, Mao-Hua', 'Chen, Shi-Bing', 'Yu, Juan', 'Liu, Cheng-Jun', 'Zhang, Xiao-Jing']","['Liu MH', 'Chen SB', 'Yu J', 'Liu CJ', 'Zhang XJ']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Linyi Central Hospital, Yishui 276400, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Linyi Central Hospital, Yishui 276400, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Linyi Central Hospital, Yishui 276400, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Linyi Central Hospital, Yishui 276400, China.', 'Jinan Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital, Jinan 250001, China.

The most common partner of FGFR1 is ZMYM2, and patients with the ZMYM2-FGFR1 fusion often present with MPN and T-lymphoblastic lymphoma. There are 14 other partners that can fuse with FGFR1, and of interest is the BCR-FGFR1 fusion that results from t(8;22)(p11.2;q11.2). Patients with t(8;22) often show leukocytosis and present with an MPN resembling chronic myeloid leukemia or very rarely, with B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). In this study, we analyzed the clinicopathological, cytogenetic, and molecular features of 2 new patients with the t(8;22)(p11.2;q11.2)/BCR-FGFR1 who presented with B-ALL. An underlying MPN became apparent when a morphologic remission of B-ALL was achieved after chemotherapy. We subsequently reviewed the literature and identified 18 additional cases reported with B-ALL in a background MPN or with the MPN as a chronic phase. Our data suggest that the t(8;22)(p11.2;q11.2)/BCR-FGFR1 may arise from a myeloid/B progenitor cell.

GATA-3-positive acute leukemias with T-cell differentiation were also found to express proto-oncogene C-MYC, in an average of 52% of neoplastic cells, which, along with GATA-3, may contribute to leukemogenesis, as suggested by transgenic mouse models. We conclude that GATA-3 is a sensitive and specific marker for the diagnosis of acute leukemias with T-cell differentiation and may be a useful addition to the panel of immunophenotypic markers for the diagnostic evaluation of acute leukemias.","['Dorfman, David M', 'Morgan, Elizabeth A', 'Pelton, Ashley', 'Unitt, Christine']","['Dorfman DM', 'Morgan EA', 'Pelton A', 'Unitt C']",,"[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

A proper discussion about fertility preservation options before the use of therapies with potential gonadotoxicity (i.e. oncofertility counseling) is standard of care and should be offered to all patients of childbearing age. Temporary ovarian suppression with LH-RH analogs, oocyte and embryo cryopreservation are standard strategies for fertility preservation in female cancer patients. Oocyte cryopreservation should be preferred to embryo cryopreservation when this latter is prohibited by law, avoided for ethical or religious issues and in single women refusing sperm donation. Despite the increasing use of this strategy, data are still lacking about the efficacy and safety of the procedure in female cancer patients, with most of the evidence on this regard deriving from infertile non-oncologic women. This article aims at critically review the available evidence about the success of oocyte cryopreservation in female cancer patients with the final goal to further improve the oncofertility counseling of these women.","['Massarotti, Claudia', 'Scaruffi, Paola', 'Lambertini, Matteo', 'Remorgida, Valentino', 'Del Mastro, Lucia', 'Anserini, Paola']","['Massarotti C', 'Scaruffi P', 'Lambertini M', 'Remorgida V', 'Del Mastro L', 'Anserini P']",,"['Department of Neurosciences, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.

Methods: Colony-forming assay was used to detect the proliferation of KG-1a cells treated with different concentration of ATO and ACM. Compusyn software was used to analyze the synergistic effect of ATO and ACM. Flow cytometry and Wright's staining were used to analyze the apoptotic rate of KG-1a cells induced by combined treatment of ATO and ACM. Western blot was used to determine the expression of proteins associated with apoptosis. Results: The cytotoxicity of arsenic trioxide or aclacinomycin alone was in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the apoptotic rate of KG-1a cells treated with both 0.4 mumol/L ATO and 10 nmol/L ACM was (34.5+/-3.1)%, significantly higher than (7.6+/-1.1)% of 0.4 mumol/L ATO treatment or (18.7+/-2.3) % of 10 nmol/L ACM treatment alone (P<0.05). The apoptotic rate of KG-1a cells treated with both 1.5 mumol/L ATO and 37.5 nmol/L ACM was (52.5+/-4.7)%, significantly higher than (19.1+/-3.2)% of 1.5 mumol/L ATO treatment or (27.7+/-2.2)% of 37.5 nmol/L ACM treatment alone (P<0.05). The apoptotic rate of KG-1a cells treated with both 3.0 mumol/L ATO and 75 nmol/L ACM was (61.3+/-4.5)%, significantly higher than (29.5+/-2.5)% of 3.0 mumol/L ATO treatment or (28.6+/-3.4) % of 75 nmol/L ACM treatment alone (P<0.05). In addition, the result of Wright's staining showed that combined treatment of ATO and ACM induced a more apparent phenotype of apoptosis when compared with single agent treatment. Compusyn software analysis showed that the combination index (CI) value of combined treatment group was less than 1, which indicated the synergistic effect of these two agents. Conclusions: Combined treatment of ATO and ACM shows a synergistic lethal effect on human acute myeloid leukemia cell line KG-1a via activating the apoptotic pathway, which inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis.","['Ye, Y B', 'Xu, X J', 'Chen, Y H', 'Zhang, M W', 'Qiu, D F', 'Guo, Z W', 'He, H Q']","['Ye YB', 'Xu XJ', 'Chen YH', 'Zhang MW', 'Qiu DF', 'Guo ZW', 'He HQ']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University & Zhongshan People's Hospital, Zhongshan 528403, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University & Zhongshan People's Hospital, Zhongshan 528403, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University & Zhongshan People's Hospital, Zhongshan 528403, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University & Zhongshan People's Hospital, Zhongshan 528403, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University & Zhongshan People's Hospital, Zhongshan 528403, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University & Zhongshan People's Hospital, Zhongshan 528403, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University & Zhongshan People's Hospital, Zhongshan 528403, China.""]",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],7910681,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (aclacinomycins)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,2017/05/28 06:00,2017/08/09 06:00,['2017/05/28 06:00'],"['2017/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-3766.2017.04.004 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2017 Apr 23;39(4):256-262. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-3766.2017.04.004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2274407 (G912T; K304N) is located in the 3' splice acceptor site of exon 8 of ABCC4 pre-mRNA. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of rs2274407 in childhood ALL and its possible functional effect on MRP4. METHODS: ABCC4 G912T SNP was genotyped in 145 Iranian Philadelphia-negative (Ph(-)) children with ALL using modified tetra-primer ARMS PCR and evaluated for possible association with 3-year disease-free survival (3DFS). In addition, functional impact of rs2274407 on the MRP4 activity and possible post-transcriptional modifications were bioinformatically and experimentally studied. RESULTS: ABCC4 912T allele carriers (G/T and T/T genotypes) are associated with worse 3DFS in Pre-B cell ALL [P = 0.00019, OR (95% CI) = 13.17 (2.55-68.11)]. In addition, computational studies showed that K304N alteration has no impact on the MRP4 activity. However, it may disrupt the normal splicing process of ABCC4 pre-mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: To date, this is the first study that shows the potential functional impact of rs2274407 SNP on the aberrant splicing of ABCC4 mRNA. We also demonstrated a robust association between G912T and pediatric ALL negative outcome, which may be explained by the novel computational studies performed in this study.","['Mesrian Tanha, Hamzeh', 'Rahgozar, Soheila', 'Mojtabavi Naeini, Marjan']","['Mesrian Tanha H', 'Rahgozar S', 'Mojtabavi Naeini M']",,"['Division of Cell and Molecular Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan, Hezar Jarib Street, Isfahan, 81746-73441, Iran.', 'Division of Cell and Molecular Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan, Hezar Jarib Street, Isfahan, 81746-73441, Iran. rahgozar@sci.ui.ac.ir.', 'Division of Cell and Molecular Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan, Hezar Jarib Street, Isfahan, 81746-73441, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170526,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (ABCC4 protein, human)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (RNA Splice Sites)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Exons', 'Female', '*Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Iran', 'Male', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'RNA Splice Sites/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",,2017/05/28 06:00,2017/07/18 06:00,['2017/05/28 06:00'],"['2017/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00280-017-3340-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-017-3340-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2017 Jul;80(1):109-117. doi: 10.1007/s00280-017-3340-7.

METHODS: Adult survivors (18 years+) who had been diagnosed with a haematological cancer were recruited to a cross-sectional mailed survey via five state cancer registries in Australia. Participating survivors invited a support person to also complete a survey. Structural equation modelling was used to explore the relationships among survivor and support person self-reported depression, anxiety, and unmet needs. RESULTS: Of the 4299 eligible haematological cancer survivors contacted by the registries, 1511 (35%) returned a completed survey as did 1004 support persons. There were 787 dyads with complete data. After adjusting for age, gender, rurality, cancer type, and whether the support person was a relative, positive correlations were found between survivor and support person scores for depression (p = 0.0029) and unmet needs (p < 0.001), but not anxiety scores (p = 0.075). Survivor unmet needs were significantly related to support person depression (p = 0.0036). Support person unmet needs were significantly related to a higher depression score for survivors (p = 0.0067). Greater support person unmet needs were significantly related to a higher anxiety score for survivors (p = 0.0083). Survivor unmet needs did not have a significant relationship to support person anxiety (p = 0.78). CONCLUSION: Unmet needs may mediate the interdependence of psychosocial experiences for survivors and support persons, although a longitudinal study is required to confirm causality. Addressing unmet needs may be a potential target for improving outcomes for both groups.","['Paul, Christine', 'Hall, Alix', 'Oldmeadow, Christopher', 'Lynagh, Marita', 'Campbell, Sharon', 'Bradstock, Ken', 'Williamson, Anna', 'Carey, Mariko', 'Sanson-Fisher, Rob']","['Paul C', 'Hall A', 'Oldmeadow C', 'Lynagh M', 'Campbell S', 'Bradstock K', 'Williamson A', 'Carey M', 'Sanson-Fisher R']",,"['School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, 2308, Australia.

However, only a small proportion of CP-CML patients subsequently achieve a deep molecular response (DMR) with imatinib. Dasatinib, a second-generation TKI, is more potent than imatinib in the inhibition of BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase in vitro and more effective in CP-CML patients who do not achieve an optimal response with imatinib treatment. METHODS: In the present study, we attempted to investigate whether switching the treatment from imatinib to dasatinib can induce DMR in 16 CP-CML patients treated with imatinib for at least two years who achieved a major molecular response (MMR) with detectable levels of BCR-ABL1 transcripts. RESULTS: The rates of achievement of DMR at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after switching to dasatinib treatment in the 16 patients were 44% (7/16), 56% (9/16), 63% (10/16) and 75% (12/16), respectively. The cumulative rate of achieving DMR at 12 months from initiation of dasatinib therapy was 93.8% (15/16). The proportion of natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells in peripheral lymphocytes increased after switching to dasatinib. In contrast, the proportion of regulatory T cells decreased during treatment. The safety profile of dasatinib was consistent with previous studies. CONCLUSION: Switching to dasatinib would be a therapeutic option for CP-CML patients who achieved MMR but not DMR by imatinib, especially for patients who wish to discontinue TKI therapy.","['Shiseki, Masayuki', 'Yoshida, Chikashi', 'Takezako, Naoki', 'Ohwada, Akira', 'Kumagai, Takashi', 'Nishiwaki, Kaichi', 'Horikoshi, Akira', 'Fukuda, Tetsuya', 'Takano, Hina', 'Kouzai, Yasuji', 'Tanaka, Junji', 'Morita, Satoshi', 'Sakamoto, Junichi', 'Sakamaki, Hisashi', 'Inokuchi, Koiti']","['Shiseki M', 'Yoshida C', 'Takezako N', 'Ohwada A', 'Kumagai T', 'Nishiwaki K', 'Horikoshi A', 'Fukuda T', 'Takano H', 'Kouzai Y', 'Tanaka J', 'Morita S', 'Sakamoto J', 'Sakamaki H', 'Inokuchi K']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7827-4971'],"[""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, 8-1 Kawadacho, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 162-8666, Japan. shisekim@dh.twmu.ac.jp."", 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Mito Medical Center, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Disaster Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Metropolitan Bokutoh Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Ohme Municipal General Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Clinical Oncology and Hematology, Jikei University Kashiwa Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of General Internal Medicine, Nerima-Hikarigaoka Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Musashino Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Hematology Department, Tokyo Metropolitan Tama Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, 8-1 Kawadacho, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 162-8666, Japan."", 'Department of Biomedical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Tokai Central Hospital, Gifu, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20170526,Japan,Int J Clin Oncol,International journal of clinical oncology,9616295,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Dasatinib/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC5608785,2017/05/28 06:00,2018/05/16 06:00,['2017/05/28 06:00'],"['2017/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10147-017-1141-y [doi]', '10.1007/s10147-017-1141-y [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Oncol. 2017 Oct;22(5):972-979. doi: 10.1007/s10147-017-1141-y.

C329R; c.985 T > C) identified in a patient with JAK2(V617F) Polycythaemia Vera (PV). This substitution affects a conserved cysteine residue in EGFR domain 2 and leads to the formation of a ligand-independent covalent receptor dimer, associated with increased transforming potential. Aberrant signalling from the EGFR(C329R) receptor is cell type-dependent and in the TF1.8 erythroid cell line expression of this mutant suppresses EPO-induced differentiation. Clonal analysis shows that the dominant JAK2(V617F)-positive clone in this PV patient harbors EGFR(C329R), thus this mutation may contribute to clonal expansion. Somatic mutations affecting other ERBB and related receptor tyrosine kinases are observed in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), and we show elevated EGFR levels in MPN samples, consistent with previous reports. Thus activation of this group of receptors, via multiple mechanisms, may contribute to clonal growth and survival of the JAK2(V617F) disease clone in MPN.","['Casolari, D A', 'Nguyen, T', 'Butcher, C

By relating hematopoietic stem cell frequencies to outcome we detected poor overall- and disease-free survival of patients with low hematopoietic stem cell frequencies. Serial analysis of matched diagnostic and follow-up samples further demonstrated that hematopoietic stem cells increased after chemotherapy in patients who achieved durable remissions. However, in patients who eventually relapsed, hematopoietic stem cell numbers decreased dramatically at the time of molecular relapse demonstrating that hematopoietic stem cell levels represent an indirect marker of minimal residual disease, which heralds leukemic relapse. Upon transplantation in immune-deficient mice cases with low percentages of hematopoietic stem cells of our cohort gave rise to leukemic or no engraftment, whereas cases with normal hematopoietic stem cell levels mostly resulted in multi-lineage engraftment. Based on our experimental data, we propose that leukemic stem cells have increased niche affinity in cases with low percentages of hematopoietic stem cells. To validate this hypothesis, we developed new mathematical models describing the dynamics of healthy and leukemic cells under different regulatory scenarios. These models suggest that the mechanism leading to decreases in hematopoietic stem cell frequencies before leukemic relapse must be based on expansion of leukemic stem cells with high niche affinity and the ability to dislodge hematopoietic stem cells. Thus, our data suggest that decreasing numbers of hematopoietic stem cells indicate leukemic stem cell persistence and the emergence of leukemic relapse.","['Wang, Wenwen', 'Stiehl, Thomas', 'Raffel, Simon', 'Hoang, Van T', 'Hoffmann, Isabel', 'Poisa-Beiro, Laura', 'Saeed, Borhan R', 'Blume, Rachel', 'Manta, Linda', 'Eckstein, Volker', 'Bochtler, Tilmann', 'Wuchter, Patrick', 'Essers, Marieke', 'Jauch, Anna', 'Trumpp, Andreas', 'Marciniak-Czochra, Anna', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Lutz, Christoph']","['Wang W', 'Stiehl T', 'Raffel S', 'Hoang VT', 'Hoffmann I', 'Poisa-Beiro L', 'Saeed BR', 'Blume R', 'Manta L', 'Eckstein V', 'Bochtler T', 'Wuchter P', 'Essers M', 'Jauch A', 'Trumpp A', 'Marciniak-Czochra A', 'Ho AD', 'Lutz C']",,"['Department of Medicine V, Heidelberg University, Germany.', 'Institute of Applied Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing (IWR), BIOQUANT, Heidelberg University, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Heidelberg University, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cells and Cancer, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Heidelberg Institute for Stem Cell Technology and Experimental Medicine (HI-STEM gGmbH), Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Heidelberg University, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Heidelberg University, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Heidelberg University, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Heidelberg University, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Heidelberg University, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Heidelberg University, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Heidelberg University, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Heidelberg University, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Unit Molecular Hematology/Oncology, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Heidelberg University, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cells and Cancer, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Heidelberg Institute for Stem Cell Technology and Experimental Medicine (HI-STEM gGmbH), Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Heidelberg University, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cells and Cancer, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Heidelberg Institute for Stem Cell Technology and Experimental Medicine (HI-STEM gGmbH), Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Applied Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing (IWR), BIOQUANT, Heidelberg University, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Heidelberg University, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Heidelberg University, Germany christoph.lutz@med.uni-heidelberg.de.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170526,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Survival Rate']",PMC5685219,2017/05/28 06:00,2018/05/08 06:00,['2017/05/28 06:00'],"['2017/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2016.163584 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2016.163584 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2017 Sep;102(9):1567-1577. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.163584.

Despite nondetectable CNS leukemia in many cases, prophylactic CNS-directed conventional intrathecal chemotherapy is required for relapse-free survival, indicating subclinical CNS manifestation in most patients. However, CNS-directed therapy is associated with long-term sequelae, including neurocognitive deficits and secondary neoplasms. Therefore, molecular mechanisms and pathways mediating leukemia-cell entry into the CNS need to be understood to identify targets for prophylactic and therapeutic interventions and develop alternative CNS-directed treatment strategies. In this study, we analyzed leukemia-cell entry into the CNS using a primograft ALL mouse model. We found that primary ALL cells transplanted onto nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice faithfully recapitulated clinical and pathological features of meningeal infiltration seen in patients with ALL. ALL cells that had entered the CNS and were infiltrating the meninges were characterized by high expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF). Although cellular viability, growth, proliferation, and survival of ALL cells were found to be independent of VEGF, transendothelial migration through CNS microvascular endothelial cells was regulated by VEGF. The importance of VEGF produced by ALL cells in mediating leukemia-cell entry into the CNS and leptomeningeal infiltration was further demonstrated by specific reduction of CNS leukemia on in vivo VEGF capture by the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab. Thus, we identified a mechanism of ALL-cell entry into the CNS, which by targeting VEGF signaling may serve as a novel strategy to control CNS leukemia in patients, replacing conventional CNS-toxic treatment.","['Munch, Vera', 'Trentin, Luca', 'Herzig, Julia', 'Demir, Salih', 'Seyfried, Felix', 'Kraus, Johann M', 'Kestler, Hans A', 'Kohler, Rolf', 'Barth, Thomas F E', 'Te Kronnie, Geertruy', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael', 'Meyer, Luder H']","['Munch V', 'Trentin L', 'Herzig J', 'Demir S', 'Seyfried F', 'Kraus JM', 'Kestler HA', 'Kohler R', 'Barth TFE', 'Te Kronnie G', 'Debatin KM', 'Meyer LH']",,"['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'International Graduate School in Molecular Medicine and.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'International Graduate School in Molecular Medicine and.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Systems Biology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Systems Biology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute for Pathology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany; and.', ""Laboratory of Oncohematology, Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padua, Padua, Italy."", 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170526,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '2S9ZZM9Q9V (Bevacizumab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bevacizumab/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Endothelial Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Leukemic Infiltration/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transendothelial and Transepithelial Migration/drug effects', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",,2017/05/28 06:00,2017/08/11 06:00,['2017/05/28 06:00'],"['2017/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33136-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-03-769315 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Aug 3;130(5):643-654. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-03-769315.

Ibrutinib, an inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, has demonstrated impressive response rates in the relapsed/refractory setting, including in the setting of Del17p and/or TP53 mutations. Venetoclax, an inhibitor of BCL-2 known to play an important role in regulating cell death, has been approved recently for treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia with Del17p who have received at least one prior therapy. Unfortunately, a cure remains unattainable unless eligible patients are offered an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. However, hematopoietic cell allografting is limited by the availability of suitable donors and significant morbidity and mortality. Recent clinical practice recommendations by the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation have relegated the role of transplantation to later stages of the disease. In patients with evidence of Richter syndrome, frontline consolidation allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation remains the most desirable approach owing to the limited activity of ibrutinib or other novel therapies. Further therapeutic advances would require enrolling these patients in large clinical trials that evaluate novel therapies alone or in combination with traditional chemotherapies or even in the setting of posttransplant consolidation/maintenance.","['Rafei, Hind', 'Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A']","['Rafei H', 'Kharfan-Dabaja MA']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, George Washington University School of Medicine, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, H.

Indole-3-formaldehyde derivatives limit the growth and facilitate cell death in different cell systems. In this study, we introduced a novel indole derivative (2-AITFEI-3-F) with tendency to facilitate apoptosis in NB4 line in comparison to basal Indole-3-formaldehyde (I3F). METHODS: The NB4 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium contained 2-AITFEI-3-F and I3F (15.12-1000mug/mL) for 24, 48 and 72h. Inhibition of cell proliferation was assessed by trypan blue staining technique and MTT assay. The fold changes of Bax/Bcl-2 expression against beta-actin were determined by real-time-PCR technique. Western blotting analysis was also applied for evaluating the expression of Bax and Bcl2 at protein level. Data were analyzed by student t and repeated measure tests. Differences were considered significant if (P<0.01). RESULTS: There was a significant difference in cell viability, when various concentrations of 2-AITFEI-3-F (but similar to I3F) were used for 24, 48 and 72h in comparison to I3F regarding the cellular viability (P<0.05). Real time PCR and Western blotting analysis indicated that the gene and protein expression level of Bcl-2 down-regulated while Bax was up-regulated in compare to untreated control cells and cells treated with I3F (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: According to these findings, the novel indole derivative 2-AITFEI-3-F probably triggered apoptosis of NB4 cells by modulating Bax/Bcl-2 ratio.

However, despite important advances in elucidating molecular mechanisms, the treatment of AML has not improved significantly, remaining anchored at the standard chemotherapy regimen ""3 + 7"", with the prognosis of patients remaining severe, especially for the elderly and for those not eligible for transplant procedures. The biological and clinical heterogeneity of AML represents the major obstacle that hinders the improvement of prognosis and the identification of new effective therapeutic approaches. To date, abundant information has been collected on the genetic and molecular alterations of AML carrying prognostic significance. However, not enough is known on how AML progenitors regulate proliferation and survival by redundant and cross-talking signal transduction pathways (STP). Furthermore, it remains unclear how such complicated network affects prognosis and therapeutic treatment options, although many of these molecular determinants are potentially attractive for their druggable characteristics. In this review, some of the key STP frequently deregulated in AML, such as PI3k/Akt/mTOR pathway, GSK3 and components of Bcl-2 family of proteins, are summarized, highlighting in addition their interplay. Based on this information, we reviewed new targeted therapeutic approaches, focusing on the aberrant networks that sustain the AML blast proliferation, survival and drug resistance, aiming to improve disease treatment. Finally, we reported the approaches aimed at disrupting key signaling cross-talk overcoming resistances based on the combination of different targeting therapeutic strategies.","['Ricciardi, Maria Rosaria', 'Mirabilii, Simone', 'Licchetta, Roberto', 'Piedimonte, Monica', 'Tafuri, Agostino']","['Ricciardi MR', 'Mirabilii S', 'Licchetta R', 'Piedimonte M', 'Tafuri A']",,"['Hematology, ""Sant\'Andrea"" Hospital-Sapienza, University of Rome, Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, ""Sant\'Andrea"" Hospital-Sapienza, University of Rome, Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Rome, Italy.

Patient improvement completely depends on the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. So there is a great demand for diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In this study, a novel assay based on dual-aptamer (Sgc8c and ATP aptamers)-functionalized graphene oxide (DAFGO) complex was designed for the identification of Molt-4 cells (human acute lymphoblastic leukemia T-cell). This assay relies on the internalization of DAFGO complex into Molt-4 cells, but not into U266 cells, using Sgc8c aptamer as molecular recognition probe, and release of FAM-labeled ATP aptamer from the complex in the presence of high amounts of ATP in lysosome, leading to a strong fluorescence emission. Formation of DAFGO complex was analyzed by fluorometric analysis and gel retardation assay. The internalization of complex was monitored by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy in Molt-4 (target) and U266 cells (nontarget) with DAFGO complex. Our results showed that the developed complex was efficiently internalized into target cells and induced a strong fluorescence emission.","['Bahreyni, Amirhossein', 'Yazdian-Robati, Rezvan', 'Ramezani, Mohammad', 'Rasouli, Mehdi', 'Alinezhad Nameghi, Morteza', 'Alibolandi, Mona', 'Abnous, Khalil', 'Taghdisi, Seyed Mohammad']","['Bahreyni A', 'Yazdian-Robati R', 'Ramezani M', 'Rasouli M', 'Alinezhad Nameghi M', 'Alibolandi M', 'Abnous K', 'Taghdisi SM']",,"['1 Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Immunogenetic Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Mazandaran, Iran.', '2 Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', '3 Nanotechnology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', '1 Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Immunogenetic Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Mazandaran, Iran.', '4 School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', '5 Pharmaceutical Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', '5 Pharmaceutical Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', '6 Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', '7 Targeted Drug Delivery Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170526,England,J Biomater Appl,Journal of biomaterials applications,8813912,"['0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Oxides)', '7782-42-5 (Graphite)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (PTK7 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/analysis', 'Aptamers, Nucleotide/*chemistry', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Graphite/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Optical Imaging/*methods', 'Oxides/chemistry', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnostic imaging', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis']",,2017/05/28 06:00,2018/05/04 06:00,['2017/05/28 06:00'],"['2017/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0885328217712111 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomater Appl. 2017 Jul;32(1):74-81. doi: 10.1177/0885328217712111.

Relevant VAE comprise peripheral, cerebral, and coronary artery changes in patients receiving nilotinib, venous and arterial occlusive events during ponatinib therapy, and pulmonary hypertension in patients receiving dasatinib. Although each TKI binds to a unique profile of molecular targets in leukemic cells and vascular cells, the exact etiology of drug-induced vasculopathies remains uncertain. Recent data suggest that predisposing molecular factors, pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors as well as certain comorbidities contribute to the etiology of VAE in these patients. In addition, direct effects of these TKI on vascular endothelial cells have been demonstrated and are considered to contribute essentially to VAE evolution. In the current article, we discuss mechanisms underlying the occurrence of VAE in TKI-treated patients with CML, with special emphasis on vascular and perivascular target cells and involved molecular (vascular) targets of VAE-triggering TKI. In addition, we discuss optimal patient selection and drug selection through which the risk of occurrence of cardiovascular events can hopefully be minimized while maintaining optimal anti-leukemic effects in CML, thereby following the principles of personalized medicine.","['Valent, Peter', 'Hadzijusufovic, Emir', 'Hoermann, Gregor', 'Fureder, Wolfgang', 'Schernthaner, Gerit-Holger', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Kirchmair, Rudolf', 'Wolf, Dominik']","['Valent P', 'Hadzijusufovic E', 'Hoermann G', 'Fureder W', 'Schernthaner GH', 'Sperr WR', 'Kirchmair R', 'Wolf D']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria; Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.

The expressed fusion protein incorporates domains of both parental proteins. Using a methodology that treats discrete protein domains as binding sites for specific domains of interacting proteins, we have cataloged the protein interaction networks for 11 528 cancer fusions (ChiTaRS-3.1). Here, we present our novel method, chimeric protein-protein interactions (ChiPPI) that uses the domain-domain co-occurrence scores in order to identify preserved interactors of chimeric proteins. Mapping the influence of fusion proteins on cell metabolism and pathways reveals that ChiPPI networks often lose tumor suppressor proteins and gain oncoproteins. Furthermore, fusions often induce novel connections between non-interactors skewing interaction networks and signaling pathways. We compared fusion protein PPI networks in leukemia/lymphoma, sarcoma and solid tumors finding distinct enrichment patterns for each disease type. While certain pathways are enriched in all three diseases (Wnt, Notch and TGF beta), there are distinct patterns for leukemia (EGFR signaling, DNA replication and CCKR signaling), for sarcoma (p53 pathway and CCKR signaling) and solid tumors (FGFR and EGFR signaling). Thus, the ChiPPI method represents a comprehensive tool for studying the anomaly of skewed cellular networks produced by fusion proteins in cancer.","['Frenkel-Morgenstern, Milana', 'Gorohovski, Alessandro', 'Tagore, Somnath', 'Sekar, Vaishnovi', 'Vazquez, Miguel', 'Valencia, Alfonso']","['Frenkel-Morgenstern M', 'Gorohovski A', 'Tagore S', 'Sekar V', 'Vazquez M', 'Valencia A']",,"['Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan-University, Henrietta Szold 8, Safed 1311502, Israel.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan-University, Henrietta Szold 8, Safed 1311502, Israel.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Bar-Ilan-University, Henrietta Szold 8, Safed 1311502, Israel.', 'Structural Biology and BioComputing Programme, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), M.F.Almagro 3, 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Structural Biology and BioComputing Programme, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), M.F.Almagro 3, 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Structural Biology and BioComputing Programme, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), M.F.Almagro 3, 28029 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)']",IM,"['*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Interaction Mapping/*methods', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/metabolism', 'Sarcoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction', '*Software', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC5499553,2017/05/27 06:00,2017/10/12 06:00,['2017/05/27 06:00'],"['2016/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['3854948 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkx423 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2017 Jul 7;45(12):7094-7105. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkx423.,,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2017.

Methods: We used the Ovid SP platform to search Medline, Medline In-Process, and Embase for studies that identified risk factors for IFD in children with cancer or those who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We included studies if they consisted of children or adolescents (<25 years) who were receiving treatment for cancer or undergoing HSCT and if the study evaluated risk factors among patients with and those without IFD. Results: Among the 3566 studies screened, 22 studies were included. A number of pediatric factors commonly associated with an increased risk for IFD were confirmed, including prolonged neutropenia, high-dose steroid exposure, intensive-timing chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia, and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease. Increasing age, a factor not commonly associated with IFD risk, was identified as a risk factor in multiple published cohorts. Conclusions: With this systematic review, we have confirmed IFD risk factors that are considered routinely in daily clinical practice. Increasing age should also be considered when assessing patient risk for IFD. Future efforts should focus on defining more precise thresholds for a particular risk factor (ie, age, neutropenia duration) and on development of prediction rules inclusive of individual factors to further refine the risk prediction.","['Fisher, Brian T', 'Robinson, Paula D', 'Lehrnbecher, Thomas', 'Steinbach, William J', 'Zaoutis, Theoklis E', 'Phillips, Bob', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Fisher BT', 'Robinson PD', 'Lehrnbecher T', 'Steinbach WJ', 'Zaoutis TE', 'Phillips B', 'Sung L']",,"[""Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario, Toronto, Canada.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.', ""Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Leeds General Infirmary, Leeds Teaching Hospitals, NHS Trust.', 'Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['PDF-2014-07-072/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,England,J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,101586049,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/adverse effects', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects', 'Invasive Fungal Infections/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/complications', 'Risk Factors']",,2017/05/27 06:00,2018/11/14 06:00,['2017/05/27 06:00'],"['2016/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['3855046 [pii]', '10.1093/jpids/pix030 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc. 2018 Aug 17;7(3):191-198. doi: 10.1093/jpids/pix030.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the germline, cell-autonomous DAF-16 activity prevents stem cell proliferation, thus acting tumor-suppressive. In contrast, hypodermal DAF-16 causes a tumorous germline phenotype characterized by hyperproliferation of the germline stem cells and rupture of the adjacent basement membrane. Here we show that cross-talk between DAF-16 and the transforming growth factor ss (TGFss)/bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling pathway causes germline hyperplasia and results in disruption of the basement membrane. In addition to activating MADM/NRBP/hpo-11 gene alone, DAF-16 also directly interacts with both R-SMAD proteins SMA-2 and SMA-3 in the nucleus to regulate the expression of mTORC1 pathway. Knocking-down of BMP genes or each of the four target genes in the hypodermis was sufficient to inhibit germline proliferation, indicating a cell-non-autonomously controlled regulation of stem cell proliferation by somatic tissues. We propose the existence of two antagonistic DAF-16/FOXO functions, a cell-proliferative somatic and an anti-proliferative germline activity. Whereas germline hyperplasia under reduced IIS is inhibited by DAF-16 cell-autonomously, activation of somatic DAF-16 in the presence of active IIS promotes germline proliferation and eventually induces tumor-like germline growth. In summary, our results suggest a novel pathway crosstalk of DAF-16 and TGF-ss/BMP that can modulate mTORC1 at the transcriptional level to cause stem-cell hyperproliferation. Such cell-type specific differences may help explaining why human FOXO activity is considered to be tumor-suppressive in most contexts, but may become oncogenic, e.g. in chronic and acute myeloid leukemia.","['Qi, Wenjing', 'Yan, Yijian', 'Pfeifer, Dietmar', 'Donner V Gromoff, Erika', 'Wang, Yimin', 'Maier, Wolfgang', 'Baumeister, Ralf']","['Qi W', 'Yan Y', 'Pfeifer D', 'Donner V Gromoff E', 'Wang Y', 'Maier W', 'Baumeister R']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9287-5837'],"['Bioinformatics and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany.', 'Bioinformatics and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany.', 'Bioinformatics and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany.', 'Bioinformatics and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany.', 'Bioinformatics and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany.', 'Bioinformatics and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany.', 'Center for Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Research, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany.', 'Centre for Biological Signaling Studies (BIOSS), University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170526,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,"['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (daf-16 protein, C elegans)', '0 (sma-2 protein, C elegans)', '0 (sma-3 protein, C elegans)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/*metabolism', 'Caenorhabditis elegans/cytology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Epidermal Cells', 'Epidermis/metabolism', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Multiprotein Complexes/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism/physiology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism']",PMC5467913,2017/05/27 06:00,2017/06/29 06:00,['2017/05/27 06:00'],"['2016/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1006801 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-16-01540 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Genet. 2017 May 26;13(5):e1006801. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006801. eCollection 2017 May.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that Natural Killer (NK) cell defects in AML are predictors of poor overall survival (OS). This study aimins at validating NKp30, a receptor that mediates NK activation, as a prognostic biomarker for AML patients with intermediate prognosis.NKp30 expression was prospectively assessed at diagnosis on NK cells from peripheral blood by flow cytometry (N = 201 patients). Clinical outcome was evaluated with regard to NKp30 status.In patients with intermediate cytogenetic (N = 162), NKp30high phenotype at diagnosis was predictive of better OS (HR = 0.26; 95%CI = [0.14-0.50]; P < 0.0001) and relapse-free survival (RFS) (HR = 0.21; 95%CI = [0.08-0.52]; P = 0.0007). In patients with intermediate ELN (N = 116), NKp30high phenotype at diagnosis was predictive of better OS (HR = 0.33; 95%CI = [0.16-0.67]; P = 0.0019) and RFS (HR = 0.24; 95%CI = [0.08-0.67]; P = 0.0058). In multivariate analysis, high NKp30 expression independently predicted improved OS (HR = 0.56, P = 0.046) and RFS (HR = 0.37, P = 0.048). Consistently, cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was lower in patients with high NKp30 expression (HR = 0.37, P = 0.026).In conclusion, we propose NKp30 status as a simple and early prognostic biomarker that identifies intermediate-risk patients with poor prognosis who otherwise may not be identified with existing risk stratification systems.","['Chretien, Anne-Sophie', 'Fauriat, Cyril',

It is hoped that dissection of the cellular functions and interconnections of network factors will aid our understanding of ESC and cancer biology. Proteomic and genomic approaches have identified Nac1 as a member of the core pluripotency network. However, previous studies have predominantly focused on the role of Nac1 in psychomotor stimulant response and cancer pathogenesis. In this study, we report that Nac1 is a self-renewal promoting factor, but is not required for maintaining pluripotency of ESCs. Loss of function of Nac1 in ESCs results in a reduced proliferation rate and an enhanced differentiation propensity. Nac1 overexpression promotes ESC proliferation and delays ESC differentiation in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Furthermore, we demonstrated that Nac1 directly binds to the c-Myc promoter and regulates c-Myc transcription. The study also revealed that the function of Nac1 in promoting ESC self-renewal appears to be partially mediated by c-Myc. These findings establish a functional link between the core and c-Myc-centered networks and provide new insights into mechanisms of stemness regulation in ESCs and cancer.","['Ruan, Yan', 'He, Jianrong', 'Wu, Wei', 'He, Ping', 'Tian, Yanping', 'Xiao, Lan', 'Liu, Gaoke', 'Wang, Jiali', 'Cheng, Yuda', 'Zhang, Shuo', 'Yang, Yi', 'Xiong, Jiaxiang', 'Zhao, Ke', 'Wan, Ying', 'Huang, He', 'Zhang, Junlei', 'Jian, Rui']","['Ruan Y', 'He J', 'Wu W', 'He P', 'Tian Y', 'Xiao L', 'Liu G', 'Wang J', 'Cheng Y', 'Zhang S', 'Yang Y', 'Xiong J', 'Zhao K', 'Wan Y', 'Huang H', 'Zhang J', 'Jian R']",,"['Laboratory of Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, Department of Histology and Embryology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Biomedical Analysis Center, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, Department of Histology and Embryology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400037, China.', 'Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, Department of Histology and Embryology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, Department of Histology and Embryology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, Department of Histology and Embryology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, Department of Histology and Embryology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, Department of Histology and Embryology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, Department of Histology and Embryology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Experimental Center of Basic Medicine, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Experimental Center of Basic Medicine, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Biomedical Analysis Center, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400037, China.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, Department of Histology and Embryology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, Department of Histology and Embryology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nacc1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Self Renewal/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",PMC5564591,2017/05/27 06:00,2018/04/24 06:00,['2017/05/27 06:00'],"['2017/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['17744 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.17744 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jul 18;8(29):47607-47618. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.17744.,['NOTNLM'],"['Nac1', 'c-Myc', 'embryonic stem cells', 'self-renewal', 'transcriptional regulation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixty-seven patients aged 18 years or younger were included. Fifty-five CSF samples were analyzed at initial diagnosis and 17 at the time of relapse. A cytological analysis (CA) was performed in all 72 samples, while IMP was done in 63. Blasts were identified in only three samples by CA, whereas all three samples were found negative by IMP, one of which had no isolation of nucleated cells after centrifugation. Among the samples analyzed by IMP, 11 showed a positive blast count, two of which had been inconclusive using CA. No equivalence was found between CA and IMP results (p = 0.55). CSF IMP positivity was not associated with other risk factors for ALL relapse. Among the 55 patients included at the time of diagnosis of ALL, eight relapsed during follow-up. Considering the cases of central nervous system (CNS) relapse, one of the patients belonged to the CSF IMP-positive group (11%) at diagnosis, and the other two cases, to the IMP-negative (5%) group. Detection of CSF blast cells using IMP was associated with a worse overall (p < 0.0001) and event-free survival (p < 0.0001). These results show that CSF IMP may be a useful additional method to conventional CA in the diagnosis of CNS involvement in ALL, and for the identification of high-risk subgroups that would benefit from an intensified therapy.","['Cancela, Camila Silva Peres', 'Murao, Mitiko', 'Assumpcao, Juliana Godoy', 'Souza, Marcelo Eduardo de Lima', 'de Macedo, Antonio Vaz', 'Viana, Marcos Borato', 'De Oliveira, Benigna Maria']","['Cancela CSP', 'Murao M', 'Assumpcao JG', 'Souza MEL', 'de Macedo AV', 'Viana MB', 'De Oliveira BM']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9665-2115'],"['a Faculdade de Medicina/Departamento de Pediatria, Bairro Santa Efigenia , Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais , Belo Horizonte , Brazil.', 'b Hospital das Clinicas da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais , Servico de Hematologia , Belo Horizonte , Brazil.', 'c Geneticenter , Belo Horizonte , Brazil.', 'd Hospital das Clinicas da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais , Belo Horizonte , Brazil.', 'd Hospital das Clinicas da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais , Belo Horizonte , Brazil.', 'e Faculdade de Medicina-UFMG, Pediatrics, Sala , Belo Horizonte , Brazil.', 'e Faculdade de Medicina-UFMG, Pediatrics, Sala , Belo Horizonte , Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20170526,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', '*Blast Crisis/cerebrospinal fluid/diagnosis/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/cerebrospinal fluid/diagnosis/therapy', 'Prognosis']",,2017/05/27 06:00,2018/01/03 06:00,['2017/05/27 06:00'],"['2017/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08880018.2017.1313920 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2017 Mar;34(2):53-65. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2017.1313920.

One hundred and seventy-six patients were treated with HDAC-135 and 392 patients with HDAC-123 with prophylactic pegfilgrastim at days 10 and 8, respectively, in the AMLSG 07-04 and the German AML Intergroup protocol. Time from start to chemotherapy until hematologic recovery with white blood cells >1.0 G/l and neutrophils >0.5 G/l was in median 4 days shorter in patients receiving HDAC-123 compared with HDAC-135 (P<0.0001, each), and further reduced by 2 days (P<0.0001) by pegfilgrastim. Rates of infections were reduced by HDAC-123 (P<0.0001) and pegfilgrastim (P=0.002). Days in hospital and platelet transfusions were significantly reduced by HDAC-123 compared with HDAC-135. Survival was neither affected by HDAC-123 versus HDAC-135 nor by pegfilgrastim. In conclusion, consolidation therapy with HDAC-123 leads to faster hematologic recovery and less infections, platelet transfusions as well as days in hospital without affecting survival.","['Jaramillo, S', 'Benner, A', 'Krauter, J', 'Martin, H', 'Kindler, T', 'Bentz, M', 'Salih, H R', 'Held, G', 'Kohne, C-H', 'Gotze, K', 'Lubbert, M', 'Kundgen, A', 'Brossart, P', 'Wattad,

Immunoassays for the p27 core protein of FeLV aid in the detection of FeLV infections. Commercial microtiter-plate ELISAs have rapid protocols and visual result interpretation, limiting their usefulness in high-throughput situations. The purpose of our study was to validate the PetChek FeLV 15 ELISA, which is designed for the reference laboratory, and incorporates sequential, orthogonal screening and confirmatory protocols. A cutoff for the screening assay was established with 100% accuracy using 309 feline samples (244 negative, 65 positive) defined by the combined results of FeLV PCR and an independent reference p27 antigen ELISA. Precision of the screening assay was measured using a panel of 3 samples (negative, low-positive, and high-positive). The intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) was 3.9-7.9%; the inter-assay CV was 6.0-8.6%. For the confirmatory assay, the intra-assay CV was 3.0-4.7%, and the inter-assay CV was 7.4-9.7%. The analytical sensitivity for p27 antigen was 3.7 ng/mL for inactivated whole FeLV and 1.2 ng/mL for purified recombinant FeLV p27. Analytical specificity was demonstrated based on the absence of cross-reactivity to related retroviruses. No interference was observed for samples containing added bilirubin, hemoglobin, or lipids. Based on these results, the new high-throughput design of the PetChek FeLV 15 ELISA makes it suitable for use in reference laboratory settings and maintains overall analytical performance.","['Buch,

However, additional genetic changes are known to be required for the development of this type of leukaemia. Therefore, we here aimed to assess the somatic mutational profile of four ALL cases carrying the ETV6/RUNX1 fusion gene using whole-exome sequencing. Methods: DNA was isolated from bone marrow samples using a QIAmp DNA Blood Mini kit and subsequently sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq system. Results: We identified 12,960 to17,601 mutations in each sample, with a total of 16,466 somatic mutations in total. Some 15,533 variants were single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 129 were substitutions, 415 were insertions and 389 were deletions. When taking into account the coding region and protein impact, 1,875 variants were synonymous and 1,956 were non-synonymous SNPs. Among non-synonymous SNPs, 1,862 were missense, 13 nonsense, 35 frameshifts, 11 nonstop, 3 misstart, 15 splices disrupt and 17 in-frame indels.

In the absence of dysplasia, an acquired clonal genetic abnormality is required or causes for reactive monocytosis have to be excluded. Oligomonocytic chronic myelomonocytic leukemia showing increased monocytes but no absolute monocytosis in the peripheral blood occurs occasionally. These cases are likely classified as myelodysplastic syndrome or myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable. A subset eventually develop overt chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Better characterization of oligomonocytic chronic myelomonocytic leukemia is essential since the distinction between chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome is clinically relevant. We identified 44 cases of oligomonocytic chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (>/=10% peripheral blood monocytes with absolute monocyte count of 0.5-1 x 10(9)/l) and 28 consecutive chronic myelomonocytic leukemia controls. Clinicopathologic features were compared and mutation analysis was performed. Oligomonocytic chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patients were significantly younger (median age of 65 vs 72). They had lower WBC and absolute neutrophil count, while the monocyte percentage, hemoglobin and platelet counts were similar in the two groups. The myeloid to erythroid ratio was predominantly decreased or normal, compared with the characteristic increase in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (P=0.006). 38% of patients progressed to overt chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (median: 12 months). The overall percentage of mutations was significantly lower in oligomonocytic chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. However, the most frequent mutations in both groups were the 'signature' chronic myelomonocytic leukemia mutations in ASXL1, TET2 and SRSF2. Mutations in CBL were found exclusively in overt chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. In conclusion, we demonstrate clinical and genetic similarities between overt chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and oligomonocytic chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The findings suggest that at least a subset of oligomonocytic chronic myelomonocytic leukemia represents early phase 'dysplastic type' chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.","['Geyer, Julia T', 'Tam, Wayne', 'Liu, Yen-Chun', 'Chen, Zhengming', 'Wang, Sa A', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Oak, Jean', 'Arber, Daniel A', 'Hsi, Eric', 'Rogers, Heesun J', 'Levinson, Katherine', 'Bagg, Adam', 'Hassane, Duane C', 'Hasserjian, Robert P', 'Orazi, Attilio']","['Geyer JT', 'Tam W', 'Liu YC', 'Chen Z', 'Wang SA', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Oak J', 'Arber DA', 'Hsi E', 'Rogers HJ', 'Levinson K', 'Bagg A', 'Hassane DC', 'Hasserjian RP', 'Orazi A']",,"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Department of Healthcare Policy &Research, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20170526,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '147153-65-9 (SRSF2 protein, human)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Dioxygenases', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/classification/*genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*pathology', '*Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors/genetics', 'United States']",,2017/05/27 06:00,2018/05/22 06:00,['2017/05/27 06:00'],"['2016/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/10 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['modpathol201745 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2017.45 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2017 Sep;30(9):1213-1222. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2017.45.

The data on EBV-negative aggressive NK-cell leukemia/lymphoma are limited. Here we report a series of three patients (two Caucasians, one African-American) with EBV-negative aggressive NK-cell leukemia/lymphoma from a single institution, including a case diagnosed on post-mortem examination. Similar to EBV-positive aggressive NK-cell leukemia/lymphoma, our patients presented with constitutional symptoms and hepatosplenomegaly, and followed a highly aggressive clinical course. The disease involved peripheral blood, bone marrow, liver, spleen, and lymph node, and the neoplastic cells were pleomorphic with prominent azurophilic granules and demonstrated an atypical NK-cell phenotype. Lack of blood lymphocytosis (3 of 3), bone marrow interstitial infiltration (2 of 3), EBER negativity (3 of 3), and atypical phenotype including CD3 negativity by immunohistochemistry make an early recognition of the disease difficult. Ancillary studies revealed a complex karyotype (1 of 2), overexpression (3 of 3), and amplification (1 of 1) of c-MYC. The polycomb repressive complex 2 pathway-associated proteins EZH2 and H3K27me3 and immune checkpoint protein PD-L1 were overexpressed in three of three and two of three cases, respectively. Our findings indicate that the EBV-negative aggressive NK-cell leukemia/lymphoma shares similar clinicopathological features to the EBV-positive counterpart except for the high prevalence of Asian seen in EBV-positive cases. Overexpression of polycomb repressive complex 2 pathway-associated proteins and PD-L1 suggest potential therapeutic targets for this aggressive disease. Next-generation sequencing on two of three cases identified multiple genetic alterations but were negative for JAK-STAT pathway-associated gene mutations previously reported in EBV-positive NK/T-cell lymphoma, suggesting alternative molecular pathogenic mechanisms for EBV-negative aggressive NK-cell leukemia/lymphoma.","['Gao, Juehua', 'Behdad, Amir', 'Ji, Peng', 'Wolniak, Kristy L', 'Frankfurt, Olga', 'Chen, Yi-Hua']","['Gao J', 'Behdad A', 'Ji P', 'Wolniak KL', 'Frankfurt O', 'Chen YH']",,"['Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20170526,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2017/05/27 06:00,2018/05/04 06:00,['2017/05/27 06:00'],"['2017/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/13 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['modpathol201737 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2017.37 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2017 Aug;30(8):1100-1115. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2017.37.

The majority of germline mutations are frameshift mutations suggesting loss of function with DDX41 acting as a tumor suppressor, and there is a common somatic missense mutation found in a majority of germline mutated tumors. Clinically, DDX41 mutations lead to development of high-risk MDS at an age similar to that observed in sporadic cohorts, presenting a unique challenge to hematologists in recognizing the familial context. Functionally, DDX41 has been shown to contribute to multiple pathways and processes including mRNA splicing, innate immunity and rRNA processing. Mutations in DDX41 result in aberrations to each of these in ways that could potentially impact on tumorigenesis-initiation, maintenance or progression. This review discusses the various molecular, clinical and biological aspects of myeloid malignancy predisposition due to DDX41 mutation and highlights how each of these suggest potential therapeutic opportunities through the use of pathway-specific inhibitors.","['Cheah, Jesse J C', 'Hahn, Christopher N', 'Hiwase, Devendra K', 'Scott, Hamish S', 'Brown, Anna L']","['Cheah JJC', 'Hahn CN', 'Hiwase DK', 'Scott HS', 'Brown AL']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5813-631X'],"['Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, PO Box 14, Rundle Mall, Adelaide, 5000, SA, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology and University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Division of Health Sciences, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, PO Box 14, Rundle Mall, Adelaide, 5000, SA, Australia. chris.hahn@sa.gov.au.', 'Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology and University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia. chris.hahn@sa.gov.au.', 'Division of Health Sciences, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia. chris.hahn@sa.gov.au.', 'School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia. chris.hahn@sa.gov.au.', 'School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, PO Box 14, Rundle Mall, Adelaide, 5000, SA, Australia. hamish.scott@sa.gov.au.', 'Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology and University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia. hamish.scott@sa.gov.au.', 'Division of Health Sciences, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia. hamish.scott@sa.gov.au.', 'School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia. hamish.scott@sa.gov.au.', 'ACRF Cancer Genomics Facility, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, SA, Australia. hamish.scott@sa.gov.au.', 'School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia. hamish.scott@sa.gov.au.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, PO Box 14, Rundle Mall, Adelaide, 5000, SA, Australia. anna.brown@sa.gov.au.', 'Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology and University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia. anna.brown@sa.gov.au.', 'Division of Health Sciences, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia. anna.brown@sa.gov.au.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170525,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (DDX41 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/chemistry/*genetics/physiology', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', '*Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Germ-Line Mutation/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",,2017/05/27 06:00,2017/10/06 06:00,['2017/05/27 06:00'],"['2017/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-017-2260-y [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-017-2260-y [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2017 Aug;106(2):163-174. doi: 10.1007/s12185-017-2260-y.

The association of systemic sclerosis (SSc) and haematological cancers was reported in a large number of case reports and cohort studies, describing SSc patients with highly heterogeneous clinical pictures. Objective. We reviewed the literature to better describe SSc patients with haematological malignancies. Methods. SSc cases complicated by haematological malignancies described in the world literature were collected; other 2 cases referred to our centre were reported. Results. One hundred-thirty SSc subjects were collected from 1954 up to date. The mean age of patients at cancer diagnosis was 56.1 +/- 16.7 years; 72% of patients were females. In 60% of cases, the diagnosis of haematological malignancy was described within 5 years of SSc diagnosis. In 7.8% of cases, coexistence of Sjogren's syndrome or other autoimmune disorders was cited. Sixty-six cases with lymphoma (in the majority of cases B-cell neoplasms), 28 with leukaemia (chronic lymphocytic form in 9), 14 with multiple myeloma plus one solitary IgM plasmocytoma, and 16 with myeloproliferative disorders were found. No specific SSc subsets seem to be related to haematological malignancies. Conclusions. We remarked the importance of clinical work-up in SSc, in order to early diagnose and treat eventual occult haematological malignancies, especially during the first years of the disease.","['Colaci, M', 'Giuggioli, D', 'Vacchi, C', 'Ferri, C']","['Colaci M', 'Giuggioli D', 'Vacchi C', 'Ferri C']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3606-3404'],"['Rheumatology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Policlinico di Modena, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Rheumatology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Policlinico di Modena, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Rheumatology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Policlinico di Modena, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Rheumatology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Policlinico di Modena, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20170504,United States,Case Rep Rheumatol,Case reports in rheumatology,101585353,,,,PMC5435905,2017/05/27 06:00,2017/05/27 06:01,['2017/05/27 06:00'],"['2017/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/02 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2017/6230138 [doi]'],ppublish,Case Rep Rheumatol. 2017;2017:6230138. doi: 10.1155/2017/6230138.

Some treatments will work better for some, while being harmful or ineffective for others. This is due to genetic variation in the form of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that affect gene expression or function and cause inherited interindividual differences in the metabolism and disposition of drugs. Drug transporters are one of the determinants governing the pharmacokinetic profile of chemotherapeutic drugs. The ABCB1 transporter gene transports a wide range of drugs, including drugs used in leukemia treatment. Polymorphisms in the ABCB1 gene do affect intrinsic resistance and pharmacokinetics of several drugs used in leukemia treatment protocols and thereby affect the efficacy of treatment and event-free survival. This review focuses on the impact of three commonly occurring SNPs (1236C>T, 2677G>T/A, and 3435C>T) of ABCB1 on treatment response of various types of leukemia. From the literature available, some of the genotypes and haplotypes of these SNPs have been found to be potential determinants of interindividual variability in drug disposition and pharmacologic response in different types of leukemia. However, due to inconsistencies in the results observed across the studies, additional studies, considering novel genomic methodologies, comprehensive definition of clinical phenotypes, adequate sample size, and uniformity in all the confounding factors, are warranted.","['Ankathil, Ravindran']",['Ankathil R'],,"['Human Genome Centre, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, Malaysia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170512,New Zealand,Pharmgenomics Pers Med,Pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine,101514107,,,,PMC5438075,2017/05/27 06:00,2017/05/27 06:01,['2017/05/27 06:00'],"['2017/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/PGPM.S105208 [doi]', 'pgpm-10-169 [pii]']",epublish,Pharmgenomics Pers Med. 2017 May 12;10:169-181. doi: 10.2147/PGPM.S105208. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['ABCB1 polymorphisms', 'chemotherapy response', 'leukemia', 'survival']",['Disclosure The author reports no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There has been a strong focus on glucose transport in leukemias but the present data show that primary T-ALL cells have increased transport of multiple nutrients. Specifically, increased leucine transport in T-ALL fuels mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity which then sustains expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF1alpha) and c-Myc; drivers of glucose metabolism in T cells. A key finding is that PTEN deletion and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) accumulation is insufficient to initiate leucine uptake, mTORC1 activity, HIF1alpha or c-Myc expression in T cells and hence cannot drive T-ALL metabolic reprogramming. Instead, a key regulator for leucine transport in T-ALL is identified as NOTCH. Mass spectrometry based proteomics identifies SLC7A5 as the predominant amino acid transporter in primary PTEN(-/-) T-ALL cells. Importantly, expression of SLC7A5 is critical for the malignant transformation induced by PTEN deletion. These data reveal the importance of regulated amino acid transport for T-cell malignancies, highlighting how a single amino acid transporter can have a key role.","['Grzes, K M', 'Swamy, M', 'Hukelmann, J L', 'Emslie, E', 'Sinclair, L V', 'Cantrell, D A']","['Grzes KM', 'Swamy M', 'Hukelmann JL', 'Emslie E', 'Sinclair LV', 'Cantrell DA']",,"['Division of Cell Signalling and Immunology, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK.', 'Division of Cell Signalling and Immunology, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK.', 'Centre for Gene Regulation and Expression, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK.', 'Division of Cell Signalling and Immunology, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK.', 'Division of Cell Signalling and Immunology, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK.', 'Division of Cell Signalling and Immunology, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK.']",['eng'],"['205023/Z/16/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '097418/Z/11/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170526,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Amino Acid Transport Systems)', '0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Transport Systems/metabolism', 'Amino Acids/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1/metabolism', '*Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism']",PMC5729345,2017/05/27 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2017/05/27 06:00'],"['2016/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/23 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017160 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.160 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Dec;31(12):2771-2779. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.160.

Choice of a stem cell donor is dependent on donor availability, donor compatibility and health, recipient disease type, and recipient condition. Current sources of stem cell donation for HSCT are matched sibling donors (MSDs), matched unrelated donors (MUDs), 1-antigen mismatched unrelated donors (MMUDs), haploidentical donors (haplo), and umbilical cord blood (UCB) units. Historically, preferred donors for HSCT have been human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donors; however, only about 30% of U.S. patients will have a MSD available. The majority of patients referred for HSCT will require an alternative donor graft: MUD, MMUD, UCB, or haplo. The likelihood of finding a MUD varies depending on the ethnicity of the recipient. White Caucasians of European descent have the greatest chance of finding a MUD. Chances of finding a MUD are significantly less for African-American or Hispanic recipients due to HLA polymorphisms. Therefore, MMUD, UCB, and haplo donor graft sources expand the donor pool for recipients who do not have a MSD or MUD available. Given the variety of different donor stem cell sources available today, nearly every patient who needs an allogeneic HSCT has a potential donor in 2017. All transplant-eligible patients with hematologic malignancies should be evaluated by a transplant center to determine if HSCT is a viable treatment option for their underlying disease process. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The goal of this review is to increase the awareness of oncology practitioners to the availability of alternative donor stem cell transplants for patients with hematologic malignancies.

In this study, we examined the possible role of MKL/SRF in the context of regulation of profilin (Pfn), a major controller of actin dynamics and actin cytoskeletal remodeling in cells. We demonstrated that despite being located on different genomic loci, two major isoforms of Pfn (Pfn1 and Pfn2) are co-regulated by a common mechanism involving the action of MKL that is independent of its SRF-related activity. We found that MKL co-regulates the expression of Pfn isoforms indirectly by modulating signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and utilizing its SAP-domain function. Unexpectedly, our studies revealed that cellular externalization, rather than transcription of Pfn1, is affected by the perturbations of MKL. We further demonstrated that MKL can influence cell migration by modulating Pfn1 expression, indicating a functional connection between MKL and Pfn1 in actin-dependent cellular processes. Finally, we provide initial evidence supporting the ability of Pfn to influence MKL and SRF expression. Collectively, these findings suggest that Pfn may play a role in a possible feedback loop of the actin/MKL/SRF signaling circuit.","['Joy, Marion', 'Gau, David', 'Castellucci, Nevin', 'Prywes, Ron', 'Roy, Partha']","['Joy M', 'Gau D', 'Castellucci N', 'Prywes R', 'Roy P']",,"['Departments of Bioengineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219.', 'Departments of Bioengineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219.', 'Departments of Bioengineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027.', 'Departments of Bioengineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219; Cell Biology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219; Pathology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219.

The primary aim of this exploratory investigation was to determine if there were changes in brain function of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia before chemotherapy. METHODS: In this study, we advanced a measure named regional homogeneity to evaluate the resting-state brain activities, intelligence quotient test was performed at same time. Using regional homogeneity, we first investigated the resting state brain function in patients with new onset childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia before chemotherapy, healthy children as control. RESULTS: The decreased ReHo values were mainly founded in the default mode network and left frontal lobe, bilateral inferior parietal lobule, bilateral temporal lobe, bilateral occipital lobe, precentral gyrus, bilateral cerebellum in the newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients compared with the healthy control. While in contrast, increased ReHo values were mainly shown in the right frontal lobe (language area), superior frontal gyrus-R, middle frontal gyrus-R and inferior parietal lobule-R for acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients group. There were no significant differences for intelligence quotient measurements between the acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient group and the healthy control in performance intelligence quotient, verbal intelligence quotient, total intelligence quotient. CONCLUSION: The altered brain functions are associated with cognitive change and language, it is suggested that there may be cognition impairment before the chemotherapy. Regional homogeneity by functional magnetic resonance image is a sensitive way for early detection on brain damage in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Hu, Zhanqi', 'Zou, Dongfang', 'Mai, Huirong', 'Yuan, Xiuli', 'Wang, Lihong', 'Li, Yue', 'Liao, Jianxiang', 'Liu, Liwei', 'Liu, Guosheng', 'Zeng, Hongwu', 'Wen, Feiqiu']","['Hu Z', 'Zou D', 'Mai H', 'Yuan X', 'Wang L', 'Li Y', 'Liao J', 'Liu L', 'Liu G', 'Zeng H', 'Wen F']",,"[""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou 510630, Guangdong, China; Department of Neurology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen 518038, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Neurology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen 518038, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen 518038, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen 518038, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen 518038, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen 518038, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Neurology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen 518038, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen 518038, Guangdong, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou 510630, Guangdong, China.', ""Department of Radiology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen 518038, Guangdong, China.

Construction work near hospital wards caring for immunocompromised patients is one of the main risk factors for developing invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). AIM: To assess the impact of environmental control measures used during hospital construction for the prevention of IA in acute leukaemia patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was developed to evaluate the IA incidence in acute leukaemia patients with different environmental control measures employed during hospital construction. We used European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criterial diagnosis parameters for definition of IA. FINDINGS: A total of 175 episodes of inpatient care were evaluated, 62 of which did not have any environmental control measures (when an outbreak occurred), and 113 that were subject to environmental control measures directed to preventing IA. The study showed an IA incidence of 25.8% for the group without environmental control measures vs 12.4% for those who did receive environmental control measures (P=0.024). The relative risk for IA was 0.595 (95% confidence interval: 0.394-0.897) for the group with environmental control measures. CONCLUSION: The current study suggests that the implementation of environmental control measures during a hospital construction has a positive impact for prevention of IA in patients hospitalized with acute leukaemia.","['Combariza, J F', 'Toro, L F', 'Orozco, J J']","['Combariza JF', 'Toro LF', 'Orozco JJ']",,"['Hospital Pablo Tobon Uribe, Medellin, Antioquia, Colombia.

These subgroups have distinct clinicopathological and molecular features, and underpin current disease subclassification and initial subgroup-directed therapies that are underway in clinical trials. However, substantial biological heterogeneity and differences in survival are apparent within each subgroup, which remain to be resolved. We aimed to investigate whether additional molecular subgroups exist within childhood medulloblastoma and whether these could be used to improve disease subclassification and prognosis predictions. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we assessed 428 primary medulloblastoma samples collected from UK Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) treatment centres (UK), collaborating European institutions, and the UKCCSG-SIOP-PNET3 European clinical trial. An independent validation cohort (n=276) of archival tumour samples was also analysed. We analysed samples from patients with childhood medulloblastoma who were aged 0-16 years at diagnosis, and had central review of pathology and comprehensive clinical data. We did comprehensive molecular profiling, including DNA methylation microarray analysis, and did unsupervised class discovery of test and validation cohorts to identify consensus primary molecular subgroups and characterise their clinical and biological significance. We modelled survival of patients aged 3-16 years in patients (n=215) who had craniospinal irradiation and had been treated with a curative intent. FINDINGS: Seven robust and reproducible primary molecular subgroups of childhood medulloblastoma were identified. MBWNT remained unchanged and each remaining consensus subgroup was split in two. MBSHH was split into age-dependent subgroups corresponding to infant (<4.3 years; MBSHH-Infant; n=65) and childhood patients (>/=4.3 years; MBSHH-Child; n=38). MBGrp3 and MBGrp4 were each split into high-risk (MBGrp3-HR [n=65] and MBGrp4-HR [n=85]) and low-risk (MBGrp3-LR [n=50] and MBGrp4-LR [n=73]) subgroups. These biological subgroups were validated in the independent cohort. We identified features of the seven subgroups that were predictive of outcome. Cross-validated subgroup-dependent survival models, incorporating these novel subgroups along with secondary clinicopathological and molecular features and established disease risk-factors, outperformed existing disease risk-stratification schemes. These subgroup-dependent models stratified patients into four clinical risk groups for 5-year progression-free survival: favourable risk (54 [25%] of 215 patients; 91% survival [95% CI 82-100]); standard risk (50 [23%] patients; 81% survival [70-94]); high-risk (82 [38%] patients; 42% survival [31-56]); and very high-risk (29 [13%] patients; 28% survival [14-56]).

MMB monosuccinate was also reacted with terminal diaminoalkanes to afford dimeric succinamido analogs of MMB (4a-4h). These succinamide analogs of MMB were evaluated for their anti-cancer activity against a panel of sixty human cancer cell lines. Analogs 3d-3i and dimers 4f-4g exhibited promising anti-cancer activity with GI50 values ranging from 0.28 to 33.5microM against most of the cell lines in the panel. The dimeric analogs 4f and 4g were identified as lead compounds with GI50 values in the nanomolar range (GI50=280-980nM) against several cell lines in the panel; i.e. leukemia cell lines CCRF-CEM, HL-60(TB), K-562, MOLT-4, RPMI-8226 and SR; and solid tumor cell lines NCI-H522 (non-small cell lung cancer), SW-620 and HCT-116 (colon cancer), LOX IMVI (melanoma), RXF 393 (renal cancer), and MCF7, BT-549 and MDA-MB-468 (breast cancer). Succinamide analogs 3a, 3c-3l and 4b-4h were also evaluated for their apoptotic activity against M9-ENL1 acute myelogenous leukemia cells; compounds 3h-3j and 4g were equipotent with parthenolide, exhibiting LC50 values in the range 4.1-8.1muM. Molecular docking studies indicate that these molecules interact covalently with the highly conserved Cys-46 residue of the N-terminal lobe (1-109) of human IKKbeta to inhibit the NFkappaB transcription factor complex, resulting in down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes under NFkappaB control.","['Janganati, Venumadhav', 'Ponder, Jessica', 'Thakkar, Shraddha', 'Jordan, Craig T', 'Crooks, Peter A']","['Janganati V', 'Ponder J', 'Thakkar S', 'Jordan CT', 'Crooks PA']",,"['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA.', 'Department of Toxicology, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'National Center for Toxicological Research, Jefferson, AR 72079, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA.

Appearance of aggregates of particles of nuclear origin within the nuclei and cytoplasm of the induced cells was the first and the most prominent morphological sign of apoptosis. These aggregates were not coated by a membrane, had variable shape, density and size. Two types of particles dominated in the aggregates: perichromatin fibers (PFs) and proteasomes (PRs). PFs represent a morphological expression of transcriptional and co-transcriptional processing of pre-mRNA (Biggiogera et al., 2008), PRs are involved in hydrolysis of proteins and nucleoproteins, and participate in regulation of apoptosis (Ciechanover, 1998; Liu et al., 2007). We examined the ultrastructure and localization of PFs and PRs, and confirmed the proteasome nature of the latter by immunoelectron microscopy. We traced the formation and migration of the aggregates along the nucleus and their exit into the cytoplasm across the nuclear pores. Finally, we demonstrated degradation of the aggregates and relocating their content into exosomes at the terminal stages of apoptosis with aid of exosomes. We suggest that proteasomes function as morphologically definite and independent intracellular organelles. Alongside with proteasomes, autophagic vacuoles were revealed in apoptotic cells. Occurrence of autophagic vacuoles in apoptotic cells may suggest that both proteolytic pathways, autophagy and proteasome degradation, are coordinated with each other along the programmed cell death pathway.","['Snigirevskaya, Ekaterina S', 'Komissarchik, Yan Yu']","['Snigirevskaya ES', 'Komissarchik YY']",,"['Group of Cell Membrane Ultrastructure, Institute of Cytology, Russian Academy of Sciences, 4 Tikhoretsky Ave., 194064 St. Petersburg, Russia.

Persistence of tumor-initiating cells (TICs, or cancer stem cells) after cytotoxic drug treatment is responsible for tumor relapse, and represents one of the main reasons for the poor prognosis of mesothelioma. In fact, identification of the molecules affecting TIC viability is still a significant challenge. METHODS: TIC-enriched cultures were obtained from 10 human malignant pleural mesotheliomas and cultured in vitro. Three fully characterized tumorigenic cultures, named MM1, MM3, and MM4, were selected and used to assess antiproliferative effects of the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib. Cell viability was investigated by MTT assay, and cell cycle analysis as well as induction of apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry. Western blotting was performed to reveal the modulation of protein expression and the phosphorylation status of pathways associated with sorafenib treatment. RESULTS: We analyzed the molecular mechanisms of the antiproliferative effects of sorafenib in mesothelioma TIC cultures. Sorafenib inhibited cell cycle progression in all cultures, but only in MM3 and MM4 cells was this effect associated with Mcl-1-dependent apoptosis. To investigate the mechanisms of sorafenib-mediated antiproliferative activity, TICs were treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) causing, in MM3 and MM4 cells, MEK, ERK1/2, Akt, and STAT3 phosphorylation. These effects were abolished by sorafenib only in bFGF-treated cells, while a modest inhibition occurred after EGF stimulation, suggesting that sorafenib effects are mainly due to FGF receptor (FGFR) inhibition. Indeed, FGFR1 phosphorylation was inhibited by sorafenib. Moreover, in MM1 cells, which release high levels of bFGF and showed autocrine activation of FGFR1 and constitutive phosphorylation/activation of MEK-ERK1/2, sorafenib induced a more effective antiproliferative response, confirming that the main target of the drug is the inhibition of FGFR1 activity. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, in malignant pleural mesothelioma TICs, bFGF signaling is the main target of the antiproliferative response of sorafenib, acting directly on the FGFR1 activation. Patients with constitutive FGFR1 activation via an autocrine loop may be more sensitive to sorafenib treatment and the analysis of this possibility warrants further clinical investigation.","['Pattarozzi, Alessandra', 'Carra, Elisa', 'Favoni, Roberto E', 'Wurth, Roberto', 'Marubbi, Daniela', 'Filiberti, Rosa Angela', 'Mutti, Luciano', 'Florio, Tullio', 'Barbieri, Federica', 'Daga, Antonio']","['Pattarozzi A', 'Carra E', 'Favoni RE', 'Wurth R', 'Marubbi D', 'Filiberti RA', 'Mutti L', 'Florio T', 'Barbieri F', 'Daga A']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2394-996X'],"['Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI) and Centre of Excellence for Biomedical Research (CEBR), University of Genova, Viale Benedetto XV, 2, 16132, Genova, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine (DIMES), University of Genova, Via L.B.

Here we compare Cox and parametric regression models regarding survival of children with acute leukemia in southern Iran. Methods: In a retrospective cohort study, information for 197 children with acute leukemia over 6 years was collected through observation and interviews. In order to identify factors affecting their survival, the Cox and parametric (exponential, Weibull, log-logistic, log-normal, Gompertz and generalized gamma) models were fitted to the data. To find the best predictor model, the Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and the Coxsnell residual were employed. Results: Out of 197 children, 164 (83.3%) had ALL and 33 (16.7%) AML; the mean (+/- standard deviation) survival time was 52.1+/-8.10 months. According to both the AIC and the Coxsnell residual, the Cox regression model was the weakest and the log-normal and Weibull models were the best for fitting to data. Based on the log-normal model, age (HR=1.01, p=0.004), residence area (HR=1.60, p=0.038) and WBC (White Blood Cell) (HR=1.57, p=0.014) had significant effects on patient survival. Conclusion: Parametric regression models demonstrate better performance as compared to the Cox model for identifying risk factors for prognosis with acute leukemia data. Just because the assumption of PH (Proportional Hazards) is held for the Cox regression model, we should not ignore parameter models.","['Hosseini Teshnizi, Saeed', 'Taghi Ayatollahi, Seyyed Mohammad']","['Hosseini Teshnizi S', 'Taghi Ayatollahi SM']",,"['Clinical Research Development Center of Children Hospital, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, Bandar Abbas, Iran.

Here, we report on a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a discovery cohort or 2,101 cases and 4,202 controls of European ancestry. We identify two new association signals at 3q25 and 4p16 that replicated robustly in multiple independent cohorts comprising 1,163 cases and 4,396 controls (3q25: rs6441201 combined P = 1.2x10-11, Odds Ratio 1.23, 95% CI:1.16-1.31; 4p16: rs3796727 combined P = 1.26x10-12, Odds Ratio 1.30, 95% CI: 1.21-1.40). The 4p16 signal maps within the carboxypeptidase Z (CPZ) gene. The 3q25 signal resides within the arginine/serine-rich coiled-coil 1 (RSRC1) gene and upstream of the myeloid leukemia factor 1 (MLF1) gene. Increased expression of MLF1 was observed in neuroblastoma cells homozygous for the rs6441201 risk allele (P = 0.02), and significant growth inhibition was observed upon depletion of MLF1 (P < 0.0001) in neuroblastoma cells. Taken together, we show that common DNA variants within CPZ at 4p16 and upstream of MLF1 at 3q25 influence neuroblastoma susceptibility and MLF1 likely plays an important role in neuroblastoma

Mutations in SF3B1 are associated with 80% cases of refractory anemia with ring sideroblast (RARS), a subtype of MDS. SF3B1K700E is the most frequently mutated site among mutations on SF3B1. Yet the molecular mechanisms on how mutations of splicing factors lead to defective erythropoiesis are not clear. SF3B1K700E mutant binds to an RNA binding protein, RBM15, stronger than the wild type SF3B1 protein in co-immunoprecipitation assays. In addition, K700E mutant alters the RNA splicing of transcription factors TAL1 and GATA1. Via alternative RNA splicing, a novel short TAL1 transcript variant (TAL1s) is generated. Enhanced interaction between SF3B1 and RBM15 promotes the production of full-length TAL1 (TAL1fl) mRNA, while reduction of RBM15 protein level via PRMT1-mediated degradation pathway changes TAL1s/TAL1fl ratio in favor of TAL1s. TAL1s contains the helix-loop-helix DNA binding domain but not the N terminal region upstream of the DNA binding domain. The TAL1s protein loses its interaction with ETO2, which represses early erythropoiesis. In this vein, overexpression of TAL1s stimulates the transcription of beta-hemoglobin in human leukemia K562 cells and promotes erythroid differentiation of human cord blood CD34+ cells cultured in erythropoietin-containing medium. Therefore, mutations of SF3B1 may block erythropoiesis via dysregulation of alternative RNA splicing of transcription factor TAL1, and targeting PRMT1 may alleviate the anemic symptoms in MDS patients.","['Jin, Shuiling', 'Su, Hairui', 'Tran, Ngoc-Tung', 'Song, Jing', 'Lu, Sydney S', 'Li, Ying', 'Huang, Suming', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Liu, Yanyan', 'Zhao, Xinyang']","['Jin S', 'Su H', 'Tran NT', 'Song J', 'Lu SS', 'Li Y', 'Huang S', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Liu Y', 'Zhao X']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Henan Cancer Hospital & Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Human Oncology & Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Macau Institute for Applied Research in Medicine and Health, State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Avenida Wai Long, Taipa, Macau.

However, the mechanisms underlying the activation of expression of PL2L60 remain unknown. In this study, an intragenic promoter responsible for the activation of PL2L60 within the human PIWIL2 gene has been identified, cloned and characterized. The promoter of PL2L60 is located in the intron 10 of the host gene PIWIL2. Bioinformatic and mutagenic analysis reveals that this intragenic promoter within the sequence of 50 nucleotides contains two closely arranged cis-acting elements specific for the hepatic leukemia factor (HLF) in the positive strand and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in the negative strand. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrates that both the HLF and polymerase II (Pol II), a hallmark of active promoters, directly bind to the sequence, although STAT3 does not. Knockdown of HLF and STAT3 alone or both by RNA interference significantly reduced both promoter activity and the PL2L60 protein expression, although there is no additive effect. The expression of PL2L60 proteins was enhanced when host gene Piwil2 was genetically disrupted in a murine cell model. Taken together, we have identified a PL2L60-specific intragenic promoter in the host gene of PIWIL2, which is interdependently activated by HLF and STAT3 through steric interaction. This activation is dependent on cellular milieu rather than the integrity of host gene PIWIL2, highlighting a novel, important mechanism for a cancer-causing gene to be activated during tumorigenesis.","['Liu, Shan-Shan', 'Liu, Ning', 'Liu, Meng-Yao', 'Sun, Lei', 'Xia, Wu-Yan', 'Lu, Hong-Min', 'Fu, Yu-Jie', 'Yang, Guo-Liang', 'Bo, Juan-Jie', 'Liu, Xiao-Xing', 'Feng, Haizhong', 'Wu, Hailong', 'Li, Lin-Feng', 'Gao, Jian-Xin']","['Liu SS', 'Liu N', 'Liu MY', 'Sun L', 'Xia WY', 'Lu HM', 'Fu YJ', 'Yang GL', 'Bo JJ', 'Liu XX', 'Feng H', 'Wu H', 'Li LF', 'Gao JX']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Renji-Med X Clinical Stem Cell Research Center, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Renji-Med X Clinical Stem Cell Research Center, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Renji-Med X Clinical Stem Cell Research Center, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Renji-Med X Clinical Stem Cell Research Center, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Renji-Med X Clinical Stem Cell Research Center, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Renji-Med X Clinical Stem Cell Research Center, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Renji-Med X Clinical Stem Cell Research Center, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Urology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Urology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Radiotherapy, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Renji-Med X Clinical Stem Cell Research Center, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Renji-Med X Clinical Stem Cell Research Center, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Renji-Med X Clinical Stem Cell Research Center, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Renji-Med X Clinical Stem Cell Research Center, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Argonaute Proteins)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (HLF protein, human)', '0 (PIWIL2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Allosteric Regulation', 'Animals', 'Argonaute Proteins/*genetics', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC5542253,2017/05/26 06:00,2018/04/17 06:00,['2017/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['17553 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.17553 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jul 11;8(28):46104-46120. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.17553.,['NOTNLM'],"['PIWIL2', 'PL2L60', 'STAT3', 'alienated gene activation', 'intragenic promoter']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although IM-resistance can be due to BCR-ABL kinase domain (KD) mutations, many IM-resistant patients do not have detectable BCR-ABL KD mutations. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that control gene expression. To investigate the role of miRNAs in IM-resistance, we recruited 8 chronic phase CML patients with IM-resistance who tested negative for BCR-ABL KD mutations and 2 healthy normal controls. Using miRNA sequencing, we identified 54 differentially expressed miRNAs; 43 of them downregulated. The 3 most differentially downregulated miRNAs were miR-146a-5p, miR-99b-5p and miR-151a-5p. Using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, the expression patterns of the 3 miRNAs were validated on the same cohort of 8 patients in addition to 3 other IM-resistant CML patients. In-silico analysis showed that the predicted gene targets are ATRIP, ATR, WDR48, RAD51C and FANCA genes which are involved in the Fanconi Anemia/BRCA pathway. This pathway regulates DNA damage response (DDR) and influences disease response to chemotherapy. Thus it is conceivable that DDR constitutes a key component in IM-resistance. Further research is needed to elucidate miRNA modulation of the predicted gene targets.","['Yap, E', 'Norziha, Z A', 'Simbun, A', 'Tumian, N R', 'Cheong, S K', 'Leong, C F', 'Wong, C L']","['Yap E', 'Norziha ZA', 'Simbun A', 'Tumian NR', 'Cheong SK', 'Leong CF', 'Wong CL']",,"['Haematology Unit, Department of Medicine, National University of Malaysia Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Here, we introduce a no-wash assay based on single-platform cell enumeration and Streptamer staining to determine the Wilms' tumor antigen 1 (WT1)-specific T cell immunity in clinical samples. We analyzed the performance of the WT1-specific MHC Streptamers in direct comparison to CMV- and EBV-specific MHC Streptamer staining by spiking antigen-specific T cells in PBMCs. The accuracy of the assay was high for all performed experiments with a mean recovery of 94% and a linear regression of 0.988. Differences were apparent regarding the limit of detection/quantification (LOD/LOQ). While results obtained for WT1 yielded an LOD/LOQ of 0.08 +/- 0.04% and 0.11 +/- 0.06% (1.33 +/- 0.32 cells/microl and 1.9 +/- 0.14 cells/microl), the overall LOD/LOQ was notably lower and accounted to 0.02 +/- 0.02% and 0.05 +/- 0.03% (0.60 +/- 0.03 cells/microl and 1.27 +/- 0.58 cells/microl). Subsequent screening of 22 healthy individuals revealed significantly higher values for WT1 (0.04 +/- 0.02% and 1.5 +/- 0.9 cells/microl) than for the irrelevant HIV pol (0.016 +/- 0.01% and 0.5 +/- 0.4 cells/microl). In contrast, no increased frequencies were observed for WT1-specific T cells compared to HIV-specific T cells using a classical wash-protocol. These findings strongly suggest the use of no-wash single-platform assays in combination with MHC Streptamer staining for the detection of low affinity LAA-specific T cells due to its high accuracy and sensitivity.

However, little is known about the expression character of Bcl11a gene in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). In previous study, our results showed there was a clear dysregulation in the global gene expression of the Bcl11a-suppressed B lymphoma cells. The aim of the study is to further evaluate the role of Bcl11a and the expression level of its related genes Mdm2, Pten in B-ALL patients. METHODS: The relative mRNA expression levels of Bcl11a and Mdm2, Pten in blood mononuclear cells of B-ALL patients were determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcript-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) with SYBR Green Dye. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers served as control. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) was used as reference. RESULTS: There was higher Bcl11a mRNA expression in initial diagnosed B-ALL than the healthy control, but there is no statistical significance (P > 0.05). The expression level of Bcl11a and Mdm2 in initial diagnosed B-ALL patients was statistically higher compared to those with complete remission (CR; P < 0.05). The expression levels of Bcl11a and Mdm2, Pten in B-ALL patients with CR were decreased significantly when compared with the healthy control (P < 0.05). The correlation analyses revealed that the Bcl11a expression level was positively correlated with the Mdm2 and Pten relative expression level in B-ALL patients. There is also positive correlation between Mdm2 and Pten expression. CONCLUSIONS: Bcl11a transcript levels were significantly downregulated in B-ALL patients with CR. The decreased expression characteristics of Bcl11a and Mdm2, Pten might imply the CR of B-ALL patients.","['Xu, Ling', 'Wu, Hong', 'Wu, Xiuli', 'Li, Yangqiu', 'He, Dongmei']","['Xu L', 'Wu H', 'Wu X', 'Li Y', 'He D']",,"['Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, PR China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170524,Australia,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,101241430,"['0 (BCL11A protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Young Adult']",,2017/05/26 06:00,2018/05/23 06:00,['2017/05/26 06:00'],"['2016/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ajco.12690 [doi]'],ppublish,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2018 Apr;14(2):e124-e128. doi: 10.1111/ajco.12690.

The risk of progression to symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM) is probably important for the outcome of SP. PCL is rare and has a dismal outcome. In this study, we report on incidence and survival in PCL/SP, and progression to MM in SP, using the prospective observational Swedish Multiple Myeloma Register designed to document all newly diagnosed plasma cell diseases in Sweden since 2008. Both solitary bone plasmacytoma (SBP) (n=124) and extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) (n=67) have better overall survival (OS) than MM (n=3549). Progression to MM was higher in SBP than in EMP (35% and 7% at 2 years, respectively), but this did not translate into better survival in EMP. In spite of treatment developments, the OS of primary PCL is still dismal (median of 11 months, 0% at 5 years).

Portal hypertension (pHTN) occurs in 7-18% of MPN patients via both thrombotic and nonthrombotic mechanisms and portends a poor prognosis. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has been used in the management of MPN-associated pHTN; however, data on long-term outcomes of TIPS in this setting is limited and the optimal management of medically refractory MPN-associated pHTN is not known. In order to assess the efficacy and long-term outcomes of TIPS in MPN-associated pHTN, we performed a retrospective analysis of 29 MPN patients who underwent TIPS at three academic medical centers between 1997 and 2016. The majority of patients experienced complete clinical resolution of pHTN and its clinical sequelae following TIPS. One, two, three, and four-year overall survival post-TIPS was 96.4%, 92.3%, 84.6%, and 71.4%, respectively. However, despite therapeutic anticoagulation, in-stent thrombosis occurred in 31.0% of patients after TIPS, necessitating additional interventions. In conclusion, TIPS can be an effective intervention for MPN-associated pHTN regardless of etiology. However, TIPS thrombosis is a frequent complication in the MPN population and indefinite anticoagulation post-TIPS should be considered.","['Reilly, Christopher R', 'Babushok, Daria V', 'Martin, Karlyn', 'Spivak, Jerry L', 'Streiff, Michael', 'Bahirwani, Ranjeeta', 'Mondschein, Jeffrey', 'Stein, Brady', 'Moliterno, Alison', 'Hexner, Elizabeth O']","['Reilly CR', 'Babushok DV', 'Martin K', 'Spivak JL', 'Streiff M', 'Bahirwani R', 'Mondschein J', 'Stein B', 'Moliterno A', 'Hexner EO']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4513-5318'],"['Department of Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Abramson Cancer Center and the Division of Hematology & Oncology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Liver Consultants of Texas, Baylor University Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.', 'Department of Interventional Radiology, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Abramson Cancer Center and the Division of Hematology & Oncology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],['K08 HL132101/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20170726,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', '*Hypertension, Portal/etiology/mortality/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Myeloproliferative Disorders/mortality/surgery', '*Portasystemic Shunt, Transjugular Intrahepatic', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",PMC5547000,2017/05/26 06:00,2017/08/10 06:00,['2017/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24798 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 Sep;92(9):909-914. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24798.

Therefore, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is considered only for patients with disease progression or for patients after treatment failure with multiple TKIs. To reflect the current clinical situation of patients with CML-CP, we tried to clarify whether prior TKI treatment affects the outcome of allo-HSCT. Data from 237 patients for whom the number of pretransplant TKIs varied from one to three were used for analysis. Before allo-HSCT, 153 patients were treated with one TKI, 49 patients were treated with two TKIs and 35 patients were treated with three TKIs. In addition to conventional risk factors, i.e., disease status at transplantation and patient's age, the use of three TKIs before transplantation was identified as a significant adverse factor for prognosis. Nonrelapse mortality rate was higher in patients treated with three TKIs than in patients treated with one or two TKIs. Our results suggest that allo-HSCT could be considered for young patients with CML-CP who manifest resistance to second-line TKI therapy and who have an appropriate donor.","['Kondo, Takeshi', 'Nagamura-Inoue, Tokiko', 'Tojo, Arinobu', 'Nagamura, Fumitaka', 'Uchida, Naoyuki', 'Nakamae, Hirohisa', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Mori, Takehiko', 'Yano, Shingo', 'Kurokawa, Mineo', 'Ueno, Hironori', 'Kanamori, Heiwa', 'Hashimoto, Hisako', 'Onizuka, Makoto', 'Takanashi, Minoko', 'Ichinohe, Tatsuo', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Ohashi, Kazuteru']","['Kondo T', 'Nagamura-Inoue T', 'Tojo A', 'Nagamura F', 'Uchida N', 'Nakamae H', 'Fukuda T', 'Mori T', 'Yano S', 'Kurokawa M', 'Ueno H', 'Kanamori H', 'Hashimoto H', 'Onizuka M', 'Takanashi M', 'Ichinohe T', 'Atsuta Y', 'Ohashi K']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7455-5824', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8176-4760', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4034-2422']","['Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Faculty of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Cell Processing/Transfusion, The Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Center for Translational Research, The Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Federation of National Public Service Personnel Mutual Aid Associations Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Osaka City University Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Jikei University School of Medicine, Hematopoietic Cell Therapy Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Cell Therapy and Transplantation Medicine, The University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Tokyo Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Division of Stem Cell Transplantation, Kobe General Hospital/Institute of Biomedical Research and Innovation, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Blood Service Headquarters, Japanese Red Cross Society, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine (RIRBM), Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Healthcare Administration, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Tokyo Metropolitan Komagome Hospital, Hematology Division, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20170609,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Survival Rate']",,2017/05/26 06:00,2017/08/10 06:00,['2017/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/11 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24793 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 Sep;92(9):902-908. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24793.

However, the coupling mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Using Tnfrsf11b-deficient (OPG(-/-) ) mice, in which bone formation is clearly coupled to bone resorption, we found here that osteoclasts suppress the expression of sclerostin, a Wnt antagonist, thereby promoting bone formation. Wnt/beta-catenin signals were higher in OPG(-/-) and RANKL-transgenic mice with a low level of sclerostin. Conditioned medium from osteoclast cultures (Ocl-CM) suppressed sclerostin expression in UMR106 cells and osteocyte cultures. In vitro experiments revealed that osteoclasts secreted leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and inhibited sclerostin expression. Anti-RANKL antibodies, antiresorptive agents, suppressed LIF expression and increased sclerostin expression, thereby reducing bone formation in OPG(-/-) mice. Taken together, osteoclast-derived LIF regulates bone turnover through sclerostin expression. Thus, LIF represents a target for improving the prolonged suppression of bone turnover by antiresorptive agents. (c) 2017 The Authors.

Exploiting this approach to develop a therapeutic modality for T cell malignancies for which the available regimens are neither curative, nor confer long term survival we generated a lentivirus-based CAR gene transfer system to target the chemokine receptor CCR4 that is over-expressed in a spectrum of T cell malignancies as well as in CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) T regulatory cells that accumulate in the tumor microenvironment constituting a barrier against anti-tumor immunity. Ex vivo modified, donor-derived T cells that expressed CCR4 directed CAR displayed antigen-dependent potent cytotoxicity against patient-derived cell lines representing ATL, CTCL, ALCL and a subset of HDL. Furthermore, these CAR T cells also eradicated leukemia in a mouse xenograft model of ATL illustrating the potential utility of this modality in the treatment of a wide spectrum of T cell malignancies.","['Perera, Liyanage P', 'Zhang, Meili', 'Nakagawa, Masao', 'Petrus, Michael N', 'Maeda, Michiyuki', 'Kadin, Marshall E', 'Waldmann, Thomas A', 'Perera, Pin-Yu']","['Perera LP', 'Zhang M', 'Nakagawa M', 'Petrus MN', 'Maeda M', 'Kadin ME', 'Waldmann TA', 'Perera PY']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6316-8618'],"['Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-1374, USA.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-1374, USA.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-1374, USA.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-1374, USA.', 'Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Boston University School of Medicine, Department of Dermatology and Skin Surgery, Roger Williams Medical Center, Providence, Rhode 02908.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-1374, USA.', 'Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Washington D.C., 20422, USA.']",['eng'],"['UL1 TR001409/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'Z99 CA999999/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20170605,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (CCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', '*Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, CCR4/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/pathology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5546946,2017/05/26 06:00,2017/08/10 06:00,['2017/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/11 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24794 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 Sep;92(9):892-901. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24794.

An analysis was performed to develop a population pharmacokinetic model of CC-292 and assess the influence of demographics and disease-related covariates on CC-292 exposure and to assess the exposure-response (overall response rate) relationship in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was based on a 2-compartment base model conducted in NONMEM. Categorical exposure-response analysis was performed using logistic regression in SAS. The population pharmacokinetic analysis results indicated that CC-292 pharmacokinetic disposition is similar between healthy subjects and patients. CC-292 showed a larger central compartment volume of distribution than the peripheral compartment volume of distribution (158 L and 72 L, respectively) and a faster clearance than intercompartmental clearance (134 L/h and 18.7 L/h, respectively), indicating that for CC-292, clearance from blood occurs faster than distribution into deep tissues and organs. CC-292 clearance is not affected by demographics or baseline clinical lab factors, except for sex. Although sex significantly reduced variation of apparent clearance, the sex effect on apparent clearance is unlikely to be clinically relevant. The exposure-response analysis suggested that higher drug exposure is linearly correlated with higher overall response rate. A twice-daily dose regimen showed higher overall response rate as compared to once-daily dosing, consistent with a threshold concentration of approximately 300 ng/mL, above which the probability of overall response rate significantly increases.","['Li, Yan', 'Ramirez-Valle, Francisco', 'Xue, Yongjun', 'Ventura, Judith I', 'Gouedard, Olivier', 'Mei, Jay', 'Takeshita, Kenichi', 'Palmisano, Maria', 'Zhou, Simon']","['Li Y', 'Ramirez-Valle F', 'Xue Y', 'Ventura JI', 'Gouedard O', 'Mei J', 'Takeshita K', 'Palmisano M', 'Zhou S']",,"['Translational Development and Clinical Pharmacology, Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Translational Development and Clinical Pharmacology, Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Non-Clinical Development, Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Clinical Research and Development, Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Global Project Management, Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Clinical Research and Development, Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Clinical Research and Development, Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Translational Development and Clinical Pharmacology, Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Translational Development and Clinical Pharmacology, Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20170519,England,J Clin Pharmacol,Journal of clinical pharmacology,0366372,"['0 (Acrylamides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'DRU6NG543J (spebrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)']",IM,"['Acrylamides/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC5599992,2017/05/26 06:00,2018/06/01 06:00,['2017/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcph.923 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharmacol. 2017 Oct;57(10):1279-1289. doi: 10.1002/jcph.923.

We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for SPMs among 23 879 patients who survived at least 1 year after a first primary DLBCL diagnosed during 1989-2012, compared to the general population in California. Cumulative incidence (CMI) of SPMs, accounting for the competing risk of death, also was calculated. We found that the incidence of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) nearly doubled in the post-rituximab era [SIR (95% CI) 4.39 (2.51-7.13) pre- (1989-2000) and 8.70 (6.62-11.22) post-rituximab (2001-2012)]. Subsequent thyroid cancer was rare pre-rituximab, but increased substantially after 2001 [0.66 (0.08-2.37) vs. 2.27(1.44-3.41)]. The 5-year CMI for all SPMs (4.77% pre- vs. 5.41% post-rituximab, P = 0.047), AML (0.15% vs. 0.41%, P = 0.003), thyroid cancer (0.03% vs. 0.15%, P = 0.003) and melanoma (0.25% vs. 0.42%, P = 0.020) were greater in DLBCL patients diagnosed in the post- versus pre-rituximab period.

METHODS: In 2015, we conducted a mailed survey of a randomly selected sample of hematologic oncologists in the United States to characterize their perspectives regarding the utility and adequacy of hospice for blood cancer patients, as well as factors that might impact referral patterns. Simultaneous provision of care for patients with solid malignancies was permitted. RESULTS: We received 349 surveys (response rate, 57.3%). The majority of respondents (68.1%) strongly agreed that hospice care is helpful for patients with hematologic cancers; those with practices including greater numbers of solid tumor patients (at least 25%) were more likely to strongly agree (odds ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-3.52). Despite high levels of support for hospice in general, 46.0% felt that home hospice is inadequate for their patients' needs (as compared to inpatient hospice with round-the-clock care). Although more than half of the respondents reported that they would be more likely to refer patients to hospice if red cell and/or platelet transfusions were available, those who considered home hospice inadequate were even more likely to report that they would (67.3% vs 55.3% for red cells [P = .03] and 52.9% vs 39.7% for platelets [P = .02]). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that although hematologic oncologists value hospice, concerns about the adequacy of services for blood cancer patients limit hospice referrals. To increase hospice enrollment for blood cancer patients, interventions tailoring hospice services to their specific needs are warranted. Cancer 2017;123:3377-84.

Using 8-colour flow cytometry and proliferation-assays, we studied the composition and proliferation of both the B-cell precursor (BCP) population in the bone marrow (BM) and mature B-cell population in peripheral blood (PB) during and after BCP-ALL therapy. We found a normal BCP differentiation pattern and a delayed formation of classical CD38(dim) -naive mature B-cells, natural effector B-cells and memory B-cells in patients after chemotherapy. This B-cell differentiation/maturation pattern was strikingly similar to that during initial B-cell development in healthy infants. Tissue-resident plasma cells appeared to be partly protected from chemotherapy. Also, we found that the fast recovery of naive mature B-cell numbers after chemotherapy was the result of increased de novo BCP generation, rather than enhanced B-cell proliferation in BM or PB. These results indicate that post-treatment BCP-ALL patients will eventually re-establish a B-cell compartment with a composition and B-cell receptor repertoire similar to that in healthy children. Additionally, the formation of a new memory B-cell compartment suggests that revaccination might be beneficial after BCP-ALL therapy.","['Theunissen, Prisca M J', 'van den Branden, Anouk', 'Van Der Sluijs-Gelling, Alita', 'De Haas, Valerie', 'Beishuizen, Auke', 'van Dongen, Jacques J M', 'Van Der Velden, Vincent H J']","['Theunissen PMJ', 'van den Branden A', 'Van Der Sluijs-Gelling A', 'De Haas V', 'Beishuizen A', 'van Dongen JJM', 'Van Der Velden VHJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4028-7734'],"['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Centre Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Centre Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Sophia Children's Hospital/Erasmus MC, University Medical Centre Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Centre Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Centre Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170525,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/drug effects/pathology/*physiology', 'Regeneration/drug effects/physiology']",,2017/05/26 06:00,2017/09/07 06:00,['2017/05/26 06:00'],"['2016/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14685 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2017 Jul;178(2):267-278. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14685.

With a median follow-up of 7.2 years, 349 patients died and 62 progressed to acute leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Taking death as a competing risk, CALR genotype was associated with a lower risk of transformation [subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR): 0.13, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.2-0.9, P = 0.039], whereas JAK2 V617F showed borderline significance for higher risk (SHR: 2.05, 95% CI: 0.9-4.6, P = 0.09). Myelofibrotic transformation increased leukaemic risk, except in CALR-mutated patients. Next generation sequencing of 51 genes at the time of transformation showed additional mutations (median number: 3; range: 1-5) in 25 out of 29 (86%) assessable cases. Mutations (median: 1; range: 1-3) were detected in 67% of paired samples from the chronic phase. Leukaemia appeared in a JAK2 V617F negative clone in 17 (58%) cases, eleven of them being previously JAK2 V617F-positive. JAK2 V617F-mutated leukaemia was significantly associated with complex karyotype and acquisition of TP53 mutations, whereas EZH2 and RUNX1 mutations were more frequent in JAK2 V617F-negative leukaemia. Survival was longer in JAK2 V617F-unmutated leukaemia (343 days vs. 95 days, P = 0.003). In conclusion, CALR genotype is associated with a lower risk of leukaemic transformation. Leukaemia arising in a JAK2 V617F-negative clone is TP53 independent and shows better survival.","['Alvarez-Larran, Alberto', 'Senin, Alicia', 'Fernandez-Rodriguez, Concepcion', 'Pereira, Arturo', 'Arellano-Rodrigo, Eduardo', 'Gomez, Montse', 'Ferrer-Marin, Francisca', 'Martinez-Lopez, Joaquin', 'Camacho, Laura', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Angona, Anna', 'Navarro, Blanca', 'Cervantes, Francisco', 'Besses, Carlos', 'Bellosillo, Beatriz', 'Hernandez-Boluda, Juan Carlos']","['Alvarez-Larran A', 'Senin A', 'Fernandez-Rodriguez C', 'Pereira A', 'Arellano-Rodrigo E', 'Gomez M', 'Ferrer-Marin F', 'Martinez-Lopez J', 'Camacho L', 'Colomer D', 'Angona A', 'Navarro B', 'Cervantes F', 'Besses C', 'Bellosillo B', 'Hernandez-Boluda JC']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6387-4619', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9520-3243', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4289-3113']","['Haematology Department, Hospital del Mar-IMIM, Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Haematology Department, Hospital del Mar-IMIM, Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Pathology Department-IMIM, Hospital del Mar, Universidad Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Haemotherapy and Haemostasis Department, Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Haemotherapy and Haemostasis Department, Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Haematology Department, Hospital Clinico-INCLIVA, Valencia, Spain.', 'Haematology and Medical Oncology, Hospital Morales-Messeguer, CIBERER, UCAM, Murcia, Spain.', 'Haematology Department, Hospital 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Pathology Department-IMIM, Hospital del Mar, Universidad Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Haematopathology Unit, Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Haematology Department, Hospital del Mar-IMIM, Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Haematology Department, Hospital Clinico-INCLIVA, Valencia, Spain.', 'Haematology Department, Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Haematology Department, Hospital del Mar-IMIM, Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Pathology Department-IMIM, Hospital del Mar, Universidad Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Haematology Department, Hospital Clinico-INCLIVA, Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170523,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Calreticulin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Calreticulin/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/mortality', 'Polycythemia Vera/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*genetics/mortality', 'Young Adult']",,2017/05/26 06:00,2017/10/03 06:00,['2017/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14762 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2017 Sep;178(5):764-771. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14762.

We studied hyperleucocytosis in 890 patients with AML aged 0-18 years registered in the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO) registry, with special focus on very high white blood cell counts (WBC >200 x 10/l). Eighty-six patients (10%) had WBC 100-199 x 10(9) /l and 57 (6%) had WBC >/=200 x 10(9) /l. Patients with WBC >/=200 x 10(9) /l had a high frequency of t(9;11) and a paucity of trisomy 8. Due to the high frequency of deaths within the first 2 weeks (30% vs. 1% for all others), overall survival in this group was inferior to patients with WBC <200 x 10(9) /l (39% vs. 61%). Main cause of early death was intracranial haemorrhage and leucostasis. Twenty-six per cent of these patients never started antileukaemic protocol therapy.

Post-transplantation minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring enables risk stratification and identifies AL patients at higher risk of relapse. MRD assessment primarily involves the determination of leukaemia-associated immunophenotypic patterns using multiparameter flow cytometry, and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based evaluation of expression levels of leukaemia-related genes (specific reciprocal gene rearrangements and other mutation types). In addition, next generation sequencing and digital PCR may further enrich current MRD detection. Several MRD-directed interventions have demonstrated the ability to reduce the risk of relapse with acceptable treatment-related toxicities. Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is the most important intervention for MRD-positive patients, while several modified strategies, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral blood cells followed by short term immune suppression and escalating dose regimen, further improve the safety and efficacy of DLI. Interferon therapy, targeted drugs, and hypomethylating agents have also been introduced for MRD-directed interventions. Referring to the issues of whether and who would benefit from pre-emptive intervention according to MRD, in this review, we summarized this rapidly evolving area of MRD monitoring and MRD-directed interventions in AL patients after allo-HSCT.","['Mo, Xiao-Dong', 'Lv, Meng', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Mo XD', 'Lv M', 'Huang XJ']",,"[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Haematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Haematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Haematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", 'Peking-Tsinghua Centre for Life Sciences, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170523,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Allografts', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/*methods', '*Leukemia/blood/prevention & control', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/*methods', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/*methods', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recurrence']",,2017/05/26 06:00,2017/10/20 06:00,['2017/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14778 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2017 Oct;179(2):184-197. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14778.

In clinical practice, the diagnostic yield of blood cultures and other investigations which aim to identify a causative organism or site of infection is low. We have retrospectively examined all blood cultures collected in a ""real world"" cohort of patients receiving chemotherapy for acute leukemia and patients with aggressive lymphoma treated with Hyper-CVAD/MTX-cytarabine, at a single tertiary center over a five-year period. In this cohort, the 30-day mortality following confirmed blood stream infection (BSI) was 5.9%, which is lower than most reports in the recent literature. We compared the blood culture results of inpatients undergoing induction chemotherapy and outpatients presenting with fevers and found a significantly higher rate of proven BSI in the outpatient group. In all settings, gram-negative organisms were most common. The rate of resistance to first-line empiric antibiotics among pathogenic isolates was 11.6% in the whole cohort, independent of blood culture circumstances. There was a trend to higher resistance rates among inpatients undergoing induction chemotherapy compared to patients presenting to the emergency department (17.4% vs 7.5%) but this did not reach statistical significance. We also report low rates of ciprofloxacin resistance (5% of isolates), in a center where universal fluoroquinolone prophylaxis is not employed. Our low resistance and mortality rates support our current therapeutic strategies, however presence of resistant organisms across the spectrum of indications for BC collection highlights the importance of surveilling local patterns, escalating antimicrobial therapy in the deteriorating patient, and considering advanced techniques for the rapid identification of resistance in this patient population.","['Conn, Jason R', 'Catchpoole, Elizabeth M', 'Runnegar, Naomi', 'Mapp, Sally J', 'Markey, Kate A']","['Conn JR', 'Catchpoole EM', 'Runnegar N', 'Mapp SJ', 'Markey KA']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7064-2362'],"['Division of Cancer Services, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', ""Pathology Queensland, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."", 'The University of Queensland, School of Medicine, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Infection Management Services, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Division of Cancer Services, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland, School of Medicine, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Division of Cancer Services, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland, School of Medicine, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', ""Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."", 'QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Australian Infectious Diseases Research Centre, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20170519,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/*blood/drug therapy/microbiology/*mortality', 'Ciprofloxacin/*therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Febrile Neutropenia/blood/drug therapy/microbiology/*mortality', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC5438184,2017/05/26 06:00,2017/10/05 06:00,['2017/05/26 06:00'],"['2016/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0178059 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-49213 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 May 19;12(5):e0178059. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0178059. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although great progress has been made for improvement in clinical treatment during the past decades, it is common for patients to develop chemotherapy resistance. Therefore, further exploring novel therapeutic strategies are still crucial for improving disease outcome. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a novel class of genes that function as negative regulators of gene expression. Recently, miRNAs have been implicated in several cancers. Previously, we identified 41 miRNAs that were dysregulated in resistant compared with adriamycin (ADR)-sensitive parental cells in CML. In the present study, we reported that miR-3142 are overexpressed in ADR-resistant K562/ADR cells and CML/multiple drug resistance patients, as compared with K562 cells and CML patients. Upregulation of miR-3142 in K562 cells accelerated colony formation ability and enhanced resisitance to ADR in vitro. Conversely, inhibition of miR-3142 expression in K562/ADR cells decreased colony-formation ability and enhanced sensitivity to ADR in vitro and in vivo. Significantly, our results showed miR-3142-induced ADR resistance through targeting phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), which led to downregulation of PTEN protein and activation of PI3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Inhibition of Akt using Akt inhibitor or introduction of PTEN largely abrogated miR-3142-induced resistance. These findings indicated that miR-3142 induces cell proliferation and ADR resistance primarily through targeting the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway and implicate the potential application of miR-3142 in cancer therapy.","['Zhao, Lifen', 'Shan, Yujia', 'Liu, Bing', 'Li, Yang', 'Jia, Li']","['Zhao L', 'Shan Y', 'Liu B', 'Li Y', 'Jia L']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3152-3253'],"['College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, Liaoning Province, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, Liaoning Province, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, Liaoning Province, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, Liaoning Province, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, Liaoning Province, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",20170525,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (MicroRNAs)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",PMC5520737,2017/05/26 06:00,2018/02/24 06:00,['2017/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2017223 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2017.223 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2017 May 25;8(5):e2830. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2017.223.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cell Death Dis. 2020 Feb 12;11(2):121.

METHODS: The first Long-term Follow-up Study in Oncology (SALTO1) is a prospective cohort study of survivors of childhood cancers (except leukemia) diagnosed between 1987 and 1992 in the Rhone-Alpes and Auvergne regions of France. Of the 481 patients eligible for the study, 150 participated in a long-term consultation with a pediatric oncologist and an internist, after which survivors and their GPs received long-term plans and recommendations based on consultation findings. A year after the consultation, survivors and their GPs assessed their satisfaction with the process. RESULTS: Of the 150 survivor participants in the long-term follow-up, 120 (80%) completed the satisfaction form, with 107 (89%) reporting satisfaction. Forty-eight (32%) expressed strengthening their follow-up as a consequence of the consultation. Of the 79 survivors sent recommendations, 76 (96%) reported reading them, most (n = 68; 86%) found them useful, and 56 (71%) followed recommendations. Of the 107 GPs of the survivors, 82 (77%) conceded having been poorly informed about long-term complications for their patients after chemotherapy, and 93 (88%) appreciated having a hospital contact available for these patients. CONCLUSION: The long-term consultations ultimately enhanced medical follow-up of survivor participants, improving knowledge of both patients and family physicians regarding the patients' early disease, its treatments, and possible concerns, and offering consultative resources of medical specialists. The levels of participation of survivors and their physicians and reported satisfaction encourage the adoption of such consultations throughout France.","['Berger, Claire', 'Casagranda, Leonie', 'Faure-Conter, Cecile', 'Freycon, Claire', 'Isfan, Florentina', 'Robles, Aurelie', 'Trombert-Paviot, Beatrice', 'Guichard, Isabelle', 'Durieu, Isabelle', 'Cathebras, Pascal']","['Berger C', 'Casagranda L', 'Faure-Conter C', 'Freycon C', 'Isfan F', 'Robles A', 'Trombert-Paviot B', 'Guichard I', 'Durieu I', 'Cathebras P']",,"['1 Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit, University Hospital of Saint-Etienne , Saint-Etienne Cedex 02, France .', '2 Childhood Cancer Registry of the Rhone-Alpes Region, University of Saint-Etienne , Saint-Etienne Cedex 02, France .', '3 Host Research Team EA4607 SNA-EPIS, PRES Lyon, Jean Monnet University, University Hospital , Saint-Etienne, France .', '1 Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit, University Hospital of Saint-Etienne , Saint-Etienne Cedex 02, France .', '2 Childhood Cancer Registry of the Rhone-Alpes Region, University of Saint-Etienne , Saint-Etienne Cedex 02, France .', '3 Host Research Team EA4607 SNA-EPIS, PRES Lyon, Jean Monnet University, University Hospital , Saint-Etienne, France .', '4 Institute of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology , Lyon, France .', '5 Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit, University Hospital of Grenoble , Grenoble Cedex 9, France .', '6 Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit, University Hospital Estaing of Clermont-Ferrand , Clermont-Ferrand, France .', '7 Department of Internal Medicine Unit, Hospital of Firminy , Firminy, France .', '3 Host Research Team EA4607 SNA-EPIS, PRES Lyon, Jean Monnet University, University Hospital , Saint-Etienne, France .', '8 Department of Public Health and Medical Informatics, University of Saint-Etienne , Saint-Etienne Cedex 02, France .', '9 Department of Internal Medicine Unit, University Hospital of Saint-Etienne , Saint-Etienne Cedex 02, France .', '10 Department of Internal Medicine and Vascular Pathology Unit, University Hospital of Lyon Sud , Pierre-Benite, France .', '9 Department of Internal Medicine Unit, University Hospital of Saint-Etienne , Saint-Etienne Cedex 02, France .']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170525,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,,IM,"['Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'France', 'General Practitioners', 'Humans', 'Prospective Studies', 'Referral and Consultation/*standards', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,2017/05/26 06:00,2018/07/18 06:00,['2017/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jayao.2017.0019 [doi]'],ppublish,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2017 Dec;6(4):524-534. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2017.0019.

Relapse/refractory disease remains frequent in younger patients and even more so in older patients, including treatment with epigenetic drugs in this age group, mainly with hypomethylating agents. New treatment strategies are urgently needed. The recent discovery that epigenetic readers of the bromodomain (BRD) and extraterminal (BET) protein family, are crucial for AML maintenance by transcription of oncogenic c-MYC lead to rapid development of BET inhibitors entering clinical trials. Areas covered: We provide a critical overview using main sources for the use of BET inhibitors in AML treatment. Limits of this treatment approach including resistance mechanisms and future directions including development of new generation BET inhibitors and combination strategies with other drugs are detailed. Expert opinion: BET inhibitors were expected to overcome limits of conventional treatment in patients as impressive in vitro data emerged recently in well-characterized AML subsets, including those associated with poor risk characteristics in the clinic. Nevertheless single activity of BET inhibitors appears to be modest and resistance mechanisms were already identified. BET inhibitors with alternative mechanisms of action and/or combination strategies with epigenetic drugs should be tested.","['Braun, Thorsten', 'Gardin, Claude']","['Braun T', 'Gardin C']",,"['a Hematology Department , Avicenne Hospital-Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), University Paris XIII , Bobigny , France.', ""b Laboratoire de Transfert des Leucemies , Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, University Paris VII , Paris , France."", 'a Hematology Department , Avicenne Hospital-Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), University Paris XIII , Bobigny , France.', ""b Laboratoire de Transfert des Leucemies , Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, University Paris VII , Paris , France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170609,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BRD2 protein, human)', '0 (BRD3 protein, human)', '0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Drugs, Investigational)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drugs, Investigational/*pharmacology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors']",,2017/05/26 06:00,2017/07/19 06:00,['2017/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13543784.2017.1335711 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2017 Jul;26(7):803-811. doi: 10.1080/13543784.2017.1335711.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the advantages and disadvantages of chemotherapy including escalated BEACOPP compared to chemotherapy including ABVD in the treatment of early unfavourable or advanced stage HL as first-line treatment. SEARCH METHODS: We searched for randomised controlled trials in MEDLINE, CENTRAL and conference proceedings (January 1985 to July 2013 and for the update to March 2017) and Embase (1985 to November 2008). Moreover we searched trial registries (March 2017; www.controlled-trials.com, www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search, clinicaltrials.gov, www.eortc.be, www.ghsg.org, www.ctc.usyd.edu.au, www.trialscentral.org/index.html) SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials examining chemotherapy including at least two cycles of escalated BEACOPP regimens compared with chemotherapy including at least four cycles of ABVD regimens as first-line treatment for patients with early unfavourable stage or advanced stage HL. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The effect measures we used were hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and freedom from first progression.We used risk ratios (RRs) relative risks to analyse harms: treatment-related mortality, secondary malignancies (including myeloid dysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)), infertility and adverse events.Quality of life was not reported in any trial, therefore not analysed. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed quality of trials. MAIN RESULTS: We screened 1796 records and identified five eligible trials in total i.e. one trial could be added on the previous review. These trials included only adults (16 to 65 years of age). We included all five trials with 3427 people in the meta-analyses: the HD9 and HD14 trials were co-ordinated in Germany, the HD2000 and GSM-HD trials were performed in Italy and the EORTC 20012 was conducted in Belgium. The overall risk of performance and detection bias was low for overall survival (OS), but was high for other outcomes, as therapy blinding was not feasible. The remaining 'Risk of bias' domains were low and unclear.All trials reported results for OS and progression-free survival (PFS). In contrast to the our first published review (2011) the addition of results from the EORTC 20012 BEACOPP escalated increases OS (3142 participants; HR 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.97; high-quality evidence). This means that only 90 (70 to 117) patients will die after five years in the BEACOPP escalated arm compared to 120 in the ABVD arm. This survival advantage is also reflected in an increased PFS with BEACOPP escalated (3142 participants; HR 0.54 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.64); moderate-quality evidence), meaning that after five years only 144 (121 to 168) patients will experience a progress, relapse or death in the BEACOPP escalated arm compared to 250 in the ABVD arm.There is no evidence for a difference for treatment-related mortality (2700 participants, RR 2.15 (95% CI = 0.93 to 4.95), low-quality evidence).Although the occurrence of MDS or AML may increase with BEACOPP escalated (3332 participants, RR 3.90 (95% CI 1.36 to 11.21); low-quality evidence)), there is no evidence for a difference between both regimens for overall secondary malignancies (3332 participants, RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.48), low-quality evidence). However, the observation time of the studies included in the review is too short to be expected to demonstrate differences with respect to second solid tumours which would not be expected to show significance until around 15 years after treatment.We are very uncertain how many female patients will be infertile due to chemotherapy and which arm might be favoured (106 participants, RR 1.37 (95% CI 0.83 to 2.26), very low-quality evidence). This is a very small sample, and the age of the patients was not detailed. No analysis of male fertility was provided.Five trials reported adverse events and the analysis shows that the escalated BEACOPP regimens probably causes more haematological toxicities WHO grade III or IV ((anaemia: 2425 participants, RR 10.67 (95% CI 7.14 to 15.93); neutropenia: 519 participants, RR 1.80 (95% CI 1.52 to 2.13); thrombocytopenia: 2425 participants, RR 18.12 (95% CI 11.77 to 27.92); infections: 2425 participants, RR 3.73 (95% CI 2.58 to 5.38), all low-quality evidence).Only one trial (EORTC 20012) planned to assess quality of life, however, no results were reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis provides moderate- to high-quality evidence that adult patients between 16 and 60 years of age with early unfavourable and advanced stage HL benefit regarding OS and PFS from first-line chemotherapy including escalated BEACOPP. The proven benefit in OS for patients with advanced HL is a new finding of this updated review due to the inclusion of the results from the EORTC 20012 trial. Furthermore, there is only low-quality evidence of a difference in the total number of secondary malignancies, as the follow-up period might be too short to detect meaningful differences. Low-quality evidence also suggests that people treated with escalated BEACOPP may have a higher risk to develop secondary AML or MDS. Due to the availability of only very low-quality evidence available, we are unable to come to a conclusion in terms of infertility. This review does for the first time suggest a survival benefit. However, it is clear from this review that BEACOPP escalated may be more toxic that ABVD, and very important long-term side effects of second malignancies and infertility have not been sufficiently analysed yet.","['Skoetz, Nicole', 'Will, Andrea', 'Monsef, Ina', 'Brillant, Corinne', 'Engert, Andreas', 'von Tresckow, Bastian']","['Skoetz N', 'Will A', 'Monsef I', 'Brillant C', 'Engert A', 'von Tresckow B']",,"['Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group, Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne, Kerpener Str. 62, Cologne, Germany, 50937.', 'Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group, Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne, Kerpener Str. 62, Cologne, Germany, 50937.', 'Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group, Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne, Kerpener Str. 62, Cologne, Germany, 50937.', 'Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group, Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne, Kerpener Str. 62, Cologne, Germany, 50937.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne, Kerpener Str. 62, Cologne, Germany, 50924.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne, Kerpener Str. 62, Cologne, Germany, 50924.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20170525,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ABVD protocol', 'BEACOPP protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease Progression', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",PMC6481581,2017/05/26 06:00,2017/08/10 06:00,['2017/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2017 May 25;5:CD007941. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD007941.pub3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2011 Aug 10;(8):CD007941.

We aimed to describe cancer incidence in Japan focusing on childhood, adolescence and young adulthood (AYA). Cancer incidence data were obtained from the Monitoring of Cancer Incidence in Japan project. For the 2009-2011 incidence, the data were collected from 40 prefectures, of which data from 27 prefectures meeting quality standards were analyzed (population coverage: 38.6%). Cancers diagnosed in 0-39 years of age were classified according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancer (version 3). Crude incidence rates of cancer (including benign or behavior-unknown brain tumors) were 122.7, 142.2, 310.7, and 910.6 for the 0-14, 15-19, 20-29, and 30-39 age groups, respectively (per million population). Using the sex- and age-specific incidence rates, the national estimates of cancer incidence were 2055 for 0-14 years (1118 males and 937 females), 864 for 15-19 years (450 males and 414 females), 4246 for 20-29 years (1699 males and 2547 females), and 16 295 for 30-39 years of age (5101 males and 11 194 females). The five leading cancers were leukemia, cancer of the central nervous system (CNS), lymphoma, malignant germ cell and other gonadal tumors, and neuroblastoma in childhood cases (0-14 years old); leukemia, malignant germ cell and other gonadal tumors, lymphoma, CNS, and malignant bone tumors in adolescence (15-19 years old). The leading cancer in 20-29 years of age was malignant germ cell other gonadal tumors (mainly testis and ovary), whereas female breast cancer was most frequent in 30-39 years of age. These results provide an overall picture of childhood and AYA cancer in Japan.","['Katanoda, Kota', 'Shibata, Akiko', 'Matsuda, Tomohiro', 'Hori, Megumi', 'Nakata, Kayo', 'Narita, Yoshitaka', 'Ogawa, Chitose', 'Munakata, Wataru', 'Kawai, Akira', 'Nishimoto, Hiroshi']","['Katanoda K', 'Shibata A', 'Matsuda T', 'Hori M', 'Nakata K', 'Narita Y', 'Ogawa C', 'Munakata W', 'Kawai A', 'Nishimoto H']",,"['Center for Cancer Control and Information Services, National Cancer Center, Tokyo.', 'Center for Cancer Control and Information Services, National Cancer Center, Tokyo.', 'Center for Cancer Control and Information Services, National Cancer Center, Tokyo.', 'Center for Cancer Control and Information Services, National Cancer Center, Tokyo.', 'Cancer Control Center, Osaka International Cancer Institute, Osaka.', 'Department of Neurosurgery and Neuro-Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo.', 'Department of Hematology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo.', 'Rare Cancer Center, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo.', 'Rare Cancer Center, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo.', 'Department of Musculoskeletal Oncology and Rehabilitation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo.', 'Center for Cancer Control and Information Services, National Cancer Center, Tokyo.']",['eng'],,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",,England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Young Adult']",PMC5896699,2017/05/26 06:00,2017/12/02 06:00,['2017/05/26 06:00'],"['2016/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/02 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['3852037 [pii]', '10.1093/jjco/hyx070 [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 2017 Aug 1;47(8):762-771. doi: 10.1093/jjco/hyx070.,['NOTNLM'],"['epidemiological monitoring', 'neoplasms', 'pediatrics', 'population-based cancer registry']",,['(c) The Author 2017.

In Italy, on January 2014, drinking water contamination in an area of the Veneto Region was detected mainly due to the drain of fluorinated chemicals by a manufacturing company operating since 1964. Methods: The present ecological mortality study was aimed at comparing mortality for some causes of death selected on the basis of previous reported associations, during the period 1980-2013, in municipalities with PFAS contaminated and uncontaminated drinking water on the basis of the levels indicated by the Italian National Health Institute (ISS). Sex-specific number, standardized mortality rates and rate ratios (RR) for PFAS contaminated and uncontaminated areas were computed for each cause of death through the ENEA epidemiological database. Results: In both sexes, statistically significant RRs were detected for all causes mortality, diabetes, cerebrovascular diseases, myocardial infarction and Alzheimer's disease. In females, RRs significantly higher than 1.0 were also observed for kidney and breast cancer, and Parkinson's disease. Increased risk, although not statistically significant, was observed for bladder cancer in both sexes, and for testicular cancer, pancreatic cancer and leukemia in males only. Conclusions: Higher mortality levels for some causes of death, possibly associated with PFAS exposure, were detected in contaminated municipalities in comparison with uncontaminated ones with similar socioeconomic status and smoking habits. These results warrant further individual level analytic studies to delineate casual associations.","['Mastrantonio, Marina', 'Bai, Edoardo', 'Uccelli, Raffaella', 'Cordiano, Vincenzo', 'Screpanti, Augusto', 'Crosignani, Paolo']","['Mastrantonio M', 'Bai E', 'Uccelli R', 'Cordiano V', 'Screpanti A', 'Crosignani P']",,"['Territorial and Production System Sustainability Department, Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA), Rome, Italy.', 'International Society of Doctors for the Environment (ISDE), Rome, Italy.', 'Territorial and Production System Sustainability Department, Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA), Rome, Italy.', 'International Society of Doctors for the Environment (ISDE), Rome, Italy.', 'Territorial and Production System Sustainability Department, Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA), Rome, Italy.', 'International Society of Doctors for the Environment (ISDE), Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Eur J Public Health,European journal of public health,9204966,"['0 (Drinking Water)', '0 (Fluorocarbons)', '0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cities', '*Death', 'Drinking Water/*analysis', 'Environmental Monitoring/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Fluorocarbons/*poisoning', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical/*analysis', 'Water Pollution/analysis', 'Young Adult']",,2017/05/26 06:00,2019/01/27 06:00,['2017/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['3852033 [pii]', '10.1093/eurpub/ckx066 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Public Health. 2018 Feb 1;28(1):180-185. doi: 10.1093/eurpub/ckx066.,,,,"['(c) The Author 2017.

Here we report that PHF5A, another component of this subcomplex, is also targeted by these compounds. Mutations in PHF5A-Y36, SF3B1-K1071, SF3B1-R1074 and SF3B1-V1078 confer resistance to these modulators, suggesting a common interaction site. RNA-seq analysis reveals that PHF5A-Y36C has minimal effect on basal splicing but inhibits the global action of splicing modulators. Moreover, PHF5A-Y36C alters splicing modulator-induced intron-retention/exon-skipping profile, which correlates with the differential GC content between adjacent introns and exons. We determine the crystal structure of human PHF5A demonstrating that Y36 is located on a highly conserved surface. Analysis of the cryo-EM spliceosome B(act) complex shows that the resistance mutations cluster in a pocket surrounding the branch point adenosine, suggesting a competitive mode of action. Collectively, we propose that PHF5A-SF3B1 forms a central node for binding to these splicing modulators.","['Teng, Teng', 'Tsai, Jennifer Hc', 'Puyang, Xiaoling', 'Seiler, Michael', 'Peng, Shouyong',

The immunophenotyping identified a blastic population co-expressing myeloid, lymphoid B and lymphoid T markers suggesting the diagnosis of either a mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) or an early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL). Because of the poor prognosis linked to these leukemias, the patient benefited from chemotherapy targeting both myeloid and lymphoid components, followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. DNA-based techniques analyzing B and T-cell clonality identified partial rearrangements in immunoglobulin and TCR genes, allowing the monitoring of minimal residual disease. This observation highlights the difficulty to classify some atypical cases of acute leukemias. It emphasizes on the complementarity of cytomorphology, immunophenotyping by flow cytometry and molecular techniques in order to promptly characterize and treat these leukemias.","['Fleury, Carole', 'Passet, Marie', 'Settegrana, Catherine', 'Simon, Laurence', 'Chapiro, Elise', 'Trinquand, Amelie', 'Safra Zaghouani, Ines', 'Uzunov, Madalina', 'Le Garff-Tavernier, Magali', 'Armand, Marine', 'Costopoulos, Myrto']","['Fleury C', 'Passet M', 'Settegrana C', 'Simon L', 'Chapiro E', 'Trinquand A', 'Safra Zaghouani I', 'Uzunov M', 'Le Garff-Tavernier M', 'Armand M', 'Costopoulos M']",,"[""Service d'hematologie biologique, Hopitaux universitaires Pitie-Salpetriere Charles-Foix, Paris, France."", ""Service d'hematologie biologique, Hopitaux universitaires Pitie-Salpetriere Charles-Foix, Paris, France."", ""Service d'hematologie biologique, Hopitaux universitaires Pitie-Salpetriere Charles-Foix, Paris, France."", ""Service d'hematologie clinique, Hopitaux universitaires Pitie-Salpetriere Charles-Foix, Paris, France."", ""Service d'hematologie biologique, Hopitaux universitaires Pitie-Salpetriere Charles-Foix, Paris, France."", ""Service d'hematologie biologique, Institut Necker Enfants Malades, Paris, France."", ""Laboratoire d'hematologie moleculaire et cellulaire, Institut Pasteur, Tunis, Belvedere, Tunisie."", ""Service d'hematologie clinique, Hopitaux universitaires Pitie-Salpetriere Charles-Foix, Paris, France."", ""Service d'hematologie biologique, Hopitaux universitaires Pitie-Salpetriere Charles-Foix, Paris, France."", ""Service d'hematologie biologique, Hopitaux universitaires Pitie-Salpetriere Charles-Foix, Paris, France."", ""Service d'hematologie biologique, Hopitaux universitaires Pitie-Salpetriere Charles-Foix, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,France,Ann Biol Clin (Paris),Annales de biologie clinique,2984690R,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cells/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",,2017/05/26 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2017/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['abc.2017.1238 [pii]', '10.1684/abc.2017.1238 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Biol Clin (Paris). 2017 Jun 1;75(3):339-347. doi: 10.1684/abc.2017.1238.,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic T-cell leukemia', 'cytology', 'flow cytometry', 'immunophenotyping', 'lymphoid clonality', 'mixed phenotype acute leukemia']",,,,,Leucemies aigues difficilement classables : a propos d'un cas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The function of KDM3B is likely cell-type dependent and its seeming functional discordance may reflect its phenotypic dependence on downstream targets. Here, we first showed the underexpression of KDM3B in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and AML cell lines with MLL-AF6/9 or PML-RARA translocations. Overexpression of KDM3B repressed colony formation of AML cell line with 5q deletion. We then performed global microarray profiling to identify potential downstream targets of KDM3B, notably HOXA1, which was verified by real time PCR and Western blotting. We further showed KDM3B binding at retinoic acid response elements (RARE) but not at the promoter region of HOXA1 gene. KDM3B knockdown resulted in increased mono-methylation but decreased di-methylation of H3K9 at RARE while eschewing the promoter region of HOXA1.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the risk factors of Catheter-related infection (CRI) in patients with leukemia and to provide some nursing strategies based on the results. METHODS: Clinical data from 140 patients with leukemia between May 2014 and July 2016 in Haiyang People's Hospital, China were retrospectively analyzed. We employed univariate analysis to explore the relationship of various factors, including leukemia types, puncture times, underlying diseases, Catheter indwelling time, hormones use, chemotherapy use, immune functions and seasons, with the incidence of CRI. Further, multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the potential independent risk factors of CRI. Bacterial culture was performed for etiological detection. RESULTS: Among the 140 patients with leukemia, 25 cases were diagnosed as CRI, with the incidence of 17.9%. Univariate analysis showed that puncture times, underlying diseases, catheter indwelling time, hormones use, chemotherapy use, immune functions and seasons were significantly correlated with the incidence of CRI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that immune functions, puncture times and seasons were independent risk factors for CRI. Etiological bacterial culture detected 20 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus: n=10, Klebsiella pneumonia: n=4, Coryne-bacterium: n=2 and other species: n=4) in 25 cases diagnosed with CRI.

Docking studies revealed that 4-butylaminopyrimido[4',5':4,5]thieno(2,3-b)quinoline (BPTQ) has a higher order of interaction with the kinase receptors than other PTQ derivatives. In vitro screening confirms that BPTQ inhibits VEGFR1 and CHK2, with the IC50 values of 0.54 and 1.70 micromol/L, respectively. Further, cytotoxicity of BPTQ was measured by trypan blue assay. Treatment with BPTQ decreased the proliferation of HL-60 cells with an IC50 value of 12 micromol/L and induces apoptosis, as explicated by the fall in the mitochondrial membrane potential, annexin V labeling and increased expression of caspase-3.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cytotoxicity, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory effects of L. porteri root extract on human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells and H2O2-induced oxidative damaged HL-60 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HL-60 cells were incubated with different concentrations of root extract, and cells were harvested for viability assays on day 3 and 7. Cytokine levels (interferon-gamma [IFN-gamma], interleukin-2 [IL-2], and interleukin-10 [IL-10]) and antioxidant indexes (malondialdehyde [MDA], reduced glutathione [GSH], superoxide dismutase [SOD], and catalase [CAT]) in H2O2-induced-stressed HL-60 were measured after 2 days. RESULTS: The viability of HL-60 challenged with H2O2 declined by 42% compared to unstressed cells. After 7 days of incubation with 200 or 400 mug/mL L. porteri, the viability of HL-60 cells was two-fold higher than the control. Stressed HL-60 cells treated with 100, 200, and 400 mug/mL L. porteri reduced the lipid peroxidation by 12%-13%. We noted an increase in GSH levels, SOD and CAT activities in stressed HL-60 supplemented with 400 mug/mL root extract. Treatment with 400 mug/mL L. porteri significantly (P < 0.05) increased IFN-gamma and IL-2 in H2O2-challenged cells. CONCLUSION: Our data do not support the use of the extract as an antiproliferation and differentiation therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia. The protective function of L. porteri root extract against oxidative stress could occur through increasing GSH and higher expression of antioxidant enzymes. SUMMARY: Findings from this study may not support the use of Ligusticum porteri root extract as an antiproliferation and differentiation therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemiaOur data suggest that L. porteri root extract may be a potential antioxidant with protective effect against the oxidation of reduced glutathione (GSH)Treatment with L. porteri root extract may be effective in preventing oxidative damage through increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase [SOD] and catalase [CAT]) in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells.","['Nguyen, Khanh', 'Sparks, Jean', 'Omoruyi, Felix']","['Nguyen K', 'Sparks J', 'Omoruyi F']",,"['Department of Life Sciences, Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Life Sciences, Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Life Sciences, Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,India,Pharmacognosy Res,Pharmacognosy research,101558769,,,,PMC5424556,2017/05/26 06:00,2017/05/26 06:01,['2017/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0974-8490.204641 [doi]', 'PR-9-156 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacognosy Res. 2017 Apr-Jun;9(2):156-160. doi: 10.4103/0974-8490.204641.,['NOTNLM'],"['Antioxidative', 'Ligusticum porteri', 'cytotoxicity', 'human promyelocytic leukemia cells', 'immune-modulatory']",['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is used as an ornamental and medicinal plant. Phytochemical studies revealed that its major special metabolites are triterpene acids, such as ursolic and oleanolic acid. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the isolation of ursolic acid (UA) (1) from methanol extracts of I. coccinea flowers through two methodologies, to prepare four derivatives, and to evaluate the cytotoxic effect against six cancer cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The UA was isolated from vegetal material by percolation at room temperature and by ultrasound-assisted extraction. The preparation of derivatives was performed according to literature methods, and the cytotoxic effects were evaluated using the MTT (3,4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. RESULTS: The most efficient extraction was achieved through ultrasound irradiation with a yield of 35% after KOH-impregnated silica in chromatography column. Furthermore, four derivatives (3, 5, 6, 7) of UA were prepared and evaluated, including 1, against two lung cancer (A549 and H460) and four leukemia (K562, Lucena, HL60, and Jurkat) cell lines. Generally, results showed that 1 and 7 were the most active compounds against the assayed cell lines. Also, the cytotoxic effects observed on terpenes 1 and 7 were higher when compared with cisplatin, used as positive control, with the exception of Jurkat cell line. CONCLUSION: The efficiency of such an alternative extraction method led to the principal and abundant active component, 1, of I. coccinea, thus representing a considerable contribution for promising triterpenoid in cancer chemotherapy.

We screened a cohort of 573 fully characterised adult and paediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) patients for genomic PTEN abnormalities. PTEN-inactivating mutations and/or deletions were identified in 91 cases (16%), including 18% of paediatric (49/277) and 14% of adult cases (42/296). Thirty-four patients harboured only mutations, 12 cases demonstrated only large deletions and 9 only microdeletions. About 36 patients had combined alterations. Different mechanisms of PTEN inactivation predicted differences in the clinical outcome for both adult and paediatric patients treated according to the GRAALL03/05 and FRALLE2000 protocols. Whereas large deletions predicted lower 5-year overall survival (P=0.0053 in adults, P=0.001 in children) and disease-free survival (P=0.0009 in adults, P=0.0002 in children), mutations were not associated with a worse prognosis. The prognostic impact of PTEN loss is therefore linked to the underlying type of genomic abnormality, both in adult and paediatric T-ALLs, demonstrating that detailed analysis of the type of abnormality type would be useful to refine risk stratification.","['Tesio, M', 'Trinquand, A', 'Ballerini, P', 'Hypolite, G', 'Lhermitte, L', 'Petit, A', 'Ifrah, N', 'Baruchel, A', 'Dombret, H', 'Macintyre, E', 'Asnafi, V']","['Tesio M', 'Trinquand A', 'Ballerini P', 'Hypolite G', 'Lhermitte L', 'Petit A', 'Ifrah N', 'Baruchel A', 'Dombret H', 'Macintyre E', 'Asnafi V']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8363-1622'],"['Institut Necker-Enfants Malades (INEM), Institut national de recherche medicale (INSERM) U1151, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'Institut Necker-Enfants Malades (INEM), Institut national de recherche medicale (INSERM) U1151, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Cite and Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, U967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Hopital Trousseau, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Institut Necker-Enfants Malades (INEM), Institut national de recherche medicale (INSERM) U1151, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'Institut Necker-Enfants Malades (INEM), Institut national de recherche medicale (INSERM) U1151, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Cite and Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', ""Service d'hematologie pediatrique, AP-HP, Hopital Trousseau, Paris, France."", ""Pole de Recherche et d'Enseignement Superieur L'Universite Nantes Angers Le Mans, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Angers Service des Maladies du Sang et L'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U892, Angers, France."", ""Service d'hematologie pediatrique, AP-HP, Hopital Robert Debre, Paris, France."", ""Universite Paris 7, Hopital Saint-Louis, AP-HP, and Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Paris, France."", 'Institut Necker-Enfants Malades (INEM), Institut national de recherche medicale (INSERM) U1151, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Cite and Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'Institut Necker-Enfants Malades (INEM), Institut national de recherche medicale (INSERM) U1151, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Cite and Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170525,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (SIL-TAL1 fusion protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Alleles', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Exons', 'Female', '*Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Genetic Variation', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Survival Analysis', 'Workflow', 'Young Adult']",,2017/05/26 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2017/05/26 06:00'],"['2016/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017157 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.157 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Dec;31(12):2594-2600. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.157.

Here, we found that the promoter DNA methylation signature of t(8;21)(+) AML blasts differs from that of t(8;21)(-) AMLs. This study demonstrated that a novel hypermethylated zinc finger-containing protein, THAP10, is a target gene and can be epigenetically suppressed by AML1-ETO at the transcriptional level in t(8;21) AML. Our findings also show that THAP10 is a bona fide target of miR-383 that can be epigenetically activated by the AML1-ETO recruiting co-activator p300. In this study, we demonstrated that epigenetic suppression of THAP10 is the mechanistic link between AML1-ETO fusion proteins and tyrosine kinase cascades. In addition, we showed that THAP10 is a nuclear protein that inhibits myeloid proliferation and promotes differentiation both in vitro and in vivo Altogether, our results revealed an unexpected and important epigenetic mini-circuit of AML1-ETO/THAP10/miR-383 in t(8;21) AML, in which epigenetic suppression of THAP10 predicts a poor clinical outcome and represents a novel therapeutic target.","['Li, Yonghui', 'Ning, Qiaoyang', 'Shi, Jinlong', 'Chen, Yang', 'Jiang, Mengmeng', 'Gao, Li', 'Huang, Wenrong', 'Jing, Yu', 'Huang, Sai', 'Liu, Anqi', 'Hu, Zhirui', 'Liu, Daihong', 'Wang, Lili', 'Nervi, Clara', 'Dai, Yun', 'Zhang, Michael Q', 'Yu, Li']","['Li Y', 'Ning Q', 'Shi J', 'Chen Y', 'Jiang M', 'Gao L', 'Huang W', 'Jing Y', 'Huang S', 'Liu A', 'Hu Z', 'Liu D', 'Wang L', 'Nervi C', 'Dai Y', 'Zhang MQ', 'Yu L']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6782-7473', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6872-2665']","['Department of Haematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Nankai University School of Medicine, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Bioinformatics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Haematology, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Bioinformatics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Medico-Surgical Sciences and Biotechnologies, University of Rome ""La Sapienza"" Polo Pontino, Latina, Italy.', 'Cancer Centre, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.', 'Key Laboratory of Bioinformatics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China liyu301@vip.163.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,EMBO Mol Med,EMBO molecular medicine,101487380,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MIRN383 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (THAP10 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Carcinogenesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down-Regulation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein/*metabolism']",PMC5577530,2017/05/26 06:00,2018/03/13 06:00,['2017/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['emmm.201607180 [pii]', '10.15252/emmm.201607180 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO Mol Med. 2017 Jul;9(7):933-949. doi: 10.15252/emmm.201607180.,['NOTNLM'],"['* AML1-ETO', '* THAP10', '* miR-383', '*epigenetics', '*t(8;21) AML']",,['(c) 2017 The Authors.

CD7 is a transmembrane protein highly expressed in acute T-cell leukemia (T-ALL) and in a subset of peripheral T-cell lymphomas. Normal expression of CD7 is largely confined to T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, reducing the risk of off-target-organ toxicity. Here, we show that the expression of a CD7-specific CAR impaired expansion of transduced T cells because of residual CD7 expression and the ensuing fratricide. We demonstrate that targeted genomic disruption of the CD7 gene prevented this fratricide and enabled expansion of CD7 CAR T cells without compromising their cytotoxic function. CD7 CAR T cells produced robust cytotoxicity against malignant T-cell lines and primary tumors and were protective in a mouse xenograft model of T-ALL. Although CD7 CAR T cells were also toxic against unedited (CD7(+)) T and NK lymphocytes, we show that the CD7-edited T cells themselves can respond to viral peptides and therefore could be protective against pathogens. Hence, genomic disruption of a target antigen overcomes fratricide of CAR T cells and establishes the feasibility of using CD7 CAR T cells for the targeted therapy of T-cell malignancies.","['Gomes-Silva, Diogo', 'Srinivasan, Madhuwanti', 'Sharma, Sandhya', 'Lee, Ciaran M', 'Wagner, Dimitrios L', 'Davis, Timothy H', 'Rouce, Rayne H', 'Bao, Gang', 'Brenner, Malcolm K', 'Mamonkin, Maksim']","['Gomes-Silva D', 'Srinivasan M', 'Sharma S', 'Lee CM', 'Wagner DL', 'Davis TH', 'Rouce RH', 'Bao G', 'Brenner MK', 'Mamonkin M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9615-3735', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7178-8163']","['Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', ""Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", 'Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Bioengineering and Institute for Bioengineering and Biosciences, Instituto Superior Tecnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', ""Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", 'Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', ""Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", 'Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, TX; and.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', ""Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", 'Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, TX; and.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', ""Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", 'Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, TX; and.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', ""Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", 'Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', ""Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", 'Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA126752/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20170524,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD7/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/*transplantation', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",PMC5520470,2017/05/26 06:00,2017/08/17 06:00,['2017/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33186-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-01-761320 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Jul 20;130(3):285-296. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-01-761320.

This study aims to screen the preadolescents and adolescents more at risk in their self-esteem perception and schooling difficulties post-five years from the end of therapy. Twenty-five paediatric ex-patients healed from leukaemia were recruited at the Haematology-Oncologic Clinic (University of Padua). The mean age of the children was 13.64 years (Standard Deviation (SD)) = 3.08, range = 10-19 years), most were treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (84%) and relatively equally distributed by gender. They filled in the Multidimensional Self-Esteem Test, while parents completed a questionnaire on their child's schooling. Global self-esteem was mostly below the 50 percentile (58.5%), especially regarding interpersonal relationships (75%). An independent sample t-test showed significant mean differences on the emotionality scale (t = 2.23; degree of freedom (df) = 24; p = 0.03) and in the bodily experience scale (t = 3.02; df = 24; p = 0.006) with survivors of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) having lower scores. An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed significant mean differences in the bodily experience scale (F = 12.31; df = 2, p = 0.0001) depending on the survivors' assigned risk band. The parent reports showed that 43.5% of children had difficulties at school. Childhood AML survivors with a high-risk treatment were more at risk in their self-esteem perceptions. Preventive interventions focusing on self-esteem and scholastic wellbeing are suggested in order to help their return to their normal schedules.","['Tremolada, Marta', 'Taverna, Livia', 'Bonichini, Sabrina', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Pillon, Marta']","['Tremolada M', 'Taverna L', 'Bonichini S', 'Basso G', 'Pillon M']",,"['Department of Developmental and Social Psychology, University of Padua, Padua 35131, Italy. marta.tremolada@unipd.it.', 'Faculty of Education, Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, Brixen-Bressanone 39042, Italy.

Its receptor, Flt3, is expressed on myeloid, lymphoid and dendritic cell progenitors and is considered an important growth and differentiation factor for several hematopoietic lineages. Activating mutations of Flt3 are frequently found in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and associated with a poor clinical prognosis. In the present review we provide an overview of our current knowledge on the role of FL in the generation of blood cell lineages. We examine recent studies on Flt3 expression by hematopoietic stem cells and its potential instructive action at early stages of hematopoiesis. In addition, we review current findings on the role of mutated FLT3 in leukemia and the development of FLT3 inhibitors for therapeutic use to treat AML. The importance of mouse models in elucidating the role of Flt3-ligand in normal and malignant hematopoiesis is discussed.","['Tsapogas, Panagiotis', 'Mooney, Ciaran James', 'Brown, Geoffrey', 'Rolink, Antonius']","['Tsapogas P', 'Mooney CJ', 'Brown G', 'Rolink A']",,"['Developmental and Molecular Immunology, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Mattenstrasse 28, Basel 4058, Switzerland. panagiotis.tsapogas@unibas.ch.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edbgaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK. c.mooney@smd15.qmul.ac.uk.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edbgaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK. g.brown@bham.ac.uk.', 'Institute of Clinical Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edbgaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK. g.brown@bham.ac.uk.', 'Developmental and Molecular Immunology, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Mattenstrasse 28, Basel 4058, Switzerland. antonius.rolink@unibas.ch.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170524,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Discovery', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC5485939,2017/05/26 06:00,2018/03/10 06:00,['2017/05/25 06:00'],"['2017/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms18061115 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms18061115 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2017 May 24;18(6). pii: ijms18061115. doi: 10.3390/ijms18061115.,['NOTNLM'],"['Flt3', 'Flt3 with internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD)', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'cytokines', 'hematopoiesis']",['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One hundred twenty-one parents of 99 survivors of pediatric ALL completed surveys regarding perceptions of obesity risk in survivors. Eighty percent of parents of overweight and obese survivors correctly identified their child as ""a little overweight"" or ""overweight."" Few parents recalled discussing weight gain (21%) or obesity risk (36%) with their practitioner. Parents that did recall having these discussions and/or reported a decreased level of posttherapy activity in their child were more likely to be concerned about their child's weight status.

Despite containing the same DNA-binding domain, the two fusion proteins display distinct binding patterns, show differences in gene expression and chromatin landscape, and are dependent on different transcription factors. RUNX1-EVI1 directs a stem cell-like transcriptional network reliant on GATA2, whereas that of RUNX1-ETO-expressing cells is more mature and depends on RUNX1. However, both types of AML are dependent on the continuous expression of the fusion proteins.

These mutations correlate with decreased overall survival, but sensitize the respective CTCL cells towards MEK-inhibition-induced apoptosis which represents a promising novel therapeutic target in CTCL. Here, we show that the multi-kinase inhibitor Sorafenib induces apoptosis in NRAS-mutated CTCL cells. CTCL cell lines and to a minor extent primary T cells from Sezary patients without NRAS mutations are also affected by Sorafenib-induced apoptosis suggesting a sensitizing role of NRAS mutations for Sorafenib-induced apoptosis. When combining Sorafenib with the established CTCL medication Vorinostat we detected an increase in cell death sensitivity in CTCL cells. The combination treatment acted synergistically in apoptosis induction in both non-mutant and mutant CTCL cells. Mechanistically, this synergistic apoptosis induction by Sorafenib and Vorinostat is based on the downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, but not of other Bcl-2 family members. Taken together, these findings suggest that Sorafenib in combination with Vorinostat represents a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of CTCL patients.","['Kiessling, Michael K', 'Nicolay, Jan P', 'Schlor, Tabea', 'Klemke, Claus-Detlev', 'Suss, Dorothee', 'Krammer, Peter H', 'Gulow, Karsten']","['Kiessling MK', 'Nicolay JP', 'Schlor T', 'Klemke CD', 'Suss D', 'Krammer PH', 'Gulow K']",,"['German Cancer Research Center, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Current address: Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospital of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'German Cancer Research Center, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Venerology and Allergology, University Medical Center Mannheim, Ruprecht Karls University of Heidelberg, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Venerology and Allergology, University Medical Center Mannheim, Ruprecht Karls University of Heidelberg, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Venerology and Allergology, University Medical Center Mannheim, Ruprecht Karls University of Heidelberg, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Current address: Department of Dermatology, Venerology and Allergology, General Hospital Karlsruhe, 76187 Karlsruhe, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (NRAS protein, human)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', '*Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Sorafenib', 'Vorinostat']",PMC5542218,2017/05/26 06:00,2018/04/12 06:00,['2017/05/25 06:00'],"['2017/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['17669 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.17669 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jul 11;8(28):45687-45697. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.17669.,['NOTNLM'],"['RAS mutation', 'T cell lymphoma', 'kinase', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'targeted therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: - To survey physicians describing their current practice of test ordering in the diagnosis of AL. DESIGN: - In anticipation of a guideline by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and the American Society for Hematology on laboratory testing needed for the initial workup of AL, a baseline survey was designed by an expert panel from CAP. Members of professional societies were asked to describe their current practice of test ordering. RESULTS: - Two hundred ninety-four responses were received with 258 respondents analyzed after the first qualifying survey question regarding initial diagnosis of AL. One hundred seventy-six of 249 respondents (70.7%) were board-certified hematopathologists. Flow cytometry and karyotype analysis were routinely performed for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (99.1% [232 of 234] and 96.2% [225 of 234], respectively) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (98.3% [229 of 233] and 96.6% [225 of 233], respectively). In addition, fluorescence in situ hybridization studies were routinely performed by 81.2% (190 of 234) of respondents for AML and 85.0% (198 of 233) of respondents for ALL; other molecular studies were performed by 78.2% (183) for AML and 54.9% (128) for ALL; immunohistochemistry by 44.9% (105) for AML and 47.6% (111) for ALL; and cytochemistry by 24.8% (58) for AML and 14.2% (33) for ALL.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum and bone marrow miR-4262 expression were investigated in 186 AML patients and 115 healthy normal controls by using Real-time PCR. Associations between miR-4262 expressions and various clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed. Overall survival and relapse-free survival were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed using the Cox proportional hazard analysis. RESULTS: Expression levels of miR-4262 in the bone marrow and serum of AML patients were both significantly higher than those in healthy controls (both p<0.01). Moreover, increased miR-4262 expression was significantly associated with FAB classification (p=0.001) and cytogenetics (p=0.001). Patients with high miR-4262 expression had poorer overall survival time and relapse-free survival time than those with low miR-4262 expression. Finally, multivariate analysis identified high miR-4262 expression as an independent prognostic factor for AML (p<0.001).

Enhanced cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis lead to hemocytes accumulation. Fas/FasL signaling pathway promotes cell apoptosis. This study investigated the impact of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) on chronic myelogenous leukemia cell proliferation and apoptosis to elucidate its interaction with Fas/FasL signaling pathway. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Leukemia K562 cells were routinely cultivated and treated with 10 U/ml, 100 U/ml, and 1000 U/ml interferon for 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h, respectively. MTT assay was applied to test cell proliferation. TUNEL assay was adopted to determine cell apoptosis. Western blot was selected to detect Fas/FasL expression. RESULTS: Different concentrations of IFN-gamma inhibited cell proliferation at various time points. IFN-gamma at 1000 U/ml treatment for 48 h exhibited the strongest suppressive effect on cell proliferation (p < 0.05). IFN-gamma intervention enhanced K562 cell apoptosis with concentration and time dependence (p < 0.05). Fas and FasL proteins expressions upregulated after treated by IFN-gamma following dose elevation and time extension (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: IFN-gamma inhibits leukemia K562 cell proliferation and promotes cell apoptosis via facilitating Fas and FasL proteins expressions.","['Xia, H-L', 'Li, C-J', 'Hou, X-F', 'Zhang, H', 'Wu, Z-H', 'Wang, J']","['Xia HL', 'Li CJ', 'Hou XF', 'Zhang H', 'Wu ZH', 'Wang J']",,"['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Chaohu Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Chaohu, Anhui, China. hailongxiaqqw2@163.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Fas Ligand Protein/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",,2017/05/26 06:00,2018/08/09 06:00,['2017/05/25 06:00'],"['2017/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/09 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2017 May;21(9):2244-2248.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: We piloted a survey exploring patient-reported outcomes for people with AML in first complete remission (CR1) to determine whether patients felt the survey is relevant to their well-being and to summarize patient characteristics. DESIGN/MEASUREMENTS: Cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample of AML patients in CR1 assessing QOL and functioning (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] QLQ-C30 v 3.0), well-being (QOL-cancer survivor [QOL-CS]), fatigue (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue [FACIT-Fatigue]), and anxiety and depression (hospital anxiety and depression scale [HADS]). The survey contained five open-ended questions. RESULTS: Eighteen patients completed the survey. Most felt it was completely or mostly relevant (88.8%) in describing their QOL. Participants scored well on the EORTC QLQ-C30, fatigue being the most common symptom (83%).The FACIT-Fatigue mean score was 28.7 and median score was 33.5 (normal >/=30). Two scored in the abnormal range for anxiety and one for depression on the HADS. On the QOL-CS, participants scored more than 6 out of 10 in most domains, except the subscales of distress and fear. CONCLUSIONS: The survey content and length were appropriate. Patients reported ongoing fatigue, fears of future test results, getting a second cancer, and recurrence of cancer. Survivors experience ongoing symptoms, highlighting the importance of providers performing ongoing symptom and needs assessments.","['Cheng, M Jennifer', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Hourigan, Christopher S', 'Gojo, Ivana', 'Pratz, Keith W', 'Blackford, Amanda L', 'Mehta, Ambereen K', 'Smith, Thomas J']","['Cheng MJ', 'Smith BD', 'Hourigan CS', 'Gojo I', 'Pratz KW', 'Blackford AL', 'Mehta AK', 'Smith TJ']",,"['1 Pain and Palliative Care Service, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health , Bethesda, Maryland.', '2 Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Johns Hopkins Hospital , Baltimore, Maryland.', '3 Myeloid Malignancies Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute , Baltimore, Maryland.', '2 Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Johns Hopkins Hospital , Baltimore, Maryland.', '2 Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Johns Hopkins Hospital , Baltimore, Maryland.', '4 Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore, Maryland.', '1 Pain and Palliative Care Service, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health , Bethesda, Maryland.', '5 Program in Palliative Medicine and Department of Medical Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Johns Hopkins Hospital , Baltimore, Maryland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170524,United States,J Palliat Med,Journal of palliative medicine,9808462,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States', 'Young Adult']",PMC5672616,2017/05/26 06:00,2018/06/27 06:00,['2017/05/25 06:00'],"['2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jpm.2017.0069 [doi]'],ppublish,J Palliat Med. 2017 Nov;20(11):1267-1273. doi: 10.1089/jpm.2017.0069.

The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) signaling pathway is one of the key aberrant intracellular axes involved in AML. Areas covered: mTOR plays a critical role in sensing and responding to environmental determinants such as nutrient availability, stress, and growth factor concentrations; and in modulating key cellular functions such as proliferation, metabolism, and survival. Although abnormalities of mTOR signaling are strongly associated with neoplastic leukemic proliferation, the role of pharmacologic inhibitors of mTOR in the treatment of AML has not been established. Expert opinion: Inhibition of mTOR signaling has in general modest growth-inhibitory effects in preclinical AML models and clinical trials. Yet, combination of allosteric mTOR inhibitors with standard chemotherapy or targeted agents has a greater anti-leukemia efficacy. In turn, dual mTORC1/2 inhibitors, and dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors show greater activity in pre-clinical AML models. Further, understanding the role of mTOR signaling in stemness of leukemias is important because AML stem cells may become chemoresistant by displaying aberrant signaling molecules, modifying epigenetic mechanisms, and altering the components of the bone marrow microenvironment.","['Tabe, Yoko', 'Tafuri, Agostino', 'Sekihara, Kazumasa', 'Yang, Haeun', 'Konopleva, Marina']","['Tabe Y', 'Tafuri A', 'Sekihara K', 'Yang H', 'Konopleva M']",,"['a Department of Next Generation Hematology Laboratory Medicine , Juntendo University School of Medicine , Tokyo , Japan.', 'b Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia , The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'c Dipartimento di Medicina Clinica e Molecolare , ""Sapienza"" University of Rome , Rome , Italy.', 'd Leading Center for the Development and Research of Cancer Medicine , Juntendo University School of Medicine , Tokyo , Japan.', 'd Leading Center for the Development and Research of Cancer Medicine , Juntendo University School of Medicine , Tokyo , Japan.', 'b Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia , The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170609,England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,2017/05/26 06:00,2017/07/01 06:00,['2017/05/25 06:00'],"['2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14728222.2017.1333600 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2017 Jul;21(7):705-714. doi: 10.1080/14728222.2017.1333600.

To find genetic conditions that may lead to the development of postchemotherapy infections, the genomes of 12 children with acute leukemia who had severe infectious complications during therapy were examined. At the same time, the coding regions of 17 genes involved in the regulation of the immune response were determined by massive parallel sequencing. The analysis revealed 39 nonsynonymous SNPs that lead to amino acid substitutions, including the following informative genetic markers: PTPN22 c.1858C>T (rs2476601), TLR4 c.896A>G (rs4986790) and TLR4 c.1196C>T (rs4986791), IL7R c.197T>C (rs1494555) and IL7R c.412G>A (rs1494558). The results of massive parallel sequencing were validated by Sanger sequencing. The identification of genetic markers associated with the predisposition to infectious complications may allow one to assess the individual risk of the severe infection development in children with acute leukemia during the treatment with chemotherapeutic agents and to begin the development of personalized approaches to anticancer therapy.","['Avdonina, M A', 'Abramov, I S', 'Ammour, Y I', 'Nasedkina, T V']","['Avdonina MA', 'Abramov IS', 'Ammour YI', 'Nasedkina TV']",,"['Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 119991 Russia.', 'marysheilaus@gmail.com.', 'Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 119991 Russia.', 'Rogachev Federal Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, 119117 Russia.', 'Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 119991 Russia.']",['rus'],,['Journal Article'],,Russia (Federation),Mol Biol (Mosk),Molekuliarnaia biologiia,0105454,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', '*Alleles', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Infections/etiology/*genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia/*genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",,2017/05/26 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2017/05/25 06:00'],"['2015/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7868/S0026898417020045 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol (Mosk). 2017 Mar-Apr;51(2):301-307. doi: 10.7868/S0026898417020045.,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'immune system genes', 'polymorphism', 'targeted sequencing']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This model is a simplified version of the model we proposed in Clapp et al. (Cancer Res 75:4053-4062, 2015). Our simplification is based on the observation that certain key characteristics of the dynamics of CML can be captured with a three-compartment model: two for the leukemic cells (stem cells and mature cells) and one for the immune response. We characterize the existence of steady states and their stability for generic forms of immunosuppressive effects of leukemic cells. We provide a complete co-dimension one bifurcation analysis. Our results show how clinical response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors treatment is compatible with the existence of a stable low disease, treatment-free steady state.","['Besse, Apollos', 'Clapp, Geoffrey D', 'Bernard, Samuel', 'Nicolini, Franck E', 'Levy, Doron', 'Lepoutre, Thomas']","['Besse A', 'Clapp GD', 'Bernard S', 'Nicolini FE', 'Levy D', 'Lepoutre T']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2972-4857'],"['Univ Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5208, Institut Camille Jordan, 43 blvd. du 11 novembre 1918, F-69622, Villeurbanne cedex, France. apollos.besse@inria.fr.', 'INRIA, Villeurbanne, France. apollos.besse@inria.fr.', 'Department of Mathematics, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, USA.', 'Univ Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5208, Institut Camille Jordan, 43 blvd. du 11 novembre 1918, F-69622, Villeurbanne cedex, France.', 'INRIA, Villeurbanne, France.', 'Hematology Department 1G, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Pierre Benite, France.', 'INSERM U1052 Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Mathematics and Center for Scientific Computation and Mathematical Modeling (CSCAMM), University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, USA.', 'Univ Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5208, Institut Camille Jordan, 43 blvd. du 11 novembre 1918, F-69622, Villeurbanne cedex, France.', 'INRIA, Villeurbanne, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20170523,United States,Bull Math Biol,Bulletin of mathematical biology,0401404,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Autoimmunity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Mathematical Concepts', '*Models, Immunological', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors']",,2017/05/26 06:00,2019/04/10 06:00,['2017/05/25 06:00'],"['2016/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11538-017-0272-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s11538-017-0272-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Bull Math Biol. 2018 May;80(5):1084-1110. doi: 10.1007/s11538-017-0272-7.

To identify the mechanism of SDF-1 signaling in the migration of T-ALL, Jurkat acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells were used. Results showed that SDF-1 induces Jurkat cell migration by F-actin redistribution and assembly, which is dependent on Rho activity. SDF-1 induced RhoA and RhoC activation, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which was inhibited by Rho inhibitor. The Rho-dependent ROS production led to subsequent cytoskeleton redistribution and assembly in the process of migration. Additionally, RhoA and RhoC were involved in SDF-1-induced Jurkat cell migration. Taken together, we found a SDF-1/CXCR4-RhoA and RhoC-ROS-cytoskeleton pathway that regulates Jurkat cell migration in response to SDF-1.

Data mining is a powerful tool used to identify novel LDAs from whole genome. LRRC25 (leucine rich repeat-containing 25) was predicted to have a role in the function of myeloid cells by a large-scale ""omics"" data analysis. Further experimental validation showed that LRRC25 is highly expressed in primary myeloid cells, such as granulocytes and monocytes, and lowly/intermediately expressed in B cells, but not in T cells and almost all NK cells. It was down-regulated in multiple acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and bone marrow cells of AML patients and up-regulated after all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-mediated granulocytic differentiation in AML cell lines and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; AML-M3, FAB classification) cells. Localization analysis showed that LRRC25 is a type I transmembrane molecule. Although ectopic LRRC25 did not promote spontaneous differentiation of NB4 cells, knockdown of LRRC25 by siRNA or shRNA and knockout of LRRC25 by the CRISPR-Cas9 system attenuated ATRA-induced terminal granulocytic differentiation, and restoration of LRRC25 in knockout cells could rescue ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation. Therefore, LRRC25, a potential leukocyte differentiation antigen, is a key regulator of ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation.","['Liu, Weili', 'Li, Ting', 'Wang, Pingzhang', 'Liu, Wanchang', 'Liu, Fujun', 'Mo, Xiaoning', 'Liu, Zhengyang', 'Song, Quansheng', 'Lv, Ping', 'Ruan, Guorui', 'Han, Wenling']","['Liu W', 'Li T', 'Wang P', 'Liu W', 'Liu F', 'Mo X', 'Liu Z', 'Song Q', 'Lv P', 'Ruan G', 'Han W']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9548-4524'],"['Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology (Ministry of Health), Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Peking University Center for Human Disease Genomics, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology (Ministry of Health), Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Peking University Center for Human Disease Genomics, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology (Ministry of Health), Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Peking University Center for Human Disease Genomics, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology (Ministry of Health), Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Peking University Center for Human Disease Genomics, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology (Ministry of Health), Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Peking University Center for Human Disease Genomics, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology (Ministry of Health), Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Peking University Center for Human Disease Genomics, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology (Ministry of Health), Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Peking University Center for Human Disease Genomics, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology (Ministry of Health), Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Peking University Center for Human Disease Genomics, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology (Ministry of Health), Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Peking University Center for Human Disease Genomics, Beijing, 100191, China.', ""Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, 100044, China."", 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology (Ministry of Health), Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China. hanwl@bjmu.edu.cn.', 'Peking University Center for Human Disease Genomics, Beijing, 100191, China. hanwl@bjmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170523,Germany,Protein Cell,Protein & cell,101532368,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (LRRC25 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,"['Antigens, Differentiation/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/cytology/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",PMC6107485,2017/05/26 06:00,2019/07/28 06:00,['2017/05/25 06:00'],"['2017/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13238-017-0421-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s13238-017-0421-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Protein Cell. 2018 Sep;9(9):785-798. doi: 10.1007/s13238-017-0421-7.

Recently, a number of agents have been developed to target various components of the BCR pathway. One such target is Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), a Tec family kinase member found near the cell membrane that is involved in upstream BCR signaling. The biological function of BTK in several B-cell lymphoid malignancies has led to the development of the oral BTK inhibitor ibrutinib. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), ibrutinib has demonstrated durable clinical responses in relapsed/refractory (R/R) patients, including those with the high-risk del(17p) cytogenetic abnormality. These findings have paved the way for trials evaluating ibrutinib in previously untreated CLL patients, and also in combination with chemoimmunotherapy or other novel agents. Durable clinical responses have also been demonstrated in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) patients treated with ibrutinib. Ibrutinib is generally well tolerated, although current follow-up remains short and patients of advanced age are more likely to discontinue treatment for toxicity. Treatment-specific side effects such as bleeding and atrial fibrillation may, at least partly, be related to off-target inhibition of non-BTK kinases. Studies evaluating other potential indications for BTK inhibition are ongoing, including in post-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients for whom ibrutinib may be effective in modulating graft-versus-host disease. Combination trials of ibrutinib with venetoclax, a Bcl-2 inhibitor, are underway and are supported by sound preclinical rationale. Several next-generation BTK inhibitors are under development with the goal of decreasing treatment-related toxicity and resistance.","['Aw, Andrew', 'Brown, Jennifer R']","['Aw A', 'Brown JR']",,"['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ottawa Hospital, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.', 'CLL Center and Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, 450 Brookline Avenue, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.

Rearrangements of the mixed-lineage leukaemia (MLL) gene producing abnormal fusion proteins are the most frequent genetic/molecular findings in infant B cell-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. In small epidemiological studies, mother/foetus exposures to some chemicals including pesticides have been associated with infant leukaemia; however, the strength of evidence and power of these studies are weak at best. Experimental in vitro or in vivo models do not sufficiently recapitulate the human disease and regulatory toxicology studies are unlikely to capture this kind of hazard. Here, we develop an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) based substantially on an analogous disease-secondary acute leukaemia caused by the topoisomerase II (topo II) poison etoposide-and on cellular and animal models. The hallmark of the AOP is the formation of MLL gene rearrangements via topo II poisoning, leading to fusion genes and ultimately acute leukaemia by global (epi)genetic dysregulation. The AOP condenses molecular, pathological, regulatory and clinical knowledge in a pragmatic, transparent and weight of evidence-based framework. This facilitates the interpretation and integration of epidemiological studies in the process of risk assessment by defining the biologically plausible causative mechanism(s). The AOP identified important gaps in the knowledge relevant to aetiology and risk assessment, including the specific embryonic target cell during the short and spatially restricted period of susceptibility, and the role of (epi)genetic features modifying the initiation and progression of the disease. Furthermore, the suggested AOP informs on a potential Integrated Approach to Testing and Assessment to address the risk caused by environmental chemicals in the future.","['Pelkonen, Olavi', 'Terron, Andrea', 'Hernandez, Antonio F', 'Menendez, Pablo', 'Bennekou, Susanne Hougaard']","['Pelkonen O', 'Terron A', 'Hernandez AF', 'Menendez P', 'Bennekou SH']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2132-3864'],"['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology and Clinical Research Unit, University of Oulu, Aapistie 5 B, POB5000, 90014, Oulu, Finland. olavi.pelkonen@oulu.fi.', 'European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), Parma, Italy.', 'University of Granada School of Medicine, Granada, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute and Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red en Cancer del ISCIII (CIBERONC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'The Danish EPA, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170523,Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Pesticides)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['*Adverse Outcome Pathways', 'Animals', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etoposide/toxicity', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Pesticides/*toxicity', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/chemically induced/*etiology/genetics', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/toxicity']",,2017/05/26 06:00,2018/04/13 06:00,['2017/05/25 06:00'],"['2017/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00204-017-1986-x [doi]', '10.1007/s00204-017-1986-x [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2017 Aug;91(8):2763-2780. doi: 10.1007/s00204-017-1986-x.

METHODS: Patients with initially diagnosed acute myeloid (AML) or lymphocytic (ALL) leukemia and a matched healthy control (HC) group were included. The oral investigation comprised inspection of the oral mucosa; the decayed (D), missing (M), and filled (F) teeth (DMF-T) index; and a detailed periodontal status. Subgingival biofilm samples were analyzed (polymerase chain reaction) for the presence of selected potentially periodontal pathogenic bacteria. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test, chi-squared test, and Mann-Whitney U test (significance level alpha = 5%). RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients with leukemia (AML 26, ALL 13) and 38 HCs were included. Oral mucosal findings were present in 62% of L compared to 0% of HC patients, whereby gingival hyperplasia was the most detected finding. Furthermore, a higher caries prevalence in leukemia patients was shown (D value 3.64 +/- 3.98 vs. 0.72 +/- 1.72, p < 0.01). The periodontal parameters were poorer in leukemia patients. No substantial differences in microbiological findings of selected bacteria were detected within L group and between L and HC patients. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of oral diseases supports the demand of an early and consequent dental treatment of leukemia patients, especially considering subsequent therapy.","['Busjan, Rilana', 'Hasenkamp, Justin', 'Schmalz, Gerhard', 'Haak, Rainer', 'Trumper, Lorenz', 'Ziebolz, Dirk']","['Busjan R', 'Hasenkamp J', 'Schmalz G', 'Haak R', 'Trumper L', 'Ziebolz D']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9810-2368'],"['Dept. of Cariology, Endodontology and Periodontology, University of Leipzig, Liebigstr. 10-14, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Clinic for Hematology and Medical Oncology, University of Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany.', 'Dept. of Cariology, Endodontology and Periodontology, University of Leipzig, Liebigstr. 10-14, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Dept. of Cariology, Endodontology and Periodontology, University of Leipzig, Liebigstr. 10-14, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Clinic for Hematology and Medical Oncology, University of Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany.', 'Dept. of Cariology, Endodontology and Periodontology, University of Leipzig, Liebigstr. 10-14, 04103, Leipzig, Germany. dirk.ziebolz@medizin.uni-leipzig.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20170523,Germany,Clin Oral Investig,Clinical oral investigations,9707115,,,"['Adult', 'Biofilms', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'DMF Index', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*complications', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Diseases/*epidemiology', '*Oral Health', 'Periodontal Index', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,2017/05/26 06:00,2018/09/05 06:00,['2017/05/25 06:00'],"['2017/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00784-017-2127-x [doi]', '10.1007/s00784-017-2127-x [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Oral Investig. 2018 Jan;22(1):411-418. doi: 10.1007/s00784-017-2127-x.

RESULTS: The overall response rate (ORR) in patients with a 17p- was 56.9%, and patients with a high percentage of 17p- (defined as more than 25% of cells harbouring a 17p-) had a lower ORR. The median overall survival (OS) in patients with a 17p- was 78.0 months, which was significantly shorter than the OS in patients without this genetic abnormality (median 162.0 months, P<0.001). Within the subgroup with a 17p-, the progression-free survival was significantly shorter in patients at Binet stage B-C and patients with elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), B symptoms, unmutatedIGHV and a high percentage of 17p-. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that patients with a 17p- CLL have a variable prognosis that might be predicted using simple clinical and laboratory characteristics.","['Li, Heng', 'Xiong, Wenjie', 'Liu, Huimin', 'Yi, Shuhua', 'Yu, Zhen', 'Liu, Wei', 'Lyu, Rui', 'Wang, Tingyu', 'Zou, Dehui', 'Li, Zengjun', 'Qiu, Lugui']","['Li H', 'Xiong W', 'Liu H', 'Yi S', 'Yu Z', 'Liu W', 'Lyu R', 'Wang T', 'Zou D', 'Li Z', 'Qiu L']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Chin J Cancer Res,Chinese journal of cancer research = Chung-kuo yen cheng yen chiu,9315242,,,,PMC5422418,2017/05/26 06:00,2017/05/26 06:01,['2017/05/25 06:00'],"['2017/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2017.02.09 [doi]', 'cjcr-29-2-lizengjun [pii]']",ppublish,Chin J Cancer Res. 2017 Apr;29(2):156-165. doi: 10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2017.02.09.,['NOTNLM'],"['17p deletion', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', 'del17p in CLL', 'fluorescentin situ hybridization (FISH)']",['Conflicts of Interest: The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, most prospective and retrospective studies did not reveal an overall survival (OS) benefit associated with ATG. Homozygosity for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-C group 1 killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor ligands (KIR-L), i.e. C1/1 KIR-L status, was recently shown to be a risk factor for severe aGVHD. Congruously, we have previously reported favorable outcomes in C1/1 recipients after ATG-based transplants in a monocentric analysis. Here, within an extended cohort, we test the hypothesis that incorporation of ATG for GVHD prophylaxis may improve survival particularly in HSCT recipients with at least one C1 KIR-ligand. Retrospectively, 775 consecutive allogeneic (excluding haploidentical) HSCTs were analyzed, including peripheral blood and bone marrow grafts for adults with hematological diseases at two Austrian HSCT centers. ATG-Fresenius/Grafalon, Thymoglobuline, and alemtuzumab were applied in 256, 87, and 7 transplants, respectively (subsequently summarized as ""ATG""), while 425 HSCT were performed without ATG. Median follow-up of surviving patients is 48 months. Adjusted for age, disease-risk, HLA-match, donor and graft type, sex match, cytomegalovirus serostatus, conditioning intensity, and type of post-grafting GVHD prophylaxis, Cox regression analysis of the entire cohort (n = 775) revealed a significant association of ATG with decreased non-relapse mortality (NRM) (risk ratio (RR), 0.57; p = 0.001), and overall mortality (RR, 0.71; p = 0.014). Upon stratification for HLA-C KIR-L, the greatest benefit for ATG emerged in C1/1 recipients (n = 291), by reduction of non-relapse (RR, 0.34; p = 0.0002) and overall mortality (RR, 0.50; p = 0.003). Less pronounced, ATG decreased NRM (RR, 0.60; p = 0.036) in HLA-C group 1/2 recipients (n = 364), without significantly influencing overall mortality (RR, 0.70; p = 0.065). After exclusion of higher-dose ATG-based transplants, serotherapy significantly improved both NRM (RR, 0.54; p = 0.019; n = 322) and overall mortality (RR, 0.60; p = 0.018) in C1/2 recipients as well. In both, C1/1 (RR, 1.70; p = 0.10) and particularly in C1/2 recipients (RR, 0.94; p = 0.81), there was no statistically significant impact of ATG on relapse incidence. By contrast, in C2/2 recipients (n = 121), ATG neither reduced NRM (RR, 1.10; p = 0.82) nor overall mortality (RR, 1.50; p = 0.17), but increased the risk for relapse (RR, 4.38; p = 0.02). These retrospective findings suggest ATG may provide a survival benefit in recipients with at least one C1 group KIR-L, by reducing NRM without significantly increasing the relapse risk.","['Clausen, Johannes', 'Bohm, Alexandra', 'Strassl, Irene', 'Stiefel, Olga', 'Buxhofer-Ausch, Veronika', 'Machherndl-Spandl, Sigrid', 'Konig, Josef', 'Schmidt, Stefan', 'Steitzer, Hansjorg', 'Danzer, Martin', 'Kasparu, Hedwig', 'Weltermann, Ansgar', 'Nachbaur, David']","['Clausen J', 'Bohm A', 'Strassl I', 'Stiefel O', 'Buxhofer-Ausch V', 'Machherndl-Spandl S', 'Konig J', 'Schmidt S', 'Steitzer H', 'Danzer M', 'Kasparu H', 'Weltermann A', 'Nachbaur D']",,"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Elisabethinen Hospital, 4020 Linz, Austria. johannes.clausen@ordensklinikum.at.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Elisabethinen Hospital, 4020 Linz, Austria. alexaboehm@yahoo.de.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Elisabethinen Hospital, 4020 Linz, Austria. irene.strassl@ordensklinikum.at.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Elisabethinen Hospital, 4020 Linz, Austria. olga.stiefel@ordensklinikum.at.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Elisabethinen Hospital, 4020 Linz, Austria. veronika.buxhofer-ausch@ordensklinikum.at.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Elisabethinen Hospital, 4020 Linz, Austria. sigrid.machherndl-spandl@ordensklinikum.at.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Elisabethinen Hospital, 4020 Linz, Austria. josef.koenig@ordensklinikum.at.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical University, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria. stefan.schmidt@i-med.ac.at.', 'Austrian Red Cross, Transfusion Service for Upper Austria, 4020 Linz, Austria. hansjoerg.steitzer@o.roteskreuz.at.', 'Austrian Red Cross, Transfusion Service for Upper Austria, 4020 Linz, Austria. martin.danzer@o.roteskreuz.at.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Elisabethinen Hospital, 4020 Linz, Austria. hedwig.kasparu@ordensklinikum.at.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Elisabethinen Hospital, 4020 Linz, Austria. ansgar.weltermann@ordensklinikum.at.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical University, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria. david.nachbaur@i-med.ac.at.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170328,Switzerland,Biomedicines,Biomedicines,101691304,,,,PMC5489799,2017/05/26 06:00,2017/05/26 06:01,['2017/05/25 06:00'],"['2017/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/26 06:01 [medline]']","['biomedicines5020013 [pii]', '10.3390/biomedicines5020013 [doi]']",epublish,Biomedicines. 2017 Mar 28;5(2). pii: biomedicines5020013. doi: 10.3390/biomedicines5020013.,['NOTNLM'],"['HLA-C', 'KIR ligand', 'antithymocyte globulin', 'graft-versus-host disease', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor', 'serotherapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

28536306,NLM,MEDLINE,20180619,20180620,1557-3265 (Electronic) 1078-0432 (Linking),23,17,2017 Sep 1,Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia with Mutated IGHV4-34 Receptors: Shared and Distinct Immunogenetic Features and Clinical Outcomes.,5292-5301,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-16-3100 [doi],"Purpose: We sought to investigate whether B cell receptor immunoglobulin (BcR IG) stereotypy is associated with particular clinicobiological features among chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients expressing mutated BcR IG (M-CLL) encoded by the IGHV4-34 gene, and also ascertain whether these associations could refine prognostication.Experimental Design: In a series of 19,907 CLL cases with available immunogenetic information, we identified 339 IGHV4-34-expressing cases assigned to one of the four largest stereotyped M-CLL subsets, namely subsets #4, #16, #29 and #201, and investigated in detail their clinicobiological characteristics and disease outcomes.Results: We identified shared and subset-specific patterns of somatic hypermutation (SHM) among patients assigned to these subsets. The greatest similarity was observed between subsets #4 and #16, both including IgG-switched cases (IgG-CLL). In contrast, the least similarity was detected between subsets #16 and #201, the latter concerning IgM/D-expressing CLL. Significant differences between subsets also involved disease stage at diagnosis and the presence of specific genomic aberrations. IgG subsets #4 and #16 emerged as particularly indolent with a significantly (P < 0.05) longer time-to-first-treatment (TTFT; median TTFT: not yet reached) compared with the IgM/D subsets #29 and #201 (median TTFT: 11 and 12 years, respectively).Conclusions: Our findings support the notion that BcR IG stereotypy further refines prognostication in CLL, superseding the immunogenetic distinction based solely on SHM load. In addition, the observed distinct genetic aberration landscapes and clinical heterogeneity suggest that not all M-CLL cases are equal, prompting further research into the underlying biological background with the ultimate aim of tailored patient management.

We demonstrate in animal models that experimental systemic immune activation alters the bone marrow stromal microenvironment, disarranging extracellular matrix (ECM) microarchitecture, with downregulation of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) and collagen-I and induction of complement activation. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in Treg frequency and by an increase in activated effector T cells. Under these conditions, hematopoietic precursors harboring nucleophosmin-1 (NPM1) mutation generated myeloid cells unfit for normal hematopoiesis but prone to immunogenic death, leading to neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. NET fostered the progression of the indolent NPM1-driven myeloproliferation toward an exacerbated and proliferative dysplastic phenotype. Enrichment in NET structures was found in the bone marrow of patients with autoimmune disorders and in NPM1-mutated acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients. Genes involved in NET formation in the animal model were used to design a NET-related inflammatory gene signature for human myeloid malignancies. This signature identified two AML subsets with different genetic complexity and different enrichment in NPM1 mutation and predicted the response to immunomodulatory drugs. Our results indicate that stromal/ECM changes and priming of bone marrow NETosis by systemic inflammatory conditions can complement genetic and epigenetic events towards the development and progression of myeloid malignancy.

Disruption of RUNX1 activity has been implicated in the development of hematopoietic neoplasms. Chromosomal translocations involving the RUNX1 gene are associated with several types of leukemia, including acute myeloid leukemia driven by a leukemogenic fusion protein RUNX1-RUNX1T1. Previous studies have shown that RUNX1 is an unstable protein and is subjected to proteolytic degradation mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. However, the precise mechanisms of RUNX1 ubiquitination have not been fully understood. Furthermore, much less is known about the mechanisms to regulate the stability of RUNX1-RUNX1T1. In this study, we identified several RUNX1-interacting E3 ubiquitin ligases using a novel high-throughput binding assay. Among them, we found that STUB1 bound to RUNX1 and induced its ubiquitination and degradation mainly in the nucleus. Immunofluorescence analyses revealed that the STUB1-induced ubiquitination also promoted nuclear export of RUNX1, which probably contributes to the reduced transcriptional activity of RUNX1 in STUB1-overexpressing cells. STUB1 also induced ubiquitination of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and down-regulated its expression. Importantly, STUB1 overexpression showed a substantial growth-inhibitory effect in myeloid leukemia cells that harbor RUNX1-RUNX1T1, whereas it showed only a marginal effect in other non-RUNX1-RUNX1T1 leukemia cells and normal human cord blood cells. Taken together, these data suggest that the E3 ubiquitin ligase STUB1 is a negative regulator of both RUNX1 and RUNX1-RUNX1T1. Activation of STUB1 could be a promising therapeutic strategy for RUNX1-RUNX1T1 leukemia.","['Yonezawa, Taishi', 'Takahashi, Hirotaka', 'Shikata, Shiori', 'Liu, Xiaoxiao', 'Tamura, Moe', 'Asada, Shuhei', 'Fukushima, Tsuyoshi', 'Fukuyama, Tomofusa', 'Tanaka, Yosuke', 'Sawasaki, Tatsuya', 'Kitamura, Toshio', 'Goyama, Susumu']","['Yonezawa T', 'Takahashi H', 'Shikata S', 'Liu X', 'Tamura M', 'Asada S', 'Fukushima T', 'Fukuyama T', 'Tanaka Y', 'Sawasaki T', 'Kitamura T', 'Goyama S']",,"['Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639.', 'Proteo-Science Center (PROS), Ehime University, 3 Bunkyo-cho, Matsuyama, Ehime 790-8577, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639.', 'Proteo-Science Center (PROS), Ehime University, 3 Bunkyo-cho, Matsuyama, Ehime 790-8577, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639.

Genetic rearrangements involving KMT2A gene are frequently involved in lymphoid, myeloid and mixed lineage leukemia. One of its rare fusion partners, the mastermind like 2 (MAML2) gene has been reported in four cases of myeloid neoplasms after chemotherapy so far: two acute myeloid leukemias (AML) and two myelodysplasic syndrome (MDS), and two cases of secondary T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report the case of a KMT2A - MAML2 fusion discovered by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis in front of an inv11 (q21q23) present in a 47-year-old female previously treated for a sarcoma in 2014, who had a B acute lymphoid leukemia (B ALL). CONCLUSION: It is, to our knowledge, the first case of B acute lymphoblastic leukemia with this fusion gene. At the molecular level, two rearrangements were detected using RNA sequencing juxtaposing exon 7 to exon 2 and exon 9 to intron 1-2 of the KMT2A and MAML2 genes respectively, and one rearrangement using Sanger sequencing juxtaposing exon 8 and exon 2.","['Menu, Estelle', 'Beaufils, Nathalie', 'Usseglio, Fabrice', 'Balducci, Estelle', 'Lafage Pochitaloff, Marina', 'Costello, Regis', 'Gabert, Jean']","['Menu E', 'Beaufils N', 'Usseglio F', 'Balducci E', 'Lafage Pochitaloff M', 'Costello R', 'Gabert J']",,"['Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, University Hospital Nord, Marseille, France.

N-BLR is a primate-specific long non-coding RNA that modulates the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, facilitates cell migration, and increases colorectal cancer invasion. RESULTS: We performed multivariate analyses of data from two independent cohorts of colorectal cancer patients and show that the abundance of N-BLR is associated with tumor stage, invasion potential, and overall patient survival. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments we found that N-BLR facilitates migration primarily via crosstalk with E-cadherin and ZEB1. We showed that this crosstalk is mediated by a pyknon, a short ~20 nucleotide-long DNA motif contained in the N-BLR transcript and is targeted by members of the miR-200 family. In light of these findings, we used a microarray to investigate the expression patterns of other pyknon-containing genomic loci. We found multiple such loci that are differentially transcribed between healthy and diseased tissues in colorectal cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Moreover, we identified several new loci whose expression correlates with the colorectal cancer patients' overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: The primate-specific N-BLR is a novel molecular contributor to the complex mechanisms that underlie metastasis in colorectal cancer and a potential novel biomarker for this disease. The presence of a functional pyknon within N-BLR and the related finding that many more pyknon-containing genomic loci in the human genome exhibit tissue-specific and disease-specific expression suggests the possibility of an alternative class of biomarkers and therapeutic targets that are primate-specific.","['Rigoutsos, Isidore', 'Lee, Sang Kil', 'Nam, Su Youn', 'Anfossi, Simone',

In this study, we quantified and compared the stabilities of retroviral [murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based] and lentiviral [human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-based] vectors pseudotyped with relatively mechanically stable envelope proteins, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoproteins (VSVGs), and the influenza virus WSN strain envelope proteins against ultracentrifugation. Lentiviral genomic and functional particles were more stable than the corresponding retroviral particles against ultracentrifugation when pseudotyped with VSVGs. However, both retroviral and lentiviral particles were unstable when pseudotyped with the influenza virus WSN strain envelope proteins. Therefore, the stabilities of pseudotyped retroviral and lentiviral vectors against ultracentrifugation process are a function of not only the type of envelope proteins, but also the type of viral internal core (MLV or HIV-1 core). In addition, the fraction of functional viral particles among genomic viral particles greatly varied at times during packaging, depending on the type of envelope proteins used for pseudotyping and the viral internal core.","['Kim, Soo-Hyun', 'Lim, Kwang-Il']","['Kim SH', 'Lim KI']",,"[""Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Korea."", ""Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Korea.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170502,Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,"['0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (NA protein, influenza A virus)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)']",IM,"['Genetic Vectors/*chemistry/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus/genetics', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/genetics', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Neuraminidase/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', '*Ultracentrifugation', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics', 'Viral Proteins/genetics', 'Virion/chemistry']",PMC5463042,2017/05/26 06:00,2018/03/22 06:00,['2017/05/25 06:00'],"['2017/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/12 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['molcells.2017.0043 [pii]', '10.14348/molcells.2017.0043 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cells. 2017 May 31;40(5):339-345. doi: 10.14348/molcells.2017.0043.

However, there is comparatively little data on transfusion associated characteristics in this patient cohort. We therefore retrospectively analyzed transfusion requirements and clinical outcomes of 184 patients with myloid neoplasms treated with azacitidine at the Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, which were included in the Austrian Registry of Hypomethylating Agents. The mean blood component requirements for AML, MDS and CMML were 39.8, 67.4 and 31.4 RBC units and 31.7, 27.6 and 19.1 platelet (PLT) units respectively. In spite of an extended and stringent RBC unit matching policy (ABO, RhD, RhCcEe and K antigens), 20 (11%) patients formed at least one alloantibody (""allo-group""), whereas 164 patients (89%) did not (""non-allo-group""). The most frequent antibody specificity was anti-E, followed by anti-Wra -Lua, -D, -C and -Jka. Alloimmunization was associated with higher numbers of transfused RBC units (68 vs. 38; p=0.001), as well as with longer time under transfusion (16.7 vs. 9.4 months; p=0.014).

For cancer diagnosed in children in age groups 0-14 years and 15-19 years, the odds ratios for each 5-year increase in maternal age were 1.05 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.07) and 1.14 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.19), respectively. Having an older father also conferred an increased risk, with an odds ratio for each 5-year increase of 1.03 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.05) for cancer diagnosed at ages 0-19 years and 1.03 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.05) for cancer diagnosed at ages 0-14 years. While advancing maternal age increased risk of leukemia and central nervous system tumors, older paternal age was not associated with risk of either type.

METHODS: We used a Cox model with familially structured random effects to assess 16 mortality end points in a group of 1850 mice in 47 families maintained in a circular-breeding scheme, exposed to accelerated Si or Fe ions (0.4 Gy) or (137)Cs gamma rays (3 Gy). RESULTS: There is periodicity in the effect of familial relatedness, which is most pronounced for pulmonary adenoma, Harderian-gland adenoma, Harderian-gland tumour, ectodermal tumour, pulmonary adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (P=0.0001/0.0003/0.0017/0.0035/0.0257/0.0340, respectively) with families that are 3-4 generations apart most strongly correlated; myeloid leukaemia also exhibited a striking periodic correlation structure. The relative risks of high-energy Si or Fe ions are not significantly different and are less than for (137)Cs gamma-rays for most end points at the doses used. CONCLUSIONS: There is periodicity in the effect of familial relatedness for various cancer sites. The effects per unit dose of high-energy charged particle beams are no higher than ninefold those of lower-energy gamma radiation.","['Chernyavskiy, Pavel', 'Edmondson, Elijah F', 'Weil, Michael M', 'Little, Mark P']","['Chernyavskiy P', 'Edmondson EF', 'Weil MM', 'Little MP']",,"['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-9778, USA.', 'Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.', 'Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Fort Detrick, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.', 'Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-9778, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170523,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/etiology/genetics/mortality', 'Adenoma/etiology/genetics/mortality', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/etiology/genetics/mortality', 'Gamma Rays/*adverse effects', 'Harderian Gland', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/genetics/mortality', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/etiology/genetics/mortality', 'Lung Neoplasms/etiology/genetics/mortality', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/etiology/*genetics/mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*genetics/mortality', 'Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary/etiology/genetics/mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Sebaceous Gland Neoplasms/etiology/genetics/mortality']",PMC5520205,2017/05/24 06:00,2017/08/29 06:00,['2017/05/24 06:00'],"['2017/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/12 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['bjc2017141 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2017.141 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2017 Jun 27;117(1):41-50. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2017.141.

The prevalence is sufficiently high that prophylactic treatment is routinely given to this sanctuary site in order to eradicate occult disease that might otherwise lead to a relapse. A lumbar puncture should be routinely performed in all newly diagnosed patients with ALL. The risks of CNS leukemia vary by phenotype and genotype. Preventive treatment of the CNS during post-remission therapy has become an integral part of all current ALL treatment protocols. Most treatment regimens combine multiple doses of intrathecal chemotherapy with high-dose systemic methotrexate and/or cytarabine. Cranial irradiation is less commonly used for prophylaxis but is still the most effective treatment for overt CNS leukemia. Recurrences within the CNS usually coincide with or predict soon afterwards for systemic relapse in the marrow and blood.,"['Larson, Richard A']",['Larson RA'],,"['a Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, and Comprehensive Cancer Center , The University of Chicago , Chicago , IL , USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170523,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*secondary/*therapy', 'Chemoprevention', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2017/05/24 06:00,2018/08/01 06:00,['2017/05/24 06:00'],"['2017/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2017.1326597 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2018 Jan;59(1):3-13. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2017.1326597.

Methods CSF status was designated as follows: CNS1, no blasts; CNS2a to 2c, < 5 WBCs/muL and blasts with/without >/= 10 RBCs/muL or >/= 5 WBCs/muL plus blasts, with WBCs >/= 5 times the number of RBCs; CNS3a to 3c, >/= 5 WBCs/muL plus blasts with/without >/= 10 RBCs/muL or clinical signs of CNS disease. CNS2 status did not affect therapy; patients with CNS3 status received two extra intrathecal treatments during induction and augmented postinduction therapy with 18 Gy of cranial radiation. Results Among 8,379 evaluable patients enrolled from 2004 to 2010, 7,395 (88.3%) had CNS1 status; 857 (10.2%), CNS2; and 127 (1.5%), CNS3. The 5-year event-free and overall survival rates were, respectively, 85% and 92.7% for CNS1, 76% and 86.8% for CNS2, and 76% and 82.1% for CNS3 ( P < .001). In multivariable analysis that included age, race/ethnicity, initial WBC, and day-29 minimal residual disease < 0.1%, CSF blast, regardless of cell count, was an independent adverse predictor of outcome for patients with standard- or high-risk disease according to National Cancer Institute criteria. The EFS difference reflected a significant difference in the incidence of CNS, not marrow, relapse in patients with CNS1 versus CNS2 and/or CNS3 status. Conclusion Low levels of CNS leukemia, regardless of RBCs, predict inferior outcome and higher rates of CNS relapse. These data suggest that additional augmentation of CNS-directed therapy is warranted for CNS2 disease.","['Winick, Naomi', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Chen, Si', 'Maloney, Kelly', 'Larsen, Eric', 'Mattano, Leonard', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Carroll, Andrew', 'Gastier-Foster, Julie M', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Willman, Cheryl', 'Wood, Brent', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Raetz, Elizabeth', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Carroll, William L']","['Winick N', 'Devidas M', 'Chen S', 'Maloney K', 'Larsen E', 'Mattano L', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Carroll A', 'Gastier-Foster JM', 'Heerema NA', 'Willman C', 'Wood B', 'Loh ML', 'Raetz E', 'Hunger SP', 'Carroll WL']",,"[""Naomi Winick, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX; Meenakshi Devidas and Si Chen, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; Kelly Maloney, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, CO; Eric Larsen, Maine Children's Cancer Program, Scarborough, ME; Leonard Mattano, HARP Pharma Consulting, Mystic, CT; Michael J.

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-MEG3 is an important tumor suppressor in various cancers. The present study investigated the potential role of maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) in the progression of T-LBL. Suppressed expression of MEG3 was detected in T-LBL tissues compared with adjacent histologically normal tissues. Down-regulated level of MEG3 was also found in three T-LBL cell lines (CCRF-CEM, Jurkat and SUP-T1) compared with human T-cell line H9. The proliferation of T-LBL cells was inhibited and cell apoptosis rate was largely promoted when MEG3 was upregulated by a lentiviral vector. Further research revealed that microRNA (miRNA)-214 is a direct target of MEG3. The expression of miR-214 was increased in T-LBL tissues and cell lines compared with control groups. Besides, decreased level of miR-214 was elevated adding miR-214 mimic in SUP-T1 cells transfected with LncRNA-MEG3. Similarly, upregulated level of miR-214 was downregulated adding miR-214 inhibitor in SUP-T1 cells transfected with MEG3 siRNA. Luciferase activity assay further confirmed the targeting relationship between MEG3 and miR-214. Moreover, AIFM2 protein was predicted as a target of miR-214. The expression of AIFM2 was increased by MEG3 and was downregulated by miR-214 mimic. miRNA-214 reversed the effect of MEG3 on inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in SUP-T1 cells. Moreover, relative expression of AIFM2 had a positive correlation with the expression of MEG3 and was negatively affected by miR-214. In vivo, MEG3 effectively suppressed tumor growth and the expression of proliferation markers Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Taken together, our research revealed that MEG3 worked as an anti-oncogene in T-LBL, and the MEG3-miR-214-AIFM2 pathway regulated the growth of T-LBL, providing potential prognosis markers as well as new potential targets for T-LBL treatment.","['Fan, Fang-Yi', 'Deng, Rui', 'Yi, Hai', 'Sun, Hao-Ping', 'Zeng, Yan', 'He, Guang-Cui', 'Su, Yi']","['Fan FY', 'Deng R', 'Yi H', 'Sun HP', 'Zeng Y', 'He GC', 'Su Y']",,"['Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Cell Immunotherapy Center, Chengdu Military General Hospital of PLA, Chengdu, Sichuan 610083, P.R.

The risk of initial infection and subsequent complications are directly related to the depth and duration of neutropenia. Recent genome-wide association studies identified variants in DARC and CXCL2 genes, and in ORMDL3-GSDMA-CSF3 locus on chromosome 17q21 that influence white blood cell and neutrophil counts in healthy individuals. To investigate whether polymorphisms in these loci in conjunction with chemotherapy may modulate risk of treatment complications, we analyzed 21 SNPs across these genes for an association with chemotherapy-related neutropenia and infection in 286 Caucasian children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. After correction for multiple testing, DARC polymorphism rs3027012 in 5'-UTR was associated with higher risk of low absolute phagocyte count (APC<500 and <1000 cells per microliter, P=0.001 and P<0.0005, respectively) and hospitalization due to febrile neutropenia (P=0.002). Protective effect was instead seen for DARC rs12075 A to G substitution (P=0.004). The SNP rs3859192 in the GSDMA were associated with hospitalization due to infection (P=0.004); infection was also modulated in the additive manner by the CXCL2 rs16850408 (P=0.002). This study shows for the first time that the variations in DARC, GSDMA and CXCL2 genes may play a role in the onset of chemotherapy complications.","['Glisovic, S J', 'Pastore, Y D', 'Gagne, V', 'Plesa, M', 'Laverdiere, C', 'Leclerc, J M', 'Sinnett, D', 'Krajinovic, M']","['Glisovic SJ', 'Pastore YD', 'Gagne V', 'Plesa M', 'Laverdiere C', 'Leclerc JM', 'Sinnett D', 'Krajinovic M']",,"['Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research /International'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170523,United States,Pharmacogenomics J,The pharmacogenomics journal,101083949,"['0 (ACKR1 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CXCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL2)', '0 (Duffy Blood-Group System)', '0 (GSDMA protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/blood', 'Chemokine CXCL2/genetics', 'Child', 'Duffy Blood-Group System/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count/trends', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neutropenia/blood/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/physiology', 'Pharmacogenomic Variants/drug effects/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics']",,2017/05/24 06:00,2019/03/12 06:00,['2017/05/24 06:00'],"['2016/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/23 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['tpj201716 [pii]', '10.1038/tpj.2017.16 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacogenomics J. 2018 Apr;18(2):270-274. doi: 10.1038/tpj.2017.16.

METHODS: Six phytochemical extracts, namely petroleum ether extract (PEE), chloroform extract (CE), ethyl acetate extract (EAE), n-butanol extract (BE), the remainder after extraction (RE) and water extract (WE) from each plant were prepared. These 60 extracts were screened for their cytotoxicity on the aforementioned cell lines using MTT assay. RESULTS: All plant species showed certain anticancer activity against at least one of the 4 cancer cell lines and obvious selective cytotoxicities were observed. Compared with Huh-7 and HeLa cells, MCF-7 and BALL-1 cells were more sensitive to the treatments of the phytochemical extracts. The PEE, CE and EAE of Brassica campestris, the PE and CE of Hibiscus syriacus, as well as the BE of Pittosporum tobira exhibited strong anticancer activity but weak cytotoxicity on the normal cell line.

Supplementation of >2000 IU/day of Vitamin D in early low-risk CLL patients is able to delay disease progression and postpone the moment of initiation of the first treatment. The doses of both vitamin D and EGCG were shown to be safe in older patients. Vitamin D, EGCG and Curcumin, either as monotherapy or in combination, have additive and synergistic effects with conventional chemotherapy. Further observations have identified the improvement of response to rituximab-fludarabine-cyclophosphamide (R-FC) therapy with concomitant administration of statin and aspirin combination in relapsed/refractory CLL. Finally, high dose dexamethasone with 40mg/m(2)/day for 4 days, every 28 days, either alone or with monoclonal antibody, might be used as a salvage therapy or for debulking before transplantation in refractory/resistant cases. Dexamethasone therapy is followed by transient response and high rate of infections, but fluid retention and other toxicities are lower compared to high dose methylprednisolone schedules. The low cost therapeutics discussed in this review could not be a substitute for the more effective targeted therapies, but their use in every day practice might postpone the need for early implementation of new and costly medications.","['Marjanovic, Goran']",['Marjanovic G'],,"['Clinic of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Clinical Center Nis and Medical Faculty, University of Nis, Nis, Serbia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,"['0 (Tea)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*economics', 'Salvage Therapy/*economics/methods', 'Tea/chemistry', 'Vitamin D/therapeutic use']",,2017/05/24 06:00,2019/07/03 06:00,['2017/05/24 06:00'],"['2017/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2017 Mar-Apr;22(2):288-294.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated changes in laboratory parameters and immunopharmacodynamic markers in patients who received blinatumomab in the exploratory phase II study. METHODS: Data from 36 adults with relapsed/refractory ALL receiving blinatumomab as 4-week continuous IV infusions in various dose cohorts were analyzed for changes in liver enzymes, first-dose parameters, peripheral blood cell subpopulations, and cytokine/granzyme B release. Associations with clinical response were evaluated. RESULTS: Liver enzymes and inflammatory parameters transiently increased primarily during the first treatment week without clinical symptoms and reversed to baseline levels thereafter. B and T cells showed expected depletion and redistribution kinetics, respectively. Similarly, thrombocytes and T cells displayed an initial decline in cell counts, whereas neutrophils peaked during the first days after infusion start. T-cell redistribution coincided with upregulation of LFA-1 and CD69. Patients who responded to blinatumomab had more pronounced T-cell expansion, which was associated with proliferation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and memory subsets. Release of cytokines and granzyme B primarily occurred during the first week of cycle 1, except for IL-10, which was released in subsequent cycles. Blinatumomab step-dosing was associated with lower cytokine release and lower body temperature. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of relapsed/refractory ALL, blinatumomab-induced changes in laboratory parameters were transient and reversible. The evaluated PD markers demonstrated blinatumomab activity, and the analysis of cytokines supported the rationale for stepwise dosing.

Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes contributes to the occurrence and development of certain types of cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The current study aimed to assess the contribution of chemotherapy-induced NDRG4 changeable methylation to the development of AML. A total of 30 patients (13 males and 17 females) were involved in the present study. The DNA methylation levels of five C-phosphate-G sites of the NDRG4 gene were measured using bisulfite pyrosequencing techniques. The results indicated significantly reduced gene-body methylation levels of NDRG4 during chemotherapy (prior to chemotherapy: 9.35+/-4.22%; following chemotherapy: 7.54+/-3.11%; P=0.030). Further analysis of AML subtypes revealed the methylation reductions were principally contributed by patients with M2 subtype AML (prior to chemotherapy: 9.91+/-4.76%; following chemotherapy: 5.26+/-1.16%; P=0.038). A significant association was also observed between the patient age and the altered levels of NDRG4 gene-body methylation in patients with M2 subtype AML (r=0.761; P=0.047), suggesting that reductions in induced-methylation may be age-dependent in patients with M2 subtype AML during chemotherapy. Therefore, age may affect the induced methylation levels of NDRG4 gene-body in patients with AML (particularly patients with M2 subtype AML) during chemotherapy.","['Hong, Qingxiao', 'Chen, Xiaoying', 'Ye, Huadan', 'Wu, Xiaodong', 'Wang, Xuejing', 'Kong, Lingyan', 'Xia, Yongming', 'Duan, Shiwei']","['Hong Q', 'Chen X', 'Ye H', 'Wu X', 'Wang X', 'Kong L', 'Xia Y', 'Duan S']",,"['Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Pathophysiology, School of Medicine, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang 315211, P.R.

Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) is a routinely performed screening technique to identify BCR-ABL1 fusion genes, but a limitation of this method is its inability to recognize novel fusions that have not been previously characterized. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an effective and sensitive detection method for the determination of novel BCR-ABL1 fusion genes as well as previously characterized ones. The oncoprotein tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL1 is a constitutively active kinase involved in the activation of a number of signaling pathways, and it has been the therapeutic target for tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib. Reports have presented opposing viewpoints about the effect of the disrupted Src homology 3 (SH3) domain on TKI efficacy. FINDINGS: We here report that using NGS we identified a novel BCR-ABL1 fusion gene with breakpoints in the BCR intron 14 and the ABL1 intron 2, leading to partial deletion of its SH3 domain. In the present case, the patient received targeted therapy with the TKI imatinib at 400 mg/day and no adverse reaction was reported. The patient eventually entered remission with decreased proliferation of karyocytes and granulocytes. We also identified mutations in genes, including TP53, FLT3, ASXL1, SETBP1, CEBPA and CBL, that seemed to have an influence on the outcome of TKI therapy targeting the BCR-ABL1 protein. CONCLUSIONS: Together with previously reported results, it is clear that the genetic heterogeneity of CML patients significantly affects the presentation of the disease and its progression and therefore should inform the design of the therapeutic strategy.","['Zhou, Fen', 'Jin, Runming', 'Hu, Yu', 'Mei, Heng']","['Zhou F', 'Jin R', 'Hu Y', 'Mei H']",,"['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan, Hubei 430022 China.0000 0004 0368 7223grid.33199.31', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan, Hubei 430022 China.0000 0004 0368 7223grid.33199.31', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan, Hubei 430022 China.0000 0004 0368 7223grid.33199.31', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan, Hubei 430022 China.0000 0004 0368 7223grid.33199.31', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan, Hubei 430022 China.0000 0004 0368 7223grid.33199.31', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan, Hubei 430022 China.0000 0004 0368 7223grid.33199.31']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170519,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,,,PMC5438485,2017/05/24 06:00,2017/05/24 06:01,['2017/05/24 06:00'],"['2017/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13039-017-0322-8 [doi]', '322 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2017 May 19;10:19. doi: 10.1186/s13039-017-0322-8. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'CML', 'Genetic heterogeneity', 'NGS', 'SH3 domain']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such aberrant proteins offer great potential for the treatment of these diseases; however, inhibitors to JAK2 have had limited success in the clinic in terms of curing the disease. To understand the effects of this oncogene in haematopoietic cells with the aim of improving treatment strategies, we undertook a systematic evaluation of the effects of JAK2V617F expression using proteomics. The effects of JAK2V617F on over 5000 proteins and 2000 nuclear phosphopeptide sites were relatively quantified using either SILAC or eight-channel iTRAQ mass spectrometry. Pathway analysis of the proteins identified as changing indicated disruption to the p53 and MYC signalling pathways. These changes were confirmed using orthogonal approaches. The insight gained from this proteomic analysis led to the formation of hypothesis-driven analysis on inhibitor-mediated effects on primary cells from patients with a JAK2V617F mutation. Simultaneous inhibition of MYC and upregulation of p53 led to the preferential extinction of JAK2V617F-positive CD34+ cells, illustrating a potential therapeutic benefit from combined targeting of p53 and MYC.","['Pearson, S', 'Williamson, A J K', 'Blance, R', 'Somervaille, T C P', 'Taylor, S', 'Azadbakht, N', 'Whetton, A D', 'Pierce, A']","['Pearson S', 'Williamson AJK', 'Blance R', 'Somervaille TCP', 'Taylor S', 'Azadbakht N', 'Whetton AD', 'Pierce A']",,"['Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, University of Manchester, Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, University of Manchester, Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, University of Manchester, Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, University of Manchester, Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, University of Manchester, Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, University of Manchester, Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Stoller Biomarker Discovery Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, University of Manchester, Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],['C5759/A12328/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170523,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Cell Line', 'Codon', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Polycythemia Vera/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Proteome', '*Proteomics/methods', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",PMC5729335,2017/05/24 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2017/05/24 06:00'],"['2017/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/06 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017143 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.143 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Dec;31(12):2717-2725. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.143.

However, BCR-ABL-positive progenitors can be detected in CML patients in complete cytogenetic response. Several evidence suggests that CML stem cells are intrinsically resistant to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKI), and therefore they represent the most likely candidate responsible for disease relapse.In this work, we investigated the microRNA (miRNA) expression profile of different subpopulations of CML Leukemic Stem Cells (LSCs): Lin-CD34+CD38- and Lin-CD34-CD38- cells. These cell fractions have been previously shown to be endowed with TKI intrinsic resistance. Our analysis identified 33 common deregulated miRNAs in CML LSCs. Among those, 8 miRNAs were deregulated in CML independently from BCR-ABL kinase activity and therefore are likely to be involved in the BCR-ABL-independent resistance to TKI that characterizes CML LSCs. In particular, the up-regulation of miR-29a-3p and miR-660-5p observed in CML LSCs, led to the down-regulation of their respective targets TET2 and EPAS1 and conferred TKI-resistance to CML LSCs in vitro. On the other hand, miR-494-3p down-regulation in CML LSCs, leading to c-MYC up-regulation, was able to decrease TKI-induced apoptosis. These results demonstrate that aberrant miRNA expression in CML LSCs could contribute to the intrinsic TKI-resistance observed in these cell populations, and support the development of novel therapies aimed at targeting aberrantly regulated miRNAs or their targets in order to effectively eradicate CML LSCs.","['Salati, Simona', 'Salvestrini, Valentina', 'Carretta, Chiara', 'Genovese, Elena', 'Rontauroli, Sebastiano', 'Zini, Roberta', 'Rossi, Chiara', 'Ruberti, Samantha', 'Bianchi, Elisa', 'Barbieri, Greta', 'Curti, Antonio', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Gugliotta, Gabriele', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Bergamaschi, Micaela', 'Tafuri, Agostino', 'Tagliafico, Enrico', 'Lemoli, Roberto', 'Manfredini, Rossella']","['Salati S', 'Salvestrini V', 'Carretta C', 'Genovese E', 'Rontauroli S', 'Zini R', 'Rossi C', 'Ruberti S', 'Bianchi E', 'Barbieri G', 'Curti A', 'Castagnetti F', 'Gugliotta G', 'Rosti G', 'Bergamaschi M', 'Tafuri A', 'Tagliafico E', 'Lemoli R', 'Manfredini R']",,"['Center for Regenerative Medicine, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology ""L. and A.

We show that DPF2 interacts with the acetylated tails of both histones 3 and 4 via bipartite binding pockets on the DPF2 surface. Blocking these interactions through targeted mutagenesis of DPF2 abolishes its recruitment to target chromatin regions as well as its ability to prevent myeloid differentiation in vivo.

High EGFL7 mRNA expression associates with lower complete remission rates, and shorter event-free and overall survival in older (age >/=60 y) and younger (age <60 y) patients with cytogenetically normal AML. We further show that AML blasts secrete EGFL7 protein and that higher levels of EGFL7 protein are found in the sera from AML patients than in sera from healthy controls.

Tlr9 upregulation in cancer cells triggered the selective accumulation of CD11b(+)Ly6G(HI)Ly6C(LO) myeloid cells, phenotypically similar to PMN-MDSCs. The PMN-MDSCs from tetracycline-treated RM9-Tlr9(ON) tumors increased the immunosuppressive activity of the STAT3 transcription factor, thereby more potently inhibiting T cell proliferation. We identified LIF, an IL-6-type cytokine and STAT3 activator, as a potential mediator of crosstalk between TLR9-expressing prostate cancer cells and PMN-MDSCs. Antibody-mediated LIF neutralization reduced the percentage of tumor-infiltrating PMN-MDSCs and inhibited tumor growth in mice. The clinical relevance of LIF is confirmed by the correlation between TLR9 and LIF expression in prostate cancer specimens. Furthermore, blood samples from patients with prostate cancer showed elevated levels of LIF and high LIFR expression on circulating PMN-MDSCs. Our results suggest that TLR9(+) prostate cancers promote immune evasion via LIF-mediated expansion and activation of PMN-MDSCs. Finally, targeting TLR9/LIF/STAT3 signaling using oligonucleotide-based inhibitors, such as CpG-STAT3dODN, can offer new opportunities for prostate cancer immunotherapy.","['Won, Haejung', 'Moreira, Dayson', 'Gao, Chan', 'Duttagupta, Priyanka', 'Zhao, Xingli', 'Manuel, Edwin', 'Diamond, Don', 'Yuan, Yate-Ching', 'Liu, Zheng', 'Jones, Jeremy', ""D'Apuzzo, Massimo"", 'Pal, Sumanta', 'Kortylewski, Marcin']","['Won H', 'Moreira D', 'Gao C', 'Duttagupta P', 'Zhao X', 'Manuel E', 'Diamond D', 'Yuan YC', 'Liu Z', 'Jones J', ""D'Apuzzo M"", 'Pal S', 'Kortylewski M']",,"['Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA; and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA; mkortylewski@coh.org.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA107399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20170522,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Heterografts', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells/*immunology', 'Neutrophils/immunology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/*immunology', 'Tumor Escape/*immunology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/immunology']",PMC5505743,2017/05/24 06:00,2017/09/26 06:00,['2017/05/24 06:00'],"['2016/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.3MA1016-451RR [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.3MA1016-451RR [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2017 Aug;102(2):423-436. doi: 10.1189/jlb.3MA1016-451RR.

METHODS: According to the construction of lentiviral vector LV-OSCK of reprogramming factors (Oct-4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc), 293T cells were transfected to detect virus titer. The endogenous pluripotent genes (Oct4, SOX2, c-Myc and Klf4) and CD34 mRNA and protein expressions were detected by AP staining, immunofluorescence staining, qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Expressions of Oct4, SOX2, c-Myc and Klf4 were 0.220+/-0.013, 0.186+/-0.009, 0.287+/-0.015 and 0.153+/-0.007. These levels were significantly higher in the experimental group than the control and blank groups. CD34 protein expression in the experimental group was also discovered to be significantly higher than the other two groups. CONCLUSION: The reprogramming factors could increase the expressions of pluripotent genes and CD34 gene in HL-60 cells.","['Zhu, Liang-Fang', 'Xiao, Min', 'Chen, Yong-Quan', 'Wang, Ling-Yan', 'Luo, Xiao-Feng', 'Yuan, Xiao-Hong', 'Ren, Jin-Hua', 'Chen, Zhi-Zhe', 'Hu, Jian-Da', 'Yang, Ting']","['Zhu LF', 'Xiao M', 'Chen YQ', 'Wang LY', 'Luo XF', 'Yuan XH', 'Ren JH', 'Chen ZZ', 'Hu JD', 'Yang T']",,"['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350001, PR China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350001, PR China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350001, PR China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350001, PR China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350001, PR China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350001, PR China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350001, PR China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350001, PR China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350001, PR China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350001, PR China.

The results of the present study indicated that targeting telomerase using an oligonucleotide-based molecule against human telomerase RNA template (hTR ASODN) reduced the survival rate of NB4 cells and induced a caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. Our finding was even noticeable in the synergistic experiments, where we found an enhanced reduction in the viability of the cells after short-term treatment with ATO in combination with the inhibitor. The resulting data delineated that short-term treatment of the cells with hTR ASODN either as single agent or in combination with ATO resulted in apoptotic cell death through activation of DNA damage response via up-regulation of p73 and ATM coupled with down-regulation of c-Myc. Moreover, we found that induction of p21 and subsequent disturbance of the death promoter to death repressor genes may contribute to the enhanced growth suppressive effect of the drugs combination. Overall, our findings support the idea that telomerase activity may have pivotal role in attenuating ATO effectiveness and combination of ATO with telomerase inhibitor seems to be a novel promising strategy, which may increase APL cure rates.","['Asghari-Kia, Leila', 'Bashash, Davood', 'Safaroghli-Azar, Ava', 'Momeny, Majid', 'Hamidpour, Mohsen', 'Ghaffari, Seyed H']","['Asghari-Kia L', 'Bashash D', 'Safaroghli-Azar A', 'Momeny M', 'Hamidpour M', 'Ghaffari SH']",,"['Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

It relies heavily on human epidemiology, with support from radiobiology. The scientific underpinnings include NCRP Report No. 136 ('Evaluation of the Linear-Nonthreshold Dose-Response Model for Ionizing Radiation'), UNSCEAR 2000, ICRP Publication 99 (2004) and the National Academies BEIR VII Report (2006). NCRP Scientific Committee 1-25 is reviewing recent epidemiologic studies focusing on dose-response models, including threshold, and the relevance to radiation protection. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Recent studies after the BEIR VII Report are being critically reviewed and include atomic-bomb survivors, Mayak workers, atomic veterans, populations on the Techa River, U.S. radiological technologists, the U.S. Million Person Study, international workers (INWORKS), Chernobyl cleanup workers, children given computerized tomography scans, and tuberculosis-fluoroscopy patients. Methodologic limitations, dose uncertainties and statistical approaches (and modeling assumptions) are being systematically evaluated. RESULTS: The review of studies continues and will be published as an NCRP commentary in 2017. Most studies reviewed to date are consistent with a straight-line dose response but there are a few exceptions. In the past, the scientific consensus process has worked in providing practical and prudent guidance. So pragmatic judgment is anticipated. The evaluations are ongoing and the extensive NCRP review process has just begun, so no decisions or recommendations are in stone. CONCLUSIONS: The march of science requires a constant assessment of emerging evidence to provide an optimum, though not necessarily perfect, approach to radiation protection. Alternatives to the LNT model may be forthcoming, e.g. an approach that couples the best epidemiology with biologically-based models of carcinogenesis, focusing on chronic (not acute) exposure circumstances. Currently for the practical purposes of radiation protection, the LNT hypothesis reigns supreme as the best of the rest, but new epidemiology and radiobiology might change these conclusions.

Blinatumomab is a bispecific T-cell engager, targeting CD19. While blinatumomab's primary clinical use has been in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), there are increasing data for its use in B-lineage lymphomas. Areas covered: The aim of this review is to highlight the clinical data for blinatumomab use in NHL. Herein, the authors provide an overview of blinatumomab, its mechanism of action, its proven efficacy against B-ALL, and its phase I-II data assessing its use in NHL Expert opinion: Blinatumomab has modest activity in phase I-II trials in NHL, and may represent a means of bridging patients with relapsed disease to hematopoietic stem cell transplant. More widespread use is currently hampered by lack of phase III data, multiple competing agents, an onerous administration schedule and significant side effect profile. Further studies are eagerly awaited assessing its use in combination with other immunotherapy strategies.","['Sanders, Sheilagh', 'Stewart, Douglas A']","['Sanders S', 'Stewart DA']",,"[""a Division of Hematology , Queen's University , Kingston , Canada."", 'b Departments of Medicine and Oncology , University of Calgary and Tom Baker Cancer Centre , Calgary , Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170601,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Bispecific/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Half-Life', 'Hematologic Diseases/etiology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy']",,2017/05/24 06:00,2017/11/14 06:00,['2017/05/24 06:00'],"['2017/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14712598.2017.1334053 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2017 Aug;17(8):1013-1017. doi: 10.1080/14712598.2017.1334053.

This study focused on the synthesis of new indole derivatives with thiazolidines and imidazolidine rings condensed as side chains as well as the evaluation of their ability to interact with the DNA and antitumor and topoisomerase inhibition activities. All derivatives were successfully synthesized and their structures were elucidated by mass spectrometry (MS), infrared (IR), spectroscopy (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, COSY (1)H-(1)H and HSQC (1)H-(13)C. The antitumor activity was evaluated against different cancer cell lines using the antiproliferative MTT assay. DNA binding ability was analyzed by absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence technique using ethidium bromide (EB) as a fluorescent probe. Changes were observed in spectroscopic properties of the compounds after interacting with ctDNA (calf thymus DNA), with hypochromic and hyperchromic effects, besides blue or red shifts in the maxima of spectra. The indole derivative 5-(1H-Indol-3-ylmethylene)-thiazolidin-2,4-dione (4c) presented the best results in antitumor assay against the breast line tested (T47D), with IC50 value lower than the positive control, doxorubicin (1.93 and 4.61 muM, respectively). On the other hand, the compound 3-amino-5-(1H-indol-3-ylmethylene)-2-thioxo-thiazolidin-4-one (4a) was active against leukemia cell lines (HL60 and K562) with the high value of the DNA binding constant, Kb of 5.69 x 10(4). However, this compound (4a) did not inhibit the topoisomerase-I activity evaluated by relaxation assay. These results show that the indole nucleus contribute to the incorporation of molecules into the DNA. Moreover, it was highlighted that basic side chains, such as thiazolidines and imidazolidines, and free amino group, are relevant for design of promising antitumor and DNA binding compounds.","['Lafayette, Elizabeth Almeida', 'de Almeida, Sinara Monica Vitalino', 'Cavalcanti Santos, Renata Virginia', 'de Oliveira, Jamerson Ferreira', 'Amorim, Cezar Augusto da Cruz', 'da Silva, Rosali Maria Ferreira', 'Pitta, Maira Galdino da Rocha', 'Pitta, Ivan da Rocha', 'de Moura, Ricardo Olimpio', 'de Carvalho Junior, Luiz Bezerra', 'de Melo Rego, Moacyr Jesus Barreto', 'de Lima, Maria do Carmo Alves']","['Lafayette EA', 'de Almeida SMV', 'Cavalcanti Santos RV', 'de Oliveira JF', 'Amorim CADC', 'da Silva RMF', 'Pitta MGDR', 'Pitta IDR', 'de Moura RO', 'de Carvalho Junior LB', 'de Melo Rego MJB', 'de Lima MDCA']",,"['Departamento de Quimica e Fisica, Centro de Ciencias Agrarias (CCA), Universidade Federal da Paraiba (UFPB), Areia, PB, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Imunopatologia Keizo Asami (LIKA) and Departamento de Bioquimica, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), PE, Brazil; Faculdade de Ciencias, Educacao e Tecnologia de Garanhuns (FACETEG), Universidade de Pernambuco (UPE), Garanhuns, PE, Brazil.

Serum and testes were collected from C57Bl/6 mice at embryonic Day 17 (E17), birth (postnatal Day 0; P0) and daily until P10. Serum FSH and testosterone levels in both serum and testes were analysed and gene expression of FSH receptor (Fshr), luteinising hormone receptor (Lhr), anti-Mullerian hormone (Amh), octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct-4), membrane type 1 metalloprotease (Mt1-mmp), proto-oncogene C-kit and promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger (Plzf ) was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. We found a transient surge of serum and testicular testosterone levels between P1 and P3 and a gradual increase in FSH from P1 to P10. Testis Lhr expression remained low from P0 until P10 but Fshr expression peaked between P3 and P6 (P<0.01). The same was found for Oct-4 expression (a gonocyte marker), which surged between P3 and P6 (P<0.01). Mt1-mmp expression peaked at P3 (P<0.05). The expression pattern of both C-kit and Plzf (SSC markers) was similar with a steady increase from P1 to P10. These results show a transient activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis postnatally with increases in serum and testicular testosterone at P1-P3 and testicular Fshr (but not Lhr) at P3-P6. These changes coincide with increases in gene expression of Oct4, Mt1-mmp, Plzf and C-kit, reflecting gonocyte activation, migration and transformation into SSC. In conclusion, these findings suggest that 'minipuberty' does occur in mice and that gonocyte transformation may be driven by a transient FSH signalling pathway.","['Li, Ruili', 'Vannitamby, Amanda', 'Yue, Sarah S K', 'Handelsman, David', 'Hutson, John']","['Li R', 'Vannitamby A', 'Yue SSK', 'Handelsman D', 'Hutson J']",,"[""F Douglas Stephens Surgical Research Group, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Vic. 3052, Australia."", ""F Douglas Stephens Surgical Research Group, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Vic. 3052, Australia."", ""F Douglas Stephens Surgical Research Group, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Vic. 3052, Australia."", 'Andrology Laboratory, ANZAC Research Institute Concord Hospital, University of Sydney, NSW 2139, Australia.', ""F Douglas Stephens Surgical Research Group, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Vic. 3052, Australia.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Australia,Reprod Fertil Dev,"Reproduction, fertility, and development",8907465,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Receptors, FSH)', '0 (Receptors, LH)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '80497-65-0 (Anti-Mullerian Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)']",IM,"['Adult Germline Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Anti-Mullerian Hormone/genetics/metabolism', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Models, Animal', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Receptors, FSH/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, LH/genetics/metabolism', 'Spermatogonia/*cytology/metabolism', 'Testis/*cytology/metabolism', 'Testosterone/blood/*metabolism']",,2017/05/23 06:00,2018/07/18 06:00,['2017/05/23 06:00'],"['2016/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['RD17100 [pii]', '10.1071/RD17100 [doi]']",ppublish,Reprod Fertil Dev. 2017 Nov;29(12):2430-2436. doi: 10.1071/RD17100.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the long-term risk of SMNs in a well-characterized cohort of 5-year CCSs, with a particular focus on individual chemotherapeutic agents and solid cancer risk. Methods The Dutch Childhood Cancer Oncology Group-Long-Term Effects After Childhood Cancer cohort includes 6,165 5-year CCSs diagnosed between 1963 and 2001 in the Netherlands. SMNs were identified by linkages with the Netherlands Cancer Registry, the Dutch Pathology Registry, and medical chart review. We calculated standardized incidence ratios, excess absolute risks, and cumulative incidences. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to evaluate treatment-associated risks for breast cancer, sarcoma, and all solid cancers. Results After a median follow-up of 20.7 years (range, 5.0 to 49.8 years) since first diagnosis, 291 SMNs were ascertained in 261 CCSs (standardized incidence ratio, 5.2; 95% CI, 4.6 to 5.8; excess absolute risk, 20.3/10,000 person-years). Cumulative SMN incidence at 25 years after first diagnosis was 3.9% (95% CI, 3.4% to 4.6%) and did not change noticeably among CCSs treated in the 1990s compared with those treated earlier. We found dose-dependent doxorubicin-related increased risks of all solid cancers ( Ptrend < .001) and breast cancer ( Ptrend < .001). The doxorubicin-breast cancer dose response was stronger in survivors of Li-Fraumeni syndrome-associated childhood cancers (leukemia, CNS, and non-Ewing sarcoma) versus survivors of other cancers ( Pdifference = .008). In addition, cyclophosphamide was found to increase sarcoma risk in a dose-dependent manner ( Ptrend = .01). Conclusion The results strongly suggest that doxorubicin exposure in CCSs increases the risk of subsequent solid cancers and breast cancer, whereas cyclophosphamide exposure increases the risk of subsequent sarcomas. These results may inform future childhood cancer treatment protocols and SMN surveillance guidelines for CCSs.","['Teepen, Jop C', 'van Leeuwen, Flora E', 'Tissing, Wim J', 'van Dulmen-den Broeder, Eline', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', 'van der Pal, Helena J', 'Loonen, Jacqueline J', 'Bresters, Dorine', 'Versluys, Birgitta', 'Neggers, Sebastian J C M M', 'Jaspers, Monique W M', 'Hauptmann, Michael', 'van der Heiden-van der Loo, Margriet', 'Visser, Otto', 'Kremer, Leontien C M', 'Ronckers, Cecile M']","['Teepen JC', 'van Leeuwen FE', 'Tissing WJ', 'van Dulmen-den Broeder E', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'van der Pal HJ', 'Loonen JJ', 'Bresters D', 'Versluys B', 'Neggers SJCMM', 'Jaspers MWM', 'Hauptmann M', 'van der Heiden-van der Loo M', 'Visser O', 'Kremer LCM', 'Ronckers CM']",,"[""Jop C.

Here we have demonstrated that the antileukemic effect mediated by RUNX1 depletion is highly dependent on a functional p53-mediated cell death pathway. Increased expression of other RUNX family members, including RUNX2 and RUNX3, compensated for the antitumor effect elicited by RUNX1 silencing, and simultaneous attenuation of all RUNX family members as a cluster led to a much stronger antitumor effect relative to suppression of individual RUNX members. Switching off the RUNX cluster using alkylating agent-conjugated pyrrole-imidazole (PI) polyamides, which were designed to specifically bind to consensus RUNX-binding sequences, was highly effective against AML cells and against several poor-prognosis solid tumors in a xenograft mouse model of AML without notable adverse events. Taken together, these results identify a crucial role for the RUNX cluster in the maintenance and progression of cancer cells and suggest that modulation of the RUNX cluster using the PI polyamide gene-switch technology is a potential strategy to control malignancies.","['Morita, Ken', 'Suzuki, Kensho', 'Maeda, Shintaro', 'Matsuo, Akihiko', 'Mitsuda, Yoshihide', 'Tokushige, Chieko', 'Kashiwazaki, Gengo', 'Taniguchi, Junichi', 'Maeda, Rina', 'Noura, Mina', 'Hirata, Masahiro', 'Kataoka, Tatsuki', 'Yano, Ayaka', 'Yamada, Yoshimi', 'Kiyose, Hiroki', 'Tokumasu, Mayu', 'Matsuo, Hidemasa', 'Tanaka, Sunao', 'Okuno, Yasushi', 'Muto, Manabu', 'Naka, Kazuhito', 'Ito, Kosei', 'Kitamura, Toshio', 'Kaneda, Yasufumi', 'Liu, Paul P', 'Bando, Toshikazu', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Sugiyama, Hiroshi', 'Kamikubo, Yasuhiko']","['Morita K', 'Suzuki K', 'Maeda S', 'Matsuo A', 'Mitsuda Y', 'Tokushige C', 'Kashiwazaki G', 'Taniguchi J', 'Maeda R', 'Noura M', 'Hirata M', 'Kataoka T', 'Yano A', 'Yamada Y', 'Kiyose H', 'Tokumasu M', 'Matsuo H', 'Tanaka S', 'Okuno Y', 'Muto M', 'Naka K', 'Ito K', 'Kitamura T', 'Kaneda Y', 'Liu PP', 'Bando T', 'Adachi S', 'Sugiyama H', 'Kamikubo Y']",,"['Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Therapeutic Oncology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Bone Biology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy and Division of Stem Cell Signaling, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Gene Therapy Science, Department of Genome Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Oncogenesis and Development Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170522,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits)', '0 (Nylons)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Nylons/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5490777,2017/05/23 06:00,2017/09/15 06:00,['2017/05/23 06:00'],"['2016/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['91788 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI91788 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2017 Jun 30;127(7):2815-2828. doi: 10.1172/JCI91788.

However, the short half-life of bendamustine may limit its clinical applications. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to design and synthesize compounds with a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile. METHODS: We synthesized a series of hybrid molecules comprising a phenyl N-mustard moiety and benzothiazole or benzimidazole scaffold linked via a urea linker and evaluated their antitumor activity and plasma stability. RESULTS: We revealed that these agents exhibited significant cytotoxicity against a panel of human lymphoblastic leukemia and human solid tumor cells in culture. Human lymphoblastic leukemia CCRM-CEM cells were the most sensitive to the tested compounds. In general, the new hybrids were as potent as cisplatin, but significantly more cytotoxic than bendamustine. Phenyl N-mustard-benzothiazole compound 27d and phenyl N-mustardbenzimidaloe compound 32b possessed significant cytotoxicity and led to apoptotic death in the treated tumor cells. These two agents were able to induce DNA interstrand cross-linking and arrested cell cycle progression at the G2/M phase. Furthermore, we showed that these new hybrids were more chemically stable than bendamustine in rat plasma. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that conjugation of phenyl N-mustard pharmacophore at C6 of benzimidazole or at C8 of the benzothiazole ring via a urea linker is likely an approach to increase the chemical stability and bioavailability. Highlights --> Series of benzimidazoles and benzothiazoles linked to N-mustard were synthesized. --> The newly synthesized derivatives induced DNA interstrand cross-links. --> These derivatives induced cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and triggered apoptosis in H460 cells. --> The new compounds are more cytotoxic than bendamustine. --> The new compounds were chemically more stable than bendamustine in rat plasma.","['Detroja, Dilip', 'Chen, Tai-Lin', 'Lin, Yi-Wen', 'Yen, Tsai-Yi', 'Wu, Ming-Hsi', 'Tsai, Tung-Hu', 'Mehariya, Krunal', 'Kakadiya, Rajesh', 'Lee, Te-Chang', 'Shah, Anamik', 'Su, Tsann-Long']","['Detroja D', 'Chen TL', 'Lin YW', 'Yen TY', 'Wu MH', 'Tsai TH', 'Mehariya K', 'Kakadiya R', 'Lee TC', 'Shah A', 'Su TL']",,"['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei 115.

Early symptoms are not specific, fatigue, pallor, compression signs and bone marrow failure are often mentioned. AIM: To summarize the most frequent early symptoms of childhood malignancies in order to help the physicians in the early recognition. METHOD: In our retrospective study, we processed a period of 5 years between 2012-2016, with an accent on the onset manifestations of malignancies. RESULTS: In this period 34 cases were admitted with a diagnosis of malignant disease to our department. The most important symptoms were fever, fatigue, weight loss, pain, adenopathy, infections, and signs of anemia or thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood acute leukemia mostly occurs with adenopathy, fever, bone pain and signs of anemia. Solid tumors in their early stages may present with fatigue, pain and compression symptoms. The responsibility of the first physician is major in recognizing the most important early signs.

Blockade of immune checkpoints and immune signaling antibodies has shown promise in multiple types of hematologic malignancies (HMs), with dramatic single agent responses for pembrolizumab and nivolumab in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). In this review, we outline the current state of immune checkpoint blockade drug development in HMs, and discuss mechanisms of activity and resistance, and highlight potential targets in the immune tumor microenvironment (TME). Blockade of T-cell checkpoint molecules PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 are the most clinically mature of the immune checkpoint strategies. Novel and upcoming strategies for immune checkpoint blockade drug development in HMs using innovative combinations to modulate immunologic targets shows significant promise as a way to expand the number of patients with blood cancers who could benefit from immunotherapy.","['Pianko, Matthew J', 'Liu, Yuzhou', 'Bagchi, Srishti', 'Lesokhin, Alexander M']","['Pianko MJ', 'Liu Y', 'Bagchi S', 'Lesokhin AM']",,"['Myeloma Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', ""Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai St. Luke's and Mount Sinai West, New York, NY, USA."", 'Myeloma Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Myeloma Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Immunotherapeutics Core, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['UL1 TR000457/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170419,China,Stem Cell Investig,Stem cell investigation,101672113,,,,PMC5420526,2017/05/23 06:00,2017/05/23 06:01,['2017/05/23 06:00'],"['2017/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/sci.2017.03.04 [doi]', 'sci-04-2017.03.04 [pii]']",epublish,Stem Cell Investig. 2017 Apr 19;4:32. doi: 10.21037/sci.2017.03.04. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['Immunotherapy', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'multiple myeloma (MM)', 'tumor microenvironment (TME)']","['Conflicts of Interest: AM Lesokhin: Stock or other ownership: Exelixis, Enumeral;', 'Honoraria: Bristol-Myers Squibb, Janssen Pharmaceuticals (a Johnson & Johnson', 'Co.), Gilead Sciences (I), Novartis; Consulting or advisory role: Bristol-Myers', 'Squibb, Foundation Medicine (Inst), Janssen Pharmaceuticals (a Johnson & Johnson', 'Co.), Novartis, Juno, Aduro; Research funding: Bristol-Myers Squibb (Inst),', 'Janssen Pharmaceuticals (a Johnson & Johnson Co.)

A number of studies highlight the involvement of CREB in the resistance to ionizing radiation (IR) therapy, demonstrating a relationship between IR-induced CREB family members' activation and cell survival. Consistent with these observations, we have recently demonstrated that CREB and ATF-1 are expressed in leukemia cell lines and that low-dose radiation treatment can trigger CREB activation, leading to survival of erythro-leukemia cells (K562). On the other hand, a number of evidences highlight a proapoptotic role of CREB following IR treatment of cancer cells. Since the development of multiple mechanisms of resistance is one key problem of most malignancies, including those of hematological origin, it is highly desirable to identify biological markers of responsiveness/unresponsiveness useful to follow-up the individual response and to adjust anticancer treatments. Taking into account all these considerations, this mini-review will be focused on the involvement of CREB/ATF family members in response to IR therapy, to deepen our knowledge of this topic, and to pave the way to translation into a therapeutic context.","[""D'Auria, Francesca"", 'Centurione, Lucia', 'Centurione, Maria Antonietta', 'Angelini, Antonio', 'Di Pietro, Roberta']","[""D'Auria F"", 'Centurione L', 'Centurione MA', 'Angelini A', 'Di Pietro R']",,"['Department of Cardiac and Vascular Surgery, Campus Bio-Medico University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', ""Department of Medicine and Ageing Sciences, G. d'Annunzio University, Chieti, Italy."", 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, National Research Council-Pavia, Chieti, Italy.', ""Department of Medicine and Ageing Sciences, G. d'Annunzio University, Chieti, Italy."", ""Ageing Research Center, CeSI, G. d'Annunzio University Foundation, Chieti, Italy."", ""Department of Medicine and Ageing Sciences, G. d'Annunzio University, Chieti, Italy.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170505,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC5418225,2017/05/23 06:00,2017/05/23 06:01,['2017/05/23 06:00'],"['2017/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2017.00076 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2017 May 5;7:76. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2017.00076. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA repair', 'cancer', 'cyclic AMP response element binding/activating transcription factor', 'ionizing radiation', 'nuclear transcription factors', 'radio-resistance', 'radio-sensitivity', 'radiotherapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additional mutations potentially cooperating with the translocation fusion product in leukemogenesis have been hitherto unreported in ZBTB16-RARA APL and were sought by application of a next-generation sequencing approach to detect those recurrently found in myeloid malignancies.

At present, no relevant personalized targets have been identified. Sequencing studies have implicated gene alterations of disruptor of telomeric silencing 1 like histone lysine methyltransferase (DOT1L) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. DOT1L is part of the histone modification system and catalyzes methylation of H3K79, which is crucial in cell signaling and DNA damage repair. DOT1L is considered to be a target of therapy in mixed lineage leukemia gene-deficient leukemia cases and a potential target in breast carcinoma. The frequencies and importance of DOT1L copy-number variations and their specific correlation with protein expression in adenocarcinoma of the pancreas have yet to be investigated. In the present study, tissue microarrays of 230 resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma cases were constructed. The tumor tissue was analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry. In total, 10/225 carcinoma cases (4.4%) analyzed by immunohistochemistry demonstrated intense nuclear protein expression of DOT1L and in 9/224 tumors analyzed using FISH (4.0%), copy-number variations (CNV) were detectable. No DOT1L amplification was detected in the carcinoma cohort. To the best of our knowledge, the present study describes for the first time the frequency of CNV of DOT1L using the gold standard fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and their specific correlation to the protein expression in adenocarcinomas of the pancreas. Although the positive cases by immunohistochemistry and copy-number variations by FISH were not congruent with each other, the data suggest a potential role for DOT1L in a small subset of pancreatic cancer cases. The significance of the two analysis methods concerning their druggability in pancreatic adenocarcinoma requires further studies.","['Loeser, Heike', 'Waldschmidt, Dirk', 'Kuetting, Fabian', 'Heydt, Carina', 'Zander, Thomas', 'Plum, Patrick', 'Alakus, Hakan', 'Buettner, Reinhard', 'Quaas, Alexander']","['Loeser H', 'Waldschmidt D', 'Kuetting F', 'Heydt C', 'Zander T', 'Plum P', 'Alakus H', 'Buettner R', 'Quaas A']",,"['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Gastrointestinal Cancer Group Cologne, D-50937 Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Cologne, Gastrointestinal Cancer Group Cologne, D-50937 Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Cologne, Gastrointestinal Cancer Group Cologne, D-50937 Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Gastrointestinal Cancer Group Cologne, D-50937 Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, University of Cologne, Gastrointestinal Cancer Group Cologne, D-50937 Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Visceral Surgery, University of Cologne, Gastrointestinal Cancer Group Cologne, D-50937 Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Visceral Surgery, University of Cologne, Gastrointestinal Cancer Group Cologne, D-50937 Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Gastrointestinal Cancer Group Cologne, D-50937 Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Gastrointestinal Cancer Group Cologne, D-50937 Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170314,England,Mol Clin Oncol,Molecular and clinical oncology,101613422,,,,PMC5432215,2017/05/23 06:00,2017/05/23 06:01,['2017/05/23 06:00'],"['2016/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/mco.2017.1194 [doi]', 'MCO-0-0-1194 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Clin Oncol. 2017 May;6(5):639-642. doi: 10.3892/mco.2017.1194.

Methods: Human myelogenous leukemia cells K562 and their adriamycin-resistance cells K562/ADR were used. The growth curve of cells treated by tuberostemonine and the Non-toxic concentration of tuberostemonine were determined by MTT, Cell apoptosis was determined by MTT and flow cytometry. The expression of MDR1, Survivin and Livin was detected by RT-PCR. The activity of P-gp was detected by flow cytometry. Western blot was used to detect the expression of NF-kappaB and Survivin. Results: The effect of tuberostemonine on K562/ADR showed a dose-dependence, and 350mug/mL and 500mug/mL of tuberostemonine could inhibit the expression of MDR1 (P<0.05). While no function difference of P-gp was detected. With the increased concentration of tuberostemonine, the inhibitory effect were enhanced to the expression of NF-kappaB. Tuberostemonine combined with adriamycin could time-dependently inhibit the cell proliferation (P<0.05) and obviously promoted the cell apoptosis (P<0.05). Also the tuberostemonine could inhibit the expression of Survivin. Conclusion: There are no direct relations between tuberostemonine and P-gp, but tuberostemonine could reverse the multidrug resistance of K562/ADR via down-regulating the expression of Nf-kappaB and inhibiting th1e expression of Survivin.","['Wang, Yu Jia', 'Zhao, Huan Dong', 'Zhu, Cai Feng', 'Li, Jian', 'Xie, Hong Juan', 'Chen, Yu Xiang']","['Wang YJ', 'Zhao HD', 'Zhu CF', 'Li J', 'Xie HJ', 'Chen YX']",,"['Tongren Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai JiaoTong University, 1111 Xianxia Road, Changning District, Shanghai 200336, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Central South University, 172 Tongzipo Road, Changsha 410013, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Nanobiological Technology of Chinese Ministry of Health, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, 78 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410008, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Yanbian University, 977 Park Road, Yanji 133000, China.', 'Hepatobilliary and Enteric Surgery Research Center, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, 78 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410008, China.', 'Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital Corporation. 2699 Gaoke West Road, Pudong New Area, Shanghai, 201204, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Central South University, 172 Tongzipo Road, Changsha 410013, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170409,Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,,,,PMC5436265,2017/05/23 06:00,2017/05/23 06:01,['2017/05/23 06:00'],"['2016/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7150/jca.17688 [doi]', 'jcav08p1103 [pii]']",epublish,J Cancer. 2017 Apr 9;8(6):1103-1112. doi: 10.7150/jca.17688. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['K562/ADR', 'P-glycoprotein', 'apoptosis.', 'multidrug resistance', 'tuberostemonine']",['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human KIR haplotypes comprise genes encoding mainly inhibitory receptors (KIR A) or activating and inhibitory receptors (KIR B). A substantial fraction of humans lack ligands for inhibitory KIRs (iKIRs), that is, a 'missing ligand' genotype. KIR B/x and missing ligand genotypes may thus give rise to potentially autoreactive, unlicensed NK cells. Little is known regarding the impact of such genotypes in untransplanted acute myeloid leukemia (AML). For this study, NK cell phenotypes and KIR/HLA genotypes were determined in 81 AML patients who received immunotherapy with histamine dihydrochloride and low-dose IL-2 for relapse prevention (NCT01347996). We observed that presence of unlicensed NK cells impacted favorably on clinical outcome, in particular among patients harboring functional NK cells reflected by high expression of the natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR) NKp46. Genotype analyses suggested that the clinical benefit of high NCR expression was restricted to patients with a missing ligand genotype and/or a KIR B/x genotype.

Thus, a large number of studies on the cellular characteristics, regulators and molecular details of stem cells have been carried on out of non-represented cells. Niche studies have largely pursued using these purified stem cells and these are largely un-interpretable.

A driver lesion, namely, Janus kinase (JAK)2V617F, calreticulin (CALR) or myeloproliferative leukemia (MPL) gene mutation can be identified in the vast majority of patients. Each of these mutations is associated with distinct clinical features and may modulate the patients' clinical course, risk of complications, including vascular events, and survival. JAK2V617F appears to be a risk-modifying mutation and has been shown to increase the likelihood of thrombotic events in patients with ET across studies. As such, it has been included in prognostic models and its presence may influence treatment decisions. The association of CALR and MPL mutations with the incidence of vascular events has been less clear. Even more limited information is available on the contribution of additional non-driver lesions to the thrombotic risk. In this review we discuss the available evidence on the role of recurrent mutations in the risk of thrombotic complications in patients with ET and how these mutations weigh into modern prognostic scores.","['Falchi, L', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Verstovsek, S']","['Falchi L', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Verstovsek S']",,"['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20170522,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['*Genomics', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*complications/genetics', 'Thrombosis/*etiology/genetics']",PMC5989314,2017/05/23 06:00,2017/09/29 06:00,['2017/05/23 06:00'],"['2017/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/22 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017150 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.150 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Sep;31(9):1845-1854. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.150.

Sclerostin (Scl), an osteocyte-derived inhibitor of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, is elevated in MM patient sera and increased in osteocytes in MM-bearing mice. We show here that genetic deletion of Sost, the gene encoding Scl, prevented MM-induced bone disease in an immune-deficient mouse model of early MM, and that administration of anti-Scl antibody (Scl-Ab) increased bone mass and decreases osteolysis in immune-competent mice with established MM. Sost/Scl inhibition increased osteoblast numbers, stimulated new bone formation and decreased osteoclast number in MM-colonized bone. Further, Sost/Scl inhibition did not affect tumor growth in vivo or anti-myeloma drug efficacy in vitro. These results identify the osteocyte as a major contributor to the deleterious effects of MM in bone and osteocyte-derived Scl as a promising target for the treatment of established MM-induced bone disease. Further, Scl did not interfere with efficacy of chemotherapy for MM, suggesting that combined treatment with anti-myeloma drugs and Scl-Ab should effectively control MM growth and bone disease, providing new avenues to effectively control MM and bone disease in patients with active MM.","['Delgado-Calle, J', 'Anderson, J', 'Cregor, M D', 'Condon, K W', 'Kuhstoss, S A', 'Plotkin, L I', 'Bellido, T', 'Roodman, G D']","['Delgado-Calle J', 'Anderson J', 'Cregor MD', 'Condon KW', 'Kuhstoss SA', 'Plotkin LI', 'Bellido T', 'Roodman GD']",,"['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Roudebush Veterans Administration Medical Center, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Lilly Research Laboratories, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Roudebush Veterans Administration Medical Center, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Roudebush Veterans Administration Medical Center, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Roudebush Veterans Administration Medical Center, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA209882/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'IK6 BX004596/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'S10 RR023710/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK076007/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'I01 CX000623/CX/CSRD VA/United States', 'R21 CA179017/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'I01 BX002104/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'R01 AR059357/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR059679/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20170522,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (SOST protein, human)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Diseases/diagnosis/*etiology/*prevention & control', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Bone and Bones/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Bortezomib/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', '*Gene Deletion', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Osteoblasts/drug effects/metabolism', 'Osteolysis']",PMC5699973,2017/05/23 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2017/05/23 06:00'],"['2017/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/26 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017152 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.152 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Dec;31(12):2686-2694. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.152.

METHODS: 139 haematological cancer patients who underwent a stem cell transplantation completed a longitudinal questionnaire according to 3 phases of the treatment: short-term (pre-transplant), medium-term (1st year post-transplant) and long-term (2nd-6th year post-transplant). Economic value of informal care was estimated using proxy good and opportunity cost methods. Ordered and binary logistic models were performed to identify factors associated with informal care. RESULTS: 123 patients reported having received informal care. A progressive reduction of the number of hours of care was observed between phases. Monetary value per patient ranged from 1,288 to 3,409; 1,045 to 2,786; and 336 to 854 euro/month in the short, medium and long term, respectively. Patients with acute leukaemia and those who received an unrelated allogeneic transplantation were 22% (short-term) and 33.5% (medium-term) more likely to receive more than 8hours/day of care respect to patients diagnosed with lymphoma and autologous transplantation. In the long term, patients with multiple myeloma were more likely to receive more care. Better health status and higher educational level were associated with fewer daily hours of care. CONCLUSIONS: Informal care varies greatly between stages of the treatment depending on the clinical and sociodemographic factors. Significant caring time and societal costs are associated with such care in blood cancer patients.","['Ortega-Ortega, Marta', 'Montero-Granados, Roberto', 'Jimenez-Aguilera, Juan de Dios']","['Ortega-Ortega M', 'Montero-Granados R', 'Jimenez-Aguilera JD']",,"['Applied Economic Department, School of Economic and Business, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.

Hematological patients are particularly affected by MDRO infections because of disease- and therapy-related immunosuppression. To determine the impact of colonization with MDRO on overall survival, we retrospectively analyzed data from patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at our institution. In total, 184 patients were identified, mainly patients with lymphomas (n = 98, 53.3%), multiple myelomas (n = 80, 43.5%), germ cell cancers (n = 5, 2.7%), or acute myeloid leukemia (n = 1, .5%). Forty patients (21.7%) tested positive for MDRO colonization. At a median follow-up time of 21.5 months, the main causes of death were infection in colonized and disease progression in noncolonized patients. Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was higher in patients who tested positive for MDRO than in the noncolonized group (25.4% versus 3%, P < .001). Interestingly, NRM in neutropenia after autologous transplantation did not differ between colonized and noncolonized patients. Colonized patients, however, had inferior overall survival after autologous transplantation in univariate (61.7% versus 73.3%, P = .005) as well as in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 2.463; 95% confidence interval, 1.311 to 4.626; P = .005). We conclude that the period after discharge from hospital after autologous transplantation seems critical and patients with MDRO colonization should be observed closely for infections in the post-transplantation period in outpatient care.","['Scheich, Sebastian', 'Reinheimer, Claudia', 'Brandt, Christian', 'Wichelhaus, Thomas A', 'Hogardt, Michael', 'Kempf, Volkhard A J', 'Brunnberg, Uta', 'Brandts, Christian', 'Ballo, Olivier', 'von Metzler, Ivana', 'Kessel, Johanna', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Steffen, Bjorn']","['Scheich S', 'Reinheimer C', 'Brandt C', 'Wichelhaus TA', 'Hogardt M', 'Kempf VAJ', 'Brunnberg U', 'Brandts C', 'Ballo O', 'von Metzler I', 'Kessel J', 'Serve H', 'Steffen B']",,"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; University Center for Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

BM-MSCs from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have been poorly characterized due to disease heterogeneity. We report a functional, genetic, and immunological characterization of BM-MSC cultures from 46 AML patients, stratified by molecular/cytogenetics into low-risk (LR), intermediate-risk (IR), and high-risk (HR) subgroups. Stable MSC cultures were successfully established and characterized from 40 of 46 AML patients irrespective of the risk subgroup. AML-derived BM-MSCs never harbored tumor-specific cytogenetic/molecular alterations present in blasts, but displayed higher clonogenic potential than healthy donor (HD)-derived BM-MSCs. Although HD- and AML-derived BM-MSCs equally provided chemoprotection to AML cells in vitro, AML-derived BM-MSCs were more immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory, enhanced suppression of lymphocyte proliferation, and diminished secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Multivariate analysis revealed that the level of interleukin-10 produced by AML-derived BM-MSCs as an independent prognostic factor negatively affected overall survival. Collectively our data show that AML-derived BM-MSCs are not tumor related, but display functional differences contributing to therapy resistance and disease evolution.","['Diaz de la Guardia, Rafael', 'Lopez-Millan, Belen', 'Lavoie, Jessie R', 'Bueno, Clara', 'Castano, Julio', 'Gomez-Casares, Maite', 'Vives, Susana', 'Palomo, Laura', 'Juan, Manel', 'Delgado, Julio', 'Blanco, Maria L', 'Nomdedeu, Josep', 'Chaparro, Alberto', 'Fuster, Jose Luis', 'Anguita, Eduardo', 'Rosu-Myles, Michael', 'Menendez, Pablo']","['Diaz de la Guardia R', 'Lopez-Millan B', 'Lavoie JR', 'Bueno C', 'Castano J', 'Gomez-Casares M', 'Vives S', 'Palomo L', 'Juan M', 'Delgado J', 'Blanco ML', 'Nomdedeu J', 'Chaparro A', 'Fuster JL', 'Anguita E', 'Rosu-Myles M', 'Menendez P']",,"['Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, Universitat de Barcelona, Casanova 143, Barcelona 08036, Spain; Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red-Oncologia (CIBERONC), ISCIII, Madrid 28031, Spain.

Research of the last two decades revealed that many viruses have evolved effector proteins that modify PML-NBs. This correlates with antagonization of individual PML-NB components which act as host cell restriction factors. The multifunctional immediate-early protein IE1 of human cytomegalovirus directly interacts with the PML protein resulting in a disruption of the dot-like structure of PML-NBs. This review summarizes recent advances on the functional consequences of PML-NB modification by IE1. In particular, we describe that PML exerts a novel co-regulatory role during the interferon response which is abrogated by IE1. Via binding to PML, IE1 is able to compromise both intrinsic antiviral defense mechanisms and classical innate immune responses. These interactions of IE1 with innate host defenses are crucial for the onset of lytic replication and, consequently, may represent promising targets for antiviral strategies.","['Scherer, Myriam', 'Schilling, Eva-Maria', 'Stamminger, Thomas']","['Scherer M', 'Schilling EM', 'Stamminger T']",,"['Institute for Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universtitat (FAU) Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute for Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universtitat (FAU) Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute for Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universtitat (FAU) Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany. thomas.stamminger@viro.med.uni-erlangen.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Adv Anat Embryol Cell Biol,"Advances in anatomy, embryology, and cell biology",0407712,"['0 (IE1 protein, cytomegalovirus)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Cytomegalovirus/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*metabolism', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Interferons/metabolism', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding']",,2017/05/22 06:00,2018/06/05 06:00,['2017/05/22 06:00'],"['2017/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-3-319-53168-7_4 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Anat Embryol Cell Biol. 2017;223:77-94. doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-53168-7_4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to assess cancer incidence in miners relative to the general population and identify high-risk subgroups. METHODS: Incident cancers in Western Australian miners (n=153,922; 86% male) during 1996-2013 were identified. Indirectly standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated and mixed-effects Poisson models were used to calculate Incidence Rate Ratios (IRRs) to identify high-risk within-cohort subgroups. RESULTS: Compared with the general population, the overall cancer incidence in miners (n=4194 cases) was lower for both females (SIR:0.83, 95%CI:0.74-0.92) and males (SIR:0.96, 95%CI:0.93-0.99). Overall, cancer incidence did not differ by employment duration or employment commencement time. Ever-underground work was associated with lung cancer (IRR:1.81, 95%CI:1.11-2.93). Relative to multi-ore miners, IRRs for specific cancers were significantly different when exclusively mining: iron (prostate:0.73, 95%CI:0.56-0.94); gold (lung:1.77, 95%CI:1.04-3.01 and colorectum:1.70, 95%CI:1.16-2.51); and other metals (urinary tract:1.85, 95%CI:1.03-3.31 and leukaemia:0.36, 95%CI:0.14-0.96). CONCLUSION: Working underground emerged as a significant determinant of lung cancer risk in our contemporary mining cohort. Increased risks of lung, prostate, colorectal and urinary tract cancers and leukaemia were identified in miners of specific ores. These findings underline the importance of continued surveillance of the health and exposures of this relatively young cohort of miners.","['Sodhi-Berry, Nita', 'Reid, Alison', 'Fritschi, Lin', 'Musk, Aw Bill', 'Vermeulen, Roel', 'de Klerk, Nicholas', 'Peters, Susan']","['Sodhi-Berry N', 'Reid A', 'Fritschi L', 'Musk AB', 'Vermeulen R', 'de Klerk N', 'Peters S']",,"['Occupational Respiratory Epidemiology, School of Population and Global Health, The University of Western Australia, 35 Stirling Hwy., Perth, WA 6009, Australia.

The BRIDGE trial studied the safety and efficacy of a clofarabine-based salvage therapy before HSCT in patients with r/r AML. Here, we report the long-term follow-up of this phase II multicenter trial and exploratory analyses on the impact of comorbidity on outcome. Eighty-four patients with a median age of 61 years (range, 40 to 75) were enrolled. Patients were scheduled for at least 1 cycle of salvage therapy with CLARA (clofarabine 30 mg/m(2); cytarabine 1 g/m(2), days 1 to 5). Chemo-responsive patients with a donor received HSCT after first CLARA. The conditioning regimen consisted of clofarabine 30 mg/m(2), day -6 to -3, and melphalan 140 mg/m(2) day -2. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, the hematopoietic cell transplantation-specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI), and the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale were obtained at study enrollment as well as before HSCT. Sixty-seven percent of the patients received HSCT within the trial. After a median follow up of 40 months, the estimated 3-year overall survival (OS) for all enrolled patients and those with HSCT within the trial was 40% and 55%, respectively. Relapse-free survival for patients who underwent transplantation with a complete remission afterwards (n = 50) was 48%, calculated from the day of transplantation. In multivariate analysis, both the HCT-CI and ECOG score had a statistically significant impact on OS with a hazard ratio of 1.22 (P = .025)and 1.72 (P = .001), respectively. Using a clofarabine-based salvage therapy combined with early allogeneic HSCT, we were able to achieve good long-term results for patients with r/r AML. In this cohort, both the HCT-CI and the ECOG scores gave prognostic information on OS, showing the feasibility and clinical relevance of comorbidity evaluation at the time of diagnosis of r/r AML patients.","['Middeke, Jan Moritz', 'Herbst, Regina', 'Parmentier, Stefani', 'Bug, Gesine', 'Hanel, Mathias', 'Stuhler, Gernot', 'Schafer-Eckart, Kerstin', 'Rosler, Wolf', 'Klein, Stefan', 'Bethge, Wolfgang', 'Bitz, Ulrich', 'Buttner, Bozena', 'Knoth, Holger', 'Alakel, Nael', 'Schaich, Markus', 'Morgner, Anke', 'Kramer, Michael', 'Sockel, Katja', 'von Bonin, Malte', 'Stolzel, Friedrich', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Rollig, Christoph', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Schetelig, Johannes']","['Middeke JM', 'Herbst R', 'Parmentier S', 'Bug G', 'Hanel M', 'Stuhler G', 'Schafer-Eckart K', 'Rosler W', 'Klein S', 'Bethge W', 'Bitz U', 'Buttner B', 'Knoth H', 'Alakel N', 'Schaich M', 'Morgner A', 'Kramer M', 'Sockel K', 'von Bonin M', 'Stolzel F', 'Platzbecker U', 'Rollig C', 'Thiede C', 'Ehninger G', 'Bornhauser M', 'Schetelig J']",,"['Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der TU Dresden, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Dresden, Germany.

Analysis of patient-, disease-, and transplantation characteristics and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was performed to identify factors with adverse effects on LFS and OS. These data were used to develop risk scores for survival. We did not identify any prognostic factors beyond 4 years after transplantation for AML and beyond 3 years for ALL. Risk score for survival for AML includes age, disease status at transplantation, cytogenetic risk group, and chronic GVHD. For ALL, the risk score includes age at transplantation and chronic GVHD. The 10-year probabilities of OS for AML with good (score 0, 1, or 2), intermediate (score 3), and poor risk (score 4, 5, 6, or 7) were 94%, 87%, and 68%, respectively.

Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome disease often have ineffective hematopoiesis, cytopenias, blood cell dysplasia in one or more cell types, and are at high risk for developing acute myeloid leukemia. In myelodysplastic syndrome, mutations of TP53 gene are usually associated with complex karyotype and confer a worse prognosis. In the present study, two mutations in this gene are presented and discussed with the clinical evolution of the patients. CASE PRESENTATION: The first case is a 77-year-old Brazilian woman diagnosed as having multiple lineage dysplasia myelodysplastic syndrome according to World Health Organization 2016 and classified as very low-risk by Revised International Prognostic Scoring. The second case is an 80-year-old Brazilian man also diagnosed as having multiple lineage dysplasia myelodysplastic syndrome and classified as low risk. The mutation described in the first case was already identified in some neoplasias and it is associated with a poor prognosis, but it had never been reported before in myelodysplastic syndrome. The second mutation has never been described. CONCLUSIONS: This is a novel report for the scientific community and may be very helpful as we can better understand the disease and the impact of mutations through the follow-up of these patients and others in the future. Both patients are in a good clinical condition, suggesting that these mutations may not alter the clinical course of the disease or may be associated with a good prognosis, but their role in the disease must be investigated more deeply in a larger population.","['Duarte, Fernando Barroso', 'Lemes, Romelia Pinheiro Goncalves', 'Dos Santos, Talyta Ellen de Jesus', 'Barbosa, Maritza Cavalcante', 'de Vasconcelos, Joao Paulo Leitao', 'Rocha-Filho, Francisco Dario', 'Zalcberg, Ilana', 'Coutinho, Diego', 'Figueiredo, Monalisa Feliciano', 'Carlos, Luciana Barros', 'de Vasconcelos, Paulo Roberto Leitao']","['Duarte FB', 'Lemes RPG', 'Dos Santos TEJ', 'Barbosa MC', 'de Vasconcelos JPL', 'Rocha-Filho FD', 'Zalcberg I', 'Coutinho D', 'Figueiredo MF', 'Carlos LB', 'de Vasconcelos PRL']",,"['Department of Surgery, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Research Laboratory in Hemoglobinopathies and Genetics of Hematologic Diseases, Federal University of Ceara, Capitao Francisco Pedro street, n. 1210, Rodolfo Teofilo, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Research Laboratory in Hemoglobinopathies and Genetics of Hematologic Diseases, Federal University of Ceara, Capitao Francisco Pedro street, n. 1210, Rodolfo Teofilo, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil. talytaellen08@hotmail.com.', 'Research Laboratory in Hemoglobinopathies and Genetics of Hematologic Diseases, Federal University of Ceara, Capitao Francisco Pedro street, n. 1210, Rodolfo Teofilo, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Department of Surgery, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Department of Surgery, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology-Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation, CEMO-National Cancer Institute - INCA, Rio de Janeiro-Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology-Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation, CEMO-National Cancer Institute - INCA, Rio de Janeiro-Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Research Laboratory in Hemoglobinopathies and Genetics of Hematologic Diseases, Federal University of Ceara, Capitao Francisco Pedro street, n. 1210, Rodolfo Teofilo, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Center of Hematology and Hemotherapy of Ceara - Cryobiology Laboratory, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Department of Surgery, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20170521,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis']",PMC5438849,2017/05/22 06:00,2018/04/21 06:00,['2017/05/22 06:00'],"['2016/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13256-017-1301-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s13256-017-1301-8 [pii]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2017 May 21;11(1):143. doi: 10.1186/s13256-017-1301-8.,['NOTNLM'],"['Myelodysplastic syndromes', 'Prognosis', 'TP53 mutations']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For many years, conventional karyotyping has been used as the standard diagnostic tool for t (9;22) (q34;q11.2). However, it has several limitations that may lead to failure for detecting BCR-ABL1 gene rearrangements in around 5% of all CML patients. Although reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has evolved as a sensitive method for detecting BCR-ABL1 translocation, this method fail to detect certain BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript type, such as e13a3 (also known as b2a3), as a result of many commercially available and laboratory-developed primer sets. Fortunately, these two rare situations rarely appear at the same time, therefore, the combination of two methods rarely misdiagnosed the patients with CML. In this study, we report a patient with CML who tested both negative by RT-PCR and cytogenetic analysis at the time of diagnosis. She was diagnosed as atypical CML (aCML) and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was suggested. Further fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed cryptic insertion of ABL into BCR gene on chromosome 22, and DNA sequencing with alternative primer sets demonstrated the presence of an e13a3 BCR-ABL1 fusion. She was diagnosed as CML and received imatinib 400 mg/day. A follow-up BCR-ABL1 FISH analysis demonstrated a markedly reduced BCR-ABL1 fusion rate of 0 after 6months treatment, indicating a complete cytogenetic response.","['Duan, M-H', 'Li, H', 'Cai, H']","['Duan MH', 'Li H', 'Cai H']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, People's Republic of China.

This study retrospectively investigated a consecutive series of 312 adult patients with acute leukemia receiving allo-HSCT by using a novel concept of GVHD-free/relapse-free survival (GRFS), and further evaluated the impact of clinical factors on GRFS. Results indicated that the 1- and 2-year GRFS were 54.8% and 51.5%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, recipient age >35years (HR 1.676; p=0.006), diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (HR 1.653; p=0.027) and acute biphenotypic leukemia (HR 2.175; p=0.010), advanced disease (HR 2.702; p<0.001), and donor age >35 years (HR 1.622; p=0.008) were significantly associated with inferior GRFS post-HSCT. GRFS of haploidentical-related donor transplant was comparable to that of matched sibling donor or matched unrelated donor transplant. Furthermore, prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) had an overall beneficial effect on GRFS (HR 0.645, p=0.044). Collectively, with a better understanding of these significant prognostic factors which impacted on GRFS, we can effectively evaluate the risk and probability of real recovery after allo-HSCT, further optimizing the therapeutic avenues for acute leukemia.","['Tan, Jie', 'Wang, Ya', 'Yu, Si-Jian', 'Ma, Yong-Yong', 'Lei, Hu-Yi', 'Liu, Qi-Fa']","['Tan J', 'Wang Y', 'Yu SJ', 'Ma YY', 'Lei HY', 'Liu QF']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China; Department of Hematology, Jingzhou First People's Hospital, Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Jingzhou First People's Hospital, Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.

In addition, signaling cascade pathways, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, contribute to the regulation of mast cell degranulation. Accordingly, different research strategies have been pursued to develop anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic drugs by regulating these signaling pathways. The development of new drugs that inhibit mast cell degranulation may help in the treatment of allergies. In this study, we investigated the effects of coumarin derivatives on mast cell degranulation. The effect of coumarin derivatives on degranulation in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells was determined by a beta-hexosaminidase assay and histamine assay. A coumarin derivative 1 (C1), 2-oxo-2H-chromen-4-yl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate, inhibited degranulation in a dose-dependent manner and demonstrated maximum therapeutic effect when used at 25muM. Additionally, these compounds inhibited the phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. Taken together, these results indicate that 2-oxo-2H-chromen-4-yl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate inhibits mast cell degranulation by suppressing the activation of the ERK pathway and this inhibitory effect suggests potential therapeutic strategies towards the prevention of allergic disorders.","['Yoo, Gaeun', 'Lee, Kooyeon', 'Lee, Deug-Chan']","['Yoo G', 'Lee K', 'Lee DC']",,"['Department of Biomedical Technology, Kangwon National University, Kangwondaehakgil 1, Chuncheon, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Bio-health Technology, Kangwon National University, Kangwondaehakgil 1, Chuncheon, Republic of Korea.

Although currently available Notch-blocking agents are showing anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies, they are not effective in all the patients and often cause severe side-effects, limiting their widespread therapeutic use. Here, by functional and biological analysis of the most representative molecules of an in house library of natural products, we have designed and synthetized the chalcone-derivative 8 possessing Notch inhibitory activity at low micro molar concentration in T-ALL cell lines. Structure-activity relationships were afforded for the chalcone scaffold. Short term treatments with compound 8 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of Notch signaling activity, halted cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis, thus affecting leukemia cell growth. Taken together, our data indicate that 8 is a novel Notch inhibitor, candidate for further investigation and development as an additional therapeutic option against Notch-dependent cancers.","['Mori, Mattia', 'Tottone, Luca', 'Quaglio, Deborah', 'Zhdanovskaya, Nadezda', 'Ingallina, Cinzia', 'Fusto, Marisa', 'Ghirga, Francesca', 'Peruzzi, Giovanna', 'Crestoni, Maria Elisa', 'Simeoni, Fabrizio', 'Giulimondi, Francesca', 'Talora, Claudio', 'Botta, Bruno', 'Screpanti, Isabella', 'Palermo, Rocco']","['Mori M', 'Tottone L', 'Quaglio D', 'Zhdanovskaya N', 'Ingallina C', 'Fusto M', 'Ghirga F', 'Peruzzi G', 'Crestoni ME', 'Simeoni F', 'Giulimondi F', 'Talora C', 'Botta B', 'Screpanti I', 'Palermo R']",,"['Center for Life Nano Science@Sapienza, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, 00161, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, 00161, Italy.', 'Department of Chemistry and Technology of Drugs, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, 00185, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, 00161, Italy.', 'Department of Chemistry and Technology of Drugs, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, 00185, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, 00161, Italy.', 'Center for Life Nano Science@Sapienza, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, 00161, Italy.', 'Center for Life Nano Science@Sapienza, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, 00161, Italy.', 'Department of Chemistry and Technology of Drugs, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, 00185, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, 00161, Italy.', 'Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Manchester, M20 4BX, UK.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, 00161, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, 00161, Italy.', 'Department of Chemistry and Technology of Drugs, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, 00185, Italy. bruno.botta@uniroma1.it.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, 00161, Italy. isabella.screpanti@uniroma1.it.', 'Istituto Pasteur Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, 00161, Italy. isabella.screpanti@uniroma1.it.', 'Center for Life Nano Science@Sapienza, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, 00161, Italy. rocco.palermo@iit.it.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170519,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chalcones)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '4WVS5M0LGF (butein)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chalcones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Molecular Structure', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",PMC5438367,2017/05/21 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2017/05/21 06:00'],"['2016/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-02316-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-02316-9 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 May 19;7(1):2213. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-02316-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approval of this drug was based on progression-free survival and interim overall survival data from the phase 3 EMILIA study. In this report, we present a descriptive analysis of the final overall survival data from that trial. METHODS: EMILIA was a randomised, international, open-label, phase 3 study of men and women aged 18 years or older with HER2-positive unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane. Enrolled patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via a hierarchical, dynamic randomisation scheme and an interactive voice response system to trastuzumab emtansine (3.6 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks) or control (capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2) self-administered orally twice daily on days 1-14 on each 21-day cycle, plus lapatinib 1250 mg orally once daily on days 1-21). Randomisation was stratified by world region (USA vs western Europe vs or other), number of previous chemotherapy regimens for unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease (0 or 1 vs >1), and disease involvement (visceral vs non-visceral). The coprimary efficacy endpoints were progression-free survival (per independent review committee assessment) and overall survival. Efficacy was analysed in the intention-to-treat population; safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment, with patients analysed according to the treatment actually received. On May 30, 2012, the study protocol was amended to allow crossover from control to trastuzumab emtansine after the second interim overall survival analysis crossed the prespecified overall survival efficacy boundary. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00829166. FINDINGS: Between Feb 23, 2009, and Oct 13, 2011, 991 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to either trastuzumab emtansine (n=495) or capecitabine and lapatinib (control; n=496). In this final descriptive analysis, median overall survival was longer with trastuzumab emtansine than with control (29.9 months [95% CI 26.3-34.1] vs 25.9 months [95% CI 22.7-28.3]; hazard ratio 0.75 [95% CI 0.64-0.88]). 136 (27%) of 496 patients crossed over from control to trastuzumab emtansine after the second interim overall survival analysis (median follow-up duration 24.1 months [IQR 19.5-26.1]). Of those patients originally randomly assigned to trastuzumab emtansine, 254 (51%) of 495 received capecitabine and 241 [49%] of 495 received lapatinib (separately or in combination) after study drug discontinuation. In the safety population (488 patients treated with capecitabine plus lapatinib, 490 patients treated with trastuzumab emtansine), fewer grade 3 or worse adverse events occurred with trastuzumab emtansine (233 [48%] of 490) than with capecitabine plus lapatinib control treatment (291 [60%] of 488). In the control group, the most frequently reported grade 3 or worse adverse events were diarrhoea (103 [21%] of 488 patients) followed by palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (87 [18%]), and vomiting (24 [5%]). The safety profile of trastuzumab emtansine was similar to that reported previously; the most frequently reported grade 3 or worse adverse events in the trastuzumab emtansine group were thrombocytopenia (70 [14%] of 490), increased aspartate aminotransferase levels (22 [5%]), and anaemia (19 [4%]). Nine patients died from adverse events; five of these deaths were judged to be related to treatment (two in the control group [coronary artery disease and multiorgan failure] and three in the trastuzumab emtansine group [metabolic encephalopathy, neutropenic sepsis, and acute myeloid leukaemia]). INTERPRETATION: This descriptive analysis of final overall survival in the EMILIA trial shows that trastuzumab emtansine improved overall survival in patients with previously treated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer even in the presence of crossover treatment. The safety profile was similar to that reported in previous analyses, reaffirming trastuzumab emtansine as an efficacious and tolerable treatment in this patient population.

A B10.D2 --> BALB/c transplant model of sclerodermatous GVHD was used to address the therapeutic effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the development of chronic GVHD. The clinical and pathological severity of cutaneous sclerodermatous GVHD was significantly attenuated in MSC-treated recipients relative to sclerodermatous GVHD control subjects. After MSC treatment, skin collagen production was significantly reduced, with consistent down-regulation of Tgfb expression. Effects of MSCs on molecular markers implicated in persistent transforming growth factor-beta signaling and fibrosis, such as PTEN, phosphorylated Smad-2/3, and matrix metalloproteinase-1, were observed in skin tissue. MSCs neither migrate to the skin nor affect the in vivo expansion of immune effector cells, but they inhibited the infiltration of immune effector cells into skin via down-regulation of CCR4 and CCR8 expression on CD4(+) T cells and CCR1 on CD11b(+) monocyte/macrophages. MSCs diminished expression of chemokines such as CCL1, CCL3, CCL8, CCL17, and CCL22 in skin. MSCs were also dependent on stimulated splenocytes to suppress fibroblast proliferation. Our findings indicate that MSCs attenuate the cutaneous sclerodermatous GVHD by selectively blocking immune cell migration and down-regulating chemokines and chemokine receptors.","['Lim, Ji-Young', 'Ryu, Da-Bin', 'Lee, Sung-Eun', 'Park, Gyeongsin', 'Min, Chang-Ki']","['Lim JY', 'Ryu DB', 'Lee SE', 'Park G', 'Min CK']",,"[""Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Pathology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.

An in-vivo chronic rat model of pressure overload employing Nw-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) was tested at different time intervals to ensure the occurrence of persistent myocardial apoptosis along with pressure overload. Seven groups of male Wistar rats were assigned as (i) distilled water; (ii-iv) L-NAME (60 mg/kg) for 6, 12 or 16 weeks; (v-vii) L-NAME [16 weeks] + celecoxib (25, 50 or 100 mg/kg), from week 13 to week 16. Treatment with L-NAME for 6, 12 or 16 weeks increased systolic blood pressure, serum level of creatine kinase-MB and lactate dehydrogenase. Further, it induced cardiac hypertrophy, detected in terms of greater heart weight index and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area and produced interstitial and perivascular fibrosis. Moreover, administration of L-NAME increased cardiac immunostaining for activated caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio whereas; immunostaining for Mcl-1 was decreased. Administration of celecoxib (25, 50 or 100 mg/kg) aggravated the L-NAME-induced toxicity. The work results shed the light on the putative pro-apoptotic effect of celecoxib at a risk state of pressure overload comparable to the clinical condition of essential hypertension.","['Mosaad, Sarah M', 'Zaitone, Sawsan A', 'Ibrahim, Abdelazim', 'El-Baz, Amani A', 'Abo-Elmatty, Dina M', 'Moustafa, Yasser M']","['Mosaad SM', 'Zaitone SA', 'Ibrahim A', 'El-Baz AA', 'Abo-Elmatty DM', 'Moustafa YM']",,"['Department of Pharmaceutical Inspection, Ministry of Health, Ismailia 41522, Egypt.

Overexpression of CXCR4 has been reported in different hematological malignancies including CLL. Binding of the pro-survival chemokine CXCL12 with its cognate receptor CXCR4 induces cell migration. CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis promotes cell survival and proliferation and may contribute to the tropism of leukemia cells towards lymphoid tissues and bone marrow. Therefore, we hypothesized that targeting CXCR4 with an IgG1 antibody, PF-06747143, may constitute an effective therapeutic approach for CLL. METHODS: Patient-derived primary CLL-B cells were assessed for cytotoxicity in an in vitro model of CLL microenvironment. PF-06747143 was analyzed for cell death induction and for its potential to interfere with the chemokine CXCL12-induced mechanisms, including migration and F-actin polymerization. PF-06747143 in vivo efficacy was determined in a CLL murine xenograft tumor model. RESULTS: PF-06747143, a novel-humanized IgG1 CXCR4 antagonist antibody, induced cell death of patient-derived primary CLL-B cells, in presence or absence of stromal cells. Moreover, cell death induction by the antibody was independent of CLL high-risk prognostic markers. The cell death mechanism was dependent on CXCR4 expression, required antibody bivalency, involved reactive oxygen species production, and did not require caspase activation, all characteristics reminiscent of programmed cell death (PCD). PF-06747143 also induced potent B-CLL cytotoxicity via Fc-driven antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity activity (CDC). PF-06747143 had significant combinatorial effect with standard of care (SOC) agents in B-CLL treatment, including rituximab, fludarabine (F-ara-A), ibrutinib, and bendamustine. In a CLL xenograft model, PF-06747143 decreased tumor burden and improved survival as a monotherapy, and in combination with bendamustine. CONCLUSIONS: We show evidence that PF-06747143 has biological activity in CLL primary cells, supporting a rationale for evaluation of PF-06747143 for the treatment of CLL patients.","['Kashyap, Manoj

Previous studies indicate increased risks of hematopoietic cancers and decreased risks at other sites, possibly due to differences in lifestyle or risk behaviours. We present findings from CanCHEC (Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort), the largest national population-based cohort of agricultural workers. METHODS: Statistics Canada created the cohort using deterministic and probabilistic linkage of the 1991 Canadian Long Form Census to National Cancer Registry records for 1992-2010. Self-reported occupations were coded using the Standard Occupational Classification (1991) system. Analyses were restricted to employed persons aged 25-74 years at baseline (N = 2,051,315), with follow-up until December 31, 2010. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were modeled using Cox proportional hazards for all workers in agricultural occupations (n = 70,570; 70.8% male), stratified by sex, and adjusted for age at cohort entry, province of residence, and highest level of education. RESULTS: A total of 9515 incident cancer cases (7295 in males) occurred in agricultural workers. Among men, increased risks were observed for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (HR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.00-1.21), prostate (HR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.06-1.16), melanoma (HR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.02-1.31), and lip cancer (HR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.70-2.70). Decreased risks in males were observed for lung, larynx, and liver cancers. Among female agricultural workers there was an increased risk of pancreatic cancer (HR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.07-1.72). Increased risks of melanoma (HR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.17-2.73), leukemia (HR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.24-3.25) and multiple myeloma (HR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.16-4.37) were observed in a subset of female crop farmers. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to pesticides may have contributed to increased risks of hematopoietic cancers, while increased risks of lip cancer and melanoma may be attributed to sun exposure. The array of decreased risks suggests reduced smoking and alcohol consumption in this occupational group compared to the general population.","['Kachuri, Linda', 'Harris, M Anne', 'MacLeod, Jill S', 'Tjepkema, Michael', 'Peters, Paul A', 'Demers, Paul A']","['Kachuri L', 'Harris MA', 'MacLeod JS', 'Tjepkema M', 'Peters PA', 'Demers PA']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3226-4727'],"['Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, 155 College Street, 6th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5T 3M7, Canada.

Drugs with multiple targets provide a feasible option for the treatment of complex tumors. Multitarget anti-angiogenesis agents are among the new generation of anticancer drugs and have shown favorable clinical efficacy. Dianhydrogalactitol (DAG) is a chemotherapeutic agent for chronic myeloid leukemia and lung cancer. Recently, it has been tested in phase II trials of glioblastoma treatment; however, mechanisms of DAG in glioblastoma have not been elucidated. Here we show that DAG could inhibit the migration and invasion of U251 cell line by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) expression. Furthermore, DAG could also inhibit tumor angiogenesis in vitro as well as in the zebrafish model. Mechanistic studies reveal that DAG inhibited both VEGFR2 and FGFR1 pathways. Our results suggest that DAG may be a potential multitarget agent that can inhibit tumor migration, invasion, and angiogenesis, and the anti-angiogenic effects may be involved in dual-suppression VEGF/VEGFR2 and FGF2/FGFR1 signal pathways.","['Jiang, Xia', 'Huang, Yinmei', 'Wang, Xiaojie', 'Liang, Qiaofang', 'Li, Yingjie', 'Li, Fuji', 'Fu, Xuanhao', 'Huang, Chonghuan', 'Liu, Huagang']","['Jiang X', 'Huang Y', 'Wang X', 'Liang Q', 'Li Y', 'Li F', 'Fu X', 'Huang C', 'Liu H']",,"['The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, China.', 'Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, China.', 'Liuzhou Worker Hospital, Liuzhou 545005, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, China.', 'Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, China.', 'Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, China.', 'Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, China.

The relationship between polymorphisms in genes encoding MTX transporters and MTX response is controversial. In the present study, 322 Chinese children with standard- and intermediate-risk ALL were genotyped for 12 polymorphisms. SLCO1B1 rs10841753 showed a significant association with plasma MTX levels at 48 h (P = 0.017).

In this paper, cytotoxic effect of emamectin benzoate (EMB), an excellent natural-product insecticide, was evaluated through monitoring cell viability, cell apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) in leukemia K562 and Molt-4 cells. Following the exposure to EMB, cell viability was decreased and positive apoptosis of K562 and Molt-4 cells was increased in a concentration- and time- dependent fashion. In the treatment of 10muM EMB, apoptotic cells accounted for 93.0% to K562 cells and 98.9% to Molt-4 cells based on the control, meanwhile, 63.47% of K562 cells and 81.15% of Molt-4 cells exhibited late apoptotic and necrotic features with damaged cytoplasmic membrane. 48h exposure to 10muM EMB increased significantly the great number of cells with mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) loss, and the elevation of [Ca(2+)]i level was peaked and persisted within 70s in K562 cells whilst 50s in Molt-4 cells. Moreover, a stronger cytotoxicity of EMB was further observed than that of imatinib. The results authenticate the efficacious effect of EMB as a potential anti-leukemia agent and an inconsistency with regard to insecticide-induced leukemia.","['Yun, Xinming', 'Rao, Wenbing', 'Xiao, Ciying', 'Huang, Qingchun']","['Yun X', 'Rao W', 'Xiao C', 'Huang Q']",,"['Shanghai Key Lab of Chemical Biology, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China.', 'Shanghai Key Lab of Chemical Biology, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China.', 'Shanghai Key Lab of Chemical Biology, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China.

Compounds 7j, 7a and its water soluble analog 7p also exhibited potent anticancer activity against rat 9L-SF gliosarcoma cells in culture. Compound 7j was the most potent compound in the series in the M9-ENL1 AML cell assay with a lethal dose concentration EC50 value of 720 nM, and exhibited the greatest cytotoxicity against a collection of primary AML stem cell specimens, which included a specimen that was unresponsive to PTL, affording EC50 values in the range 0.33-1.0 muM in three out of four specimens.

There is an urgent, unmet need for robust and sensitive assays that can be readily adopted as real-time tools for disease monitoring. NPM1 frameshift mutations are an established MRD marker present in half of patients with cytogenetically normal AML. However, detection is complicated by the existence of hundreds of potential frameshift insertions, clonal heterogeneity, and absence of sequence information when the NPM1 mutation is identified using capillary electrophoresis. Thus, some patients are ineligible for NPM1 MRD monitoring. Furthermore, a subset of patients with NPM1-mutated AML will have false-negative MRD results because of clonal evolution. To simplify and improve MRD testing for NPM1, we present a novel digital PCR technique composed of massively multiplex pools of insertion-specific primers that selectively detect mutated but not wild-type NPM1. By measuring reaction end points using digital PCR technology, the resulting single assay enables sensitive and specific quantification of most NPM1 exon 12 mutations in a manner that is robust to clonal heterogeneity, does not require NPM1 sequence information, and obviates the need for maintenance of hundreds of type-specific assays and associated plasmid standards.","['Mencia-Trinchant, Nuria', 'Hu, Yang', 'Alas, Maria Antonina', 'Ali, Fatima', 'Wouters, Bas J', 'Lee, Sangmin', 'Ritchie, Ellen K', 'Desai, Pinkal', 'Guzman, Monica L', 'Roboz, Gail J', 'Hassane, Duane C']","['Mencia-Trinchant N', 'Hu Y', 'Alas MA', 'Ali F', 'Wouters BJ', 'Lee S', 'Ritchie EK', 'Desai P', 'Guzman ML', 'Roboz GJ', 'Hassane DC']",,"['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.

The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors for and clinical outcomes of breakthrough yeast BSIs in patients with hematological malignancies in the era of newer antifungal agents. Between 2011 and 2014, all consecutive patients with hematological malignancies who developed yeast BSIs were included in a case-control study wherein breakthrough infections (cases) and de novo infections (controls) were compared. Of 49 patients with yeast BSIs, 21 (43%) met the criteria for breakthrough infections. The proportions of Candida krusei and Candida tropicalis in the cases and controls were significantly different (32% [7/22] vs. 3% [1/29], P = .015; 5% [1/22] vs. 38% [11/29], P = .007, respectively). Acute leukemia, presence of a central venous catheter and neutropenia in the 3 days prior to BSI were significant risk factors for breakthrough infections. Six-week mortality rates was 33% [7/21] in the cases and 43% [12/28] in the controls (P = .564). Refractory neutropenia and the Pitt bacteremia score were independent predictors of 6-week mortality. In conclusion, breakthrough infections accounted for a significant proportion of yeast BSIs in patients with hematological malignancies. However, these infections did not increase the risk of death by themselves. Our results suggest that current clinical management of breakthrough yeast BSIs, which includes switching to a different antifungal class and prompt catheter removal is reasonable.","['Kim, Si-Hyun', 'Choi, Jae-Ki', 'Cho, Sung-Yeon', 'Lee, Hyo-Jin', 'Park, Sun Hee', 'Choi, Su-Mi', 'Lee, Dong-Gun', 'Choi, Jung-Hyun', 'Yoo, Jin-Hong', 'Lee, Jong-Wook']","['Kim SH', 'Choi JK', 'Cho SY', 'Lee HJ', 'Park SH', 'Choi SM', 'Lee DG', 'Choi JH', 'Yoo JH', 'Lee JW']",,"['Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Incheon St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Incheon St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",,England,Med Mycol,Medical mycology,9815835,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/classification/*therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Fungemia/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Fungi/classification', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC5896439,2017/05/20 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2017/05/20 06:00'],"['2016/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['3835468 [pii]', '10.1093/mmy/myx038 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Mycol. 2018 Feb 1;56(2):197-206. doi: 10.1093/mmy/myx038.,['NOTNLM'],"['bloodstream infection', 'breakthrough infection', 'hematological malignancy', 'yeast']",,"['(c) The Author 2017.

This 1-year, retrospective study was designed to assess the incidence and clinical determinants of IMI in centers in five countries (Thailand, Taiwan, Singapore, China, India). Patients treated in a single year (2012) were identified through discharge diagnoses, microbiology, and histopathology logs, and entered based on published definitions of IMI. A total of 155 cases were included (median age 54 years; 47.7% male). Of these, 47.7% had proven disease; the remainder had probable IMI. The most frequent host factors were prolonged steroid use (39.4%) and recent neutropenia (38.7%). Common underlying conditions included diabetes mellitus (DM; 30.9%), acute myeloid leukemia (19.4%), and rheumatologic conditions (11.6%). DM was more common in patients with no recent history of neutropenia or prolonged steroid use (P = .006). The lung was the most frequently involved site (78.7%), demonstrating a range of features on computed tomography (CT). Aspergillus was the most common mould cultured (71.6%), primarily A. fumigatus and A. flavus, although proportions varied in different centers. The most often used antifungal for empiric therapy was conventional amphotericin. Ninety-day mortality was 32.9%. This is the first multicenter Asian study of IMI not limited to specific patient groups or diagnostic methods. It suggests that DM and rheumatologic conditions be considered as risk factors for IMI and demonstrates that IMI should not be ruled out in patients whose chest features on CT do not fit the conventional criteria.","['Rotjanapan, P', 'Chen, Y C', 'Chakrabarti, A', 'Li, R Y', 'Rudramurthy, S M', 'Yu, J', 'Kung, H C', 'Watcharananan, S', 'Tan, A L', 'Saffari, S E', 'Tan, B H']","['Rotjanapan P', 'Chen YC', 'Chakrabarti A', 'Li RY', 'Rudramurthy SM', 'Yu J', 'Kung HC', 'Watcharananan S', 'Tan AL', 'Saffari SE', 'Tan BH']",,"['Division of Infectious Diseases, Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Dermatology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Dermatology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pathology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Centre for Quantitative Medicine, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,England,Med Mycol,Medical mycology,9815835,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Asia/epidemiology', 'Aspergillus/physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fungi/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Invasive Fungal Infections/diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Lung/diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2017/05/20 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2017/05/20 06:00'],"['2016/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['3835466 [pii]', '10.1093/mmy/myx029 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Mycol. 2018 Feb 1;56(2):186-196. doi: 10.1093/mmy/myx029.,['NOTNLM'],"['diabetes mellitus', 'invasive aspergillosis', 'invasive mould disease']",,"['(c) The Author 2017.

This study is designed to explore the possible role of PML SUMOylation and its associated nuclear bodies (NBs) in the regulation of HERG protein expression. Both arsenic trioxide (ATO) and angiotensin II (Ang II) were able to significantly reduce HERG protein expression, while also increasing PML SUMOylation and accelerating the formation of PML-NBs. Pre-exposure of cardiomyocytes to a SUMOylation chemical inhibitor, ginkgolic acid, or the silencing of UBC9 suppressed PML SUMOylation, subsequently preventing the downregulation of HERG induced by ATO or Ang II. Conversely, knockdown of RNF4 led to a remarkable increase in PML SUMOylation and the function of PML-NBs, further promoting ATO- or Ang II-induced HERG protein downregulation. Mechanistically, an increase in PML SUMOylation by ATO or Ang II dramatically enhanced the formation of PML and Pin1 complexes in PML-NBs, leading to the upregulation of TGF-beta1 protein, eventually inhibiting HERG expression through activation of protein kinase A. The present work uncovered a novel molecular mechanism underlying HERG protein expression and indicated that PML SUMOylation is a critical step in the development of drug-acquired arrhythmia.","['Liu, Yu', 'Li, Duo', 'Nie, Dan', 'Liu, Shang-Kun', 'Qiu, Fang', 'Liu, Mei-Tong', 'Li, Yuan-Yuan', 'Wang, Jia-Xin', 'Liu, Yan-Xin', 'Dong, Chang-Jiang', 'Wu, Di', 'Tian, Wei', 'Yang, Jia', 'Mu, Wei', 'Li, Jia-Tong', 'Zhao, Dan', 'Wang, Xiao-Feng', 'Chu, Wen-Feng', 'Yang, Bao-Feng']","['Liu Y', 'Li D', 'Nie D', 'Liu SK', 'Qiu F', 'Liu MT', 'Li YY', 'Wang JX', 'Liu YX', 'Dong CJ', 'Wu D', 'Tian W', 'Yang J', 'Mu W', 'Li JT', 'Zhao D', 'Wang XF', 'Chu WF', 'Yang BF']",,"['Department of Pharmacology, The State-Province Key Laboratories of Biomedicine Pharmaceutics of China, Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Research, Ministry of Education, College of Pharmacy, Harbin Medical University at Harbin, Heilongjiang 150081, P.

We therefore studied the influence of the surface chemistry of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) carrying identical amounts of a specific antibody (anti-B220) on the selectivity toward B220-positive leukemia stem cells. The uptake by these cells was higher compared to the nanoparticle uptake by B220-negative leukemia stem cells, demonstrating uptake specificity. In addition, the adsorption of serum proteins onto the differently charged MSNs was studied by SDS-PAGE. Interestingly, the highest selectivity was not observed for the MSNs with the lowest level of serum protein adsorption, which suggests that proteins present in the protein corona of the MSNs may positively influence the selective uptake of targeted nanoparticles. For the particles exhibiting the highest selectivity, successful selective delivery of cargo to the B220-positive cells was demonstrated. Taken together, our results indicate that nanoparticle surface charge and adsorption of serum proteins is an important factor for enhancing selectivity in targeted delivery of drugs using nanoparticulate vectors, an observation tentatively attributed to enhanced cellular internalization kinetics in the presence of adsorbed serum proteins on the nanoparticles.","['Beck, Michaela', 'Mandal, Tamoghna', 'Buske, Christian', 'Linden, Mika']","['Beck M', 'Mandal T', 'Buske C', 'Linden M']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1736-0638'],"['University of Ulm , Institute of Inorganic Chemistry II, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'University Hospital Ulm , Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'University Hospital Ulm , Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'University of Ulm , Institute of Inorganic Chemistry II, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89081 Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170525,United States,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,ACS applied materials & interfaces,101504991,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)']",IM,"['Adsorption', 'Blood Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Nanoparticles', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Porosity', 'Silicon Dioxide']",,2017/05/20 06:00,2018/12/20 06:00,['2017/05/20 06:00'],"['2017/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acsami.7b04742 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces. 2017 Jun 7;9(22):18566-18574. doi: 10.1021/acsami.7b04742.

However, prolonged exposure to 50/60 Hz MF is associated with an increased risk of childhood leukemia at less than one microtesla of time-averaged intensity. And such kind of association is suggested in adults for some blood cancers and senile dementia. The cryptochrome hypothesis has been proposed to explain the association established with childhood leukemia. Cryptochromes indeed assume the regulation of circadian biorhythms (a disruption of these lasts takes part to carcinogenesis) and they could be intrinsically sensitive to MF as from the low microtesla range. The cryptochrome hypothesis is now supported by diverse experimental observations. And recently, its relevance is further enhanced by the perspective of possible photo-dependence of the clock function of Cry 2 in retina, at least in diurnal mammals - the magnetic sensitivity of cryptochromes is indeed photo-dependent. Such a perspective however implies some major paradigm shifts in the experimental study of biological effects of 50/60 Hz MF as it has been conducted to date. On the other hand, the cryptochrome hypothesis can in principle also apply to static MF. For these, indeed, a mechanism of interaction with cryptochromes is identified, which is not the case of 50/60 Hz MF so far. A hypothesis is proposed here for these last, namely, resonance-based interaction with the spin polarization of one or both the radicals of the long-lived (milliseconds) pair FAD degrees -Trp4 degrees .","['Vanderstraeten, J']",['Vanderstraeten J'],,"['Collaborateur scientifique, Centre de Recherche en Sante environnementale et Sante du Travail (CR4), Ecole de Sante publique, ULB.']",['fre'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Belgium,Rev Med Brux,Revue medicale de Bruxelles,8003474,,,,,2017/05/20 06:00,2017/05/20 06:01,['2017/05/20 06:00'],"['2017/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/20 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rev Med Brux. 2017;38(2):79-89.,['NOTNLM'],"['Circadian biorhythms', 'Extremely low frequency,', 'Retinal biorhythms']",,,,,Champs magnetiques et sante : de l'epidemiologie a la chimie des cryptochromes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two programs, AutoDock 4 and AutoDock Vina software were applied to dock the target protein with synthesized compounds and ATP. AutoDock runs resulted in binding energy scores from -7.8 to -10.16 kcal/mol for AutoDock 4 and -6.9 to -8.5 (kcal/mol) for AutoDock Vina. Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed using Gromacs for up to 20 ns simulation time investigating the stability of a ligand-protein complex. Finally, a theoretical experiment using MD simulation for 10 ns was performed without defining the initial coordinates, and the affinity binding of ligand to receptors was directly studied, which revealed that the ligand approaches the active sites. The relative free binding energy for the structure 06 (S06), which has the highest binding energy in Autodock 4 and Autodock Vina (-10.10 and -8.5 kcal/mol, respectively), was also evaluated by molecular mechanics (MM) with Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) and a surface area solvation (MM-PBSA) method using g_mmpbsa tools for the last 15 ns MD. On the basis of binding energy scores, a negative binding energy value of 73.6 kcal/mol, S06, was recognized as the dominant potential inhibitors. The cytotoxic properties of S06 was evaluated against three cell lines, acute T cell leukemia (Jurkat), human chronic myelogenous leukemia, (K562) and human foreskin fibroblast (Hu02) using the microculture tetrazolium test MTT assay. Cisplatin was used as the reference agent. The results indicated that S06 has a higher safety index (SI = 0.73, IC50 = 152.64 mug/mL for Jurkat and IC50 = 110.25 mug/mL for Hu02, P < 0.05 means +/- SD for four independent experiments) compared to cisplatin (SI = 0.56, IC50 = 8.86 mug/mL for Jurkat and IC50 = 4.96 mug/mL for Hu02). The in silico results indicated that the proposed structures, which have no toxic effects, are potential tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target Bcr-Abl and thus prevent uncontrolled cell growth (proliferation) but not necessarily cell death (apoptosis) and might potentially constitute an interesting novel class of targeted antileukemic drugs, which deserve further studies.","['Dolatkhah, Zahra', 'Javanshir, Shahrzad', 'Sadr, Ahmad Shahir', 'Hosseini, Jaber', 'Sardari, Soroush']","['Dolatkhah Z', 'Javanshir S', 'Sadr AS', 'Hosseini J', 'Sardari S']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3161-0456'],"['Heterocyclic Chemistry Research Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Iran University of Science and Technology , Tehran 16846-13114, Iran.', 'Heterocyclic Chemistry Research Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Iran University of Science and Technology , Tehran 16846-13114, Iran.', 'Bioinformatics Research Center, Sabzevar University of Medical Sciences , Sabzevar 9613873136, Iran.', 'Bioinformatics Research Center, Cheragh Medical Institute and Hospital , Kabul 1001-1007, Afghanistan.', 'Heterocyclic Chemistry Research Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Iran University of Science and Technology , Tehran 16846-13114, Iran.', 'Drug Design and Bioinformatics Unit, Department of Medical Biotechnology, Biotechnology Research Center, Pasteur Institute of Iran , Pasteur Avenue, Tehran 13164, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170525,United States,J Chem Inf Model,Journal of chemical information and modeling,101230060,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chromones)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemistry Techniques, Synthetic', 'Chromones/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', '*Molecular Docking Simulation', '*Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thermodynamics']",,2017/05/20 06:00,2017/09/22 06:00,['2017/05/20 06:00'],"['2017/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jcim.6b00138 [doi]'],ppublish,J Chem Inf Model. 2017 Jun 26;57(6):1246-1257. doi: 10.1021/acs.jcim.6b00138.

We propose a method to assess the prediction accuracy of a mixture cure model in predicting cure probability based on inverse probability of censoring weights to incorporate the censoring and latent cure status in the data. The inverse probability of censoring weight-adjusted estimator is shown to be consistent for the true expected prediction error for cure probability. A simulation study shows that the estimator performs well with finite samples when subjects with censored survival times greater than the largest uncensored time are identified as cured, an approach that is often used in mixture cure model literature to increase model identifiability. The simulation study also investigates the performance of the estimator with different thresholds to identify cured subjects and the estimator based on observed (training) data only. The method is applied to bone barrow transplant data for leukemia patients for assessing prediction accuracy for the cure probabilities.","['Jiang, Wenyu', 'Sun, Haoyu', 'Peng, Yingwei']","['Jiang W', 'Sun H', 'Peng Y']",,"[""1 Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada."", ""1 Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada."", ""1 Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada."", ""2 Department of Public Health Sciences, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada."", ""3 Division of Cancer Care and Epidemiology, Queen's Cancer Research Institute, Kingston, ON, Canada.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170519,England,Stat Methods Med Res,Statistical methods in medical research,9212457,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Models, Statistical', '*Probability', 'Survival Analysis', '*Treatment Outcome']",,2017/05/20 06:00,2018/06/21 06:00,['2017/05/20 06:00'],"['2017/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0962280217708673 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Methods Med Res. 2017 Oct;26(5):2029-2041. doi: 10.1177/0962280217708673.

We report an atypical case of congenital pure erythroid leukemia that did not express typical erythroid markers. The patient presented with a high white blood cell count with blastic cells at birth. Although flow cytometric analyses of peripheral blood and bone marrow showed a large CD45-negative cell population, we did not identify any evidence of monoclonality. While the circulating blasts decreased with only supportive care, hepatomegaly with multiple nodules was accompanied by liver failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and development of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Pathological examination of the liver biopsy specimen revealed a small round cell tumor that was negative for nearly all hematopoietic cell markers, including classical erythroid cell markers, and positive for CD43, CD71, and E-cadherin, an early erythroid marker epithelial calcium-dependent adhesion protein, suggesting that these tumor cells originated from an immature erythroblast. We found high beta-catenin and c-Myc protein expression, which were not previously described in pure erythroid leukemia. Cytosine arabinoside temporarily alleviated clinical symptoms; however, the patient died of progressive disease at 8 months of age. This case indicates that E-cadherin is useful for diagnosing pure erythroid leukemia, even in immature cases.","['Tamura, Akihiro', 'Uemura, Suguru', 'Saito, Atsuro', 'Okubo, Saki', 'Nino, Nanako', 'Tahara, Teppei', 'Yokoi, Takehito', 'Kishimoto, Kenji', 'Ishida, Toshiaki', 'Hasegawa, Daiichiro', 'Kawasaki, Keiichiro', 'Yoshimoto, Seiji', 'Nakao, Hideto', 'Yoshida, Makiko', 'Kosaka, Yoshiyuki']","['Tamura A', 'Uemura S', 'Saito A', 'Okubo S', 'Nino N', 'Tahara T', 'Yokoi T', 'Kishimoto K', 'Ishida T', 'Hasegawa D', 'Kawasaki K', 'Yoshimoto S', 'Nakao H', 'Yoshida M', 'Kosaka Y']",,"[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Cancer Center, Hyogo Prefectural Kobe Children's Hospital, Minatojima-Minamimachi 1-6-7, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0047, Japan. tamura_kch@hp.pref.hyogo.jp."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Cancer Center, Hyogo Prefectural Kobe Children's Hospital, Minatojima-Minamimachi 1-6-7, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0047, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Cancer Center, Hyogo Prefectural Kobe Children's Hospital, Minatojima-Minamimachi 1-6-7, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0047, Japan."", ""Department of Neonatology, Hyogo Prefectural Kobe Children's Hospital, Minatojima-Minamimachi 1-6-7, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0047, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Cancer Center, Hyogo Prefectural Kobe Children's Hospital, Minatojima-Minamimachi 1-6-7, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0047, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Cancer Center, Hyogo Prefectural Kobe Children's Hospital, Minatojima-Minamimachi 1-6-7, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0047, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Cancer Center, Hyogo Prefectural Kobe Children's Hospital, Minatojima-Minamimachi 1-6-7, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0047, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Cancer Center, Hyogo Prefectural Kobe Children's Hospital, Minatojima-Minamimachi 1-6-7, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0047, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Cancer Center, Hyogo Prefectural Kobe Children's Hospital, Minatojima-Minamimachi 1-6-7, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0047, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Cancer Center, Hyogo Prefectural Kobe Children's Hospital, Minatojima-Minamimachi 1-6-7, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0047, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Cancer Center, Hyogo Prefectural Kobe Children's Hospital, Minatojima-Minamimachi 1-6-7, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0047, Japan."", ""Department of Neonatology, Hyogo Prefectural Kobe Children's Hospital, Minatojima-Minamimachi 1-6-7, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0047, Japan."", ""Department of Neonatology, Hyogo Prefectural Kobe Children's Hospital, Minatojima-Minamimachi 1-6-7, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0047, Japan."", ""Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Hyogo Prefectural Kobe Children's Hospital, Minatojima-Minamimachi 1-6-7, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0047, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Cancer Center, Hyogo Prefectural Kobe Children's Hospital, Minatojima-Minamimachi 1-6-7, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0047, Japan.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20170518,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/*blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', '*Blast Crisis/blood/congenital/therapy', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/blood/congenital/therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood']",,2017/05/20 06:00,2018/01/09 06:00,['2017/05/20 06:00'],"['2017/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/02 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/09 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-017-2248-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-017-2248-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2017 Nov;106(5):711-717. doi: 10.1007/s12185-017-2248-7.

HD is inherited in a dominant fashion, and the underlying mutation in all cases is a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion within exon 1 of the HD gene (Cell 72:971-983, 1993). The expanded CAG repeat, translated into a lengthened glutamine tract at the amino terminus of the huntingtin protein, affects its structural properties and functional activities. The effects are pleiotropic, as huntingtin is broadly expressed in different cellular compartments (i.e., cytosol, nucleus, mitochondria) as well as in all cell types of the body at all developmental stages, such that HD pathogenesis likely starts at conception and is a lifelong process (Front Neurosci 9:509, 2015). The rate-limiting mechanism(s) of neurodegeneration in HD still remains elusive: many different processes are commonly disrupted in HD cell lines and animal models, as well as in HD patient cells (Eur J Neurosci 27:2803-2820, 2008); however, epigenetic-chromatin deregulation, as determined by the analysis of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNAs, has now become a prevailing feature. Thus, the overarching goal of this chapter is to discuss the current status of the literature, reviewing how an aberrant epigenetic landscape can contribute to altered gene expression and neuronal dysfunction in HD.","['Bassi, Silvia', 'Tripathi, Takshashila', 'Monziani, Alan', 'Di Leva, Francesca', 'Biagioli, Marta']","['Bassi S', 'Tripathi T', 'Monziani A', 'Di Leva F', 'Biagioli M']",,"['The NeuroEpigenetics Laboratory, Centre for Integrative Biology, University of Trento, Via Sommarive 9, 38123, Povo (TN), Italy.', 'The NeuroEpigenetics Laboratory, Centre for Integrative Biology, University of Trento, Via Sommarive 9, 38123, Povo (TN), Italy.', 'The NeuroEpigenetics Laboratory, Centre for Integrative Biology, University of Trento, Via Sommarive 9, 38123, Povo (TN), Italy.', 'The NeuroEpigenetics Laboratory, Centre for Integrative Biology, University of Trento, Via Sommarive 9, 38123, Povo (TN), Italy.', 'The NeuroEpigenetics Laboratory, Centre for Integrative Biology, University of Trento, Via Sommarive 9, 38123, Povo (TN), Italy. marta.biagioli@unitn.it.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (HTT protein, human)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Huntingtin Protein)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/genetics', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Histone Code/genetics', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Histone Deacetylases/physiology', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Huntingtin Protein/*genetics', 'Huntington Disease/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins/physiology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/genetics', 'RNA, Untranslated/genetics']",,2017/05/20 06:00,2017/09/28 06:00,['2017/05/20 06:00'],"['2017/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-3-319-53889-1_15 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2017;978:277-299. doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-53889-1_15.,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAG repeat expansion', '*Chromatin', '*Epigenetic', '*Histone acetylation/deacetylation', '*Histone and DNA methylation/demethylation', ""*Huntington's disease (HD)"", '*Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)', '*Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs)', '*miRNAs']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the basis of FXIII-A expression, various subgroups of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) can be identified. Fifty-five children with BCP-ALL were included in the study. Bone marrow samples were obtained by aspiration and the presence of FXIII-A was detected by flow cytometry. G-banding and fluorescent in situ hybridization was performed according to standard procedures. The 10-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rate of FXIII-A-positive and FXIII-A-negative patients showed significant differences (EFS: 84% vs. 61%, respectively; p = 0.031; OS: 89% vs. 61%; p = 0.008). Of all the parameters examined, there was correlation only between FXIII-A expression and 'B-other' genetic subgroup. Further multivariate Cox regression analysis of FXIII-subtype and genetic group or 'B-other' subgroup identified the FXIII-A negative characteristic as an independent factor associated with poor outcome in BCP-ALL. We found an excellent correlation between long-term survival and the FXIII-A-positive phenotype of BCP lymphoblasts at presentation. The results presented seem to be convincing enough to suggest a possible role for FXIII-A expression in the prognostic grouping of childhood BCP-ALL patients.","['Karai, Bettina', 'Hevessy, Zsuzsanna', 'Szantho, Eszter', 'Csathy, Laszlo', 'Ujfalusi, Aniko', 'Gyurina, Katalin', 'Szegedi, Istvan', 'Kappelmayer, Janos', 'Kiss, Csongor']","['Karai B', 'Hevessy Z', 'Szantho E', 'Csathy L', 'Ujfalusi A', 'Gyurina K', 'Szegedi I', 'Kappelmayer J', 'Kiss C']",,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Nagyerdei krt 98, Debrecen, 4032, Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Nagyerdei krt 98, Debrecen, 4032, Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Nagyerdei krt 98, Debrecen, 4032, Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Nagyerdei krt 98, Debrecen, 4032, Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Nagyerdei krt 98, Debrecen, 4032, Hungary.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Institute of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Nagyerdei krt 98, Debrecen, H-4032, Hungary.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Institute of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Nagyerdei krt 98, Debrecen, H-4032, Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Nagyerdei krt 98, Debrecen, 4032, Hungary.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Institute of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Nagyerdei krt 98, Debrecen, H-4032, Hungary. kisscs@med.unideb.hu.']",['eng'],['K-108885/OTKA'],['Journal Article'],20170518,Switzerland,Pathol Oncol Res,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '9013-56-3 (Factor XIII)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Factor XIII/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,2017/05/20 06:00,2018/08/29 06:00,['2017/05/20 06:00'],"['2016/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12253-017-0236-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s12253-017-0236-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Pathol Oncol Res. 2018 Apr;24(2):345-352. doi: 10.1007/s12253-017-0236-0.

ARDAP derivative 10 inhibited the proliferation of BCR/ABL-expressing KU812 and LAMA84 cells from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients in blast crisis and of hematopoietic cells ectopically expressing the imatinib mesylate (IM)-sensitive KBM5-WT or its IM-resistant KBM5-T315I mutation. Compound 10 minimally affected the proliferation of normal blood cells, indicating that it may be a promising agent to overcome broad tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in relapsed/refractory CML patients. Compound 10 significantly decreased CML proliferation by inducing G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis via a mitochondria-dependent pathway. ARDAP 10 augmented the cytotoxic effects of IM in human CML cells.

However, resistance to EGFR and ALK inhibitors inevitably occurs, and the molecular mechanism underlying resistance is not fully understood. In this study, we report a PI3K/Akt- and MEK/ERK-independent resistance mechanism by which loss of the E3 ubiquitin ligase F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7 (FBW7alpha) leads to targeted therapy resistance via stabilization of antiapoptotic protein MCL-1. Using a panel of in vitro and in vivo studies, we showed that the regulatory machinery responsible for MCL-1 protein degradation was a step-wise event involving phosphorylation and nucleus translocation. ERK cooperated with GSKbeta to phosphorylate MCL-1 Ser159 residue, which enabled MCL-1 to translocate into the nucleus and bind FBW7. Defects in this sequence impaired MCL-1 degradation and cell apoptosis, recapitulating phenotypes observed in FBW7 deficiency. Downregulation of FBW7 was found in EGFR inhibitor-resistant human NSCLC specimens and correlated with increased MCL-1 protein expression. Reactivation of FBW7 sensitized resistant cells to targeted therapy and facilitated MCL-1 degradation. Overall, our study provides proof-of-principle insight into a PI3K/Akt- and MEK/ERK-independent resistant model and suggests that targeting FBW7 can overcome resistance to targeted therapy.

However, questions remain unanswered regarding the biological basis of molecular relapse after imatinib cessation. In IMMUNOSTIM, we monitored 51 patients from the French Stop IMatinib trial for peripheral blood T cells and natural killer cells. Molecular relapse-free survival at 24 months was 45.1% (95% CI: 31.44%-58.75%). At the time of imatinib discontinuation, non-relapsing patients had significantly higher numbers of natural killer cells of the cytotoxic CD56(dim) subset than had relapsing patients, while CD56(bright) natural killer cells, T cells and their subsets did not differ significantly. Furthermore, the CD56(dim) natural killer-cell count was an independent prognostic factor of molecular-relapse free survival in a multivariate analysis. However, expression of natural killer-cell activating receptors, BCR-ABL1(+) leukemia cell line K562-specific degranulation and cytokine-induced interferon-gamma secretion were decreased in non-relapsing and relapsing patients as compared with healthy individuals. After imatinib cessation, the natural killer-cell count increased significantly and stayed higher in non-relapsing patients than in relapsing patients, while receptor expression and functional properties remained unchanged. Altogether, our results suggest that natural killer cells may play a role in controlling leukemia-initiating cells at the origin of relapse after imatinib cessation, provided that these cells are numerous enough to compensate for their functional defects. Further research will decipher mechanisms underlying functional differences between natural killer cells from patients and healthy individuals and evaluate the potential interest of immunostimulatory approaches in tyrosine kinase inhibitor discontinuation strategies.

We developed a complete mass cytometry analysis pipeline for characterization of intracellular signal transduction patterns in the major leukocyte subsets of chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia. Changes in phosphorylated Bcr-Abl1 and the signaling pathways involved were readily identifiable in peripheral blood single cells already within three hours of the patient receiving oral nilotinib. The signal transduction profiles of healthy donors were clearly distinct from those of the patients at diagnosis. Furthermore, using principal component analysis, we could show that phosphorylated transcription factors STAT3 (Y705) and CREB (S133) within seven days reflected BCR-ABL1(IS) at three and six months.

This function is impaired upon phosphorylation of p27 at tyrosine residue 88. We observed that FLT3 and FLT3-ITD can directly bind and selectively phosphorylate p27 on this residue. Inhibition of FLT3-ITD in cell lines strongly reduced p27 tyrosine 88 phosphorylation and resulted in increased p27 levels and cell cycle arrest. Subsequent analysis revealed the presence of tyrosine 88 phosphorylated p27 in primary patient samples. Inhibition of FLT3 kinase activity with AC220 significantly reduced p27 tyrosine 88 phosphorylation in cells isolated from FLT3 wild type expressing acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. In FLT3-ITD positive AML patients, p27 tyrosine 88 phosphorylation was reduced in 5 out of 9 subjects, but, surprisingly, was increased in 4 patients. This indicated that other tyrosine kinases such as Src family kinases might contribute to p27 tyrosine 88 phosphorylation in FLT3-ITD positive AML cells. In fact, incubation with the Src family kinase inhibitor dasatinib could decrease p27 tyrosine 88 phosphorylation in these patient samples, indicating that p27 phosphorylated on tyrosine 88 may be a therapeutic marker for the treatment of AML patients with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Peschel, Ines', 'Podmirseg, Silvio R', 'Taschler, Martin', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Gotze, Katharina S', 'Sill, Heinz', 'Nachbaur, David', 'Jakel, Heidelinde', 'Hengst, Ludger']","['Peschel I', 'Podmirseg SR', 'Taschler M', 'Duyster J', 'Gotze KS', 'Sill H', 'Nachbaur D', 'Jakel H', 'Hengst L']",,"['Division of Medical Biochemistry, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Division of Medical Biochemistry, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Division of Medical Biochemistry, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Division of Medical Biochemistry, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria heidelinde.jaekel@i-med.ac.at.', 'Division of Medical Biochemistry, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170518,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*metabolism']",PMC5541872,2017/05/20 06:00,2018/06/26 06:00,['2017/05/20 06:00'],"['2016/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2016.160101 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2016.160101 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2017 Aug;102(8):1378-1389. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.160101.

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a member of the IL-6 cytokine family, is a critical determinant of lung tissue protection during pneumonia, but the cellular sources of LIF and the signaling pathways leading to its production in the infected lung are not known. Here, we demonstrate that lung epithelium, specifically alveolar type II cells, is the predominant site of LIF transcript induction in pneumonic mouse lungs. Epithelial cell cultures were induced to express LIF by bacteria and by sterile bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from pneumonic mice. Reciprocal bone marrow chimera studies demonstrated that LIF deficiency in the nonhematopoietic compartment, but not LIF deficiency in hematopoietic cells, eliminated LIF induction during pneumonia. Although NF-kappaB RelA (p65) is essential for the expression of many cytokines during pneumonia, its targeted mutation in the lung epithelium was inconsequential for pneumonia-driven LIF induction. However, maximal expression of this epithelial-derived cytokine was dependent on NF-kappaB RelA in myeloid cells. Overall, our data suggest a signaling axis whereby activation of NF-kappaB RelA in myeloid cells promotes epithelial LIF induction during lung infections, representing a means through which these two cell types collaborate to improve tissue resilience during pneumonia.","['Traber, Katrina E', 'Symer, Elise M', 'Allen, Eri', 'Kim, Yuri', 'Hilliard, Kristie L', 'Wasserman, Gregory A', 'Stewart, Colin L', 'Jones, Matthew R', 'Mizgerd, Joseph P', 'Quinton, Lee J']","['Traber KE', 'Symer EM', 'Allen E', 'Kim Y', 'Hilliard KL', 'Wasserman GA', 'Stewart CL', 'Jones MR', 'Mizgerd JP', 'Quinton LJ']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8534-4480'],"['Pulmonary Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Pulmonary Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Pulmonary Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Pulmonary Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Pulmonary Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Pulmonary Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Institute of Medical Biology, Singapore.', 'Pulmonary Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Pulmonary Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts; and.', 'Pulmonary Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts; lquinton@bu.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL104053/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM120060/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 HL135756/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI115053/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007035/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HL130582/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL111449/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20170518,United States,Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,American journal of physiology.

Among them, promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) are involved in multiple genome maintenance pathways including the DNA damage response, DNA repair, telomere homeostasis, and p53-associated apoptosis. In response to DNA damage, PML-NBs are coalesced and divided by a fission mechanism, thus increasing their number. PML-NBs also play a role in repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination (HR). Clinically, the dominant negative PML-RARalpha fusion protein expressed in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) inhibits the transactivation of downstream factors and disrupts PML function, revealing the tumor suppressor role of PML-NBs. All-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide treatment has been implemented for promyelocytic leukemia to target the PML-RARalpha fusion protein. PML-NBs are associated with various factors implicated in genome maintenance, and are found at the sites of DNA damage. Their interaction with proteins such as p53 indicates that PML-NBs may play a significant role in apoptosis and cancer.

In tumor cells, CD30 expression is most commonly associated with lymphoid malignancies (Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas) and is a therapeutic target using anti-CD30 antibody. CD30 expression has been reported also in mostly adult non-lymphoid malignancies, raising the possibility of CD30-targeted therapy for additional tumors. In this study, we examined the incidence of CD30 expression in 251 hematopoietic and 334 non-hematopoietic cases of pediatric tumors. As expected, strong and membranous CD30 staining was seen in anaplastic large cell lymphoma, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and embryonal carcinoma while variable staining was seen in diffuse large B cell lymphoma. In addition, positive CD30 staining was also seen in cases of neuroblastoma (33 of 56), neoplasm with chondroid differentiation (8 of 25), myeloid neoplasms (11 of 120), hemangioma (2 of 12), and mature teratoma (1 of 11). In neuroblastoma, the CD30 expression was generally restricted to cells with ganglion differentiation; staining of ganglion cells was also seen in the one positive case of mature teratoma. In neoplasm with chondroid differentiation, the positive cases were chondrosarcoma (3 of 5), chondroblastic osteosarcoma (2 of 10), and chondroblastoma (3 of 7). In acute myeloid leukemia, the CD30 positive cases were more common in AML with monocytic differentiation but did not correlate with any specific molecular change. We conclude that CD30 expression in pediatric tumors is more general than anticipated and future studies are warranted to understand the biologic and therapeutic significances.","['Cheng, Jinjun', 'Zhu, Haiqing', 'Choi, John Kim']","['Cheng J', 'Zhu H', 'Choi JK']",,"['1 Department of Pathology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.', ""2 Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""2 Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170208,United States,Pediatr Dev Pathol,Pediatric and developmental pathology : the official journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology and the Paediatric Pathology Society,9809673,['0 (Ki-1 Antigen)'],IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ki-1 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*metabolism/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2017/05/20 06:00,2019/04/16 06:00,['2017/05/20 06:00'],"['2017/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1093526616689185 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Dev Pathol. 2017 Jun;20(3):191-196. doi: 10.1177/1093526616689185.

Here, we describe the patient, disease characteristics, pathological, molecular, and genetic features and outcomes of patients with CD36+ B-LL compared to patients with CD36- B-LL. Methods We retrospectively reviewed all flow cytometry reports from September 2008 to December 2015 to identify patients diagnosed at our institution with CD36 expression on B lymphoblasts. CD36- control patients were chosen from our leukemia database and matched 2:1 to CD36+ patients for National Cancer Institute (NCI) risk group at diagnosis. We reviewed diagnostic marrow slides for cytoplasmic granules and abstracted clinical data from patient charts. To identify underlying genetic abnormalities, clinical FISH testing and RNA sequencing was performed on 5 of our CD36+ patients, and RNA-seq data from the NIH Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) ALL Expansion Phase 2 data set were examined. Results Twenty-five of 366 (6.83%) patients diagnosed at our institution in the study period had CD36+ blasts. With a median follow-up of 5.32 years, 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly worse for CD36+ patients compared to CD36- patients who were NCI Standard Risk at diagnosis (EFS: 60% +/- 15.49 vs 95% +/- 4.87, P = .016; OS: 90% +/- 9.5 vs 100%, P = .019). NCI Standard Risk patients whose blasts were both CD36+ and had granules had the worst survival compared to CD36- patients without granules (EFS 25% +/- 21.65 vs 95% +/- 4.87, P = .0004). From our CD36+ patients and the TARGET database, we found 2 ABL2 mutations, 1 PDGFRB mutation, and 2 NRAS mutations. Conclusions For NCI Standard Risk patients, CD36 expression on B-lymphoblasts identifies patients with B-LL who have especially poor outcome. This may be due to underlying genetic abnormalities that may be amenable to targeted therapy.","['Newton, Joanna G', 'Horan, John T', 'Newman, Scott', 'Rossi, Michael R', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Park, Sunita I']","['Newton JG', 'Horan JT', 'Newman S', 'Rossi MR', 'Ketterling RP', 'Park SI']",,"[""1 Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta - Scottish Rite, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."", ""2 Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta -Egleston, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."", '3 Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', ""4 Department of Radiation Oncology, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."", '5 Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', ""6 Department of Pathology, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta - Egleston, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170208,United States,Pediatr Dev Pathol,Pediatric and developmental pathology : the official journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology and the Paediatric Pathology Society,9809673,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD36 Antigens)', '0 (CD36 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'CD36 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",,2017/05/20 06:00,2019/04/16 06:00,['2017/05/20 06:00'],"['2017/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1093526616688753 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Dev Pathol. 2017 Jun;20(3):224-231. doi: 10.1177/1093526616688753.

Whether the ALT pathway can be exploited for therapeutic treatment remains unknown. The purpose of this study is to develop oncotherapeutic agent to target ALT cancers. Methods: Surface plasmon resonance assay, antibody to G-quadruplex, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to discover Tetra-Pt(bpy), a cisplatin derivative that specifically targets telomeric G-quadruplex. We used immunofluorescence, FISH, C-circle assay, and chromosome orientation FISH to evaluate the inhibitory effect of Tetra-Pt(bpy) on ALT activity in human ALT cancers. The shortening of telomere length induced by Tetra-Pt(bpy) was determined by telomere restriction fragment or Q-FISH. Cell destination after Tetra-Pt(bpy) treatment was determined by beta-gal staining or apoptosis assay. Nude mice (n = 4 per group) were injected with U2OS cells to evaluate the effects of Tetra-Pt(bpy) on tumor growth. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Tetra-Pt(bpy) inhibits the strand invasion/annealing step of telomeric homologous recombination by selectively converting telomeric ssDNA to a G-quadruplex. ALT-cells treated with Tetra-Pt(bpy) show fewer ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies (untreated: mean+/-SD = 5.9+/-0.2 vs treated: mean+/-SD = 3.1+/-0.1, P < .001), fewer extrachromosomal C-circles (untreated: mean+/-SD = 100.5+/-1.6 vs treated: mean+/-SD = 18.0+/-1.7, P < .001), and reduced telomere sister chromatin exchanges (untreated: mean+/-SD = 25.2%+/-1.5% vs treated: mean+/-SD = 13.1%+/-1.9%, P < .001). Consequently, critically short telomeres accumulate after multiple population doublings (untreated: mean+/-SD = 18.9%+/-1.7% vs treated: mean+/-SD = 57.4%+/-2.2%, P < .001), resulting in cell death by apoptosis or senescence. In vivo, Tetra-Pt(bpy) severely inhibits the growth of ALT-cell xenograft tumors in mice (untreated: mean+/-SD = 57.1+/-3.7 mm 3 vs treated: mean+/-SD = 19.0+/-3.2 mm 3 , P < .001). Importantly, Tetra-Pt(bpy) exhibits no adverse effects on proliferation, gene expression, or telomere metabolism in normal cells. Conclusions: These results reveal the potential of Tetra-Pt(bpy) as a novel oncotherapeutic agent for targeting ALT cancer cells.","['Zheng, Xiao-Hui', 'Nie, Xin', 'Fang, Yiming', 'Zhang, Zepeng', 'Xiao, Yingnan', 'Mao, Zongwan', 'Liu, Haiying', 'Ren, Jian', 'Wang, Feng', 'Xia, Lixin', 'Huang, Junjiu', 'Zhao, Yong']","['Zheng XH', 'Nie X', 'Fang Y', 'Zhang Z', 'Xiao Y', 'Mao Z', 'Liu H', 'Ren J', 'Wang F', 'Xia L', 'Huang J', 'Zhao Y']",,"['Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, P.

MRTs are driven by loss of tumor suppressor SNF5/INI1/SMARCB1/BAF47. The prognosis of MRT is poor using currently available treatments, so new treatment targets need to be identified to expand treatment options for patients experiencing chemotherapy resistance. The growth hormone insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) signaling pathway is a promising target to overcome drug resistance in many cancers. Here, we evaluated the role of IGF2 axis in MRT cell proliferation. We showed that microenvironment stress, including starvation treatment and chemotherapy exposure, lead to elevated expression of IGF2 in the SNF5-deficient MRT cell line. The autocrine IGF2, in turn, activated insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), insulin receptor (INSR), followed by PI3K/AKT pathway and RAS/ERK pathway to promote cancer cell proliferation and survival.

However, cardiotoxicity, especially long QT syndrome (LQTS) has become the most important issue during As2O3 treatment. The characterized mechanisms behind this adverse effect are inhibition of cardiac hERG channel trafficking and increase of cardiac calcium currents. In our study, we found a new pathway underlying As2O3-induced cardiotoxicity that As2O3 accelerates lysosomal degradation of hERG on plasma membrane after using brefeldin A (BFA) to block protein trafficking. Then we explored pharmacological rescue strategies on As2O3-induced LQTS, and found that 4 therapeutic agents exert rescue efficacy via 3 different pathways: fexofenadine and astemizole facilitate hERG trafficking via promotion of channel-chaperone formation after As2O3 incubation; ranolazine slows hERG degradation in the presence of As2O3; and resveratrol shows significant attenuation on calcium current increase triggered by As2O3. Moreover, we used human-induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs) to evaluate the rescue effects of the above agents on As2O3-induced prolongation of action potential duration (APD) and demonstrated that fexofenadine and resveratrol significantly ameliorate the prolonged APD. These observations suggested that pharmacological chaperone like fexofenadine and resveratrol might have the potential to protect against the cardiotoxicity of As2O3.","['Yan, Meng', 'Feng, Lifang', 'Shi, Yanhui', 'Wang, Junnan', 'Liu, Yan', 'Li, Fengmei', 'Li, Baoxin']","['Yan M', 'Feng L', 'Shi Y', 'Wang J', 'Liu Y', 'Li F', 'Li B']",,"['Department of Pharmacology Harbin Medical University, Nangang District, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province 150086, China.', 'Translational Medicine Research and Cooperation Center of Northern China, Heilongjiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Nangang District, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province 150081, China.', 'Translational Medicine Research and Cooperation Center of Northern China, Heilongjiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Nangang District, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province 150081, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology Harbin Medical University, Nangang District, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province 150086, China.', 'Translational Medicine Research and Cooperation Center of Northern China, Heilongjiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Nangang District, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province 150081, China.', 'Translational Medicine Research and Cooperation Center of Northern China, Heilongjiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Nangang District, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province 150081, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology Harbin Medical University, Nangang District, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province 150086, China.', 'Translational Medicine Research and Cooperation Center of Northern China, Heilongjiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Nangang District, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province 150081, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology Harbin Medical University, Nangang District, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province 150086, China.', 'Translational Medicine Research and Cooperation Center of Northern China, Heilongjiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Nangang District, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province 150081, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology Harbin Medical University, Nangang District, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province 150086, China.', 'Translational Medicine Research and Cooperation Center of Northern China, Heilongjiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Nangang District, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province 150081, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (ERG1 Potassium Channel)', '0 (KCNH2 protein, human)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '7BA5G9Y06Q (Terfenadine)', 'E6582LOH6V (fexofenadine)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Action Potentials/*drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'ERG1 Potassium Channel/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Long QT Syndrome/chemically induced', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*cytology', 'Oxides/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Proteolysis', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/pharmacology', 'Terfenadine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,2017/05/19 06:00,2018/06/05 06:00,['2017/05/19 06:00'],"['2017/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['3829628 [pii]', '10.1093/toxsci/kfx098 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2017 Aug 1;158(2):379-390. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/kfx098.,['NOTNLM'],"['*As2O3', '*action potential prolongation', '*calcium current', '*hERG degradation', '*hiPS-CMs', '*pharmacological rescue']",,"['(c) The Author 2017.

The role of co-activators in establishing this long-range interaction is poorly understood. Here we tested the contributions of the RNA Pol II pre-initiation complex (PIC), mediator and cohesin to establishment of locus control region (LCR)/beta-globin proximity. CRISPR/Cas9 editing of the beta-globin promoter to eliminate the RNA Pol II PIC by deleting the TATA-box resulted in loss of transcription, but enhancer-promoter interaction was unaffected. Additional deletion of the promoter GATA1 site eliminated LDB1 complex and mediator occupancy and resulted in loss of LCR/beta-globin proximity. To separate the roles of LDB1 and mediator in LCR looping, we expressed a looping-competent but transcription-activation deficient form of LDB1 in LDB1 knock down cells: LCR/beta-globin proximity was restored without mediator core occupancy. Further, Cas9-directed tethering of mutant LDB1 to the beta-globin promoter forced LCR loop formation in the absence of mediator or cohesin occupancy. Moreover, ENCODE data and our chromatin immunoprecipitation results indicate that cohesin is almost completely absent from validated and predicted LDB1-regulated erythroid enhancer-gene pairs. Thus, lineage specific factors largely mediate enhancer-promoter looping in erythroid cells independent of mediator and cohesin.","['Krivega, Ivan', 'Dean, Ann']","['Krivega I', 'Dean A']",,"['Laboratory of Cellular and Developmental Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Developmental Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Ldb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (beta-Globins)', '0 (cohesins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'LIM Domain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Locus Control Region/genetics', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'beta-Globins/genetics']",PMC5737898,2017/05/19 06:00,2017/10/24 06:00,['2017/05/19 06:00'],"['2017/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['3831094 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkx433 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2017 Aug 21;45(14):8255-8268. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkx433.,,,,['Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research 2017.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we show that in the human and baboon decidua HOXA10 expression is downregulated after implantation and that this reduction is most prominent in the decidual cells juxtaposed to the invading placental villi. The supernatants derived from HOXA10-depleted human decidual cells increase the invasiveness of the trophoblast cell lines ACH-3P and JEG3 in vitro; this increase is due to higher expression and activity of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) and reduced expression of tissue inhibitors of MMPs in both the cell lines. The proinvasive ability of HOXA10-depleted decidual cells is due to increased levels and secretion of leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF) and interleukin (IL)-6. Both these cytokines individually promote invasion of ACH-3P and JEG3 cell by increasing the activities of MMPs and decreasing mRNA levels of TIMPs. Finally, we demonstrate that the supernatants derived from HOXA10-depleted decidual cell-phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr 705) and knocking down STAT3 in ACH-3P and JEG3 cells restrained the invasion mediated by supernatants derived from HOXA10-depleted decidual cells. These results imply that STAT3 activity is essential and sufficient to promote invasion in response to downregulation of HOXA10 in decidual cells. We propose that downregulation of HOXA10 in the decidual cells promotes the expression of LIF and IL-6, which, in a paracrine manner, activates STAT3 in the trophoblast cells, leading to an increase in MMPs to facilitate invasion.","['Godbole, Geeta', 'Suman, Pankaj', 'Malik, Ankita', 'Galvankar, Mosami', 'Joshi, Niraj', 'Fazleabas, Asgerally', 'Gupta, Satish Kumar', 'Modi, Deepak']","['Godbole G', 'Suman P', 'Malik A', 'Galvankar M', 'Joshi N', 'Fazleabas A', 'Gupta SK', 'Modi D']",,"['Molecular and Cellular Biology Laboratory, National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health, Indian Council of Medical Research, Parel, Mumbai 400012, India.', 'Reproductive Cell Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi 110067, India.', 'Reproductive Cell Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi 110067, India.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology Laboratory, National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health, Indian Council of Medical Research, Parel, Mumbai 400012, India.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynaecology & Reproductive Biology, Michigan State University, Grand Rapids, Michigan 49503.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynaecology & Reproductive Biology, Michigan State University, Grand Rapids, Michigan 49503.', ""Department of Women's Health, Spectrum Health System, Grand Rapids, Michigan 49341."", 'Reproductive Cell Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi 110067, India.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology Laboratory, National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health, Indian Council of Medical Research, Parel, Mumbai 400012, India.']",['eng'],['R01 HD042280/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '140441-81-2 (HOXA10 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Down-Regulation', 'Embryo Implantation/*physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Trophoblasts/*physiology']",PMC6283436,2017/05/19 06:00,2017/09/25 06:00,['2017/05/19 06:00'],"['2017/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['3828770 [pii]', '10.1210/en.2017-00032 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2017 Aug 1;158(8):2618-2633. doi: 10.1210/en.2017-00032.,,,,['Copyright (c) 2017 Endocrine Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BIRC6 has been implicated in drug resistance in several different human cancers, however mechanisms regulating BIRC6 have not been extensively explored. Our phosphoproteomic analysis of an imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line (MYL-R) identified increased amounts of a BIRC6 peptide phosphorylated at S480, S482, and S486 compared to imatinib-sensitive CML cells (MYL). Thus we investigated the role of BIRC6 in mediating imatinib resistance and compared it to the well-characterized anti-apoptotic protein, Mcl-1. Both BIRC6 and Mcl-1 were elevated in MYL-R compared to MYL cells. Lentiviral shRNA knockdown of BIRC6 in MYL-R cells increased imatinib-stimulated caspase activation and resulted in a ~20-25-fold increase in imatinib sensitivity, without affecting Mcl-1. Treating MYL-R cells with CDK9 inhibitors decreased BIRC6 mRNA, but not BIRC6 protein levels. By contrast, while CDK9 inhibitors reduced Mcl-1 mRNA and protein, they did not affect imatinib sensitivity. Since the Src family kinase Lyn is highly expressed and active in MYL-R cells, we tested the effects of Lyn inhibition on BIRC6 and Mcl-1. RNAi-mediated knockdown or inhibition of Lyn (dasatinib/ponatinib) reduced BIRC6 protein stability and increased caspase activation. Inhibition of Lyn also increased formation of an N-terminal BIRC6 fragment in parallel with reduced amount of the BIRC6 phosphopeptide, suggesting that Lyn may regulate BIRC6 phosphorylation and stability. In summary, our data show that BIRC6 stability is dependent on Lyn, and that BIRC6 mediates imatinib sensitivity independently of Mcl-1 or CDK9. Hence, BIRC6 may be a novel target for the treatment of drug-resistant CML where Mcl-1 or CDK9 inhibitors have failed.","['Okumu, Denis O', 'East, Michael P', 'Levine, Merlin', 'Herring, Laura E', 'Zhang, Raymond', 'Gilbert, Thomas S K', 'Litchfield, David W', 'Zhang, Yanping', 'Graves, Lee M']","['Okumu DO', 'East MP', 'Levine M', 'Herring LE', 'Zhang R', 'Gilbert TSK', 'Litchfield DW', 'Zhang Y', 'Graves LM']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4791-0453'],"['Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'UNC Michael Hooker Proteomics Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'UNC Michael Hooker Proteomics Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'UNC Michael Hooker Proteomics Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.']",['eng'],['T32 GM007040/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20170516,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BIRC6 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK9 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*toxicity', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",PMC5433768,2017/05/19 06:00,2017/09/07 06:00,['2017/05/19 06:00'],"['2016/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0177871 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-32385 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 May 16;12(5):e0177871. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0177871. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Donor natural killer (NK) cell alloreactivity in HCT can control leukemic relapse, but capturing alloreactivity in HLA-matched HCT has been elusive. HLA expression on leukemia cells-upregulated in the post-HCT environment-signals for NK cell inhibition via inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like (KIR) receptors and interrupts their antitumor activity. We hypothesized that varied strengths of inhibition among subtypes of the ubiquitous KIR3DL1 and its cognate ligand, HLA-B, would titrate NK reactivity against acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Patients and Methods By using an algorithm that was based on polymorphism-driven expression levels and specificities, we predicted and tested inhibitory and cytotoxic NK potential on the basis of KIR3DL1/HLA-B subtype combinations in vitro and evaluated their impact in 1,328 patients with AML who underwent HCT from 9/10 or 10/10 HLA-matched unrelated donors. Results Segregated by KIR3DL1 subtype, NK cells demonstrated reproducible patterns of strong, weak, or noninhibition by target cells with defined HLA-B subtypes, which translated into discrete cytotoxic hierarchies against AML. In patients, KIR3DL1 and HLA-B subtype combinations that were predictive of weak inhibition or noninhibition were associated with significantly lower relapse (hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; P = .004) and overall mortality (HR, 0.84; P = .030) compared with strong inhibition combinations. The greatest effects were evident in the high-risk group of patients with all KIR ligands (relapse: HR, 0.54; P < .001; and mortality: HR, 0.74; P < .008). Beneficial effects of weak and noninhibiting KIR3DL1 and HLA-B subtype combinations were separate from and additive to the benefit of donor activating KIR2DS1. Conclusion Consideration of KIR3DL1-mediated inhibition in donor selection for HLA-matched HCT may achieve superior graft versus leukemia effects, lower risk for relapse, and an increase in survival among patients with AML.","['Boudreau, Jeanette E', 'Giglio, Fabio', 'Gooley, Ted A', 'Stevenson, Philip A', 'Le Luduec, Jean-Benoit', 'Shaffer, Brian C', 'Rajalingam, Raja', 'Hou, Lihua', 'Hurley, Carolyn Katovich', 'Noreen, Harriet', 'Reed, Elaine F', 'Yu, Neng', 'Vierra-Green, Cynthia', 'Haagenson, Michael', 'Malkki, Mari', 'Petersdorf, Effie W', 'Spellman, Stephen', 'Hsu, Katharine C']","['Boudreau JE', 'Giglio F', 'Gooley TA', 'Stevenson PA', 'Le Luduec JB', 'Shaffer BC', 'Rajalingam R', 'Hou L', 'Hurley CK', 'Noreen H', 'Reed EF', 'Yu N', 'Vierra-Green C', 'Haagenson M', 'Malkki M', 'Petersdorf EW', 'Spellman S', 'Hsu KC']",,"['Jeanette E.

28520351,,Publisher,,,,,,2012,Thioguanine Therapy and TPMT and NUDT15 Genotype,,,"Thioguanine (brand name Tabloid) is used to treat acute nonlymphocytic leukemias, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Thioguanine is an analogue of the nucleic acid guanine and belongs to the drug class of thiopurines. Thioguanine is a prodrug that must first be activated to form thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs), the major active metabolites. The active metabolites are metabolized and inactivated by the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and the enzyme nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15). Individuals with reduced activity of either enzyme are exposed to higher levels of thioguanine and have a higher risk of toxicity side effects, including severe bone marrow suppression (myelosuppression). The FDA-approved drug label states that testing for TPMT and NUDT15 deficiency should be considered in individuals who experience severe bone marrow toxicities or repeated episodes of myelosuppression. The label also includes dosing recommendations for when TPMT or NUDT15, or both, genotypes are known. For individuals with a pharmacogenetic deficiency in either enzyme, the initial dose of thioguanine should be reduced, and individuals who have a deficiency in both enzymes may require more substantial dose reductions. The label notes that individuals with a complete deficiency of either enzyme often continue to require a lower dose, which is 10% or less than the standard thioguanine dose (Table 1) (1). Dosing recommendations for thioguanine based on TPMT and NUDT15 genotype have also been published by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) and the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG). Both the CPIC and DPWG guidelines recommend substantial dose reductions for individuals who have low or deficient enzyme activity, including considering an alternative drug to thioguanine, particularly when treating a non-malignant condition (Table 2, Table 3) (2-4).","['Dean, Laura']",['Dean L'],,,['eng'],,"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Bethesda (MD),,,,,,,,2020/08/07 06:01,2020/08/07 06:01,,,['NBK100663 [bookaccession]'],,,['NLM'],"['Thioguanine therapy', 'thioguanine response', 'Tabloid', 'thiopurines', 'NUDT15', 'TPMT', 'TPMT*2', 'TPMT*3A', 'TPMT*3B', 'TPMT*3C']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20170519,['20200807'],['20120920'],['National Center for Biotechnology Information (US)'],['Medical Genetics Summaries'],"['Pratt, Victoria M.', 'Scott, Stuart A.', 'Pirmohamed, Munir', 'Esquivel, Bernard', 'Kane, Megan S.', 'Kattman, Brandi L.', 'Malheiro, Adriana J.']","['Pratt VM', 'Scott SA', 'Pirmohamed M', 'Esquivel B', 'Kane MS', 'Kattman BL', 'Malheiro AJ']",['2017/05/19 06:01'],

It is used with other drugs to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which is the most common form of cancer in children (1). Common off-label uses include the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Mercaptopurine is a prodrug that must first be activated to form thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs), of which 6-thioguanine triphosphate (6-TGTP) is the major active metabolite. Two of the enzymes involved in the complex pathway of these metabolites are thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) and nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15). Individuals with reduced activity of either enzyme will be exposed to higher levels of active metabolites, like 6-TGTP, and will be at a higher risk of side effects, such as severe bone marrow suppression (myelosuppression). The FDA-approved drug label states that the initial dose of mercaptopurine should be reduced in individuals who are known to lack TPMT or NUDT15 activity (""homozygous deficiency"") and that these individuals typically require 10% or less of the standard dose. In individuals who have reduced enzyme activity (""heterozygous deficiency""), the label states that the dose of mercaptopurine should be reduced based on tolerability. A more substantial dose reduction may be required in individuals who have reduced activity of both enzymes (Table 1) (1). Dosing recommendations for mercaptopurine based on TPMT and NUDT15 genotype have also been published by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC, Table 2, Table 3) and the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG). These recommendations include specific dose reductions for individuals who have low or deficient enzyme activity, including starting dose and more information on how and when to adjust the dose for example, the time allowed to reach steady-state after each dose adjustment (2, 3).","['Dean, Laura', 'Kane, Megan']","['Dean L', 'Kane M']",,,['eng'],,"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Bethesda (MD),,,,,,,,2020/10/26 06:01,2020/10/26 06:01,,,['NBK100660 [bookaccession]'],,,['NLM'],"['mercaptopurine therapy', 'mercaptopurine response', 'thiopurines', 'NUDT15', 'TPMT', 'TPMT*2', 'TPMT*3A', 'TPMT*3B', 'TPMT*3C', 'Purinethol', 'Purixan', 'Purinethol response', 'Purixan response']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20170519,['20201026'],['20120920'],['National Center for Biotechnology Information (US)'],['Medical Genetics Summaries'],"['Pratt, Victoria M.', 'Scott, Stuart A.', 'Pirmohamed, Munir', 'Esquivel, Bernard', 'Kane, Megan S.', 'Kattman, Brandi L.', 'Malheiro, Adriana J.']","['Pratt VM', 'Scott SA', 'Pirmohamed M', 'Esquivel B', 'Kane MS', 'Kattman BL', 'Malheiro AJ']",['2017/05/19 06:01'],

Whereas the distribution of the leukaemia and lymphosarcoma cases show no clear genealogical pattern, the existence of a single recessive allele causing susceptibility to Hodgkin's disease and immunodeficiency in an isolated New-foundland population can be inferred. There appears to be no heterozygote penetrance, but in the period up to 1974 homozygote penetrance was high and perhaps complete. More important, the ancestral paths of the allele can be inferred. Many ancestral individuals are obligatory carriers, and most others have either probability >95% or <5% of having carried the allele. More recently, methods were developed and applied in order to investigate linkage of this locus to conventional blood group and serum protein marker loci. Although no linkages were found, some observed associations were clarified, and some definite non-linkages established.","['Thompson, E A']",['Thompson EA'],,"['Department of Statistics GN-22, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Hum Biol,American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,8915029,,,,,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['2017/05/19 06:00'],"['1989/05/09 00:00 [received]', '1990/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajhb.1310020311 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hum Biol. 1990;2(3):291-301. doi: 10.1002/ajhb.1310020311.,,,,"['Copyright (c) 1990 Wiley-Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was aimed at determining the impact of test timing and anti-HBV therapy on adverse liver outcomes in these patients. METHODS: Patients with solid or hematologic malignancies who received chemotherapy between 2004 and 2011 were retrospectively studied. HBV testing and anti-HBV therapy were defined as early at the initiation of cancer therapy and as late after initiation. Outcomes included hepatitis flares, hepatic impairment, liver failure, and death. Time-to-event analysis was used to determine incidence, and multivariate hazard models were used to determine predictors of outcomes. RESULTS: There were 18,688 study patients (80.4% with solid tumors). The prevalence of chronic HBV was 1.1% (52 of 4905), and the prevalence of past HBV was 7.1% (350 of 4905). Among patients with solid tumors, late identification of chronic HBV was associated with a higher risk of hepatitis flare (hazard ratio [HR], 4.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-12.86), hepatic impairment (HR, 8.48; 95% CI, 1.86-38.66), liver failure (HR, 9.38; 95% CI, 1.50-58.86), and death (HR, 3.90; 95% CI, 1.19-12.83) in comparison with early identification. Among patients with hematologic malignancies and chronic HBV, the risk of death was 7.8 (95% CI, 1.73-35.27) times higher for persons with late initiation of anti-HBV therapy versus early initiation. Patients with late identification of chronic HBV had late or no anti-HBV therapy. Chronic HBV predicted liver failure in patients with solid or hematologic malignancies, whereas male sex and late identification were predictors for patients with solid tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification correlates with early anti-HBV therapy and reduces the risk of liver failure and death in chronic HBV patients receiving chemotherapy. Cancer 2017;123:3367-76.

Despite the advances in past decades, the clinical outcomes of AML patients remain poor. Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) is the major cause of the recurrence of AML even after aggressive treatment making, promoting development of LSC-targeted agents is an urgent clinical need. Although the antitumor activity of disulfiram (DS), an approved anti-alcoholism drug, has been demonstrated in multiple types of tumors including hematological malignancies such as AML, it remains unknown whether this agent would also be able to target cancer stem cells like LSCs. Here, we report the in vitro and in vivo activity of DS in combination with copper (Cu) against CD34(+)/CD38(+) leukemia stem-like cells sorted from KG1alpha and Kasumi-1 AML cell lines, as well as primary CD34(+) AML samples. DS plus Cu (DS/Cu) displayed marked inhibition of proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and suppression of colony formation in cultured AML cells while sparing the normal counterparts. DS/Cu also significantly inhibited the growth of human CD34(+)/CD38(+) leukemic cell-derived xenografts in NOD/SCID mice. Mechanistically, DS/Cu-induced cytotoxicity was closely associated with activation of the stress-related ROS-JNK pathway as well as simultaneous inactivation of the pro-survival Nrf2 and nuclear factor-kappaB pathways. In summary, our findings indicate that DS/Cu selectively targets leukemia stem-like cells both in vitro and in vivo, thus suggesting a promising LSC-targeted activity of this repurposed agent for treatment of relapsed and refractory AML.","['Xu, Bing', 'Wang, Shiyun', 'Li, Rongwei', 'Chen, Kai', 'He, Lingli', 'Deng, Manman', 'Kannappan, Vinodh', 'Zha, Jie', 'Dong, Huijuan', 'Wang, Weiguang']","['Xu B', 'Wang S', 'Li R', 'Chen K', 'He L', 'Deng M', 'Kannappan V', 'Zha J', 'Dong H', 'Wang W']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.', 'Research Institute in Healthcare Science, Faculty of Science and Engineering, University of Wolverhampton, Wolverhampton, UK.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Research Institute in Healthcare Science, Faculty of Science and Engineering, University of Wolverhampton, Wolverhampton, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170518,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'TR3MLJ1UAI (Disulfiram)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Copper/*pharmacology', 'Disulfiram/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'Young Adult']",PMC5520701,2017/05/19 06:00,2018/02/28 06:00,['2017/05/19 06:00'],"['2016/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/20 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2017176 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2017.176 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2017 May 18;8(5):e2797. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2017.176.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These models are an important tool for studying the mechanisms of normal and malignant hematopoiesis and are the gold standard for identifying effective chemotherapies for many malignancies. PDX models are possible because many of the mouse cytokines also act on human cells. However, this is not the case for all cytokines, including many that are critical for studying normal and malignant hematopoiesis in human cells. Techniques that engineer mice to produce human cytokines (transgenic and knock-in models) require significant expense before the usefulness of the model has been demonstrated. Other techniques are labor intensive (injection of recombinant cytokine or lentivirus) and in some cases require high levels of technical expertise (hydrodynamic injection of DNA). This report describes a simple method for generating PDX mice that have exogenous human cytokine (TSLP, thymic stromal lymphopoietin) via weekly intraperitoneal injection of stroma that have been transduced to overexpress this cytokine. Use of this method provides an in vivo source of continuous cytokine production that achieves physiological levels of circulating human cytokine in the mouse. Plasma levels of human cytokine can be varied based on the number of stromal cells injected, and cytokine production can be initiated at any point in the experiment. This method also includes cytokine-negative control mice that are similarly produced, but through intraperitoneal injection of stroma transduced with a control vector. We have previously demonstrated that leukemia cells harvested from TSLP-expressing PDX, as compared to control PDX, exhibit a gene expression pattern more like the original patient sample. Together the cytokine-producing and cytokine-negative PDX mice produced by this method provide a model system that we have used successfully to study the role of TSLP in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.","['Coats, Jacqueline S', 'Baez, Ineavely', 'Stoian, Cornelia', 'Milford, Terry-Ann M', 'Zhang, Xiaobing', 'Francis, Olivia L', 'Su, Ruijun', 'Payne, Kimberly J']","['Coats JS', 'Baez I', 'Stoian C', 'Milford TM', 'Zhang X', 'Francis OL', 'Su R', 'Payne KJ']",,"['Department of Pathology and Human Anatomy, Loma Linda University.', 'Department of Pathology and Human Anatomy, Loma Linda University.', 'Department of Pathology and Human Anatomy, Loma Linda University.', 'Department of Basic Sciences, Loma Linda University.', 'Department of Medicine, Loma Linda University.', 'Department of Pathology and Human Anatomy, Loma Linda University.', 'Department of Pathology and Human Anatomy, Loma Linda University.', 'Department of Pathology and Human Anatomy, Loma Linda University; kpayne@llu.edu.']",['eng'],"['P20 MD006988/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA209829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA162259/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 GM060507/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Video-Audio Media']",20170510,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['0 (Cytokines)', 'GT0IL38SP4 (thymic stromal lymphopoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/blood/*genetics', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Heterografts/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Mice', 'Stromal Cells/*metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic']",PMC5607929,2017/05/19 06:00,2018/01/20 06:00,['2017/05/19 06:00'],"['2017/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/55384 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2017 May 10;(123). doi: 10.3791/55384.,,,,,,['NIHMS967108'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ESCs differentiate by default into neural precursor cells. They can be amassed into a three dimensional (3D) spherical aggregate termed embryoid body (EB) due to its similarity to the early stage embryo. EBs can be seeded on fibronectin-coated coverslips, where they expand by growing two dimensional (2D) extensions, or implanted in 3D collagen matrices where they continue growing as spheroids, and differentiate into the three germ layers: endodermal, mesodermal, and ectodermal. The 3D collagen culture mimics the in vivo environment more closely than the 2D EBs. The 2D EB culture facilitates analysis by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting to track differentiation. We have developed a two-step neural differentiation protocol. In the first step, EBs are generated by the hanging-drop technique, and, simultaneously, are induced to differentiate by exposure to retinoic acid (RA). In the second step, neural differentiation proceeds in a 2D or 3D format in the absence of RA.","['Yang, Junning', 'Wu, Chuanshen', 'Stefanescu, Ioana', 'Horowitz, Arie']","['Yang J', 'Wu C', 'Stefanescu I', 'Horowitz A']",,"['Department of Medicine, Cardeza Vascular Research Center, Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University.', 'Department of Molecular Cardiology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation.', 'Department of Medicine, Cardeza Vascular Research Center, Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University.', 'Department of Medicine, Cardeza Vascular Research Center, Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University; Department of Cancer Biology, Cardeza Vascular Research Center, Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University; Arie.Horowitz@jefferson.edu.']",['eng'],['R01 HL119984/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Video-Audio Media']",20170422,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Collagen', 'Ectoderm', 'Embryoid Bodies/*cytology', 'Endoderm', 'Mesoderm', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Neural Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Neurogenesis/*drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",PMC5437746,2017/05/19 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2017/05/19 06:00'],"['2017/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/55621 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2017 Apr 22;(122). doi: 10.3791/55621.,,,,,,['NIHMS839273'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This ""side population"" of cells can be identified using flow cytometric methods after the Hoechst 33342 dye is excited by an ultraviolet (UV) laser. The side population of many cell types contains stem- or progenitor-like cells. However, not all cell types have an identifiable side population. Danio rerio, zebrafish, have a robust in vivo model of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), but whether these zebrafish T-ALLs have a side population is unknown. The method described here outlines how to isolate the side population cells in zebrafish T-ALL. To begin, the T-ALL in zebrafish is generated via the microinjection of tol2 plasmids into one-cell stage embryos. Once the tumors have grown to a stage at which they expand into more than half of the animal's body, the T-ALL cells can be harvested. The cells are then stained with Hoechst 33342 and examined by flow cytometry for side population cells. This method has broad applications in zebrafish T-ALL research. While there are no known cell surface markers in zebrafish that confirm whether these side population cells are cancer stem cell-like, in vivo functional transplantation assays are possible. Furthermore, single-cell transcriptomics could be applied to identify the genetic features of these side population cells.","['Pruitt, Margaret M', 'Marin, Wilfredo', 'Waarts, Michael R', 'de Jong, Jill L O']","['Pruitt MM', 'Marin W', 'Waarts MR', 'de Jong JLO']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, The University of Chicago; Department of Biology and Biotechnology, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, The University of Chicago.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, The University of Chicago.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, The University of Chicago; jdejong@peds.bsd.uchicago.edu.']",['eng'],['P30 CA014599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Video-Audio Media']",20170504,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['0 (Benzimidazoles)', 'P976261J69 (bisbenzimide ethoxide trihydrochloride)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Benzimidazoles', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology', '*Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Zebrafish/genetics/immunology']",PMC5607890,2017/05/19 06:00,2018/01/31 06:00,['2017/05/19 06:00'],"['2017/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/55711 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2017 May 4;(123). doi: 10.3791/55711.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its clinical course is typically indolent; however, based on a series of pathobiological, clinical, genetic, and phenotypic parameters, patient survival varies from less than 5 to more than 20 years. In this paper, we show for the first time that the expression of the interferon-inducible DNA sensor IFI16, a member of the PYHIN protein family involved in proliferation inhibition and apoptosis regulation, is associated with the clinical outcome in CLL. We studied 99 CLLs cases by immunohistochemistry and 10 CLLs cases by gene expression profiling. We found quite variable degrees of IFI16 expression among CLLs cases. Noteworthy, we observed that a reduced IFI16 expression was associated with a very poor survival, but only in cases with ZAP70/CD38 expression. Furthermore, we found that IFI16 expression was associated with a specific gene expression signature. As IFI16 can be easily detected by immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry, it may become a part of phenotypic screening in CLL patients if its prognostic role is confirmed in independent series.","['Piccaluga, Pier Paolo', 'Agostinelli, Claudio', 'Righi, Simona', 'Ciccone, Maria', 'Re, Maria Carla', 'Musumeci, Giuseppina', 'Diani, Erica', 'Signoretto, Caterina', 'Bon, Isabella', 'Piccin, Ottavio', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Tripodo, Claudio', 'Ponti, Cristina', 'Zipeto, Donato', 'Landolfo, Santo', 'Gibellini, Davide']","['Piccaluga PP', 'Agostinelli C', 'Righi S', 'Ciccone M', 'Re MC', 'Musumeci G', 'Diani E', 'Signoretto C', 'Bon I', 'Piccin O', 'Cuneo A', 'Tripodo C', 'Ponti C', 'Zipeto D', 'Landolfo S', 'Gibellini D']",,"['Department of Experimental, Diagnostic, and Specialty Medicine, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Section of Genomics and Personalized Medicine, Istituto Euro-Mediterraneo di Scienza e Tecnologia (IEMEST), Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic, and Specialty Medicine, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic, and Specialty Medicine, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Hematology Section, S.

Here we report that ASXL2 is required for normal haematopoiesis with distinct, non-overlapping effects from ASXL1 and acts as a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor. While Asxl2 was required for normal haematopoietic stem cell self-renewal, Asxl2 loss promoted AML1-ETO leukemogenesis. Moreover, ASXL2 target genes strongly overlapped with those of RUNX1 and AML1-ETO and ASXL2 loss was associated with increased chromatin accessibility at putative enhancers of key leukemogenic loci.

As these newer antibodies are further studied and developed, improvements in response and progression-free survival need to be considered in the context of clinical benefit as well as toxicity, especially in indolent diseases. Research involving rituximab biosimilars is ongoing as well, and recent preliminary data demonstrate similar efficacy and tolerability when compared with rituximab.

Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is one of the most frequently mutated genes in AML and mutations in this gene are associated with poor overall survival. AXL plays a role in the activation of FLT3 and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AML. The studies reported here evaluated the ability of a novel FLT3/AXL inhibitor, gilteritinib, to block mutated FLT3 in cellular and animal models of AML. Initial kinase studies showed that gilteritinib, a type I tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was highly selective for both FLT3 and AXL while having weak activity against c-KIT. Gilteritinib demonstrated potent inhibitory activity against the internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) and FLT3-D835Y point mutations in cellular assays using MV4-11 and MOLM-13 cells as well as Ba/F3 cells expressing mutated FLT3. Gilteritinib also inhibited FLT3-F691 mutations, although to a lesser degree, in these assays. Furthermore, gilteritinib decreased the phosphorylation levels of FLT3 and its downstream targets in both cellular and animal models. In vivo, gilteritinib was distributed at high levels in xenografted tumors after oral administration. The decreased FLT3 activity and high intratumor distribution of gilteritinib translated to tumor regression and improved survival in xenograft and intra-bone marrow transplantation models of FLT3-driven AML. No overt toxicity was seen in mouse models treated with gilteritinib. These results indicate that gilteritinib may be an important next-generation FLT3 inhibitor for use in the treatment of FLT3 mutation-positive AML.","['Mori, Masamichi', 'Kaneko, Naoki', 'Ueno, Yoko', 'Yamada, Masaki', 'Tanaka, Ruriko', 'Saito, Rika', 'Shimada, Itsuro', 'Mori, Kenichi', 'Kuromitsu, Sadao']","['Mori M', 'Kaneko N', 'Ueno Y', 'Yamada M', 'Tanaka R', 'Saito R', 'Shimada I', 'Mori K', 'Kuromitsu S']",,"['Research Program Management Office, Drug Discovery Research, Astellas Pharma Inc., 21 Miyukigaoka, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, 305-8585, Japan. masamichi.mori@astellas.com.', 'Research Program Management Office, Drug Discovery Research, Astellas Pharma Inc., 21 Miyukigaoka, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, 305-8585, Japan.', 'Research Program Management Office, Drug Discovery Research, Astellas Pharma Inc., 21 Miyukigaoka, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, 305-8585, Japan.', 'Pharmacology Research Division, Astellas Research Technologies Co., Ltd, 21 Miyukigaoka, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Research Program Management Office, Drug Discovery Research, Astellas Pharma Inc., 21 Miyukigaoka, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, 305-8585, Japan.', 'Research Program Management Office, Drug Discovery Research, Astellas Pharma Inc., 21 Miyukigaoka, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, 305-8585, Japan.', 'Research Program Management Office, Drug Discovery Research, Astellas Pharma Inc., 21 Miyukigaoka, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, 305-8585, Japan.', 'Research Program Management Office, Drug Discovery Research, Astellas Pharma Inc., 21 Miyukigaoka, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, 305-8585, Japan.', 'Research Program Management Office, Drug Discovery Research, Astellas Pharma Inc., 21 Miyukigaoka, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, 305-8585, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170517,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (gilteritinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (axl receptor tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mutation/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/methods', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors']",PMC5613053,2017/05/19 06:00,2018/07/12 06:00,['2017/05/19 06:00'],"['2017/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10637-017-0470-z [doi]', '10.1007/s10637-017-0470-z [pii]']",ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2017 Oct;35(5):556-565. doi: 10.1007/s10637-017-0470-z.

To target hematologic malignancies with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that targets two antigens with a single vector, and thus potentially lessen the chance of leukemic escape mutations, a tandem-CAR approach was investigated. METHODS: Antigen binding domains from the FMC63 (anti-CD19) and Leu16 (anti-CD20) antibodies were linked in differing configurations to transmembrane and T cell signaling domains to create tandem-CARs. Expression on the surface of primary human T cells was induced by transduction with a single lentiviral vector (LV) encoding the tandem-CAR. Tandem-CARs were compared to single antigen targeting CARs in vitro and in vivo, and to an admixture of transduced cells expressing each CAR in vivo in immunodeficient (NSG) disease-bearing mice. RESULTS: Tandem constructs efficient killed the Raji leukemia cell line both in vitro and in vivo. Tandem CARs generated less cytokine than the CD20 CAR, but similar to CD19 CARs, on their own. In co-culture experiments at low effector to target ratios with both single- and tandem- CAR-T cells, a rapid down-modulation of full-length CD19 expression was seen on leukemia targets. There also was a partial down-modulation of CD22, and to a lesser degree, of CD20. Our data also highlight the extreme sensitivity of the NALM-6 cell line to general lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity. While single and tandem constructs were effective in vivo in a standard setting, in a high-disease burden setting, the tandem CAR proved both effective and less toxic than an admixture of transduced T cell populations expressing single CARs. CONCLUSION: Tandem CARs are equally effective in standard disease models to single antigen specificity CARs, and may be both more effective and less toxic in a higher disease burden setting. This may be due to optimized cell killing with more moderate cytokine production. The rapid co-modulation of CD19, CD20, and CD22 may account for the ability to rapidly evolve escape mutants by selecting for leukemic clones that not require these target antigens for continued expansion.","['Schneider, Dina', 'Xiong, Ying', 'Wu, Darong', 'Nlle, Volker', 'Schmitz, Sarah', 'Haso, Waleed', 'Kaiser, Andrew', 'Dropulic, Boro', 'Orentas, Rimas J']","['Schneider D', 'Xiong Y', 'Wu D', 'Nlle V', 'Schmitz S', 'Haso W', 'Kaiser A', 'Dropulic B', 'Orentas RJ']",,"['Lentigen Technology, Inc., 910 Clopper Rd., Gaithersburg, MD 20878 USA.', 'Lentigen Technology, Inc., 910 Clopper Rd., Gaithersburg, MD 20878 USA.', 'Lentigen Technology, Inc., 910 Clopper Rd., Gaithersburg, MD 20878 USA.', 'Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany.', 'Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany.', 'Lentigen Technology, Inc., 910 Clopper Rd., Gaithersburg, MD 20878 USA.', 'Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany.', 'Lentigen Technology, Inc., 910 Clopper Rd., Gaithersburg, MD 20878 USA.', 'Lentigen Technology, Inc., 910 Clopper Rd., Gaithersburg, MD 20878 USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170516,England,J Immunother Cancer,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD19 molecule, human)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/genetics/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD20/genetics/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology/therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'T-Lymphocytes/transplantation', 'Tumor Escape/immunology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5433150,2017/05/19 06:00,2018/01/30 06:00,['2017/05/19 06:00'],"['2016/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40425-017-0246-1 [doi]', '246 [pii]']",epublish,J Immunother Cancer. 2017 May 16;5:42. doi: 10.1186/s40425-017-0246-1. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adoptive immunotherapy', '*CAR T', '*CD19', '*CD20', '*CD22', '*Hematologic malignancy', '*Lentiviral vector', '*Tandem -targeting CAR', '*Tumor antigen escape']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe two adult patients with hematological malignancies with methotrexate encephalopathy who recovered with dextromethorphan therapy. RESULTS: Case 1: A 24-year-old male with acute lymphoblastic leukemia developed the acute onset of bilateral facial weakness and slurred speech after his first treatment with high-dose intravenous methotrexate. The clinical scenario and a head magnetic resonance imaging supported a diagnosis of methotrexate encephalopathy. Treatment with dextromethorphan was coincident with recovery. Case 2: A 65-year-old female with recurrent diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was treated with high-dose intravenous methotrexate. Two weeks after a cycle, she developed hypoactive delirium, marked lethargy, ocular ataxia, and a right-sided facial weakness. Within 2 days of starting dextromethorphan, there was improvement with clinical recovery. CONCLUSIONS: These two cases suggest that N-methyl d-aspartate receptor activation by homocysteine may play an important role in the pathogenesis of methotrexate neurotoxicity.","['Coker, Shodeinde A', 'Pastel, David A', 'Davis, Melissa C', 'Bengtson, Elizabeth M', 'Fadul, Camilo E', 'Lewis, Lionel D']","['Coker SA', 'Pastel DA', 'Davis MC', 'Bengtson EM', 'Fadul CE', 'Lewis LD']",,"['Section of Hematology and Oncology, The Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, NH, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH, USA.', 'Section of Hematology and Oncology, The Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, NH, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH, USA.', 'Section of Hematology and Oncology, The Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, NH, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH, USA.', 'Division of Neuro-Oncology, Department of Neurology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Section of Hematology and Oncology, The Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, NH, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH, USA.', 'Section of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA023108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Case Reports'],20170504,England,SAGE Open Med Case Rep,SAGE open medical case reports,101638686,,,,PMC5423709,2017/05/19 06:00,2017/05/19 06:01,['2017/05/19 06:00'],"['2017/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2050313X17706875 [doi]', '10.1177_2050313X17706875 [pii]']",epublish,SAGE Open Med Case Rep. 2017 May 4;5:2050313X17706875. doi: 10.1177/2050313X17706875. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['Methotrexate', 'N-methyl d-aspartate receptor antagonism', 'dextromethorphan', 'encephalopathy']","['Declaration of conflicting interests: The author(s) declared no potential', 'conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or', 'publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we describe a role for talin in maintaining the homeostasis and survival of the regulatory T (Treg) cell pool. T cell-specific deletion of talin in Tln1(fl/fl)Cd4(Cre) mice resulted in spontaneous lymphocyte activation, primarily due to numerical and functional deficiencies of Treg cells in the periphery. Peripheral talin-deficient Treg cells were unable to maintain high expression of IL-2Ralpha, resulting in impaired IL-2 signaling and ultimately leading to increased apoptosis through downregulation of prosurvival proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. The requirement for talin in maintaining high IL-2Ralpha expression by Treg cells was due, in part, to integrin LFA-1-mediated interactions between Treg cells and dendritic cells. Collectively, our data suggest a critical role for talin in Treg cell-mediated maintenance of immune homeostasis.","['Klann, Jane E', 'Remedios, Kelly A', 'Kim, Stephanie H', 'Metz, Patrick J', 'Lopez, Justine', 'Mack, Lauren A', 'Zheng, Ye', 'Ginsberg, Mark H', 'Petrich, Brian G', 'Chang, John T']","['Klann JE', 'Remedios KA', 'Kim SH', 'Metz PJ', 'Lopez J', 'Mack LA', 'Zheng Y', 'Ginsberg MH', 'Petrich BG', 'Chang JT']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5662-6112', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8397-1616', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5012-4309', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1915-3261']","['Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093.', 'Nomis Foundation Laboratories for Immunobiology and Microbial Pathogenesis, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA 92037; and.', 'Nomis Foundation Laboratories for Immunobiology and Microbial Pathogenesis, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA 92037; and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322 changj@ucsd.edu brian.petrich@emory.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093; changj@ucsd.edu brian.petrich@emory.edu.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI095277/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL117807/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK093507/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK007202/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL031950/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL078784/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI107027/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL117061/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'DP2 OD008469/OD/NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170517,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Talin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Genes, bcl-2', '*Homeostasis', 'Interleukin-2/immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/physiology', 'Talin/deficiency/immunology/*metabolism']",PMC5507362,2017/05/19 06:00,2017/09/28 06:00,['2017/05/19 06:00'],"['2016/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1601165 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1601165 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2017 Jun 15;198(12):4639-4651. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1601165.

Here we report a beneficial mechanism of E+P treatment in breast cancer cells driven by transcriptional upregulation of the NFkappaB modulator NEMO, which in turn promotes expression of the tumor suppressor protein promyelocytic leukemia (PML). E+P treatment of patient-derived epithelial cells derived from ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) increased secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL6. Mechanistic investigations indicated that IL6 upregulation occurred as a result of transcriptional upregulation of NEMO, the gene that harbored estrogen receptor (ER) binding sites within its promoter. Accordingly, E+P treatment of breast cancer cells increased ER binding to the NEMO promoter, thereby increasing NEMO expression, NFkappaB activation, and IL6 secretion. In two mouse xenograft models of DCIS, we found that RNAi-mediated silencing of NEMO increased tumor invasion and progression. This seemingly paradoxical result was linked to NEMO-mediated regulation of NFkappaB and IL6 secretion, increased phosphorylation of STAT3 on Ser727, and increased expression of PML, a STAT3 transcriptional target. In identifying NEMO as a pivotal transcriptional target of E+P signaling in breast cancer cells, our work offers a mechanistic explanation for the paradoxical antitumorigenic roles of E+P in breast cancer by showing how it upregulates the tumor suppressor protein PML.

Translocation detection at the DNA level is often complicated by chromosomal breakpoints that are distributed over very large regions. We have developed a ligation-based assay [the looped ligation assay (LOLA)] to detect translocations from diseases with multiple widely spaced breakpoint hot spots. METHODS: Oligonucleotide sets that probe breakpoints of IGH-BCL2 (immunoglobulin heavy-apoptosis regulator) in follicular lymphoma (FL), MYC-IGH (MYC proto-oncogene, bHLH transcription factor-immunoglobulin heavy) in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and BCR-ABL1 (RhoGEF and GTPase activating protein-ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) were designed. DNA from cell lines with these translocations was mixed with oligonucleotides in a single-step ligation reaction followed by PCR amplification. Detection was by capillary electrophoresis. We also tested peripheral blood from 16 CML patients and frozen tissue from 17 FL cases, and the results were compared to reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (CML) or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and delta-PCR (FL). RESULTS: LOLA produced signals of the expected sizes for the cell lines. Normal control DNA yielded no signals. A dilution series yielded translocation-specific peaks at dilutions as low as 1%. Signal intensity was log linear to the DNA concentration (R(2) = 0.94). Furthermore, we were able to detect a LOLA peak in DNA from 53.3% of FL patients and 87.5% of CML patients. The concordance between LOLA, FISH, and delta-PCR in FL was also excellent. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that LOLA is a simple method that is useful for DNA-based detection of translocations in challenging situations, particularly where the breakpoints are not tightly clustered. The assay also has the added benefit of permitting rapid mapping of the breakpoints.","['Harada, Shuko', 'Sizzle, Emily', 'Lin, Ming-Tseh', 'Gocke, Christopher D']","['Harada S', 'Sizzle E', 'Lin MT', 'Gocke CD']",,"['Departments of Pathology and Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Current affiliation: Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', 'Departments of Pathology and Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Departments of Pathology and Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Departments of Pathology and Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD; cgocke1@jhmi.edu.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170517,England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,,IM,"['Biological Assay/*standards', 'Cell Line', '*Genetic Techniques', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/diagnosis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",,2017/05/19 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2017/05/19 06:00'],"['2016/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['clinchem.2016.270140 [pii]', '10.1373/clinchem.2016.270140 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2017 Jul;63(7):1278-1287. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2016.270140.

The aim of this study is to develop a novel prognostic index (PI) for chronic and smoldering ATL. We conducted a nationwide retrospective survey on ATL patients, and 248 fully eligible individuals were used in this analysis. In the univariate analysis, sex, performance status, log10 (soluble interleukin-2 receptor [sIL-2R]), neutrophils count, and lymphadenopathy showed values of P < .05 in training samples. A multivariate analysis was performed on these factors, and only log10 (sIL-2R) was identified as an independent prognostic factor in training samples. Using a regression coefficient of this variable, a prognostic model was formulated to identify different levels of risk: indolent ATL-PI (iATL-PI) = 1.51 x log10 (sIL-2R [U/mL]). The values calculated by iATL-PI were divided into 3 groups using a quartile point. In the validation sample, median survival times (MSTs) were 1.6 years, 5.5 years, and not reached for patients in the high-, intermediate-, and low-risk groups, respectively (P < .0001). To make the scoring system clinically practicable, we simplified iATL-PI according to trichotomizing sIL-2R at 1000 and 6000 U/mL, using a quartile point. Patients with more than 6000 U/mL sIL-2R were categorized into the high-risk group, less than and equal to 1000 U/mL into the low-risk group, and the others into the intermediate-risk group, and MSTs were 1.6 years, not reached, and 5.5 years, respectively (P < .0001). iATL-PI has potential as a novel tool for a risk-adapted therapeutic approach.","['Katsuya, Hiroo', 'Shimokawa, Mototsugu', 'Ishitsuka, Kenji', 'Kawai, Kazuhiro', 'Amano, Masahiro', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Hino, Ryosuke', 'Hanada, Shuichi', 'Jo, Tatsuro', 'Tsukasaki, Kunihiro', 'Moriuchi, Yukiyoshi', 'Sueoka, Eisaburo', 'Yoshida, Shinichiro', 'Suzushima, Hitoshi', 'Miyahara, Masaharu', 'Yamashita, Kiyoshi', 'Eto, Tetsuya', 'Suzumiya, Junji', 'Tamura, Kazuo']","['Katsuya H', 'Shimokawa M', 'Ishitsuka K', 'Kawai K', 'Amano M', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Hino R', 'Hanada S', 'Jo T', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Moriuchi Y', 'Sueoka E', 'Yoshida S', 'Suzushima H', 'Miyahara M', 'Yamashita K', 'Eto T', 'Suzumiya J', 'Tamura K']",,"['Division of Medical Oncology, Hematology and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Center for AIDS Research, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Institute, National Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Hematology and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Immunology, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, and.', 'Department of Dermatology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Miyazaki University, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura Bun-in Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization, Kagoshima Medical Center, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagasaki Genbaku Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease and Hibakusha Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Science, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sasebo City General Hospital, Sasebo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization, Nagasaki Medical Center, Ohmura, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kumamoto Shinto General Hospital, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Karatsu Red Cross Hospital, Karatsu, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Hospital, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hamanomachi Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan; and.', 'Cancer Center, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Hematology and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170517,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (IL2RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/blood', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*blood/*mortality/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate']",,2017/05/19 06:00,2017/08/18 06:00,['2017/05/19 06:00'],"['2016/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33240-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-01-757542 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Jul 6;130(1):39-47. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-01-757542.

Recently, it has been suggested that HBV is associated with other human cancers. However, the association between HBV and the risk of onset of hematological malignancies remains controversial. The aim of this large-scale retrospective cohort study was to evaluate the association between HBV infection and hematological malignancies. A retrospective analysis of 86,115 newly admitted patients at Shanghai Ruijin Hospital was performed. A cohort of patients previously exposed to HBV (n = 1,874) and a cohort of individuals without a positive test for anti-hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc; n = 45,118) were compared to assess the risk of hematological malignancies. Anti-HBc was positive in 61.2% cases and 54.3% controls (p = 0.0001). The risk of B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and multiple myeloma was higher in the HBV-infected cohort than in the non-HBV-infected cohort.

In this study, we assessed prospectively by flow cytometry the prognostic value of BCL2L10 positive bone marrow mononuclear cells in 70 patients (42 MDS and 28 AML), prior to AZA treatment.In patients with baseline marrow blasts below 30%, the baseline percentage of bone marrow BCL2L10 positive cells inversely correlated with response to AZA and OS independently of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and IPSS-revised (IPSS-R).

In summary, marrow BCL2L10 positive cells may be a biomarker for azacitidine response and OS, with a potential impact in clinical practice.","['Vidal, Valerie', 'Robert, Guillaume', 'Goursaud, Laure', 'Durand, Laetitia', 'Ginet, Clemence', 'Karsenti, Jean Michel', 'Luciano, Frederic', 'Gastaud, Lauris', 'Garnier, Georges', 'Braun, Thorsten', 'Hirsch, Pierre', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Nloga, Anne Marie', 'Padua, Rose Ann', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Rohrlich, Pierre', 'Ades, Lionel', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Auberger, Patrick', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Cluzeau, Thomas']","['Vidal V', 'Robert G', 'Goursaud L', 'Durand L', 'Ginet C', 'Karsenti JM', 'Luciano F', 'Gastaud L', 'Garnier G', 'Braun T', 'Hirsch P', 'Raffoux E', 'Nloga AM', 'Padua RA', 'Dombret H', 'Rohrlich P', 'Ades L', 'Chomienne C', 'Auberger P', 'Fenaux P', 'Cluzeau T']",,"[""INSERM U1131, Institut Universitaire d'hematologie, Paris, France."", 'INSERM U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire, Nice, France.', ""INSERM U1131, Institut Universitaire d'hematologie, Paris, France."", ""INSERM U1131, Institut Universitaire d'hematologie, Paris, France."", 'INSERM U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire, Nice, France.', ""Cote d'azur University, Nice Sophia Antipolis University, CHU of Nice, Nice, France."", 'INSERM U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire, Nice, France.', ""Centre Antoine Lacassagne, Service d'oncologie, Nice, France."", 'CH Princesse Grace, Service de Medecine Interne, Monaco, Monaco.', 'Hopital Avicenne, Paris 13 University, APHP, Bobigny, France.', ""Hopital Saint Antoine, Service d'Hematologie Clinique et de Therapie Cellulaire, Paris, France."", 'Sorbonne Universites, UPMC Univ Paris 6, UMRS 938, CDR Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', ""Hopital Saint Louis, Paris 7 University, Service d'Hematologie Adulte, APHP, Paris, France."", ""Hopital Saint Louis, Paris 7 University, Service d'Hematologie Senior, APHP, Paris, France."", ""INSERM U1131, Institut Universitaire d'hematologie, Paris, France."", ""Hopital Saint Louis, Paris 7 University, Service d'Hematologie Adulte, APHP, Paris, France."", ""Cote d'azur University, Nice Sophia Antipolis University, CHU of Nice, Nice, France."", ""INSERM U1131, Institut Universitaire d'hematologie, Paris, France."", ""Hopital Saint Louis, Paris 7 University, Service d'Hematologie Senior, APHP, Paris, France."", ""INSERM U1131, Institut Universitaire d'hematologie, Paris, France."", 'INSERM U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire, Nice, France.', ""Cote d'azur University, Nice Sophia Antipolis University, CHU of Nice, Nice, France."", ""INSERM U1131, Institut Universitaire d'hematologie, Paris, France."", ""Hopital Saint Louis, Paris 7 University, Service d'Hematologie Senior, APHP, Paris, France."", ""INSERM U1131, Institut Universitaire d'hematologie, Paris, France."", 'INSERM U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire, Nice, France.', ""Cote d'azur University, Nice Sophia Antipolis University, CHU of Nice, Nice, France.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (BCL2-like 10 protein)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*metabolism/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/drug therapy/*metabolism/*mortality', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC5564547,2017/05/18 06:00,2018/04/24 06:00,['2017/05/18 06:00'],"['2016/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['17482 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.17482 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jul 18;8(29):47103-47109. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.17482.,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'BCL2L10', 'IPSS', 'IPSS-R', 'MDS']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although this protein has been shown to contribute to cellular development and tumorigenesis, the role of PBX1 in gastric carcinoma (GC) remains unclear. In this study, we observed increased expression of PBX1 in GC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. This increase in PBX1 expression levels negatively correlated with HOXB9 mRNA expression and was also associated with malignancy and metastasis. PBX1 promoted proliferation and metastasis of GC cells both in vitro and in vivo.These phenomena were also accompanied by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Additionally, we observed that PBX1 promotes the expression of tumor growth and angiogenic factors. A structural model of the PBX1-HOX complex revealed that hydrophobic binding between PBX1 and the hexapeptide motif might be required for EMT induction. This analysis also demonstrated that the Phe252 residue in the first helix of the TALE homeodomain is involved in the latter hydrophobic binding reaction. In vitro data from PBX1 mutants suggest that PBX1 cannot promote tumorigenesis of GC cells via EMT induction when Phe252 residues lose hydrophobicity. It is likely that the presence of this residue is essential in facilitating hydrophobic binding with the hexapeptide motif. These findings suggest that PBX1 may be a potential target for GC treatment and this study provides a platform to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underpin the role of PBX1 in GC tumorigenesis.","['He, Changyu', 'Wang, Zhenqiang', 'Zhang, Li', 'Yang, Liyun', 'Li, Jianfang', 'Chen, Xuehua', 'Zhang, Jun', 'Chang, Qing', 'Yu, Yingyan', 'Liu, Bingya', 'Zhu, Zhenggang']","['He C', 'Wang Z', 'Zhang L', 'Yang L', 'Li J', 'Chen X', 'Zhang J', 'Chang Q', 'Yu Y', 'Liu B', 'Zhu Z']",,"['Shanghai Key Laboratory of Gastric Neoplasms, Department of Surgery, Shanghai Institute of Digestive Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Gastric Neoplasms, Department of Surgery, Shanghai Institute of Digestive Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Gastric Neoplasms, Department of Surgery, Shanghai Institute of Digestive Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Gastric Neoplasms, Department of Surgery, Shanghai Institute of Digestive Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Gastric Neoplasms, Department of Surgery, Shanghai Institute of Digestive Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Clinical Research Center, Jiading District Central Hospital Affiliated Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Gastric Neoplasms, Department of Surgery, Shanghai Institute of Digestive Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Gastric Neoplasms, Department of Surgery, Shanghai Institute of Digestive Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Gastric Neoplasms, Department of Surgery, Shanghai Institute of Digestive Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acids/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', '*Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/genetics/metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Burden']",PMC5564525,2017/05/18 06:00,2018/04/24 06:00,['2017/05/18 06:00'],"['2016/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['17473 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.17473 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jul 18;8(29):46818-46833. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.17473.,['NOTNLM'],"['PBX1', 'epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition', 'gastric carcinoma', 'hydrophobic binding', 'tumorigenesis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, whether metabolic changes directly regulate cancer development and progression remains poorly understood. Here we show that BCAT1, a cytosolic aminotransferase for branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), is aberrantly activated and functionally required for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in humans and in mouse models of CML. BCAT1 is upregulated during progression of CML and promotes BCAA production in leukaemia cells by aminating the branched-chain keto acids. Blocking BCAT1 gene expression or enzymatic activity induces cellular differentiation and impairs the propagation of blast crisis CML both in vitro and in vivo. Stable-isotope tracer experiments combined with nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolic analysis demonstrate the intracellular production of BCAAs by BCAT1. Direct supplementation with BCAAs ameliorates the defects caused by BCAT1 knockdown, indicating that BCAT1 exerts its oncogenic function through BCAA production in blast crisis CML cells. Importantly, BCAT1 expression not only is activated in human blast crisis CML and de novo acute myeloid leukaemia, but also predicts disease outcome in patients. As an upstream regulator of BCAT1 expression, we identified Musashi2 (MSI2), an oncogenic RNA binding protein that is required for blast crisis CML. MSI2 is physically associated with the BCAT1 transcript and positively regulates its protein expression in leukaemia. Taken together, this work reveals that altered BCAA metabolism activated through the MSI2-BCAT1 axis drives cancer progression in myeloid leukaemia.","['Hattori, Ayuna', 'Tsunoda, Makoto', 'Konuma, Takaaki', 'Kobayashi, Masayuki', 'Nagy, Tamas', 'Glushka, John', 'Tayyari, Fariba', 'McSkimming, Daniel', 'Kannan, Natarajan', 'Tojo, Arinobu', 'Edison, Arthur S', 'Ito, Takahiro']","['Hattori A', 'Tsunoda M', 'Konuma T', 'Kobayashi M', 'Nagy T', 'Glushka J', 'Tayyari F', 'McSkimming D', 'Kannan N', 'Tojo A', 'Edison AS', 'Ito T']",,"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, The University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, USA.', 'The University of Georgia Cancer Center, The University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, USA.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Minato, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Minato, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, The University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, USA.', 'Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, The University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, The University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, USA.', 'Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, The University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, The University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, USA.', 'Institute of Bioinformatics, The University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, The University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, USA.', 'The University of Georgia Cancer Center, The University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, USA.', 'Institute of Bioinformatics, The University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Minato, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, The University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, USA.', 'Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, The University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, USA.', 'Institute of Bioinformatics, The University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, The University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, The University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, USA.', 'The University of Georgia Cancer Center, The University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, USA.']",['eng'],"['P41 GM103390/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM114409/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 DK097209/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170517,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Amino Acids, Branched-Chain)', '0 (MSI2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.6.1.

This results in an overproduction of acidic species that must be extruded to maintain intracellular homeostasis. We recently described that blocking the proton currents in leukemic cells mediated by Hv1 ion channels triggers a marked intracellular acidification and apoptosis induction. Moreover, histamine H1-receptor antagonists were found to induce apoptosis in tumoral cells but the mechanism is still unclear. By using Jurkat T cells, we now show how diphenhydramine inhibits Hv1 mediated currents, inducing a drop in intracellular pH and cellular viability. This provides evidence of a new target structure responsible of the known pro-apoptotic action of antihistaminic drugs.","['Asuaje, Agustin', 'Martin, Pedro', 'Enrique, Nicolas', 'Zegarra, Leandro Agustin Diaz', 'Smaldini, Paola', 'Docena, Guillermo', 'Milesi, Veronica']","['Asuaje A', 'Martin P', 'Enrique N', 'Zegarra LAD', 'Smaldini P', 'Docena G', 'Milesi V']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8388-8727'],"['a Instituto de Estudios Inmunologicos y Fisiopatologicos (IIFP, CONICET-Universidad Nacional de la Plata), Fac. de Ciencias Exactas , Universidad Nacional de La Plata , La Plata , Argentina.', 'a Instituto de Estudios Inmunologicos y Fisiopatologicos (IIFP, CONICET-Universidad Nacional de la Plata), Fac. de Ciencias Exactas , Universidad Nacional de La Plata , La Plata , Argentina.', 'a Instituto de Estudios Inmunologicos y Fisiopatologicos (IIFP, CONICET-Universidad Nacional de la Plata), Fac. de Ciencias Exactas , Universidad Nacional de La Plata , La Plata , Argentina.', 'a Instituto de Estudios Inmunologicos y Fisiopatologicos (IIFP, CONICET-Universidad Nacional de la Plata), Fac. de Ciencias Exactas , Universidad Nacional de La Plata , La Plata , Argentina.', 'a Instituto de Estudios Inmunologicos y Fisiopatologicos (IIFP, CONICET-Universidad Nacional de la Plata), Fac. de Ciencias Exactas , Universidad Nacional de La Plata , La Plata , Argentina.', 'a Instituto de Estudios Inmunologicos y Fisiopatologicos (IIFP, CONICET-Universidad Nacional de la Plata), Fac. de Ciencias Exactas , Universidad Nacional de La Plata , La Plata , Argentina.', 'a Instituto de Estudios Inmunologicos y Fisiopatologicos (IIFP, CONICET-Universidad Nacional de la Plata), Fac. de Ciencias Exactas , Universidad Nacional de La Plata , La Plata , Argentina.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Channels (Austin),"Channels (Austin, Tex.)",101321614,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (HVCN1 protein, human)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '8GTS82S83M (Diphenhydramine)']",,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Diphenhydramine/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Ion Channels/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",PMC5972794,2017/05/18 06:00,2019/08/20 06:00,['2017/05/18 06:00'],"['2017/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/19336950.2017.1331799 [doi]'],ppublish,Channels (Austin). 2018 Jan 1;12(1):58-64. doi: 10.1080/19336950.2017.1331799.,['NOTNLM'],"['*HVCN1', '*antihistaminic', '*apoptosis', '*cancer', '*diphenhydramine', '*intracellular pH', '*leukemia', '*proton channels']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats. The model of rat cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was induced by endothelin, and then treated with different concentrations of etanercept (1, 10, and 50 muM). After treatment, cell counts, viability and cell apoptosis were evaluated. The mRNA levels of myocardial hypertrophy marker genes, including atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and MMP-13, were detected by qRT-PCR, and the expressions of apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2 and Bax) were measured by western blotting. The protein levels of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) were determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. In the present study, TNF-alpha level in cardiomyocytes with hypertrophy was significantly enhanced (P<0.05). Compared to the model group, cell number and viability were significantly increased and ratio of apoptotic cells was reduced by etanercept (P<0.05, P<0.01, or P<0.001). In addition, etanercept remarkably reduced the mRNA levels of ANF, MMP-9 and MMP-13, inhibited the expression of Bax, and increased the expression of Bcl-2 compared to the model group (P<0.05). ELISA results further showed that etanercept lowered the levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, LIF and CT-1 but not TGF-beta1 compared to the model group (P<0.05).

Whole-exome sequencing of tumor samples revealed all three siblings independently acquired variants within the JAK-STAT pathway, specifically targeting JAK2 and SH2B3 (a negative regulator of JAK2), while also sharing the 46/1 haplotype linked with sporadic JAK2-positive myeloproliferative neoplasms. In-depth chromosomal characterization of tumors revealed acquired copy number gains and uniparental disomy amplifying RUNX1, JAK2 and SH2B3 variants, highlighting the significance of co-operation between these disrupted pathways. One sibling, presenting with myelodysplasia at 14 years, had no evidence of clonal or subclonal JAK2 or SH2B3 variants, suggesting the latter were specifically associated with leukemic transformation in her sisters. Collectively, the clinical and molecular homogeneity across these three young siblings provides the first notable example of convergent AML evolution in a RUNX1 pedigree, with the recurrent acquisition of JAK-STAT pathway variants giving rise to high-risk AML, characterized by chemotherapy resistance and relapse.","['Tawana, Kiran', 'Wang, Jun', 'Kiraly, Peter A', 'Kallay, Krisztian', 'Benyo, Gabor', 'Zombori, Marianna', 'Csomor, Judit', 'Al Seraihi, Ahad', 'Rio-Machin, Ana', 'Matolcsy, Andras', 'Chelala, Claude', 'Cavenagh, Jamie', 'Fitzgibbon, Jude', 'Bodor, Csaba']","['Tawana K', 'Wang J', 'Kiraly PA', 'Kallay K', 'Benyo G', 'Zombori M', 'Csomor J', 'Al Seraihi A', 'Rio-Machin A', 'Matolcsy A', 'Chelala C', 'Cavenagh J', 'Fitzgibbon J', 'Bodor C']",,"['Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', 'Bioinformatics Unit, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', '1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, MTA-SE Lendulet Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Pediatric Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, United St. Istvan and St. Laszlo Hospital, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Pediatric Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, United St. Istvan and St. Laszlo Hospital, Budapest, Hungary.', ""Department of Onco-Haematology, Heim Pal Children's Hospital, Budapest, Hungary."", '1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, MTA-SE Lendulet Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', '1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, MTA-SE Lendulet Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Bioinformatics Unit, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', '1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, MTA-SE Lendulet Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['G0700052/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",['Journal Article'],20170517,England,Eur J Hum Genet,European journal of human genetics : EJHG,9302235,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Codon, Nonsense)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (SH2B3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adult', 'Child', '*Codon, Nonsense', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Female', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Pedigree', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC5567149,2017/05/18 06:00,2017/12/13 06:00,['2017/05/18 06:00'],"['2017/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/02 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['ejhg201780 [pii]', '10.1038/ejhg.2017.80 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Hum Genet. 2017 Aug;25(8):1020-1024. doi: 10.1038/ejhg.2017.80.

Resolving their bivalency enables fast changes in their expression, which potentially can trigger cell fate decisions. Here, we provide a theoretical model of bivalency that allows for predictions on the occurrence, stability and regulatory capacity of this prominent modification state. We suggest that bivalency enables balanced gene expression heterogeneity that constitutes a prerequisite of robust lineage priming in somatic stem cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that interactions between the histone and DNA methylation machineries together with the proliferation activity control the stability of the bivalent state and can turn it into an unmodified state. We suggest that deregulation of these interactions underlies cell transformation processes as associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and provide a model of AML blast formation following deregulation of the Ten-eleven Translocation (TET) pathway.","['Thalheim, Torsten', 'Herberg, Maria', 'Loeffler, Markus', 'Galle, Joerg']","['Thalheim T', 'Herberg M', 'Loeffler M', 'Galle J']",,"['Interdisciplinary Centre for Bioinformatics, University Leipzig, Haertelstr. 16-18, 04107 Leipzig, Germany. thalheim@izbi.uni-leipzig.de.', 'Interdisciplinary Centre for Bioinformatics, University Leipzig, Haertelstr. 16-18, 04107 Leipzig, Germany. herberg@izbi.uni-leipzig.de.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, University Leipzig, Haertelstr. 16-18, 04107 Leipzig, Germany. markus.loeffler@imise.uni-leipzig.de.', 'Interdisciplinary Centre for Bioinformatics, University Leipzig, Haertelstr. 16-18, 04107 Leipzig, Germany. galle@izbi.uni-leipzig.de.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170517,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,['0 (Histones)'],IM,"['Algorithms', 'Cell Lineage/*genetics', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Genes', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Models, Biological', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC5454979,2017/05/18 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2017/05/18 06:00'],"['2017/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms18051069 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms18051069 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2017 May 17;18(5). pii: ijms18051069. doi: 10.3390/ijms18051069.,['NOTNLM'],"['aberrant DNA methylation', 'bivalent gene', 'blast formation', 'gene expression heterogeneity', 'histone modification', 'lineage specification']",['The authors declare no conflict of interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A CHO cell line expressing a humanized anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody (mAb-TH) was cultivated in both fed-batch and perfusion modes, and then purified. The critical quality attributes of these mAb variants were characterized and the pharmacokinetics (PK) properties were investigated. Results showed that the perfusion culture achieved higher productivity, whereas the fed-batch culture produced more aggregates and acid components. Additionally, the perfusion culture produced similar fucose, more galactose and a higher proportion of sialic acid on the anti-CD52 mAb compared to the fed-batch culture. Furthermore, the perfusion process produced anti-CD52 mAb had higher complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) efficacy than that produced by the fed-batch culture, a result probably linked to its higher galactose content. However, antibody produced by fed-batch and perfusion cultures showed similar PK profiles in vivo. In conclusion, perfusion is a more efficient method than fed-batch process in the production of functional anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody. Product quality variants of anti-CD52 mAb were found in different cell culture processes, which demonstrated different physiochemical and biological activities, but comparable PK properties. Whether these observations apply to all mAbs await further investigation.","['Zhuang, Chao', 'Zheng, Chen', 'Chen, Yantian', 'Huang, Zheng', 'Wang, Yanchao', 'Fu, Qiang', 'Zeng, Chen', 'Wu, Tong', 'Yang, Liming', 'Qi, Nianmin']","['Zhuang C', 'Zheng C', 'Chen Y', 'Huang Z', 'Wang Y', 'Fu Q', 'Zeng C', 'Wu T', 'Yang L', 'Qi N']",,"['School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 800 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai, 200240, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 800 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai, 200240, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 800 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai, 200240, China.', 'Shanghai Taiyin Biotechnology Co., Ltd., 781 Cailun Road, Zhangjiang Hi-tech Park, Shanghai, 201203, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 800 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai, 200240, China.', 'Shanghai Taiyin Biotechnology Co., Ltd., 781 Cailun Road, Zhangjiang Hi-tech Park, Shanghai, 201203, China.', 'Shanghai Taiyin Biotechnology Co., Ltd., 781 Cailun Road, Zhangjiang Hi-tech Park, Shanghai, 201203, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 800 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai, 200240, China.', 'Shanghai Taiyin Biotechnology Co., Ltd., 781 Cailun Road, Zhangjiang Hi-tech Park, Shanghai, 201203, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 800 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai, 200240, China. biotech@sjtu.edu.cn.', 'School of Life Sciences, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, 5 Second Avenue, Xiasha Higher Education Zone, Hangzhou, 310018, China. biotech@sjtu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170516,Germany,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,8406612,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/biosynthesis/chemistry/*immunology/*pharmacokinetics', 'Batch Cell Culture Techniques', 'Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals', 'CD52 Antigen/*immunology', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', '*Fermentation', 'Humans', 'Macaca fascicularis']",,2017/05/18 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2017/05/18 06:00'],"['2017/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00253-017-8312-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s00253-017-8312-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2017 Aug;101(15):5997-6006. doi: 10.1007/s00253-017-8312-7.

Clinically, the patient was asymptomatic; bone marrow revealed plasmacytosis, mastocytosis, and lymphocytosis with a few ""hairy"" cells. Immunophenotyping showed features of HCL with aberrant CD10 expression and a large subclone of CD19(neg) cells. A diagnosis of HCL with reactive plasmacytosis and mast cell hyperplasia was made and confirmed by immunophenotyping and molecular studies. CONCLUSION: Hematopathologists must be aware of various confounding factors and should judiciously use flow cytometric and molecular studies for attaining a proper diagnosis of HCL. We also report a very rare immunophenotypic aberrancy (CD 19 negativity) in HCL.","['Rastogi, Pulkit', 'Sreedharanunni, Sreejesh', 'Yanamandra, Uday', 'Sachdeva, Man Updesh Singh', 'Varma, Neelam']","['Rastogi P', 'Sreedharanunni S', 'Yanamandra U', 'Sachdeva MUS', 'Varma N']",,"['Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh - 160012, India.', 'Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh - 160012, India.', 'Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh - 160012, India.', 'Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh - 160012, India.', 'Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh - 160012, India.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20170501,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,,PMC5419203,2017/05/18 06:00,2017/05/18 06:01,['2017/05/18 06:00'],"['2017/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2017.033 [doi]', 'mjhid-9-1-e2017033 [pii]']",epublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2017 May 1;9(1):e2017033. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2017.033. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['Aberrancy', 'CD19 negativity', 'Hairy cell leukemia', 'Immunophenotype']",['Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and hepatic late adverse effects in a cohort of ALL survivors treated at the Hematology and Oncology Unit, Pediatrics Department, Menoufia University, Egypt. METHODS: In this case-control study, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were assessed for 35 pediatric ALL survivors and 35 healthy children. These parameters were plotted on the growth and WHO standard deviation charts for both males and females. Overweight and obesity were defined by BMI > 85(th) and 95(th) percentile respectively. Laboratory investigations were done in the form of iron profile, liver enzymes, total and direct bilirubin levels, serum urea &creatinine and detection of hepatitis C virus antibodies by ELISA. RESULTS: The weight and BMI were significantly greater in the survivors than controls (P value =0.002 and 0.039 respectively). ALT, total & direct bilirubin, serum ferritin and transferrin saturation were considerably higher in the survivors than the controls (P value = 0.03, 0.036, 0.044, 0.006 and 0.03 respectively). Ten (28.6%) of survivors had hepatitis C antibodies with none (0%) of controls (P value =0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric ALL survivors are at increased risk of overweight/obesity, hepatic dysfunction in the form of elevated liver enzymes, bilirubin levels, and C viral hepatitis.

The present study reveals that enhanced expression of LIF in response to PMA (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate) in human histiocytic lymphoma cell line U937 largely happens through stabilization of its mRNA. Functional characterization of the long 3'-untranslated region of human lif mRNA revealed several conserved sequences with conventional cis-acting elements. A 216 nucleotide containing proximal cis-element with two AUUUA pentamers and four poly-rC sequences demonstrated significant mRNA destabilizing potential, which, on treatment with PMA, showed stabilizing activity. Affinity chromatography followed by western blot and RNA co-immunoprecipitation of PMA-treated U937 extract identified Nucleolin and PCBP1 as two protein trans-factors interacting with lif mRNA, specifically to the proximal non-conventional AU-rich region. PMA induced nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation of both Nucleolin and PCBP1. RNA-dependent in vivo co-association of both these proteins with lif mRNA was demonstrated by decreased co-precipitation in the presence of RNase. Ectopic overexpression of Nucleolin showed stabilization of both intrinsic lif mRNA and gfp reporter, whereas knockdown of Nucleolin and PCBP1 demonstrated a significant decrease in both lif mRNA and protein levels. Collectively, this report establishes the stabilization of lif mRNA by PMA, mediated by the interactions of two RNA-binding proteins, Nucleolin and PCBP1 with a proximal cis-element.","['Chakraborty, Alina', 'Mukherjee, Srimoyee', 'Saha, Sucharita', 'De, Soumasree', 'Sengupta Bandyopadhyay, Sumita']","['Chakraborty A', 'Mukherjee S', 'Saha S', 'De S', 'Sengupta Bandyopadhyay S']",,"['Department of Biophysics, Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India.', 'Department of Biophysics, Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India.', 'Department of Biophysics, Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India.', 'Department of Biophysics, Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India.', 'Department of Biophysics, Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India bandyopas@gmail.com ssbmbg@caluniv.ac.in.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170703,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PCBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, recombinant)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (nucleolin)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/drug effects"", 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter/drug effects', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'RNA/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Stability/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/chemistry/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*toxicity', 'U937 Cells']",,2017/05/18 06:00,2017/07/27 06:00,['2017/05/18 06:00'],"['2017/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/06 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['BCJ20170051 [pii]', '10.1042/BCJ20170051 [doi]']",epublish,Biochem J. 2017 Jul 3;474(14):2349-2363. doi: 10.1042/BCJ20170051.,['NOTNLM'],"['*AU-rich elements', '*C-rich elements', '*hnRNPE1', '*mRNA stability']",,"['(c) 2017 The Author(s); published by Portland Press Limited on behalf of the', 'Biochemical Society.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BRAF(V600E) mutation is the most common mutation in both conditions and also occurs in the hematopoietic neoplasm hairy cell leukemia (HCL). It is not known if adult LCH or ECD arises from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), nor which potential blood borne precursors lead to the formation of histiocytic lesions. In this study, BRAF(V600E) allele-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to map the neoplastic clone in 20 adults with LCH, ECD, and HCL. BRAF(V600E) was tracked to classical monocytes, nonclassical monocytes, and CD1c(+) myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) in the blood, and mutations were observed in HSCs and myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow of 4 patients. The pattern of involvement of peripheral blood myeloid cells was indistinguishable between LCH and ECD, although the histiocytic disorders were distinct to HCL. As reported in children, detection of BRAF(V600E) in peripheral blood of adults was a marker of active multisystem LCH. The healthy counterparts of myeloid cells affected by BRAF mutation had a range of differentiation potentials depending on exogenous signals. CD1c(+) DCs acquired high langerin and CD1a with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and transforming growth factor beta alone, whereas CD14(+) classical monocytes required additional notch ligation. Both classical and nonclassical monocytes, but not CD1c(+) DCs, made foamy macrophages easily in vitro with macrophage colony-stimulating factor and human serum. These studies are consistent with a hematopoietic origin and >1 immediate cellular precursor in both LCH and ECD.","['Milne, Paul', 'Bigley, Venetia', 'Bacon, Chris M', 'Neel, Antoine', 'McGovern, Naomi', 'Bomken, Simon', 'Haniffa, Muzlifah', 'Diamond, Eli L', 'Durham, Benjamin H', 'Visser, Johannes', 'Hunt, David', 'Gunawardena, Harsha', 'Macheta, Mac', 'McClain, Kenneth L', 'Allen, Carl', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Collin, Matthew']","['Milne P', 'Bigley V', 'Bacon CM', 'Neel A', 'McGovern N', 'Bomken S', 'Haniffa M', 'Diamond EL', 'Durham BH', 'Visser J', 'Hunt D', 'Gunawardena H', 'Macheta M', 'McClain KL', 'Allen C', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Collin M']",,"['Institute of Cellular Medicine and.', 'Institute of Cellular Medicine and.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Cellular Pathology, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.', 'Internal Medicine Department, Hotel-Dieu University Hopital, Nantes, France.', 'Institute of Cellular Medicine and.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cellular Medicine and.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', ""East Midlands Children's and Young Persons' Integrated Cancer Service, Leicester Children's Hospital, Leicester, United Kingdom."", 'Medical Research Council Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.', 'Rheumatology Department, North Bristol National Health Service Trust, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'Blackpool Teaching Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust, Blackpool, United Kingdom; and.', ""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX."", ""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX."", 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Institute of Cellular Medicine and.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA201247/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'C30484/A21025/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'R01 CA154947/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'WT088555MA/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '101155/Z/13/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170516,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD1)', '0 (CD1C protein, human)', '0 (CD1a antigen)', '0 (CD207 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Mannose-Binding Lectins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alleles', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/immunology', 'Antigens, CD1/genetics/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Erdheim-Chester Disease/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Foam Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Gene Expression', 'Glycoproteins/genetics/immunology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Histiocytosis, Langerhans-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lectins, C-Type/genetics/immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Mannose-Binding Lectins/genetics/immunology', 'Monocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/*genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/immunology']",PMC5524529,2017/05/18 06:00,2017/08/16 06:00,['2017/05/18 06:00'],"['2016/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33216-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-12-757823 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Jul 13;130(2):167-175. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-12-757823.

To date, evidence indicates that protein glycosylation and its upstream regulators might be implicated in tumorigenesis and chemoresistance occurrence. In current study we initially explored N-glycan profiles on the surface of CML cell lines and bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) of CML patients by using mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. An elevated sialylation was detected in K562R cells (CML cells with imatinib resistance phenotype) compare to K562 cells. By quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting analysis we observed that imatinib resistant K562R cells exhibited marked high levels of CMP-N-acetylneuraminate-beta-galactosamide-alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase (ST3Gal IV) as compared to imatinib sensitive K562 cells. Further studies revealed that manipulated expression of ST3GAL IV led to the significant alterations of cell cycle distribution, apoptotic signal, cell proliferation and the effectiveness of imatinib treatment. Using microRNA array, miRNA database searching and luciferase reporter assay, we identified that miR-224 and let-7i directly regulate the expression of ST3GAL IV gene. Moreover, engineered expression of miR-224 and let-7i in K562 and K562R cells could significantly affect ST6Gal IV-induced proliferation rate and drug-resistance. Thus we propose that miR-224 and let-7i regulate the proliferation and chemosensitivity of CML cells probably via targeting ST3GAL IV.","['Zhou, Huimin', 'Li, Yang', 'Liu, Bing', 'Shan, Yujia', 'Li, Yan', 'Zhao, Lifen', 'Su, Zhen', 'Jia, Li']","['Zhou H', 'Li Y', 'Liu B', 'Shan Y', 'Li Y', 'Zhao L', 'Su Z', 'Jia L']",,"['College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, Liaoning Province, China; Department of Microbiology, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, Liaoning Province, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, Liaoning Province, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, Liaoning Province, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, Liaoning Province, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, the First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116011, Liaoning Province, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, Liaoning Province, China.', 'Graduate School, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, Liaoning Province, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, Liaoning Province, China.

However, it frequently evades timely detection. Early identification and effective reversal may improve the clinical outcome. In this prospective study, we evaluate several serum inflammatory markers after aneurysmal SAH with regard to the occurrence of DCI. METHODS: On days 1, 4, 7, 10, and 14 after SAH, leucocyte count, C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, E-selectin, matrix metallopeptidase 9, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and leukemia inhibitory factor were assessed in patients' serum samples. Using a Cox regression model (SPSS 21.0), associations of baseline parameters, maximum and delta (maximum minus baseline) values with occurrence of DCI were evaluated. RESULTS: Considering the assessed parameters, leucocyte count (high baseline and delta values) matches most closely with occurrence of DCI. Although baseline levels of C-reactive protein are also associated with occurrence of DCI, neither maximum (only on a borderline level) nor delta levels do so. CONCLUSIONS: Our data analysis identified leucocyte count as the parameter most likely associated with occurrence of DCI. However, because of its lack of specificity leucocyte count, it cannot be used as a biomarker. As hypothesized earlier, the results indicate a possible involvement of the inflammatory reaction after aneurysmal SAH in the pathomechanism of DCI.","['Chamling, Bishwas', 'Gross, Stefan', 'Stoffel-Wagner, Birgit', 'Schubert, Gerrit A', 'Clusmann, Hans', 'Coburn, Mark', 'Hollig, Anke']","['Chamling B', 'Gross S', 'Stoffel-Wagner B', 'Schubert GA', 'Clusmann H', 'Coburn M', 'Hollig A']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine B, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany and DZHK (German Centre for Cardiovascular Research), partner site Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine B, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany and DZHK (German Centre for Cardiovascular Research), partner site Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.

TKI therapy has since revolutionized the treatment of CML and has served as a paradigm of success for targeted drug therapy in cancer. Several new TKIs for CML have been approved over the last two decades that exhibit improved potency over imatinib and have different off-target profiles, providing options for individualized therapy selection. Areas covered: Current management of chronic phase CML, including guidance on the sequential use of imatinib and newer-generation TKIs and evolving treatment strategies such as TKI discontinuation. Relevant literature was identified by searching biomedical databases (i.e. PubMed) for primary research material. Expert commentary: Although survival outcomes have drastically improved for CML patients, treatment for CML has grown more complex with the introduction of next-generation TKIs and the advent of treatment-free remissions (TFR). Goals of therapy have shifted accordingly, with increased focus on improving quality of life, managing patient expectations and optimizing patient adherence.","['Patel, Ami B', 'Wilds, Brandon W', 'Deininger, Michael W']","['Patel AB', 'Wilds BW', 'Deininger MW']",,"['a Huntsman Cancer Institute , The University of Utah , Salt Lake City , UT , USA.', 'b Department of Pharmacy , The University of Florida , Orlando , FL , USA.', 'c Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies , Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah , Salt Lake City , UT , USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170522,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug Monitoring', '*Drug Substitution', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Retreatment', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2017/05/18 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2017/05/18 06:00'],"['2017/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2017.1330144 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2017 Jul;10(7):659-674. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2017.1330144.

If at all relapse occurs, following sites are involved: Central Nervous System (CNS), skin, testes, mediastinum, gingiva, and ear. Isolated CNS relapses after complete morphological and molecular remission is rarer particularly in children. AIM: To review the literature systematically to find out the incidence of isolated CNS relapse in paediatric APML cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search of major databases (Medline, Pubmed and Google Scholar) was conducted. We included all types of studies that reported about incidence or prevalence of isolated CNS relapse in children upto 18 years of age with APML. RESULTS: A total of nine studies (with 10 cases of isolated CNS relapse) were included. Majority (70%) was high risk patients, and 60% were </=six-year-old. Nearly, 50% were having the mean time to relapse <12 months and most (60%) of them were male. The children who died were having shorter time to CNS relapse (around 12 months), and were older (>6 to 18 years). CONCLUSION: In the present review, disease in the high-risk group, male sex, younger age (</=six-years-old), and Promyelocytic Leukaemia/Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha (PML-RARA) detection was found to be associated with isolated CNS relapse in children with APML. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination along with immunophenotyping and Reverse Transcription polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for PML-RARA is required for a definite diagnosis and early treatment of patients to improve overall survival.","['Gajendra, Smeeta', 'Das, Rashmi Ranjan', 'Sharma, Rashi']","['Gajendra S', 'Das RR', 'Sharma R']",,"['Associate Consultant, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Medanta-the Medicity, Gurugram, Haryana, India.', 'Associate Professor, Department of Paediatrics, AIIMS, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.', 'Senior Resident, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Medanta-the Medicity, Gurugram, Haryana, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170301,India,J Clin Diagn Res,Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR,101488993,,,,PMC5427419,2017/05/18 06:00,2017/05/18 06:01,['2017/05/18 06:00'],"['2016/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7860/JCDR/2017/24196.9572 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Diagn Res. 2017 Mar;11(3):XE05-XE08. doi: 10.7860/JCDR/2017/24196.9572.

This work aimed to investigate the anticancer potential of five novel 2-Thioxo-oxazolidin-4-one derivatives. METHODS: Cytotoxicity assays were performed in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy individuals and seven tumor cell lines. Apoptosis detection and cell cycle were evaluated by flow cytometry and the expression of genes involved in cell death processes by Real-Time PCR. RESULTS: All oxazolinedione derivatives were not cytotoxic in PBMCs. NB-5 showed the best results in cancer cells, inhibiting the growth of all tumor cell lines tested. NB-4 exhibited the highest cytotoxicity in Jurkat cells (IC50=15.19muM) and NB-3 showed better anticancer effects in HL-60 (17.84muM). Only NB-4 significantly induced apoptosis in acute leukemia cells (p=0.001). All compounds caused a significant increase in expression of pro-apoptotic gene BID (p<0.05) and BECN1 (p<0.05). NB-3 significantly modulated the expression of RIPK3 (p=0.02) and DDIT3 (p=0.014), while NB-2 induced an increase of CDKN1A (p=0.03) and NB-4 induced PPARgamma gene (p=0.0006). CONCLUSION: NB-5 showed antitumor effects in solid and hematopoietic cancer cells, while other derivatives produced higher activity against hematopoietic cells. In acute leukemia cells, oxazolidinone derivatives modulated the expression of genes involved in apoptosis, ER stress, necroptosis and inflammation.","['Campos, Julia Furtado', 'Pereira, Michelly Cristiny', 'de Sena, Wanessa Layssa Batista', 'de Barros Martins, Caio Gomes', 'de Oliveira, Jamerson Ferreira', 'da Cruz Amorim, Cezar Augusto', 'de Melo Rego, Moacyr Jesus Barreto', 'da Rocha Pitta, Marina Galdino', 'de Lima, Maria do Carmo Alves', 'da Rocha Pitta, Maira Galdino', 'da Rocha Pitta, Ivan']","['Campos JF', 'Pereira MC', 'de Sena WLB', 'de Barros Martins CG', 'de Oliveira JF', 'da Cruz Amorim CA', 'de Melo Rego MJB', 'da Rocha Pitta MG', 'de Lima MDCA', 'da Rocha Pitta MG', 'da Rocha Pitta I']",,"['Laboratorio de Imunomodulacao e Novas Abordagens Terapeuticas (LINAT), Nucleo de Pesquisa para Inovacao Terapeutica Suely Galdino (NUPIT-SG) - Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Imunomodulacao e Novas Abordagens Terapeuticas (LINAT), Nucleo de Pesquisa para Inovacao Terapeutica Suely Galdino (NUPIT-SG) - Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Imunomodulacao e Novas Abordagens Terapeuticas (LINAT), Nucleo de Pesquisa para Inovacao Terapeutica Suely Galdino (NUPIT-SG) - Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Imunomodulacao e Novas Abordagens Terapeuticas (LINAT), Nucleo de Pesquisa para Inovacao Terapeutica Suely Galdino (NUPIT-SG) - Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil; Laboratorio de Planejamento e Sintese de Farmacos (LPSF), Nucleo de Pesquisa em Inovacao Terapeutica Suely Galdino (NUPIT-SG) - Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Planejamento e Sintese de Farmacos (LPSF), Nucleo de Pesquisa em Inovacao Terapeutica Suely Galdino (NUPIT-SG) - Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Planejamento e Sintese de Farmacos (LPSF), Nucleo de Pesquisa em Inovacao Terapeutica Suely Galdino (NUPIT-SG) - Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Imunomodulacao e Novas Abordagens Terapeuticas (LINAT), Nucleo de Pesquisa para Inovacao Terapeutica Suely Galdino (NUPIT-SG) - Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Planejamento e Sintese de Farmacos (LPSF), Nucleo de Pesquisa em Inovacao Terapeutica Suely Galdino (NUPIT-SG) - Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Planejamento e Sintese de Farmacos (LPSF), Nucleo de Pesquisa em Inovacao Terapeutica Suely Galdino (NUPIT-SG) - Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Imunomodulacao e Novas Abordagens Terapeuticas (LINAT), Nucleo de Pesquisa para Inovacao Terapeutica Suely Galdino (NUPIT-SG) - Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Imunomodulacao e Novas Abordagens Terapeuticas (LINAT), Nucleo de Pesquisa para Inovacao Terapeutica Suely Galdino (NUPIT-SG) - Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil; Laboratorio de Planejamento e Sintese de Farmacos (LPSF), Nucleo de Pesquisa em Inovacao Terapeutica Suely Galdino (NUPIT-SG) - Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil.

Methods: We report here 3 cases of invasive infection caused by Trichosporon asahii in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston, Texas. We also conducted a literature review and identified 16 additional reports of pediatric patients with invasive T asahii infection and an underlying malignant or nonmalignant hematologic disorder. Results: Of the 19 cases of invasive T asahii infection, the most commonly reported underlying hematologic disorder was acute lymphoblastic leukenia (47%), followed by acute myelogenous leukemia (21%). Most of the patients (94%) had neutropenia, defined as an absolute neutrophil count of <500 cells/mm3. Antifungal prophylaxis information was available in 6 of the 19 cases, and micafungin use was reported in 5 cases. Treatment regimens frequently included voriconazole monotherapy (47%) or the combination of an azole antifungal with amphotericin B (35%). The mortality rate was 58%. Conclusions: Recognizing that echinocandins, which are increasingly used for prophylaxis in patients with a hematologic malignancy, are not active against Trichosporon species is of critical importance. The recommended first-line therapy for trichosporonosis is voriconazole, but successful outcome depends largely on the underlying immune status of the host.","['Foster, Catherine E', 'Edwards, Morven S', 'Brackett, Julienne', 'Schady, Deborah A', 'Healy, C Mary', 'Baker, Carol J']","['Foster CE', 'Edwards MS', 'Brackett J', 'Schady DA', 'Healy CM', 'Baker CJ']",,"[""Section of Infectious Diseases, Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston."", ""Section of Infectious Diseases, Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston."", ""Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston."", ""Section of Pathology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston."", ""Section of Infectious Diseases, Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston."", ""Section of Infectious Diseases, Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,101586049,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)', 'R10H71BSWG (Micafungin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Echinocandins/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Invasive Fungal Infections/*diagnosis/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Lipopeptides/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Micafungin', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Opportunistic Infections/*diagnosis/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Trichosporonosis/*diagnosis/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Voriconazole/therapeutic use']",,2017/05/17 06:00,2018/11/14 06:00,['2017/05/17 06:00'],"['2016/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['3828455 [pii]', '10.1093/jpids/pix031 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc. 2018 Aug 17;7(3):199-204. doi: 10.1093/jpids/pix031.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We performed a computerized search of the MEDLINE/PUBMED databases with keywords ""outer dense fiber, ODF, cancer, testis, gametogenesis and infertility"". RESULTS: The results of animal and human studies show ODF contribution to male fertility. In addition, ODFs are expressed in some cancers, including prostate adenocarcinoma, breast cancer, chronic myeloid leukemia and basal cell carcinoma.

Blood samples from 200 asymptomatic owned cats and 30 stray cats were processed using nested PCR and commercial immunochromatographic tests to diagnose infections. To evaluate the factors associated with FIV and/or FeLV in owned cats, a semi-structured interview was conducted with each owner about the animal's environment, and these data were subjected to unconditional logistic regression. The frequencies for owned cats were 6% (12/200) and 3% (6/200) for FIV and FeLV, respectively. No owned cat was positive for both viruses. Stray cats showed frequencies of 6.66% (2/30) and 0% (0/30) for FIV and FeLV, respectively. Contact with other cats and living in peri-urban areas were considered to be risk factors (P < 0.05) for FIV. We did not identify any factors associated with infections with FeLV.

We studied the correlation of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters with these toxicities and the efficacy of CFB in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Clofarabine PK parameters showed large inter-individual variability. A higher CFB area under the curve was significantly associated with higher transaminase levels (p = .011 for aspartate aminotransferase (AST), adjusted for age, sex, cumulated CFB dosage, baseline AST, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR)). No significant association could be found between maximum concentration and the liver toxicity parameters. The occurrence of skin toxicity and the response to re-induction chemotherapy evaluated at day 15 were also not associated with PK. In conclusion, a higher individual CFB exposure is associated with increased liver toxicity reflected by elevated liver enzymes, without having an impact on anti-leukemic efficacy.","['Buttner, Bozena', 'Knoth, Holger', 'Kramer, Michael', 'Oertel, Reinhard', 'Seeling, Andreas', 'Sockel, Katja', 'von Bonin, Malte', 'Stolzel, Friedrich', 'Alakel, Nael', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Rollig, Christoph', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Schetelig, Johannes', 'Middeke, Jan Moritz']","['Buttner B', 'Knoth H', 'Kramer M', 'Oertel R', 'Seeling A', 'Sockel K', 'von Bonin M', 'Stolzel F', 'Alakel N', 'Platzbecker U', 'Rollig C', 'Ehninger G', 'Bornhauser M', 'Schetelig J', 'Middeke JM']",,"['a Klinikapotheke, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der TU Dresden , Dresden , Germany.', 'a Klinikapotheke, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der TU Dresden , Dresden , Germany.', 'b Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der TU Dresden , Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I , Dresden , Germany.', 'c Institut fur Klinische Pharmakologie, Medizinische Fakultat Carl Gustav Carus der TU , Dresden , Germany.', 'd Institut fur Pharmazie, Friedrich-Schiller-Universitat Jena , Jena , Germany.', 'b Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der TU Dresden , Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I , Dresden , Germany.', 'b Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der TU Dresden , Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I , Dresden , Germany.', 'e German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'f Consortium for Translational Cancer Research, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'b Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der TU Dresden , Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I , Dresden , Germany.', 'b Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der TU Dresden , Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I , Dresden , Germany.', 'b Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der TU Dresden , Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I , Dresden , Germany.', 'b Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der TU Dresden , Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I , Dresden , Germany.', 'b Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der TU Dresden , Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I , Dresden , Germany.', 'b Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der TU Dresden , Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I , Dresden , Germany.', 'f Consortium for Translational Cancer Research, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'g National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'b Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der TU Dresden , Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I , Dresden , Germany.', 'h DKMS, German Bone Marrow Donor Center , Tubingen , Germany.', 'b Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der TU Dresden , Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I , Dresden , Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170516,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/*adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/*adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', 'Clofarabine', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Liver/drug effects/metabolism', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Skin/drug effects/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2017/05/17 06:00,2018/04/24 06:00,['2017/05/17 06:00'],"['2017/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2017.1319051 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2017 Dec;58(12):2865-2874. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2017.1319051.

P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a drug-efflux transporter, is upregulated in MM patients post-chemotherapy and is involved in the development of drug resistance since many anti-myeloma drugs (including proteasome inhibitors) are P-gp substrates. Hypoxia develops in the bone marrow niche during MM progression and has long been linked to chemoresistance. Additionally, hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF-1alpha) was demonstrated to directly regulate P-gp expression. We found that in MM patients P-gp expression positively correlated with the hypoxic marker, HIF-1alpha. Hypoxia increased P-gp protein expression and its efflux capabilities in MM cells in vitro using flow cytometry. We reported herein that hypoxia-mediated resistance to carfilzomib and bortezomib in MM cells is due to P-gp activity and was reversed by tariquidar, a P-gp inhibitor.

Accordingly, clinical endpoints must evolve to capture these outcomes, and to provide faster access to novel therapies. Minimal residual disease (MRD) is an important endpoint representing more accurately the depth of remission than complete response (CR), and is highly prognostic of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). MRD could be considered a key outcome of clinical trials and, as a surrogate for PFS, could identify the most cost-effective and durable treatment sequencing. MRD testing could also determine which patients would benefit from additional therapy and, accordingly, ascertain when therapy should be stopped earlier, to reduce toxicity and increase treatment-free intervals.

Outcome of ET is also negatively affected by the presence of the JAK2(V617F) mutation. To investigate the impact of JAK2(V617F) mutation burden and histology on outcome, we collected 475 WHO-diagnosed ET (69.2%) or early-PMF JAK2(V617F) -positive patients followed in 4 Italian haematology centers. JAK2(V617F) allele burden was </=50% in 90% and 87% of ET and early-PMF patients, respectively (P = .34). During follow-up, 32 (9.7%) ET and 18 (12.3%) early-PMF patients experienced 59 thrombotic events, and 27 patients (5.6%) and 6 (1.2%) patients evolved to myelofibrosis and acute leukemia, respectively. At last contact, 28 (5.8%) patients had died. In early-PMF compared to ET, the 10-year mortality rates (6.7% and 4.3%, P = .73), leukemic transformation rates (1.4% and 1.2%, P = .45), and thrombosis rates (16.7% and 12.2%, P = .12) were comparable. Only progression to overt myelofibrosis at 10 years was significantly worse (11.4% and 1.5%, P = .004). In multivariate analysis, a higher (>50%) JAK2(V617F) burden was significantly correlated with fibrotic progression and histology. Considering JAK2(V617F) -positive disease, a higher (>50%) JAK2(V617F) burden and histological classification are independent prognostic risk factors for disease progression. These findings reinforce the need for standardized detection of this mutation.","['Latagliata, Roberto', 'Polverelli, Nicola', 'Tieghi, Alessia', 'Palumbo, Giuseppe Alberto', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Sabattini, Elena', 'Villari, Loredana', 'Riminucci, Mara', 'Valli, Riccardo', 'Catani, Lucia', 'Alimena, Giuliana', 'Ottaviani, Emanuela', 'Fama, Angelo', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Perricone, Margherita', 'Spinsanti, Marco', 'Cavo, Michele', 'Vianelli, Nicola', 'Palandri, Francesca']","['Latagliata R', 'Polverelli N', 'Tieghi A', 'Palumbo GA', 'Breccia M', 'Sabattini E', 'Villari L', 'Riminucci M', 'Valli R', 'Catani L', 'Alimena G', 'Ottaviani E', 'Fama A', 'Martinelli G', 'Perricone M', 'Spinsanti M', 'Cavo M', 'Vianelli N', 'Palandri F']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5098-3901'],"['Division of Hematology-Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, University La Sapienza of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Unit of Stem Cell Transplantation, Chair of Hematology, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliera-IRCSS Arcispedale Santa Maria Nuova, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Ospedale Ferrarotto, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology-Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, University La Sapienza of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Haematopathology Unit, Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, S.

Light microscopy of a renal biopsy specimen showed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis features with marked mononuclear cell infiltration in the interstitium. On immunofluorescence study, the deposition of IgM heavy chain was predominantly observed with the same distribution of kappa light chain, whereas no lambda light chain was found. Electron microscopy revealed fine granular deposits in the mesangial, subendothelial, and subepithelial areas, mimicking those observed in the immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis. These pathological findings were consistent with recently described cases of proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal IgG deposits.

After myeloablative conditioning procedures, comprising cytarabine with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation, the HLA-matched unrelated bone marrow stem cells were infused (day 0). Her serum creatinine concentration, having been 0.6 mg/dL at baseline, began to increase from day 1 and was 2.3 mg/L on day 7. Hemodialysis was required to treat fluid overload and worsening uremia on days 8 and 9. On day 10, she presented with refractory hypotension and died due to multi-organ failure on day 12.

Not only did his glomeruli show class I lupus nephritis with mesangial depositions of IgG, IgA, C3, and C1q, but also tubulointerstitial nephritis with marked T-lymphocyte infiltration. These infiltrated T cells partly had nuclear atypia. The patient was positive for human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) antibodies. Furthermore, clonal rearrangements of T cell receptor-gamma chain gene was detected in the DNA extracted from his kidney sections by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. A second renal biopsy 6 months after the prednisolone treatment showed that the infiltrating T lymphocytes had markedly diminished.

The patient initially received umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) with CY 120 mg/kg and kidney unshielded 12 Gy of total body irradiation. After the leukemic relapse, he received allogenic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) 270 days after the first transplantation. Two months later, his renal function started to deteriorate and urinary protein increased gradually to 1 g/day. Four months after BMT, by the symptoms of severe GVHD, the dose of tacrolimus, utilized to avoid GVHD, was increased although his serum Cre level elevated to 2.97 mg/dL. Serum Cre level improved to 2.0 mg/dL paralleled with GVHD improvement. Renal histological findings showed severe interstitial edema, features of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), and C4d deposition along the glomerular capillaries and peritubular capillaries. We suggested that control of GVHD had benefitted to ameliorate renal function of the patient. Treatment for GVHD improved renal dysfunction and TMA of our patients.

Epidemiological studies suggest that infections or immune responses to infections may promote such an expansion and thus BCP-ALL development. Nevertheless, a specific pathogen responsible for this process has not been identified. BCP-ALL cells critically depend on interactions with the bone marrow microenvironment. The bone marrow is also home to memory T helper (Th) cells that have previously expanded during an immune response in the periphery. In secondary lymphoid organs, Th cells can interact with malignant cells of mature B cell origin, while such interactions between Th cells and malignant immature B cell in the bone marrow have not been described yet. Nevertheless, literature supports a model where Th cells-expanded during an infection in early childhood-migrate to the bone marrow and support BCP-ALL cells as they support normal B cells. Further research is required to mechanistically confirm this model and to elucidate the interaction pathways between leukemia cells and cells of the tumor microenvironment. As benefit, targeting these interactions could be included in current treatment regimens to increase therapeutic efficiency and to reduce relapses.","['Burgler, Simone', 'Nadal, David']","['Burgler S', 'Nadal D']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3238-5120'],"[""Experimental Infectious Diseases and Cancer Research, University Children's Hospital Zurich, 8008, Zurich, Switzerland. simone.buergler@kispi.uzh.ch."", ""Experimental Infectious Diseases and Cancer Research, University Children's Hospital Zurich, 8008, Zurich, Switzerland.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170516,Germany,Mol Cell Pediatr,Molecular and cellular pediatrics,101660689,,,,PMC5432458,2017/05/17 06:00,2017/05/17 06:01,['2017/05/17 06:00'],"['2017/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40348-017-0072-z [doi]', '10.1186/s40348-017-0072-z [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Pediatr. 2017 Dec;4(1):6. doi: 10.1186/s40348-017-0072-z.

Objective To determine the time from the start of a first-line TKI until it passes to second-line, and to establish the reasons for the change of therapy time. Setting Patients with Philadelphia-positive CML treated with some TKI. Methods Retrospective cohort study, between January 1 2007 and July 31 2015, with information obtained from medical records, the time to change initial drugs to secondline therapy, and the reasons for change, were identified. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was carried out. Main outcome measure A change in therapy to the secondline TKI and the final reason for the change of therapy. Results A total of 247 patients treated were found in 22 cities in Colombia with a mean age of 53.2 +/- 15.2 years. The drug most used as initial therapy was imatinib; 53.8% of cases had to change to another TKI. 50% of patients changed therapy in 42 months, men in 24 and women in 67 months (95% CI 14.314-33.686; p = 0.001). Being male (OR 2.23; 95% CI 1.291-3.854; p = 0.004) and receiving hydroxyurea (OR 3.65; 95% CI 1.601-8.326; p = 0.002) were associated with a higher probability of switching to nilotinib or dasatinib, while receiving a new-generation TKI (OR 0.15; 95% CI 0.071-0.341; p < 0.001) reduced this risk. Conclusions A high proportion of patients needed to change to a second line with nilotinib and dasatinib management. It is necessary to obtain more real world evidence, to improve the effectiveness, adherence and safety of the treatment.","['Machado-Alba, Jorge Enrique', 'Machado-Duque, Manuel Enrique']","['Machado-Alba JE', 'Machado-Duque ME']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8455-0936'],"['Grupo de Investigacion en Farmacoepidemiologia y Farmacovigilancia, Facultad Ciencias de la Salud-Programa de Medicina, Universidad Tecnologica de Pereira- Audifarma S.A., Paraje la Julita, AA: 97, Pereira, Risaralda, 660003, Colombia. machado@utp.edu.co.', 'Grupo de Investigacion en Farmacoepidemiologia y Farmacovigilancia, Facultad Ciencias de la Salud-Programa de Medicina, Universidad Tecnologica de Pereira- Audifarma S.A., Paraje la Julita, AA: 97, Pereira, Risaralda, 660003, Colombia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170515,Netherlands,Int J Clin Pharm,International journal of clinical pharmacy,101554912,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Substitution/methods/*trends', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Young Adult']",,2017/05/17 06:00,2018/04/27 06:00,['2017/05/17 06:00'],"['2017/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11096-017-0484-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s11096-017-0484-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Pharm. 2017 Aug;39(4):851-859. doi: 10.1007/s11096-017-0484-9.

Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the ratio of maximum WBC count to pretreatment WBC count (WBCratio) was most strongly associated with complete remission (CR) in previously untreated patients among several parameters we analyzed in this study; however, the prediction accuracy was not clinically significant considering the area under the curve of 0.694. Based on the cutoff value of the WBCratio, CR rate and event-free survival in the high WBCratio group were significantly better than those in the low WBCratio group in untreated patients.

In addition, an increase in blasts after G-CSF priming had a significant negative impact on CR rate in untreated patients.

This ""immunogenic cell death"" requires calreticulin (CRT) translocation to the plasma membrane, which has been shown to promote cancer cell phagocytosis. However, it remains unclear whether the effect of CRT on cancer cell phagocytosis is alone sufficient to affect tumor immunity. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells expressing cell-surface CRT were generated in order to characterize the mechanism(s) through which CRT activates tumor immune responses. Potent immune-mediated control or rejection of AML was observed in mice with CRT-expressing leukemia. The ""CRT effect"" was ultimately T-cell dependent, but dendritic cells (DCs), and CD8alpha(+) DCs in particular, were also necessary, indicating that CRT might act directly on these DCs. CRT-expressing AML cells were slightly more susceptible to phagocytosis by DCs in vivo, but this effect was unlikely to explain the potent immunity observed. CRT did not affect classical DC maturation markers, but induced expression of type I interferon (IFN), which was critical for its positive effect on survival. In conclusion, CRT functions as a ""danger signal"" that promotes a host type I IFN response associated with the induction of potent leukemia-specific T-cell immunity.","['Chen, Xiufen', 'Fosco, Dominick', 'Kline, Douglas E', 'Kline, Justin']","['Chen X', 'Fosco D', 'Kline DE', 'Kline J']",,"['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Committee on Immunology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Committee on Immunology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA166770/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20170110,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,,PMC5414882,2017/05/17 06:00,2017/05/17 06:01,['2017/05/17 06:00'],"['2016/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/24 00:00 [revised]', '2016/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2016.1278332 [doi]', '1278332 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2017 Jan 10;6(4):e1278332. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2016.1278332. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*calreticulin', '*immunity', '*type I interferon']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigate the expression pattern of miR-196b. Using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), we detected the expression of miR-196b and its correlated genes (SMC1A/MLH1) in initial pediatric AML. A significant association was observed between overexpression of miR-196b and inferior overall survival of pediatric AML (Log Rank P<0.0001). AML M4/5 subtype, high white blood cell (WBC) count at presentation, MLL rearrangement, or FLT3-ITD mutation at diagnosis and non-remission group after the first induction chemotherapy possessed higher miR-196b expression. Furthermore, a positive relationship was found between the expression of miR-196b and SMC1A/MLH1 (Spearman's r=0.37 and 0.44, P=0.001 and <0.0001, respectively).

Genetic polymorphisms in this gene can affect the activity of the TPMT enzyme and have been correlated with variability in response to treatment with thiopurines. Advances in the pharmacogenetics of TPMT allowed the development of dosing recommendations and treatment strategies to optimize and individualize prescribing thiopurine in an attempt to enhance treatment efficacy while minimizing toxicity. The influence of genetic polymorphisms in the TPMT gene on clinical outcome has been well-documented and replicated in many studies. In this review, we provide an overview of the evolution, results, conclusions and recommendations of selected studies that investigated the influence of TPMT pharmacogenetics on thiopurine treatment in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune disorders. We focus mainly on prospective studies that explored the impact of individualized TPMT-based dosing of thiopurines on clinical response. Together, these studies demonstrate the importance of preemptive TPMT genetic screening and subsequent dose adjustment in mitigating the toxicity associated with thiopurine treatment while maintaining treatment efficacy and favorable long-term outcomes. In addition, we briefly address the cost-effectiveness of this pharmacogenetics approach and its impact on clinical practice as well as the importance of recent breakthrough advances in sequencing and genotyping techniques in refining the TPMT genetic screening process.","['Abaji, Rachid', 'Krajinovic, Maja']","['Abaji R', 'Krajinovic M']",,"['Department of Pharmacology.', 'Departments of Pediatrics and Pharmacology, CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170505,New Zealand,Pharmgenomics Pers Med,Pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine,101514107,,,,PMC5428801,2017/05/17 06:00,2017/05/17 06:01,['2017/05/17 06:00'],"['2017/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/PGPM.S108123 [doi]', 'pgpm-10-143 [pii]']",epublish,Pharmgenomics Pers Med. 2017 May 5;10:143-156. doi: 10.2147/PGPM.S108123. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['6-mercaptopurine', 'ADRs', 'TPMT', 'azathioprine', 'pharmacogenetics', 'thiopurine']",['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of VOCs has been proposed as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for certain cancers. Detailed research on the VOCs in gas exhaled by cell can characterize cell type specific metabolites and may be helpful to detect the cancer markers in clinical practice.Methods: Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to detect VOCs in the headspace of tissue culture flask in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) cell line JEKO and acute mononuclear leukemia cell line SHI-1, to elaborate the characteristic gaseous biomarkers of hematological malignancies. While macrophage cells and lymphocytic cells were acted as control. The blank group was only the RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum that without cells.Results: Comparing with control group, the concentration of dimethyl sulfide, 2,4-dimethylheptane, methylbenzene, o-xylene, dodecane, and 1,3-di-tert-butylbenzene in JEKO cells was relatively higher, while the concentration of ethanol, hexanal, and benzaldehyde was lower. In SHI-1 cells, the levels of 2,4-dimethylheptane, benzene, 4-methyldecane, chloroform, 3,7-dimethyl dodecane, and hexadecane were significantly elevated, but the levels of hexanol and cyclohexanol were distinctly reduced. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study revealed that the malignant hematological cells could change the components of VOCs in the cell culture flask in a cell type-specific pattern. The traits of VOCs in our setting offered new strategy for hematological malignancies tracing, and would act as potential biomarkers in diagnosis of malignant hematological diseases.","['Tang, Hongxia', 'Lu, Yan', 'Zhang, Lulu', 'Wu, Zhonghui', 'Hou, Xiaofang', 'Xia, Hailong']","['Tang H', 'Lu Y', 'Zhang L', 'Wu Z', 'Hou X', 'Xia H']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, No. 218 Jixi Road, Hefei 230022, China.', 'Center of Medical Physics and Technology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, No. 350 Shushanhu Road, Hefei 230031, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, No. 678 Furong Road, Hefei 230022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, No. 218 Jixi Road, Hefei 230022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, No. 218 Jixi Road, Hefei 230022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Chaohu Hospital of Anhui Medical University, No. 64 Northern Chaohu Road, 238000, China hailongxia123@163.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170621,England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Volatile Organic Compounds)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Solid Phase Microextraction', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Volatile Organic Compounds/*analysis']",PMC5479021,2017/05/17 06:00,2018/03/14 06:00,['2017/05/17 06:00'],"['2017/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/10 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['BSR20170106 [pii]', '10.1042/BSR20170106 [doi]']",epublish,Biosci Rep. 2017 Jun 21;37(3). pii: BSR20170106. doi: 10.1042/BSR20170106.

We investigated the contribution of CXCL6 to SSc development by focusing on the association of friend leukemia virus integration 1 (Fli1) deficiency, a potential predisposing factor of SSc, with CXCL6 expression and clinical correlation of serum CXCL6 levels. METHODS: mRNA levels of target genes and the binding of Fli1 to the CXCL6 promoter were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation, respectively. Serum CXCL6 levels were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: FLI1 siRNA significantly enhanced CXCL6 mRNA expression in human dermal fibroblasts and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells, while Fli1 haploinsufficiency significantly suppressed CXCL6 mRNA expression in murine peritoneal macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Supporting a critical role of Fli1 deficiency to induce SSc-like phenotypes, CXCL6 mRNA expression was higher in SSc dermal fibroblasts than in normal dermal fibroblasts. Importantly, Fli1 bound to the CXCL6 promoter in dermal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and THP-1 cells. In patients with SSc, serum CXCL6 levels correlated positively with the severity of dermal and pulmonary fibrosis and were elevated in association with cardiac and pulmonary vascular involvement and cutaneous vascular symptoms, including Raynaud phenomenon, digital ulcers (DU)/pitting scars, and telangiectasia. Especially, serum CXCL6 levels were associated with DU/pitting scars and heart involvement by multiple regression analysis. CONCLUSION: CXCL6 expression is upregulated by Fli1 deficiency in fibroblasts and endothelial cells, potentially contributing to the development of fibrosis and vasculopathy in the skin, lung, and heart of SSc.","['Taniguchi, Takashi', 'Asano, Yoshihide', 'Nakamura, Kouki', 'Yamashita, Takashi', 'Saigusa, Ryosuke', 'Ichimura, Yohei', 'Takahashi, Takehiro', 'Toyama, Tetsuo', 'Yoshizaki, Ayumi', 'Sato, Shinichi']","['Taniguchi T', 'Asano Y', 'Nakamura K', 'Yamashita T', 'Saigusa R', 'Ichimura Y', 'Takahashi T', 'Toyama T', 'Yoshizaki A', 'Sato S']",,"['From the Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'T.

Delayed-release tablet and intravenous formulations of posaconazole have recently become available, but clinical data are limited. We sought to examine the real-world pharmacokinetics and prophylactic effectiveness of the new formulations of posaconazole given as prophylaxis for patients with hematological malignancy. A retrospective cohort of all consecutive adult inpatients with hematological malignancy who received >/=3 days of tablet or intravenous posaconazole therapy for primary IFI prophylaxis at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1 December 2013 and 31 December 2015 was established. Clinical information was collected and correlated with low posaconazole serum levels (<700 ng/ml). Rates of IFIs and safety events were assessed. A total of 1,321 courses of posaconazole were administered at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center during the study period, of which 343 courses were assessed for prophylactic safety and effectiveness. Seventy-nine patients (23%) had posaconazole serum level measurements available for interpretation. Acute myeloid leukemia was the primary malignancy (62%), with 20% of all patients having previously received a stem cell transplant. The median posaconazole level was 1,380 ng/ml (interquartile range, 864 to 1,860 ng/ml). Low posaconazole levels (<700 ng/ml) were observed for 14 patients (18%). Proven or probable breakthrough IFIs occurred in 8 patients (2%); posaconazole therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) was performed for 6 of those patients, all with levels above 700 ng/ml. Overall, 19% of patients experienced grade 3 or 4 liver injury, manifesting primarily as hyperbilirubinemia and being correlated with serum levels of >1,830 ng/ml. Although hepatotoxicity in a small percentage of patients is of concern, posaconazole tablets appeared to be generally safe and effective. As all breakthrough IFIs for which TDM was performed occurred in patients with levels of >700 ng/ml, and a posaconazole level of >1,830 ng/ml was correlated with grade 3 or 4 liver toxicity, further studies are needed to assess the role of TDM.","['Tverdek, Frank P', 'Heo, Sang Taek', 'Aitken, Samuel L', 'Granwehr, Bruno', 'Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P']","['Tverdek FP', 'Heo ST', 'Aitken SL', 'Granwehr B', 'Kontoyiannis DP']",,"['Department of Clinical Pharmacy Programs, The University of Texas M.

Efflux pumps decrease intracellular drug levels, thus fostering persistence of MTB during therapy. Isoniazid (INH) and pyrazinamide (PZA) are substrates of the efflux pump breast cancer resistance protein-1 (BCRP-1), which is inhibited by chloroquine (CQ). In this study, BCRP-1 was found to be expressed on macrophages of human origin and on foamy giant cells at the site of MTB infection. In the current in vitro study, interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) increased the expression of BCRP-1 in macrophages derived from the human monocytic leukaemia cell line THP-1. Using a BCRP-1-specific fluorescent dye and radioactively labelled INH, it was demonstrated that efflux from macrophages increased upon activation with IFNgamma. CQ was able to inhibit active efflux and augmented the intracellular concentrations both of INH and the dye. In agreement, CQ and specific inhibition of BCRP-1 increased the antimycobacterial activity of INH against intracellular MTB. Although PZA behaved differently, CQ had comparable advantageous effects on the intracellular pharmacokinetics and activity of PZA. The adjunctive effects of CQ on intracellular killing of MTB were measurable at concentrations achievable in humans at approved therapeutic doses. Therefore, CQ, a widely used and worldwide available drug, may potentiate the efficacy of standard MTB therapy against bacteria in the intracellular compartment.","['Matt, U', 'Selchow, P', 'Dal Molin, M', 'Strommer, S', 'Sharif, O', 'Schilcher, K', 'Andreoni, F', 'Stenzinger, A', 'Zinkernagel, A S', 'Zeitlinger, M', 'Sander, P', 'Nemeth, J']","['Matt U', 'Selchow P', 'Dal Molin M', 'Strommer S', 'Sharif O', 'Schilcher K', 'Andreoni F', 'Stenzinger A', 'Zinkernagel AS', 'Zeitlinger M', 'Sander P', 'Nemeth J']",,"['Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Laboratory of Infection Biology, Department of Medicine 1, Medical University Vienna, CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Science, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.

METHODS: Retrospective study including all haematological patients who received prophylaxis with micafungin during high-risk IA episodes (neutropenic patients after chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndrome; allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation during early neutropenic phase or graft-versus-host disease requiring high prednisone doses) and for whom at least one sGM result was available. Episodes were classified as follows: true-positive (positive GM in the context of IA), false-positive (positive GM result in patients who had no evidence of IA), true-negative (negative GM test results and no IA), or false-negative (negative GM test in the context of IA). Non-evaluable patients were excluded. RESULTS: Among 146 evaluable episodes, four were true-positive in the context of probable breakthrough IA (incidence of breakthrough IA, 2.7%); 111/146 high-risk episodes (76%) were considered true-negative and 31/146 (21.2%) were considered false-positive. No false-negative episodes were detected. All but one of the false-positive episodes were detected in surveillance GM tests, leading to high-resolution CT scans in eight cases (8/31; 25.8%), all of which were negative. The positive predictive and negative predictive values of sGM for surveillance and diagnostic approaches were 3.2% (1/31) and 100% (110/110) and 75% (3/4) and 100% (1/1), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance of asymptomatic patients receiving prophylaxis with micafungin using sGM is unnecessary, because the results are either negative or false-positive. However, sGM remains useful in the diagnosis of breakthrough IA in symptomatic patients during prophylaxis.","['Vena, A', 'Bouza, E', 'Alvarez-Uria, A', 'Gayoso, J', 'Martin-Rabadan, P', 'Cajuste, F', 'Guinea, J', 'Gomez Castella, J', 'Alonso, R', 'Munoz, P']","['Vena A', 'Bouza E', 'Alvarez-Uria A', 'Gayoso J', 'Martin-Rabadan P', 'Cajuste F', 'Guinea J', 'Gomez Castella J', 'Alonso R', 'Munoz P']",,"['Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain; Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Hospital Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain; CIBER Enfermedades Respiratorias - CIBERES (CB06/06/0058), Madrid, Spain.

To quantify the effect of TL on outcomes in malignancies and explore the role of type of TL measurement we conducted a librarian-led systematic search of electronic databases identified publications exploring the prognostic role of TL on cancer outcomes. Overall survival (OS) was the primary outcome measure while other time-to-event endpoints were secondary outcomes. Data from studies reporting a hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and/or p-value were pooled in a meta-analysis. HRs were weighted by generic inverse variance and computed by random effects modeling. All statistical tests were two-sided. Sixty-one studies comprising a total of 14,720 patients were included of which 41 (67%) reported OS outcomes. Overall, the pooled HR for OS was 0.88 (95%CI=0.69-1.11, p=0.28). Long (versus short) telomeres were associated with improved outcomes in chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) and urothelial cancer (HR=0.45, 95%CI=0.29-0.71 and HR=0.68, 95%CI=0.46-1.00, respectively), conversely worse OS was seen with hepatocellular carcinoma (HR=1.90, 95%CI=1.51-2.38). Pooled HRs (95% CI) for progression-free survival, relapse/disease-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and treatment-free survival were 0.56 (0.41-0.76), 0.76 (0.53-1.10), 0.72 (0.48-1.10), and 0.48 (0.39-0.60), respectively. There was substantial heterogeneity of tissues and methods used for TL measurement and no clear association between TL and outcome was identified in subgroups. In conclusion, there is inconsistent effect of TL on cancer outcomes possibly due to variable methods of measurement. Standardization of measurement and reporting of TL is warranted before the prognostic value of TL can be accurately assessed.","['Adam, Roman', 'Diez-Gonzalez, Laura', 'Ocana, Alberto', 'Seruga, Bostjan', 'Amir, Eitan', 'Templeton, Arnoud J']","['Adam R', 'Diez-Gonzalez L', 'Ocana A', 'Seruga B', 'Amir E', 'Templeton AJ']",,"['Faculty of Medicine, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Traslational Research laboratory, Albacete University Hospital, and Regional Biomedical Research Center, Castilla La Mancha University, Albacete, Spain.', 'Traslational Research laboratory, Albacete University Hospital, and Regional Biomedical Research Center, Castilla La Mancha University, Albacete, Spain.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Institute of Oncology Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Divisions of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland; Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, St. Claraspital, Basel, Switzerland.

Low efficacy and high toxicity limit current therapeutic options for advanced disease. Activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and c-kit signaling pathways has been implicated in KS pathogenesis and may suggest a role for targeted inhibitors. KS cases were retrospectively retrieved (N=274), most (90%) associated with human immunodeficiency virus. Tissue microarray slides were stained with human herpes virus-8, Friend leukemia integration 1 transcription factor, CD117 (c-kit), phospho-S6 (pS6), PDGF receptor-beta, VEGF, and phospho-mTOR. Both intensity and extent of staining were scored. Multiplying these scores for each core yielded total staining H-scores. Human herpes virus-8 was positive in 87% and Friend leukemia integration 1 transcription factor in 95.7% of cases. Most were also VEGF+ (97.6%), pS6+ (95.7%), CD117+ (92.5%), and PDGFRB+ (87.4%). Approximately half (55.6%) were phospho-mTOR+. There was no significant difference in staining among patients with low (<500 cells/mm(3)) or preserved CD4 T-cell counts. Immunohistochemistry confirms upregulation of the mTOR, PDGF, VEGF, and c-kit pathways in a large cohort of KS samples. Of proteins tested, pS6, downstream of mTOR, demonstrated the highest proportion of strong positivity (67.1%). These results support the possibility of using targeted inhibitors in KS. Overexpression was independent of CD4 count, suggesting that even patients with low counts may be targeted therapy candidates.","['Kerr, Darcy A', 'Busarla, Satya Vara Prasad', 'Gimbel, Devon C', 'Sohani, Aliyah R', 'Nazarian, Rosalynn M']","['Kerr DA', 'Busarla SVP', 'Gimbel DC', 'Sohani AR', 'Nazarian RM']",,"['Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114.

We previously reported that prognoses differ between the KIT D816V and N822K mutations. In the present study, we compared in vitro the cell-proliferative and anti-apoptotic ability of D816V and N822K. We transduced these KIT mutations into the interleukin-3-dependent cell line TF-1 (TF-1 KIT(D816V), TF-1 KIT(N822K)). When these KIT mutations were transduced into TF-1 cells, the cells acquired a proliferative ability independent of growth factor, which was significantly higher in TF-1 KIT(D816V) than in TF-1 KIT(N822K) (p = 0.022). When Ara-C was added in the absence of growth factor, Annexin V assay revealed that TF-1 KIT(D816V) was associated with a significantly lower proportion of apoptotic cells than TF-1 KIT(N822K) (p < 0.001). Regarding signal transduction pathways, both KIT D816V and KIT N822K underwent autophosphorylation in the absence of growth factor. This was followed in KIT D816V by downstream activation of the SRC family kinase pathway in addition to the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway, and in KIT N822K by downstream activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in addition to the JAK/STAT pathway. These findings establish that D816V and N822K mutations are situated closely on the KIT receptor activation loop, but D816V has greater cell-proliferative and anti-apoptotic ability than N822K.","['Omori, Ikuko', 'Yamaguchi, Hiroki', 'Miyake, Koichi', 'Miyake, Noriko', 'Kitano, Tomoaki', 'Inokuchi, Koiti']","['Omori I', 'Yamaguchi H', 'Miyake K', 'Miyake N', 'Kitano T', 'Inokuchi K']",,"['Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.

CRS symptoms are primarily mediated by interleukin 6 (IL-6), and clinical management has focused on inhibition of IL-6 signaling. The cellular source and function of IL-6 in CRS remain unknown. METHODS: Using co-culture assays and data from patients on our clinical CAR T-cell trials, we investigated the cellular source of IL-6, as well as other CRS-associated cytokines, during CAR T-cell activation. We also explored the effect that IL-6 has on T-cell function. RESULTS: We demonstrated that IL-6 is secreted by monocyte-lineage cells in response to CAR T-cell activation in a contact-independent mechanism upon T-cell engagement of target leukemia. We observed that the presence of antigen-presenting cell-derived IL-6 has no impact on CAR T-cell transcriptional profiles or cytotoxicity. Finally, we confirm that CAR T cells do not secrete IL-6 in vivo during clinical CRS. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that IL-6 blockade will not affect CD19 CAR T-cell-driven anti-leukemic cytotoxicity, permitting enhanced control of CRS while maintaining CAR T-cell efficacy.","['Singh, Nathan', 'Hofmann, Ted J', 'Gershenson, Zachary', 'Levine, Bruce L', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'Teachey, David T', 'Barrett, David M']","['Singh N', 'Hofmann TJ', 'Gershenson Z', 'Levine BL', 'Grupp SA', 'Teachey DT', 'Barrett DM']",,"['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.

Because these maps exaggerate the prominence of low-density districts and hide potential clusters in urban (high-density) areas, many researchers have used density-equalizing maps (cartograms) as a basis for epidemiological mapping. However, we do not have existing guidelines for visual assessment of statistical uncertainty. To address this shortcoming, we develop techniques for visual determination of statistical significance of clusters spanning one or more districts on a cartogram. We developed the techniques within a geovisual analytics framework that does not rely on automated significance testing, and can therefore facilitate visual analysis to detect clusters that automated techniques might miss. RESULTS: On a cartogram of the at-risk population, the statistical significance of a disease cluster is determinate from the rate, area and shape of the cluster under standard hypothesis testing scenarios. We develop formulae to determine, for a given rate, the area required for statistical significance of a priori and a posteriori designated regions under certain test assumptions. Uniquely, our approach enables dynamic inference of aggregate regions formed by combining individual districts. The method is implemented in interactive tools that provide choropleth mapping, automated legend construction and dynamic search tools to facilitate cluster detection and assessment of the validity of tested assumptions. A case study of leukemia incidence analysis in California demonstrates the ability to visually distinguish between statistically significant and insignificant regions. CONCLUSION: The proposed geovisual analytics approach enables intuitive visual assessment of statistical significance of arbitrarily defined regions on a cartogram. Our research prompts a broader discussion of the role of geovisual exploratory analyses in disease mapping and the appropriate framework for visually assessing the statistical significance of spatial clusters.","['Kronenfeld, Barry J', 'Wong, David W S']","['Kronenfeld BJ', 'Wong DWS']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0525-0071'],"['Department of Geology and Geography, Eastern Illinois University, 600 Lincoln Avenue, Charleston, IL, 61920-3099, USA.', 'Geography and Geoinformation Science, George Mason University, 4400 University Drive, Fairfax, VA, 22030, USA. dwong2@gmu.edu.']",['eng'],['R01 HD076020/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20170515,England,Int J Health Geogr,International journal of health geographics,101152198,,IM,"['California/epidemiology', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Geographic Information Systems/*statistics & numerical data', '*Geographic Mapping', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Population Surveillance/*methods']",PMC5433035,2017/05/17 06:00,2018/04/19 06:00,['2017/05/17 06:00'],"['2017/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12942-017-0093-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12942-017-0093-9 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Health Geogr. 2017 May 15;16(1):19. doi: 10.1186/s12942-017-0093-9.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cartograms', '*Density equalizing maps', '*Disease mapping', '*Geovisual analytics', '*Scan statistics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Outcomes with chemotherapy and targeted therapy remain poor. Targeting cell cycle regulators might complement chemotherapy and targeted therapy and help in improving outcomes. Areas covered: Here we cover the pre-clinical and clinical data for both for cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) and cell-cycle checkpoint inhibitors. While CDK inhibition can inhibit proliferation, checkpoint inhibitors can facilitate cell cycle progression in presence of DNA damage and can induce mitotic catastrophe. Expert opinion: Though the preclinical data for cell cycle inhibitors in AML is compelling, the clinical translation so far has proven to be challenging. This is a reflection of the complexity of both, AML and cell cycle regulators. However, early introduction of cell-cycle active agents in combination with chemotherapy or targeted agents, identifying right sequence of use and identifying right biomarkers might pave the way into successful clinical translation.","['Abou Zahr, Abdallah', 'Borthakur, Gautam']","['Abou Zahr A', 'Borthakur G']",,"['a Department of Leukemia , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Leukemia , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170522,England,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs,Expert opinion on emerging drugs,101135662,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology']",,2017/05/17 06:00,2017/07/08 06:00,['2017/05/17 06:00'],"['2017/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14728214.2017.1330885 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs. 2017 Jun;22(2):137-148. doi: 10.1080/14728214.2017.1330885.

We combined DNA hypomethylating agent azacitidine with histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat in preclinical models of childhood AML. Synergistic cytotoxic effect upon treatment with azacitidine and panobinostat with combination indices <1.0 was observed. Azacitidine and panobinostat increased median survival by 26 and 6days respectively in MV4;11 xenografted mice. Mice treated with both drugs showed a drastic reduction in leukemic burden leading to complete remission sustained for the duration of the experimental period lasting more than 519days. Reduced leukemic burden and prolonged survival was also observed in AML-193 xenografted mice treated with azacitidine-panobinostat combination. Differential gene expression profiling was performed on AML cells treated with azacitidine, panobinostat or azacitidine-panobinostat combination. Functional mapping of transcripts uniquely regulated by the azacitidine-panobinostat combination in MV4;11 cells identified p53 as an upstream regulator. A comparison of the uniquely modulated transcripts by azacitidine-panobinostat combination in MV4;11 cells versus AML-193 and THP-1 cells, bearing mutated p53, also revealed p53 as the topmost upstream regulator. Finally, expression of mutant p53 in MV4;11 cells reduced sensitivity to azacitidine-panobinostat combination, suggesting that p53 may be a predictor of response to epigenetic therapy in pediatric AML.","['Gopalakrishnapillai, Anilkumar', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'McCahan, Suzanne M', 'Barwe, Sonali P']","['Gopalakrishnapillai A', 'Kolb EA', 'McCahan SM', 'Barwe SP']",,"['Nemours Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, DE 19803, USA.', 'Nemours Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, DE 19803, USA.', 'Nemours Bioinformatics Core Facility, Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, DE, 19803, USA.', 'Nemours Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, DE 19803, USA.

For the most potent compound further studies were performed evaluating cell death induction, cell cycle profile, ctDNA interaction and topoisomerase IIalpha inhibition. A synthetic three-step route was established for compounds (2a-e and 3a-d) with yields ranging from 32 to 95%. Regarding antiproliferative activity, compounds 2a-e and 3a-d showed mean GI50 values ranging between 1.1 muM (2b) - 84.65 muM (3d). Compound 2b was the most promising especially against colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT-29) and leukemia (K562) cells (GI50 = 0.01 muM for both cell lines). Mechanism studies demonstrated that 24 h-treatment with compound 2b (5 muM) induced phosphatidylserine residues exposition and G2/M arrest on HT-29 cells. Moreover, 2b (50 muM) was able to interact with ctDNA and inhibited topoisomerase IIalpha activity. These results demonstrate the importance of thiosemicarbazone, especially the derivative 2b, as a promising candidate for anticancer therapy.","['de Oliveira, Jamerson Ferreira', 'Lima, Talitha Santos', 'Vendramini-Costa, Debora Barbosa', 'de Lacerda Pedrosa, Sybelle Christianne Batista', 'Lafayette, Elizabeth Almeida', 'da Silva, Rosali Maria Ferreira', 'de Almeida, Sinara Monica Vitalino', 'de Moura, Ricardo Olimpio', 'Ruiz, Ana Lucia Tasca Gois', 'de Carvalho, Joao Ernesto', 'de Lima, Maria do Carmo Alves']","['de Oliveira JF', 'Lima TS', 'Vendramini-Costa DB', 'de Lacerda Pedrosa SCB', 'Lafayette EA', 'da Silva RMF', 'de Almeida SMV', 'de Moura RO', 'Ruiz ALTG', 'de Carvalho JE', 'de Lima MDCA']",,"['Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), Departamento de Antibioticos (DANTI), 50670-901, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), Departamento de Antibioticos (DANTI), 50670-901, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas (Unicamp), Centro Pluridisciplinar de Pesquisas Quimicas, Biologicas e Agricolas (CPQBA), 13083-970, Campinas, SP, Brazil; Cancer Biology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, 19111, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Universidade Federal do Vale do Sao Francisco (UNIVASF), Colegiado de Ciencias Farmaceuticas (CFARM), 56304-205, Petrolina, PE, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal da Paraiba (UFPB), Departamento de Quimica e Fisica (DQF), 58397-000, Areia, PB, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), Departamento de Ciencias Farmaceuticas (DCFAR), 50670-901, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Universidade de Pernambuco (UPE), Faculdade de Ciencias, Educacao e Tecnologia de Garanhuns (FACETEG), 55290-000, Garanhuns, PE, Brazil.', 'Universidade Estadual da Paraiba (UEPB), Departamento de Farmacia, 58429-500, Campina Grande, PB, Brazil.', 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas (Unicamp), Centro Pluridisciplinar de Pesquisas Quimicas, Biologicas e Agricolas (CPQBA), 13083-970, Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas (Unicamp), Centro Pluridisciplinar de Pesquisas Quimicas, Biologicas e Agricolas (CPQBA), 13083-970, Campinas, SP, Brazil; Universidade Estadual de Campinas (Unicamp), Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas (FCF), 13083-970, Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), Departamento de Antibioticos (DANTI), 50670-901, Recife, PE, Brazil.

To gain deeper insights into the deregulated mechanisms promoting this disease, we searched a panel of 31 representative T-cell and 2 NK-cell lymphoma/leukemia cell lines for predictive markers of response to targeted therapy. To this end, targeted sequencing was performed alongside the expression of specific biomarkers corresponding to potentially activated survival pathways. The study identified TP53, NOTCH1 and DNMT3A as the most frequently mutated genes. We also found common alterations in JAK/STAT and epigenetic pathways. Immunohistochemical analysis showed nuclear accumulation of MYC (in 85% of the cases), NFKB (62%), p-STAT (44%) and p-MAPK (30%). This panel of cell lines captures the complexity of T/NK-cell lymphoproliferative processes samples, with the partial exception of AITL cases.

Drug resistance and toxic side effects pose a major threat to treatment success and hence alternate less toxic therapies are warranted. NF-E2 related factor-2 (Nrf2), a master regulator of antioxidant response is implicated in chemoresistance in solid tumors. However, little is known about the role of Nrf2 in AML chemoresistance and the effect of pharmacological inhibitor brusatol in modulating this resistance. Primary AML samples with high ex-vivo IC50 to Ara-C, ATO, Dnr had significantly high NRF2 RNA expression. Gene-specific knockdown of NRF2 improved sensitivity to these drugs in resistant AML cell lines by decreasing the expression of downstream antioxidant targets of Nrf2 by compromising the cell's ability to scavenge the ROS. Treatment with brusatol, a pharmacological inhibitor of Nrf2, improved sensitivity to Ara-C, ATO, and Dnr and reduced colony formation capacity. AML cell lines stably overexpressing NRF2 showed increased resistance to ATO, Dnr and Ara-C and increased expression of downstream targets. This study demonstrates that Nrf2 could be an ideal druggable target in AML, more so to the drugs that function through ROS, suggesting the possibility of using Nrf2 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapeutic agents to modulate drug resistance in AML.","['Karathedath, Sreeja', 'Rajamani, Bharathi M', 'Musheer Aalam, Syed Mohammed', 'Abraham, Ajay', 'Varatharajan, Savitha', 'Krishnamurthy, Partha', 'Mathews, Vikram', 'Velayudhan, Shaji Ramachandran', 'Balasubramanian, Poonkuzhali']","['Karathedath S', 'Rajamani BM', 'Musheer Aalam SM', 'Abraham A', 'Varatharajan S', 'Krishnamurthy P', 'Mathews V', 'Velayudhan SR', 'Balasubramanian P']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9443-439X'],"['Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Centre for Stem Cell Research, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Therapeutics, Kansas University Medical Centre, Kansas City, Kansas, United States of America.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Centre for Stem Cell Research, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.']",['eng'],"['IA/S/11/2500267/DBT-Wellcome Trust India Alliance/India', 'IA/S/15/1/501842/DBT-Wellcome Trust India Alliance/India']",['Journal Article'],20170515,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Response Elements', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC5432104,2017/05/16 06:00,2017/09/21 06:00,['2017/05/16 06:00'],"['2017/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0177227 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-01675 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 May 15;12(5):e0177227. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0177227. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regeneration derives from proliferative mesenchymal cells (blastema) that subsequently differentiate into soft and skeletal tissues. Clinically, conservative treatment of the amputated fingertip under occlusive dressing can shift the response to tissue loss from a wound repair process towards regeneration. When analyzing by Immunoassay the wound exudate from occlusive dressings, the concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were higher in fingertip exudates than in burn wounds (used as controls for wound repair versus regeneration). Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) were highly expressed in both samples in comparable levels. In our study, pro-inflammatory cytokines were relatively higher expressed in regenerative fingertips than in the burn wound exudates while chemokines were present in lower levels. Functional, vascular and mechanical properties of the regenerated fingertips were analyzed three months after trauma and the data were compared to the corresponding fingertip on the collateral uninjured side. While sensory recovery and morphology (pulp thickness and texture) were similar to uninjured sides, mechanical parameters (elasticity, vascularization) were increased in the regenerated fingertips. Further studies should be done to clarify the importance of inflammatory cells, immunity and growth factors in determining the outcome of the regenerative process and its influence on the clinical outcome.","['Jafari, Paris', 'Muller, Camillo', 'Grognuz, Anthony', 'Applegate, Lee Ann', 'Raffoul, Wassim', 'di Summa, Pietro G', 'Durand, Sebastien']","['Jafari P', 'Muller C', 'Grognuz A', 'Applegate LA', 'Raffoul W', 'di Summa PG', 'Durand S']",,"['Plastic and Hand Surgery Department, Lausanne University Hospital, 1011 Lausanne, Switzerland.

However, current single-cell RNA-sequencing approaches lack the sensitivity required to reliably detect somatic mutations. We developed a method that combines high-sensitivity mutation detection with whole-transcriptome analysis of the same single cell. We applied this technique to analyze more than 2,000 SCs from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) throughout the disease course, revealing heterogeneity of CML-SCs, including the identification of a subgroup of CML-SCs with a distinct molecular signature that selectively persisted during prolonged therapy. Analysis of nonleukemic SCs from patients with CML also provided new insights into cell-extrinsic disruption of hematopoiesis in CML associated with clinical outcome. Furthermore, we used this single-cell approach to identify a blast-crisis-specific SC population, which was also present in a subclone of CML-SCs during the chronic phase in a patient who subsequently developed blast crisis. This approach, which might be broadly applied to any malignancy, illustrates how single-cell analysis can identify subpopulations of therapy-resistant SCs that are not apparent through cell-population analysis.","['Giustacchini, Alice', 'Thongjuea, Supat', 'Barkas, Nikolaos', 'Woll, Petter S', 'Povinelli, Benjamin J', 'Booth, Christopher A G', 'Sopp, Paul', 'Norfo, Ruggiero', 'Rodriguez-Meira,

Its ability to regulate the expression of lineage-specific genes and induce growth arrest contributes to the terminal differentiation of several cell types, including hepatocytes, adipocytes and granulocytes. CEBPA loss of-function mutations contribute to the development of ~10% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), stablishing a tumor suppressor role for C/EBPalpha. Deregulation of C/EBPalpha expression has also been reported in a variety of additional human neoplasias, including liver, breast and lung cancer. However, functional CEBPA mutations have not been found in solid tumors, suggesting that abrogation of C/EBPalpha function in non-hematopoietic tissues is regulated by alternative mechanisms. Here we review the function of C/EBPalpha in solid tumors and focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying its tumor suppressive role.","['Lourenco, A R', 'Coffer, P J']","['Lourenco AR', 'Coffer PJ']",,"['Center for Molecular Medicine, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Regenerative Medicine Center, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Regenerative Medicine Center, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170515,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)'],IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/blood/*genetics/metabolism/pathology']",,2017/05/16 06:00,2017/10/14 06:00,['2017/05/16 06:00'],"['2017/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc2017151 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2017.151 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2017 Sep 14;36(37):5221-5230. doi: 10.1038/onc.2017.151.

Patients with an unfavourable prognostic haematological disease not only have a higher probability of developing IA but are also more likely to die due to causes directly related to the underlying disease. This complexity of risk mechanisms confounds the causal interpretation of IA occurrence and mortality. Full consideration of the changing patient characteristics over time is necessary to obtain reliable estimates of the correlation of IA with mortality. We studied the effect of IA on mortality in 167 consecutive patients starting with remission-induction therapy for AML or of whom most patients continued to haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). No standard antifungal prophylaxis was administered in the period before HSCT. Survival analyses were performed to determine risk estimates of IA for different phases of treatment before and after HSCT. Time-dependent adjustment for confounding variables was performed using Cox proportional hazards models. In 55 of 167 enroled patients, IA was diagnosed. Before HSCT, adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals on mortality after the diagnosis of IA were 3.5 (1.7-7.5), 2.0 (0.69-5.9), 2.3 (0.79-6.8) and 0.80 (0.49-1.4) within 30 days, between 30 and 60 days, between 60 and 90 days or more than 90 days, respectively. A similar pattern was observed after HSCT. The occurrence of IA did not significantly influence the decision to follow through with HSCT. The results provide new insights in short- and long-term survival of patients diagnosed with IA. A significantly increased mortality risk was only observed in the first month after diagnosis of IA. No unfavourable association with mortality was observed in the later course of treatment. The occurrence of IA did not affect the probability of attaining HSCT in our population.","['van de Peppel, R J', 'von dem Borne, P A', 'le Cessie, S', 'de Boer, M G J']","['van de Peppel RJ', 'von dem Borne PA', 'le Cessie S', 'de Boer MGJ']",,"['Department of Infectious Diseases, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Statistics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170515,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Aged', 'Allografts', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis/etiology/*microbiology', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,2017/05/16 06:00,2018/03/08 06:00,['2017/05/16 06:00'],"['2016/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/21 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['bmt201771 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2017.71 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2017 Jun;52(6):883-888. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2017.71.

Neutrophils are exceptionally short-lived leukocytes, yet it remains unclear whether the lifespan of pathogen-engaged neutrophils is regulated differently from that in the circulating steady-state pool. Here, we have found that under homeostatic conditions, the mRNA-destabilizing protein tristetraprolin (TTP) regulates apoptosis and the numbers of activated infiltrating murine neutrophils but not neutrophil cellularity. Activated TTP-deficient neutrophils exhibited decreased apoptosis and enhanced accumulation at the infection site. In the context of myeloid-specific deletion of Ttp, the potentiation of neutrophil deployment protected mice against lethal soft tissue infection with Streptococcus pyogenes and prevented bacterial dissemination. Neutrophil transcriptome analysis revealed that decreased apoptosis of TTP-deficient neutrophils was specifically associated with elevated expression of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl1) but not other antiapoptotic B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) family members. Higher Mcl1 expression resulted from stabilization of Mcl1 mRNA in the absence of TTP. The low apoptosis rate of infiltrating TTP-deficient neutrophils was comparable to that of transgenic Mcl1-overexpressing neutrophils. Our study demonstrates that posttranscriptional gene regulation by TTP schedules the termination of the antimicrobial engagement of neutrophils. The balancing role of TTP comes at the cost of an increased risk of bacterial infections.","['Ebner, Florian', 'Sedlyarov, Vitaly', 'Tasciyan, Saren', 'Ivin, Masa', 'Kratochvill, Franz', 'Gratz, Nina', 'Kenner, Lukas', 'Villunger, Andreas', 'Sixt, Michael', 'Kovarik, Pavel']","['Ebner F', 'Sedlyarov V', 'Tasciyan S', 'Ivin M', 'Kratochvill F', 'Gratz N', 'Kenner L', 'Villunger A', 'Sixt M', 'Kovarik P']",,"['Max F.

This retrospective study examined the feasibility and practicability of our prophylaxis guidelines in clinical practice. Data sets of 90 patients undergoing induction-chemotherapy for AML between 2011 and 2014 were evaluated regarding adherence to local guidelines for the administration of antifungal prophylaxis with posaconazole. 75.5% of the 90 patients received posaconazole prophylaxis. All but eight patients received the recommended dosage. A total of 77.95% on prophylaxis had serum galactomannan measured twice weekly. Contradicting our guidelines, 89.70% of patients received concomitant therapy with PPI. Overall, 16.17% of patients had prophylaxis discontinued and started empirical antifungal treatment in the absence of diagnostic criteria for IFI. The breakthrough IFI rate was 36.76% (proven, probable and possible) with 7.35% of infections being classified as proven or probable. Although limited by a small sample size, our study demonstrates the feasibility of local guidelines in a real life setting and outlines areas for improvement in both guidelines and clinical practice. We also highlight the importance of ensuring awareness of guidelines and raise questions about a uniform approach to antifungal prophylaxis in AML patients.","['Berking, Sophie', 'Doedens, Daphne', 'Horns, Heidi', 'Fiegl, Michael', 'Ostermann, Helmut', 'Rieger, Christina T']","['Berking S', 'Doedens D', 'Horns H', 'Fiegl M', 'Ostermann H', 'Rieger CT']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4649-0255'],"['Department of Internal Medicine III, Hospital of the University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hospital of the University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hospital of the University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Haematology and Oncology Teaching Practice, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Germering, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hospital of the University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hospital of the University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Haematology and Oncology Teaching Practice, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Germering, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170515,Germany,Mycoses,Mycoses,8805008,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Mannans)', '0 (Triazoles)', '11078-30-1 (galactomannan)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Galactose/analogs & derivatives', '*Guideline Adherence', 'Guidelines as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Mannans/blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*prevention & control', 'Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Triazoles/administration & dosage/therapeutic use']",,2017/05/16 06:00,2018/04/17 06:00,['2017/05/16 06:00'],"['2017/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/14 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/myc.12635 [doi]'],ppublish,Mycoses. 2017 Sep;60(9):600-606. doi: 10.1111/myc.12635.

Among novel therapeutic agents, vosaroxin is a first-in-class anticancer quinolone derivative that targets topoisomerase II and induces site-selective double-strand breaks in DNA, leading to tumor cell apoptosis. Areas covered: Herein, the authors provide a comprehensive review of the preclinical development of vosaroxin. This includes coverage of vosaroxin's mechanism of action in addition to its pharmacology and of the main studies reported over the past few years with vosaroxin when used to treat adult AML. Expert opinion: Given that vosaroxin is associated with fewer potential side effects, it may be of benefit to elderly patients with relapsed/refractory AML and to those with additional comorbidities who have previously received an anthracycline and cytarabine combination. Furthermore, vosaroxin also was seen to be active in multidrug-resistant preclinical models. However, further studies have to be performed to better evaluate its place in the armamentarium against AML.","['Paubelle, Etienne', 'Zylbersztejn, Florence', 'Thomas, Xavier']","['Paubelle E', 'Zylbersztejn F', 'Thomas X']",,"['a Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hematology Department , Lyon-Sud Hospital , Pierre-Benite , France.', 'b Imagine Institute INSERM U 1163/CNRS ERL 8254 , Paris , France.', 'a Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hematology Department , Lyon-Sud Hospital , Pierre-Benite , France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170522,England,Expert Opin Drug Discov,Expert opinion on drug discovery,101295755,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Naphthyridines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Topoisomerase Inhibitors)', 'K6A90IIZ19 (vosaroxin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Naphthyridines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Topoisomerase Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,2017/05/16 06:00,2017/07/01 06:00,['2017/05/16 06:00'],"['2017/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17460441.2017.1331215 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Discov. 2017 Jul;12(7):747-753. doi: 10.1080/17460441.2017.1331215.

Using knock-in mice deficient in downregulation of IFNAR1, we uncovered that IFNAR1 expression in stromal benign cells functions to protect against progression of leukemia. We discuss putative mechanisms of this regulation and potential of therapeutic targeting of IFNAR1 downregulation to treat leukemia.","['Zhao, Bin', 'Bhattacharya, Sabyasachi', 'Yu, Qiujing', 'Fuchs, Serge Y']","['Zhao B', 'Bhattacharya S', 'Yu Q', 'Fuchs SY']",,"['a Department of Biomedical Sciences , Mari Lowe Center for Comparative Oncology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'a Department of Biomedical Sciences , Mari Lowe Center for Comparative Oncology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'a Department of Biomedical Sciences , Mari Lowe Center for Comparative Oncology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'a Department of Biomedical Sciences , Mari Lowe Center for Comparative Oncology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA165997/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092900/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA216936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20170515,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Ifnar1 protein, mouse)', '156986-95-7 (Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', '*Gene Expression', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC6287747,2017/05/16 06:00,2018/08/01 06:00,['2017/05/16 06:00'],"['2017/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2017.1319053 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2018 Jan;59(1):171-177. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2017.1319053.

In this paper we summarize recent studies describing the molecular basis of ET. We review the prognostic importance of establishing a 'true' ET diagnosis, as well as risk factors for the development of adverse outcomes including thrombosis, AML (2% risk at 15 years), and MF (9% risk at 15 years). Finally, we discuss the decision to initiate treatment and assess the quality of evidence supporting the use of established, available therapies as well as novel treatments.

We present the retrospective analysis of patients with CLL treated at our institution in years 2004-2016. We collected data about the type of infection, pathogenes, treatment and severity of infections surpassed in connection with administration treatment. In the study one hundred and ten patients were evaluated. The average age of patients was 61.7 years (range 34.5-91.9 years). Fludarabine was the most widely used regimen, followed by bendamustine and alemtuzumab. We recorded 393 episodes of infections, of which 114 (29%) were severe and life threatening of degree 3-5, and 279 (71%) of degree 2. The most common infections were the upper respiratory tract infections together with sinusitis (45.03%), pneumonia (26.20%), CMV reactivation occured in 8.14%, infections of the skin was in 7.6 %. Most infections have occurred with the administration of monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab, these patients were at significantly higher risk of infection [RR 2.59 (1.30 to 5.17)] than patients receiving obinutuzumab [RR 0.63 (0.48 to 0.82)] (p = 0.0001). On the contrary, the safety profile of BCR signaling pathway inhibitors was very acceptable [RR 1.17 (0.70 - 1.96)]. The number of infections have decreased during the first 12 months of treatment with ibrutinib. In the study group we recorded 19 deaths, 8 (7.27%) of them were of infectious etiology. The risk of infectious complications is lifelong in patients with CLL, it can be minimized by early detection and aggressive management. Novel targeted agents used in therapy of CLL have a good safety profile, even the risk of infection is decreased during administration.","['Demitrovicova, L', 'Mikuskova, E', 'Oravcova, I', 'Cingelova, S', 'Drgona, L', 'Mladosievicova, B']","['Demitrovicova L', 'Mikuskova E', 'Oravcova I', 'Cingelova S', 'Drgona L', 'Mladosievicova B']",,,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alemtuzumab/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infections/*complications', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Pneumonia/complications', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sinusitis/complications', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",,2017/05/16 06:00,2019/04/25 06:00,['2017/05/16 06:00'],"['2017/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/neo_2017_320 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasma. 2017;64(3):474-481. doi: 10.4149/neo_2017_320.,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'infectious complications', 'inhibitors of BCR signaling monoclonal antibodies.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It usually hampers patients' lives and may also endanger efficient leukemia treatment. Although many factors have been suggested to account for an elevated risk of VTs in patients with ALL, there still is a lack of studies focusing on CVTs and especially in the setting of adult ALL patients. We studied in our retrospective population-based cohort the occurrence, characteristics, as well as risk factors for VTs in 186 consecutively diagnosed Finnish adult ALL patients treated with a national pediatric-inspired treatment protocol ALL2000. In the risk factor analyses for VTs we found a distinction of the characteristics of the patients acquiring CVT from those with other kinds of VTs or without thrombosis. In contrast to previous studies we were also able to compare the effects of asparaginase in relation to CVT occurrence. Notably, more than half of the CVTs were diagnosed prior the administration of asparaginase which accentuates the role of other risk factors on the pathophysiology of CVT compared to truncal or central venous line (CVL) VTs in adult ALL patients.","['Roininen, Saara', 'Laine, Outi', 'Kauppila, Marjut', 'Vesanen, Marko', 'Ramet, Maria', 'Sinisalo, Marjatta', 'Jantunen, Esa', 'Saily, Marjaana', 'Raty, Riikka', 'Elonen, Erkki', 'Wartiovaara-Kautto, Ulla']","['Roininen S', 'Laine O', 'Kauppila M', 'Vesanen M', 'Ramet M', 'Sinisalo M', 'Jantunen E', 'Saily M', 'Raty R', 'Elonen E', 'Wartiovaara-Kautto U']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0491-8196'],"['Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland.', 'University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170515,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Asparaginase/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Venous Thrombosis/*epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC5463063,2017/05/16 06:00,2018/03/09 06:00,['2017/05/16 06:00'],"['2016/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/14 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/09 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.1094 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2017 Jun;6(6):1275-1285. doi: 10.1002/cam4.1094.

Its courses of diagnosis and treatment can cause physiologic symptoms and psychological distress that secondarily affect children's quality of life and participation in daily activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of play-based occupational therapy on pain, anxiety, and fatigue in hospitalized children with cancer who were receiving chemotherapy. METHODS: Two hospitalized children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at least 4 months after diagnoses who received two courses of chemotherapy participated in this pilot study. Takata Play History and Iranian Children Participation Assessment Scale were used to develop intervention protocol. Nine, 30-45 min play-based occupational therapy sessions took place for each child. Children filled out the Faces Pain Scale, Visual Fatigue Scale, and Faces Anxiety Scale before and after each intervention session. RESULTS: Pain, anxiety, and fatigue levels decreased in both participants. Furthermore, the results showed a relationship between pain, anxiety, and fatigue variables in these children. CONCLUSIONS: Play-based occupational therapy can be effective in improving pain, anxiety, and fatigue levels in hospitalized children with cancer receiving chemotherapy.","['Mohammadi, Ahmad', 'Mehraban, Afsoon Hassani', 'Damavandi, Shahla A']","['Mohammadi A', 'Mehraban AH', 'Damavandi SA']",,"['Department of Occupational Therapy, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Occupational Therapy, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Ali-Asghar Hospital, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Asia Pac J Oncol Nurs,Asia-Pacific journal of oncology nursing,101673157,,,,PMC5412156,2017/05/16 06:00,2017/05/16 06:01,['2017/05/16 06:00'],"['2017/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/apjon.apjon_13_17 [doi]', 'APJON-4-168 [pii]']",ppublish,Asia Pac J Oncol Nurs. 2017 Apr-Jun;4(2):168-172. doi: 10.4103/apjon.apjon_13_17.,['NOTNLM'],"['Chemotherapy', 'childhood cancer', 'hospitalization', 'play-based occupational therapy']",['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, sex hormone receptors are also expressed by leukemic cell lines and blasts. In this review, I will discuss the emerging question of why hematopoietic cells express these receptors. A tempting hypothetical explanation for this phenomenon is that hematopoietic stem cells are related to subpopulation of migrating primordial germ cells. To support of this notion, the anatomical sites of origin of primitive and definitive hematopoiesis during embryonic development are tightly connected with the migratory route of primordial germ cells: from the proximal epiblast to the extraembryonic endoderm at the bottom of the yolk sac and then back to the embryo proper via the primitive streak to the aorta-gonado-mesonephros (AGM) region on the way to the genital ridges. The migration of these cells overlaps with the emergence of primitive hematopoiesis in the blood islands at the bottom of the yolk sac, and definitive hematopoiesis that occurs in hemogenic endothelium in the embryonic dorsal aorta in AGM region.","['Ratajczak, M Z']",['Ratajczak MZ'],,"['Stem Cell Institute, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Department of Regenerative Medicine, Warsaw Medical University, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['R01 DK074720/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL112788/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170515,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Gonadal Steroid Hormones)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Movement', 'Embryonic Development/*physiology', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans']",PMC5540746,2017/05/16 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2017/05/16 06:00'],"['2017/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/03 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017148 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.148 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Aug;31(8):1671-1677. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.148.

Mutations in SAMHD1 have been associated with the hyperinflammatory disease Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS). SAMHD1 also limits cells' permissiveness to infection with diverse viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), and controls endogenous retroviruses. Increasing evidence supports the role of SAMHD1 as a tumor suppressor. However, SAMHD1 also can act as a resistance factor to nucleoside-based chemotherapies by hydrolyzing their active triphosphate metabolites, thereby reducing response of various malignancies to these anticancer drugs. Hence, informed cancer therapies must take into account the ambiguous properties of SAMHD1 as both an inhibitor of uncontrolled proliferation and a resistance factor limiting the efficacy of anticancer treatments. Here, we provide evidence that SAMHD1 is a double-edged sword for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Our time-dependent analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) AML cohort indicate that high expression of SAMHD1, even though it critically limits the efficacy of high-dose ara-C therapy, might be associated with more favorable disease progression.","['Herold, Nikolas', 'Rudd, Sean G', 'Sanjiv, Kumar', 'Kutzner, Juliane', 'Myrberg, Ida Hed', 'Paulin, Cynthia B J', 'Olsen, Thale Kristin', 'Helleday, Thomas', 'Henter, Jan-Inge', 'Schaller, Torsten']","['Herold N', 'Rudd SG', 'Sanjiv K', 'Kutzner J', 'Myrberg IH', 'Paulin CBJ', 'Olsen TK', 'Helleday T', 'Henter JI', 'Schaller T']",,"[""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden; Theme of Children's and Women's Health, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.

They are driven by mutations in the hemopoietic stem cell, most notably JAK2(V617F), CALR, and MPL. Clinically, they have the propensity to progress to myelofibrosis and transform to acute myeloid leukemia. Megakaryocytic hyperplasia with abnormal features are characteristic, and it is thought that these cells stimulate and drive fibrotic progression. The biological defects underpinning this remain to be explained. In this study we examined the megakaryocyte genome in 12 patients with MPNs to determine whether there are somatic variants and whether there is any association with marrow fibrosis. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing for 120 genes associated with myeloid neoplasms on megakaryocytes isolated from aspirated bone marrow. Ten of the 12 patients had genomic defects in megakaryocytes that were not present in nonmegakaryocytic hemopoietic marrow cells from the same patient. The greatest allelic burden was in patients with increased reticulin deposition. The megakaryocyte-unique mutations were predominantly in genes that regulate chromatin remodeling, chromosome alignment, and stability. These findings show that genomic abnormalities are present in megakaryocytes in MPNs and that these appear to be associated with progression to bone marrow fibrosis.","['Guo, Belinda B', 'Allcock, Richard J', 'Mirzai, Bob', 'Malherbe, Jacques A', 'Choudry, Fizzah A', 'Frontini, Mattia', 'Chuah, Hun', 'Liang, James', 'Kavanagh, Simon E', 'Howman, Rebecca', 'Ouwehand, Willem H', 'Fuller, Kathryn A', 'Erber, Wendy N']","['Guo BB', 'Allcock RJ', 'Mirzai B', 'Malherbe JA', 'Choudry FA', 'Frontini M', 'Chuah H', 'Liang J', 'Kavanagh SE', 'Howman R', 'Ouwehand WH', 'Fuller KA', 'Erber WN']",,"['School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia; PathWest Laboratory Medicine, Nedlands, Western Australia, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia; PathWest Laboratory Medicine, Nedlands, Western Australia, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom; National Health Service Blood and Transplant, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom; National Health Service Blood and Transplant, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom; British Heart Foundation Centre of Excellence, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Health Western Australia, Royal Perth Hospital, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia; Department of Health, Western Australia, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Nedlands, Western Australia, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia; Department of Health, Western Australia, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Nedlands, Western Australia, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia; PathWest Laboratory Medicine, Nedlands, Western Australia, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom; National Health Service Blood and Transplant, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom; British Heart Foundation Centre of Excellence, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom; Department of Human Genetics, The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia; PathWest Laboratory Medicine, Nedlands, Western Australia, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia; PathWest Laboratory Medicine, Nedlands, Western Australia, Australia.

Because the bone marrow (BM) provides a more sensitive reflection of the disease process, we hypothesized that using BM parameters in the Sokal and European Treatment and Outcome Study (EUTOS) risk scores could improve their efficacy in an imatinib-treated population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed cases of CML-CP for their response and survival outcomes with imatinib using risk groupings determined by the Sokal and EUTOS scores using peripheral blood (PB) or BM parameters (Sokal-PB, Sokal-BM, EUTOS-PB, and EUTOS-BM). RESULTS: A total of 371 cases were analyzed. The concordance for risk groups was greater for the EUTOS scores (81.9%) than for the Sokal scores (68.1%) using PB versus BM parameters. For all 4 risk scores, the predictive efficacy was statistically significant. EUTOS-PB and EUTOS-BM could better prognosticate for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between the low- and high-risk groups (P < .0001). However, with the Sokal risk score, the use of BM parameters improved the prognostic capacity for PFS between the low- and intermediate-risk groups, with a statistically significant difference (P = .025), but not for OS (P = .88). CONCLUSION: The use of BM parameters, a simple method that is feasible in routine clinical practice could improve the prognostic efficacy of the Sokal score for PFS but not for OS in low- and intermediate-risk groups. Further research to improve the sensitivity of risk scores for CML-CP prognosis and attempts at risk-directed therapy is warranted.","['Kanakasetty, Govind Babu', 'Thanky, Aditi Harsh', 'Kuntegowdanahalli, Lakshmaiah', 'Dasappa, Lokanatha', 'Jacob, Linu', 'Mallekavu, Suresh Babu', 'Lakkavalli, Rajeev', 'Kadabur, Lokesh', 'Antapura, Rudresha']","['Kanakasetty GB', 'Thanky AH', 'Kuntegowdanahalli L', 'Dasappa L', 'Jacob L', 'Mallekavu SB', 'Lakkavalli R', 'Kadabur L', 'Antapura R']",,"['Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bengaluru, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bengaluru, India.

These complications are potentially mediated by damage to the hypothalamus (HT), as childhood onset (CO) craniopharyngioma (CP) survivors without HT involvement are spared overt obesity. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) shows brain tissue microstructure alterations, by fractional anisotrophy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD). We used DTI to determine the integrity of the microstructure of the HT in ALL survivors. DESIGN: Case-control study. PATIENTS: Three groups were included: (i) 27 CRT treated ALL survivors on hormone supplementation, (ii) 17 CO-CP survivors on hormone supplementation but without HT involvement and (iii) 27 matched controls. MEASUREMENTS: DTI parameters of the HT were measured and body composition. RESULTS: Microstructural alterations in the HT were more severe in ALL survivors with a BMI >/=25 than with BMI <25. Compared to controls, ALL survivors had reduced FA (P=.04), increased MD (P<.001), AD (P<.001) and RD (P<.001) in the right and left HT. In the right HT, ALL survivors with a BMI >/=25 showed elevated MD (P=.03) and AD (P=.02) compared to ALL survivors with BMI <25. In contrast, DTI parameters did not differ between CP survivors and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up after CRT for ALL DTI measures were affected in the HT despite complete hormone replacement. The present data suggest that ALL survivors have demyelination and axonal loss in the HT.","['Follin, Cecilia', 'Fjalldal, Sigridur', 'Svard, Daniel', 'van Westen, Danielle', 'Gabery, Sanaz', 'Petersen, Asa', 'Latt, Jimmy', 'Rylander, Lars', 'Erfurth, Eva Marie']","['Follin C', 'Fjalldal S', 'Svard D', 'van Westen D', 'Gabery S', 'Petersen A', 'Latt J', 'Rylander L', 'Erfurth EM']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2133-7967'],"['Department of Endocrinology, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Clinical Sciences Lund, Diagnostic Radiology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Medical Imaging and Physiology, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Clinical Sciences Lund, Diagnostic Radiology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Medical Imaging and Physiology, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Medical Imaging and Physiology, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170619,England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,,IM,"['Adult', 'Body Composition/physiology', 'Body Mass Index', 'Brain/*pathology', 'Craniopharyngioma/*pathology', 'Diffusion Tensor Imaging/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypothalamus/*pathology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors']",,2017/05/16 06:00,2018/05/15 06:00,['2017/05/15 06:00'],"['2017/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cen.13373 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2017 Oct;87(4):359-366. doi: 10.1111/cen.13373.

To be able to discontinue tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment, it is necessary to develop complementary therapies to target minimal residual disease. Recent findings by a number of investigators in both CML mouse models and CML patients offer evidence that many factors in the leukemic microenvironment can collectively contribute to immune escape, including expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, programmed death-1/programmed death-1 ligand interactions resulting in T-cell impairment, expression of soluble suppressive factors such as soluble CD25, and down-regulation of MHC molecules by CML cells. Other investigators have studied the role of cytokines on the resistance to TKIs by leukemic stem cells (LSCs) and have highlighted the implication of the JAK/STAT pathway as well as the interleukin 1 (IL-1) signaling pathway. Distinct immunologic strategies have been considered to harness the immune system or trigger LSC death to allow more CML patients to discontinue TKI treatment (so-called functional cure). Successful immunotherapy and TKI combination and the optimal timing of immunotherapy determination represent major challenges for the future.","['Cayssials, Emilie', 'Guilhot, Francois']","['Cayssials E', 'Guilhot F']",,"['INSERM CIC 1402, CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'INSERM CIC 1402, CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France. fr.guilhot@wanadoo.fr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,BioDrugs,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",9705305,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology']",,2017/05/16 06:00,2018/03/07 06:00,['2017/05/15 06:00'],"['2017/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40259-017-0225-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s40259-017-0225-6 [pii]']",ppublish,BioDrugs. 2017 Jun;31(3):143-149. doi: 10.1007/s40259-017-0225-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, many patients treated with TKIs suffer from TKI-related complications. In particular, vascular events such as peripheral artery occlusive disease have become aserious clinical problem for patients who receive the TKI, nilotinib. At present, the molecular mechanisms by which TKIs cause vascular endothelial cell insults remain unknown.This study explored the effects of the TKIs, imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib, on vascular endothelial cells in vitro, and found that only nilotinib induced expression of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) by vascular endothelial cells. Nilotinib-induced IL-1beta expression stimulated the adhesion of monocytes to vascular endothelial cells in association with an increase in levels of adhesion molecules. MicroRNA database searching identified miR-3121-3p binding sites in the 3'-UTR of the IL-1beta gene. Exposure of endothelial cells to nilotinib caused downregulation of miR-3121-3p in these cells. Importantly, forced-expression of miR-3121-3p counteracted nilotinib-induced expression of IL-1beta. Importantly, serum levels if IL-1beta were significantly elevated in CML patients receiving nilotinib (n=14) compared to those receiving other TKIs (n=16) (3.76+/-1.22pg/ml vs 0.27+/-0.77pg/ml, p<0.05). Taken together, our data suggest that nilotinib decreases levels of miR-3121-3p resulting in an increase in expression of IL-1beta and adhesion molecules in vascular endothelial cells. The miR-3121-3p/IL-1beta axis could be a potential target to prevent vascular events in CML patients with high risk of vascular events.","['Sukegawa, Masumi', 'Wang, Xiangmin', 'Nishioka, Chie', 'Pan, Bin', 'Xu, Kailin', 'Ohkawara, Hiroshi', 'Hamasaki, Yoichi', 'Mita, Masayuki', 'Nakamura, Kenichi', 'Okamoto, Masatoshi', 'Shimura, Hiromi', 'Ohta, Masatsugu', 'Ikezoe, Takayuki']","['Sukegawa M', 'Wang X', 'Nishioka C', 'Pan B', 'Xu K', 'Ohkawara H', 'Hamasaki Y', 'Mita M', 'Nakamura K', 'Okamoto M', 'Shimura H', 'Ohta M', 'Ikezoe T']",,"['Department of Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Hikarigaoka-1, Fukushima 960-1295, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Hikarigaoka-1, Fukushima 960-1295, Japan; Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, No. 99,West Huaihai Road, 221002 Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi University, Oko-cho, Nankoku, Kochi 783-8505, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Hikarigaoka-1, Fukushima 960-1295, Japan; Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, No. 99,West Huaihai Road, 221002 Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, No. 99,West Huaihai Road, 221002 Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Hikarigaoka-1, Fukushima 960-1295, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Iwaki Kyoritsu General Hospital, Iwaki, Fukushima 973-8402 Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Shirakawa Kosei General Hospital, Shirakawa, 961-0005 Fukushima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Shirakawa Kosei General Hospital, Shirakawa, 961-0005 Fukushima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, YUASA Foundation Jusendo General Hospital, Koriyama, Fukushima 963-8585, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Fukushima Medical University, Hikarigaoka-1, Fukushima 960-1295, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fukushima Medical University Aizu Medical Center, Aizuwakamatsu, 969-3492 Fukushima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Hikarigaoka-1, Fukushima 960-1295, Japan.

We performed a retrospective analysis based on data obtained from a Japanese nationwide registration database to compare HSCT outcomes in AYA patients with AML with those in children with AML. An analysis of the 2973 patients with de novo AML who received allogeneic HSCT from 1990 to 2013 showed inferior 5-year overall survival (OS) (54% versus 58%, P <.01) and increased treatment-related mortality (TRM) (16% versus 13%, P = .02) in AYA patients. Multivariate analysis for both OS and TRM showed a significant negative impact on AYAs. However, the negative impact of older age lost its significance in an additional analysis focusing on 1407 recent transplant recipients with high-resolution HLA typing (2000 to 2013). Finally, we analyzed the impact of transplantation center type on HSCT outcomes in 317 adolescent patients (15 to 18 years old) and found no difference in outcomes between patients treated at a pediatric or an adult hospital. Higher age was a strong predictive factor for inferior OS resulting from increased TRM, which can be eliminated with better donor selection using high-resolution HLA typing.","['Tomizawa, Daisuke', 'Tanaka, Shiro', 'Kondo, Tadakazu', 'Hashii, Yoshiko', 'Arai, Yasuyuki', 'Kudo, Kazuko', 'Taga, Takashi', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Goto, Hiroaki', 'Inagaki, Jiro', 'Koh, Katsuyoshi', 'Ohashi, Kazuteru', 'Ozawa, Yukiyasu', 'Inoue, Masami', 'Kato, Koji', 'Tanaka, Junji', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Ishida, Hiroyuki']","['Tomizawa D', 'Tanaka S', 'Kondo T', 'Hashii Y', 'Arai Y', 'Kudo K', 'Taga T', 'Fukuda T', 'Goto H', 'Inagaki J', 'Koh K', 'Ohashi K', 'Ozawa Y', 'Inoue M', 'Kato K', 'Tanaka J', 'Atsuta Y', 'Adachi S', 'Ishida H']",,"[""Division of Leukemia and Lymphoma, Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.

Histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC-8), a class I HDAC enzyme, may serve as 'epigenetic player' that affects in the regulation of transcription factors and alters the structure of chromosome associated with tumorigenesis. It is established that the influence of MMP-2 in invasion, metastasis and angiogenenic events of hematological malignancies may be suppressed by HDAC inhibitors through reversion-inducing-cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs (RECK) protein. Therefore, the isoform-specific HDAC-8 and MMP-2 inhibitors may provide synergistic medicinal benefit in leukemia. However, a paucity of articles is available on dual acting HDAC-8/MMP-2 inhibitors. In this circumstance, a lot of works are still necessary to identify novel dual HDAC-8/MMP-2 inhibitors and this review will surely provide an initial idea regarding the utility of designing such type of dual inhibitors. Here, the importance of MMP-2 and HDAC-8 inhibition in hematological malignancies are focussed for the first time as per our knowledge along with the structure-activity relationships (SARs) of a handful of molecules, some of which were synthesised in-house, have been highlighted that will inspire more interactions between the medicinal chemistry and biology community to harness their expertise in design and discovery of the better acting dual inhibitors in future.","['Amin, Sk Abdul', 'Adhikari, Nilanjan', 'Jha, Tarun']","['Amin SA', 'Adhikari N', 'Jha T']",,"['Natural Science Laboratory, Division of Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, P.

Among the symptoms of GWI are those associated with sickness behavior, observations suggestive of underlying neuroinflammation. We have shown that exposure of mice to the stress hormone, corticosterone (CORT), and to diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), as a nerve agent mimic, results in marked neuroinflammation, findings consistent with a stress/neuroimmune basis of GWI. Here, we examined the contribution of irreversible and reversible acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors to neuroinflammation in our mouse model of GWI. Male C57BL/6J mice received 4 days of CORT (400 mg/L) in the drinking water followed by a single dose of chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO; 8 mg/kg, i.p.), DFP (4 mg/kg, i.p.), pyridostigmine bromide (PB; 3 mg/kg, i.p.), or physostigmine (PHY; 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.). CPO and DFP alone caused cortical and hippocampal neuroinflammation assessed by qPCR of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, C-C chemokine ligand 2, IL-1beta, leukemia inhibitory factor and oncostatin M; CORT pretreatment markedly augmented these effects. Additionally, CORT exposure prior to DFP or CPO enhanced activation of the neuroinflammation signal transducer, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). In contrast, PHY or PB alone or with CORT pretreatment did not produce neuroinflammation or STAT3 activation. While all of the CNS-acting AChE inhibitors (DFP, CPO, and PHY) decreased brain AChE activity, CORT pretreatment abrogated these effects for the irreversible inhibitors. Taken together, these findings suggest that irreversible AChE inhibitor-induced neuroinflammation and particularly its exacerbation by CORT, result from non-cholinergic effects of these compounds, pointing potentially to organophosphorylation of other neuroimmune targets.","['Locker, Alicia R', 'Michalovicz, Lindsay T', 'Kelly, Kimberly A', 'Miller, Julie V', 'Miller, Diane B', ""O'Callaghan, James P""]","['Locker AR', 'Michalovicz LT', 'Kelly KA', 'Miller JV', 'Miller DB', ""O'Callaghan JP""]",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8497-4598'],"['Health Effects Laboratory Division, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Morgantown, West Virginia, USA.', 'Health Effects Laboratory Division, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Morgantown, West Virginia, USA.', 'Health Effects Laboratory Division, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Morgantown, West Virginia, USA.', 'Health Effects Laboratory Division, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Morgantown, West Virginia, USA.', 'Health Effects Laboratory Division, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Morgantown, West Virginia, USA.', 'Health Effects Laboratory Division, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Morgantown, West Virginia, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20170614,England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Cholinesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Organophosphates)', 'EC 3.1.1.7 (Acetylcholinesterase)', 'KVI301NA53 (Pyridostigmine Bromide)', 'W980KJ009P (Corticosterone)']",IM,"['Acetylcholinesterase/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Brain/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cholinesterase Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Corticosterone/*pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gulf War', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Organophosphates/*metabolism', 'Persian Gulf Syndrome/pathology', 'Pyridostigmine Bromide/pharmacology']",PMC5575502,2017/05/14 06:00,2017/09/22 06:00,['2017/05/14 06:00'],"['2017/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/29 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jnc.14071 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurochem. 2017 Aug;142(3):444-455. doi: 10.1111/jnc.14071.

We explored the risk of second cancer in relation to protocols, risk group, thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) activity, ALL high hyperdiploidy (HeH), and t(12;21)[ETV6/RUNX1]. RESULTS: After median 9.5 years (interquartile range, 5.4-15.3 yrs) of follow-up, 40 of 3,591 patients had developed a second cancer, of whom 38 had non-high-risk B-cell precursor ALL. Patients with standard-risk ALL, who received the longest maintenance therapy, had the highest adjusted hazard of second cancer (hazard ratio [HR], intermediate vs. standard risk: 0.16, 95% CI: 0.06-0.43, P < 0.001; HR, high vs. standard risk: 0.09, 95% CI: 0.02-0.49, P = 0.006); no significant effects of protocol, age, or white blood cell count at diagnosis, ALL HeH, or t(12;21)[ETV6/RUNX1] were observed. A subset analysis on the patients with standard-risk ALL did not show an increased hazard of second cancer from either HeH or t(12;21) (adjusted HR 2.02, 95% CI: 0.69-5.96, P = 0.20). The effect of low TPMT low activity was explored in patients reaching maintenance therapy in clinical remission (n = 3,368); no association with second cancer was observed (adjusted HR 1.43, 95% CI: 0.54-3.76, P = 0.47). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of second cancer was generally highest in patients with low-risk ALL, but we could not identify a subset at higher risk than others.","['Nielsen, Stine N', 'Eriksson, Frank', 'Rosthoej, Susanne', 'Andersen, Mette K', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Hasle, Henrik', 'Hjalgrim, Lisa L', 'Aasberg, Ann', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Jonsson, Olafur G', 'Pruunsild, Kaie', 'Vaitkeviciene, Goda E', 'Vettenranta, Kim', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld']","['Nielsen SN', 'Eriksson F', 'Rosthoej S', 'Andersen MK', 'Forestier E', 'Hasle H', 'Hjalgrim LL', 'Aasberg A', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Heyman M', 'Jonsson OG', 'Pruunsild K', 'Vaitkeviciene GE', 'Vettenranta K', 'Schmiegelow K']",,"['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Section of Biostatistics, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Section of Biostatistics, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Medical Biosciences, Clinical Genetics, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics, University Hospital of Trondheim, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Institution for Clinical Sciences Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', ""Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital, Barnaspitali Hringsins, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."", ""Department of Oncology and Hematology, Tallinn Children's Hospital, Tallinn, Estonia."", ""Centre for Paediatric Oncology and Haematology, University Children's Hospital, Vilnius, Lithuania."", 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170513,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/blood/drug therapy/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Ploidies', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2017/05/14 06:00,2017/10/17 06:00,['2017/05/14 06:00'],"['2016/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/02 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26518 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Oct;64(10). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26518.

We estimated health care costs by phase of cancer care, from the public payer perspective, in population-based cohorts. METHODS: Children newly diagnosed at ages 0 days-14.9 years and adolescents newly diagnosed at 15-19.9 years, from January 1, 1995 to June 30, 2010, were identified from Ontario cancer registries, and each matched to three noncancer controls. Data were linked with administrative records describing resource use for cancer and other health care. Total and net (patients minus controls) resource-specific costs ($CAD2012) were estimated using generalized estimating equations for four phases of care: prediagnosis (60 days), initial (360 days), continuing (variable), final (360 days). RESULTS: Mean ages at diagnosis were 6 years for children (N = 4,606) and 17 years for adolescents (N = 2,443). Mean net prediagnosis phase 60-day costs were $6,177 for children and $1,018 for adolescents. Costs for initial, continuing, and final phases were $138,161, $15,756, and $316,303 per 360 days for children, and $62,919, $7,071, and $242,008 for adolescents. The highest initial phase costs were for leukemia patients ($156,225 per 360 days for children and $171,275 for adolescents). The final phase was the most costly ($316,303 per 360 days for children and $242,008 for adolescents). CONCLUSIONS: Costs for children with cancer are much higher than for adolescents and much higher than those reported in adults. Comprehensive population-based long-term estimates of cancer costs are useful for health services planning and cost-effectiveness analysis.","['de Oliveira, Claire', 'Bremner, Karen E', 'Liu, Ning', 'Greenberg, Mark L', 'Nathan, Paul C', 'McBride, Mary L', 'Krahn, Murray D']","['de Oliveira C', 'Bremner KE', 'Liu N', 'Greenberg ML', 'Nathan PC', 'McBride ML', 'Krahn MD']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4746-5828'],"['Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment Collaborative, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Cancer Control Research Program, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'School of Population and Public Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment Collaborative, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170513,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cost of Illness', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*economics/therapy', 'Ontario', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Young Adult']",,2017/05/14 06:00,2017/11/01 06:00,['2017/05/14 06:00'],"['2016/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26628 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Nov;64(11). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26628.

METHODS: This study assessed the association between adolescent obesity and future risk for MPN. Data on 2,516,256 Israeli adolescents, who underwent a compulsory general health examination at ages 16 to 19, between 1967 and 2011, were linked to the National Cancer Registry in this nationwide, population-based cohort study. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for MPN associated with BMI measured at adolescence. RESULTS: The mean follow-up of 19.86 +/- 12.15 years reflected 49,977,521 person years, during which 433 examinees developed MPN, primarily chronic myelogenous leukemia, polycythemia vera, and essential thrombocythemia. Obesity (BMI >/= 95th percentile) in adolescence significantly predicted increased risk of MPN with HR (adjusted for sex) of 1.81 (95% confidence interval 1.13-2.92, P = 0.014).

In analysis of our Affymetrix microarray profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we found that ALOX5 is especially down-regulated in MLL-rearranged AML, via transcription repression mediated by Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Colony forming/replating and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) assays showed that Alox5 exhibited a moderate anti-tumor effect both in vitro and in vivo. Strikingly, leukemic cells with Alox5 overexpression showed a significantly higher sensitivity to the standard chemotherapeutic agents, i.e., doxorubicin (DOX) and cytarabine (Ara-C). The drug-sensitizing role of Alox5 was further confirmed in human and murine MLL-rearranged AML cell models in vitro, as well as in the in vivo MLL-rearranged AML BMT model coupled with treatment of ""5 + 3"" (i.e. DOX plus Ara-C) regimen. Stat and K-Ras signaling pathways were negatively correlated with Alox5 overexpression in MLL-AF9-leukemic blast cells; inhibition of the above signaling pathways mimicked the drug-sensitizing effect of ALOX5 in AML cells. Collectively, our work shows that ALOX5 plays a moderate anti-tumor role and functions as a drug sensitizer, with a therapeutic potential, in MLL-rearranged AML.","['Wang, Yungui', 'Skibbe, Jennifer R', 'Hu, Chao', 'Dong, Lei', 'Ferchen, Kyle', 'Su, Rui', 'Li, Chenying', 'Huang, Hao', 'Weng, Hengyou', 'Huang, Huilin', 'Qin, Xi', 'Jin, Jie', 'Chen, Jianjun', 'Jiang, Xi']","['Wang Y', 'Skibbe JR', 'Hu C', 'Dong L', 'Ferchen K', 'Su R', 'Li C', 'Huang H', 'Weng H', 'Huang H', 'Qin X', 'Jin J', 'Chen J', 'Jiang X']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3749-2902'],"['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University College of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310003, China.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, 45219, USA.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, 45219, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University College of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310003, China.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, 45219, USA.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, 45219, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, 45219, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, 45219, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University College of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310003, China.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, 45219, USA.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, 45219, USA.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, 45219, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, 45219, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University College of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310003, China.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, 45219, USA. chen3jj@uc.edu.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA. chen3jj@uc.edu.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, 45219, USA. jiangx4@uc.edu.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA. jiangx4@uc.edu.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA178454/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA182528/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA211614/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA214965/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170512,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 1.3.11.34 (ALOX5 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC5431828,2017/05/14 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2017/05/14 06:00'],"['2017/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-01913-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-01913-y [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 May 12;7(1):1853. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-01913-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several other JAK2 inhibitors have entered clinical testing, but none have been approved and many have been discontinued. Importantly, the activity of these agents is not restricted to patients with JAK2 V617F or exon 12 mutations. Although JAK2 inhibitors provide substantial clinical benefit, their disease-modifying activity is limited, and rational combinations with other targeted agents are needed, particularly in MF, in which survival is short. Many such combinations are being explored, as are other novel agents, some of which could successfully be combined with JAK2 inhibitors in the future. In addition, new JAK2 inhibitors with the potential for less myelosuppression continue to be investigated. Given the proven safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib, it is likely that ruxolitinib-based combinations will be a major way forward in drug development for MF. If approved, less myelosuppressive JAK2 inhibitors such as pacritinib or NS-018 could prove to be very useful additions to the therapeutic armamentarium in MF. In PV, inhibitors of histone deacetylases and human double minute 2 have activity, but their role, if any, in the future treatment algorithm is uncertain, given the availability of ruxolitinib and renewed interest in interferons. Ruxolitinib is in late-phase clinical trials in essential thrombocythemia, in which it could fill an important void for patients with troublesome symptoms.","['Bose, Prithviraj', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Bose P', 'Verstovsek S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4343-5712', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6912-8569']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170512,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0', '(11-(2-pyrrolidin-1-ylethoxy)-14,19-dioxa-5,7,26-triazatetracyclo(19.3.1.1(2,6).1', '(8,12))heptacosa-1(25),2(26),3,5,8,10,12(27),16,21,23-decaene)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged-Ring Compounds)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bridged-Ring Compounds/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nitriles', 'Patient Safety', 'Polycythemia Vera/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC5510786,2017/05/14 06:00,2017/08/16 06:00,['2017/05/14 06:00'],"['2017/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33211-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-04-742288 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Jul 13;130(2):115-125. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-04-742288.

To compare the risks and benefits between UCBT without ATG and UPBSCT in patients with acute leukemia (AL), we conducted a multicenter retrospective study of 79 patients who underwent UCBT (myeloablative conditioning without ATG) and 96 patients who underwent UPBSCT (myeloablative conditioning with ATG). The outcomes were graft failure, neutrophil engraftment, platelet engraftment, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), transplantation-related mortality (TRM), relapse, overall survival (OS), and leukemia-free survival (LFS). Follow-up was censored on October 31, 2016. Engraftment was similar between the 2 groups but granulocyte and platelet recovery were slower in the UCBT group (both P < .001). The incidences of aGVHD, TRM, OS, and LFS were similar between the 2 groups (all P > .05). Without ATG, the UCBT group displayed less cGVHD and less moderate and severe cGVHD (P < .001 and P = .004). The incidences of Epstein-Barr virus viremia and post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease were significantly lower in the UCBT group (P < .001 and P = .037). UCBT recipients had higher activity Karnofsky performance scores and 3-year GVHD-free/relapse-free survival than the UPBSCT group (P = .03 and P = .04). We observed similar survival when comparing UCBT without ATG and UPBSCT, but we also observed better quality of life in patients undergoing UCBT without ATG.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the development of chemoresistance in glioma is not well-understood. In this study, we show that long non-coding RNA AC023115.3 is induced by cisplatin in human glioblastoma cells and that elevated AC023115.3 promotes cisplatin-induced apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy. Further mechanistic studies revealed that AC023115.3 acts as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-26a and attenuates the inhibitory effect of miR-26a on GSK3beta, a proline-directed serine-threonine kinase that promotes the degradation of Mcl1, leading to an increase in GSK3beta and a decrease in autophagy. Additionally, we discovered that AC023115.3 improves chemosensitivity of glioma cells to cisplatin by regulating the miR-26a-GSK3beta-Mcl1 pathway. Thus, these data indicate that the AC023115.3-miR-26a-GSK3beta signalling axis plays an important role in reducing the chemoresistance of glioma.","['Ma, Binbin', 'Yuan, Zhongbo', 'Zhang, Li', 'Lv, Peng', 'Yang, Ting', 'Gao, Jinxia', 'Pan, Ning', 'Wu, Qiong', 'Lou, Jiacheng', 'Han, Chuanchun', 'Zhang, Bo']","['Ma B', 'Yuan Z', 'Zhang L', 'Lv P', 'Yang T', 'Gao J', 'Pan N', 'Wu Q', 'Lou J', 'Han C', 'Zhang B']",,"['Department of Neurosurgery, Second Affiliated Hospital, Institute of Cancer Stem Cell, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116027, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Second Affiliated Hospital, Institute of Cancer Stem Cell, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116027, China.', 'Laboratory of Pathogenic Biology, College of Basic Medical Science, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116027, China.', 'Research Center, Second Affiliated Hospital, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116027, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Second Affiliated Hospital, Institute of Cancer Stem Cell, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116027, China.', 'Department of Anaesthesiology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Dalian Medical University, 116027, China.', 'Department of Anaesthesiology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Dalian Medical University, 116027, China.', 'Department of Neurology of Dalian Municipal Central Hospital Affiliated, Dalian Medical University, 116033, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Second Affiliated Hospital, Institute of Cancer Stem Cell, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116027, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Second Affiliated Hospital, Institute of Cancer Stem Cell, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116027, China.

Mutations in PI3K, PTEN, RAS, or other upstream regulators can activate the AKT kinase which has central roles in supporting cell proliferation and survival. A major target of AKT is Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3). GSK3 has two isoforms (alpha and beta) that were studied as regulators of metabolism but emerged as central players in cancer in the early 1990s. GSK3 is unique in that the isoforms are constitutively active. Active GSK3 promotes destruction of oncogenic proteins such as beta Catenin, c-MYC, and MCL-1 and thus has tumor suppressor properties. In AML, inactivation of GSK3 is associated with poor overall survival. Interestingly in some leukemias GSK3 targets a tumor suppressor and thus the kinases can act as tumor promoters in those instances. An example is GSK3 targeting p27Kip1 in AML with MLL translocation. This review will cover the role of GSK3 in various leukemias both as tumor suppressor and tumor promoter. We will also briefly cover current state of GSK3 inhibitors for leukemia therapy.","['Ruvolo, Peter P']",['Ruvolo PP'],,"['Department of Leukemia, Unit 448, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, United States.

Of these, 3 compounds were more potent than resveratrol (IC50=10.5microM) namely: resveratryl triacetate (IC50=3.4microM), resveratryl triisobutyrate (IC50=5.1microM), and resveratryl triisovalerate (IC50=4.9microM); all other derivatives had IC50 values of >10microM. Further studies indicated that the active compounds caused G1 phase arrest, increased expression of p53, and induced characteristics of apoptotic cell death. Moreover, the compounds were only effective in cycling cells, with cells arrested in G1 phase being refractory.","['Urbaniak, Alicja', 'Delgado, Magdalena', 'Kacprzak, Karol', 'Chambers, Timothy C']","['Urbaniak A', 'Delgado M', 'Kacprzak K', 'Chambers TC']",,"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, United States; Department of Bioorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Adam Mickiewicz University, Umultowska 89b, 61-614 Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, United States.', 'Department of Bioorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Adam Mickiewicz University, Umultowska 89b, 61-614 Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, United States.

Nevertheless, these survivors are at great risk of second cancers and non-malignant co-morbidities in later life. DeNaCaPST is a non-interventional study whose aim is to organize a national screening for thyroid cancer and breast cancer in survivors of CAYA cancers. It will study the compliance with international recommendations, with the aim, regarding a breast screening programme, of offering for every woman living in France, at equal risk, an equal screening. METHOD: DeNaCaPST trial is coordinated by the INSERM 1018 unit in cooperation with the LEA (French Childhood Cancer Survivor Study for Leukaemia) study's coordinators, the long term follow up committee and the paediatric radiation committee of the SFCE (French Society of Childhood Cancers). A total of 35 centres spread across metropolitan France and la Reunion will participate. FCCSS (French Childhood Cancer Survivor Study), LEA and central registry will be interrogated to identify eligible patients. To participate, centers agreed to perform a complete ""long-term follow-up consultations"" according to good clinical practice and the guidelines of the SFCE (French Society of Children Cancers). DISCUSSION: As survival has greatly improved in childhood cancers, detection of therapy-related malignancies has become a priority even if new radiation techniques will lead to better protection for organs at risk. International guidelines have been put in place because of the evidence for increased lifetime risk of breast and thyroid cancer. DeNaCaPST is based on these international recommendations but it is important to recognize that they are based on expert consensus opinion and are supported by neither nonrandomized observational studies nor prospective randomized trials in this specific population. Over-diagnosis is a phenomenon inherent in any screening program and therefore such programs must be evaluated.","['Demoor-Goldschmidt, Charlotte', 'Drui, Delphine', 'Doutriaux, Isabelle', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Auquier, Pascal', 'Dumas, Agnes', 'Berger, Claire', 'Bernier, Valerie', 'Bohrer, Sandrine', 'Bondiau, Pierre-Yves', 'Filhon, Bruno', 'Fresneau, Brice', 'Freycon, Claire', 'Stefan, Dinu', 'Helfre, Sylvie', 'Jackson, Angela', 'Kerr, Christine', 'Laprie, Anne', 'Leseur, Julie', 'Mahe, Marc-Andre', 'Oudot, Caroline', 'Pluchard, Claire', 'Proust, Stephanie', 'Sudour-Bonnange, Helene', 'Vigneron, Celine', 'Lassau, Nathalie', 'Schlumberger, Martin', 'Conter, Cecile Faure', 'de Vathaire, Florent']","['Demoor-Goldschmidt C', 'Drui D', 'Doutriaux I', 'Michel G', 'Auquier P', 'Dumas A', 'Berger C', 'Bernier V', 'Bohrer S', 'Bondiau PY', 'Filhon B', 'Fresneau B', 'Freycon C', 'Stefan D', 'Helfre S', 'Jackson A', 'Kerr C', 'Laprie A', 'Leseur J', 'Mahe MA', 'Oudot C', 'Pluchard C', 'Proust S', 'Sudour-Bonnange H', 'Vigneron C', 'Lassau N', 'Schlumberger M', 'Conter CF', 'de Vathaire F']",,"['Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health (CESP), Cancer and Radiation team, INSERM U1018, Universite Paris-Sud, UVSQ, Universite Paris-Saclay, 94807, Villejuif, France.

Deregulation of c-Myc protein has been shown to occur in 30% of all human cancers, especially in hematopoietic malignancies. As a transcription factor, c-Myc has been shown to regulate up to 15% of all human genome genes, controlling diverse cellular activities including cell cycle, ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis, metabolism, apoptosis and angiogenesis. In this report, we provide evidence that the RNA helicase DHX33 is a critical downstream target of c-Myc. Myc binds to DHX33 upstream promoter region and stimulates its transcription. Elevated DHX33 protein is pivotal for c-Myc to drive tumor formation. Knockdown of DHX33 to basal levels in c-Myc overexpressing cells significantly reduced cell proliferation, cell migration and anchorage-independent cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, we found that DHX33 promotes MMP9, MMP14 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (PLAU) transcription by directly binding to their promoters, thus promoting cancer cell migration. DHX33 protein was overexpressed in a certain subset of human non-Hodgkin's lymphoma tissues. Finally, knockdown of DHX33 significantly inhibits the development of Myc-induced acute myeloid leukemia. Overall, our results implicate the important role for DHX33 in Myc-induced cancer and point toward its potential therapeutic value in Myc driven cancers.","['Fu, Jijun', 'Liu, Yuchu', 'Wang, Xingshun', 'Yuan, Baolei', 'Zhang, Yandong']","['Fu J', 'Liu Y', 'Wang X', 'Yuan B', 'Zhang Y']",,"['Department of Biology, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Biology, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Biology, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Biology, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Biology, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (DHX33 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2017/05/13 06:00,2017/09/07 06:00,['2017/05/13 06:00'],"['2016/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['3811087 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgx041 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2017 Jun 1;38(6):649-660. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgx041.,,,,"['(c) The Author 2017.

One IDH1R132H inhibitor (clomifene citrate) was found by virtual screening method, which can selectively suppress mutant enzyme activities in vitro and in vivo with a dose-dependent manner. The molecular docking indicated that clomifene occupied the allosteric site of the mutant IDH1. Enzymatic kinetics also demonstrated that clomifene inhibited mutant enzyme in a non-competitive manner. Moreover, knockdown of mutant IDH1 in HT1080 cells decreased the sensitivity to clomifene. In vivo studies indicated that clomifene significantly suppressed the tumor growth of HT1080-bearing CB-17/Icr-scid mice with oral administration of 100 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg per day.

Luteolin, a phenolic compound found in many natural products, has multiple biological functions. Our study was aimed to explore the biological effects of luteolin in a liver injury model induced in rats by mercuric chloride (HgCl2). Criteria for injury included liver enzyme, glutathione and malondialdehyde levels, histopathology, TUNEL assay, hepatocyte viability and reactive oxygen species levels. The results showed that luteolin protected against HgCl2-induced liver injury. Luteolin increased total nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) levels in the presence of HgCl2. Upregulation of its downstream factors, heme oxygenase-1 and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1, was also observed. This suggested that protection by luteolin against HgCl2-induced liver injury involved Nrf2 pathway activation. Luteolin also decreased expression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and P53. HgCl2 exposure led to increased Bcl-associated X protein (Bax), and decreased Bcl-2-related protein long form of Bcl-x (Bcl-xL) and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) expression, leading to an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Taken together, our data suggested that decreasing oxidative stress is a protective mechanism of luteolin against development of HgCl2-induced liver injury, through the Nrf2/NF-kappaB/P53 signaling pathway in rats.","['Zhang, Haili', 'Tan, Xiao', 'Yang, Daqian', 'Lu, Jingjing', 'Liu, Biying', 'Baiyun, Ruiqi', 'Zhang, Zhigang']","['Zhang H', 'Tan X', 'Yang D', 'Lu J', 'Liu B', 'Baiyun R', 'Zhang Z']",,"['College of Veterinary Medicine, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin, 150030, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin, 150030, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin, 150030, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin, 150030, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin, 150030, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin, 150030, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin, 150030, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nfe2l2 protein, rat)', '0 (Protective Agents)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '53GH7MZT1R (Mercuric Chloride)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'KUX1ZNC9J2 (Luteolin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/etiology/metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Chronic Disease', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/metabolism', 'Hepatocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Liver/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Luteolin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Mercuric Chloride/toxicity', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/metabolism', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Protective Agents/pharmacology', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",PMC5522226,2017/05/13 06:00,2018/04/10 06:00,['2017/05/13 06:00'],"['2017/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['17334 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.17334 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jun 20;8(25):40982-40993. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.17334.,['NOTNLM'],"['HgCl2', 'NF-kappaB', 'Nrf2', 'hepatotoxicity', 'luteolin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated sites were identified in AML cells treated with decitabine compared with those treated with cytarabine via the Linear Models for Microarray Data package, following data preprocessing. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of DEGs was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Analysis Discovery. Genes corresponding to the differentially methylated sites were obtained using the annotation package of the methylation microarray platform. The overlapping genes were identified, which exhibited the opposite variation trend between gene expression and DNA methylation. Important transcription factor (TF)gene pairs were screened out, and a regulated network subsequently constructed. A total of 190 DEGs and 540 differentially methylated sites were identified in AML cells treated with decitabine compared with those treated with cytarabine. A total of 36 GO terms of DEGs were enriched, including nucleosomes, proteinDNA complexes and the nucleosome assembly.

So it is necessary to find novel agents to treat this type of AML. In this study, the effects and the mechanisms of plumbagin and recombinant soluble tumor necrosis factoralpha-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (rsTRAIL) on leukemic Kasumi1 cells were primarily investigated. Plumbagin and/or rsTRAIL could significantly inhibit the growth of Kasumi1 cells and induce apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Plumbagin enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis of Kasumi1 cells in association with mitochondria damage, caspase activation, upregulation of death receptors (DRs) and decreased cFLIP expression. The effects of plumbagin on the expression of DR5, Bax and cFLIP could be partially abolished by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger NAC. Glutathione (GSH) depletion by plumbagin increased the production of ROS. In vivo, there was no obvious toxic pathologic change in the heart, liver and kidney tissues in any of the groups. Comparing with the control mice, a significantly increased number of apoptotic cells were observed in the combined treated mice by flow cytometry. Plumbagin also increased the expression of DR4 and DR5 in cells of xenograft tumors. Collectively, our results suggest that both plumbagin and rsTRAIL could be used as a single agent or synergistical agents to induce apoptosis of leukemic Kasumi1 cells in vitro and in vivo.","['Kong, Xiaoyang', 'Luo, Jing', 'Xu, Tongpeng', 'Zhou, Yunjiao', 'Pan, Zengkai', 'Xie, Yinghua', 'Zhao, Limin', 'Lu, Yingting', 'Han, Xiyao', 'Li, Zhixiong', 'Liu, Ligen']","['Kong X', 'Luo J', 'Xu T', 'Zhou Y', 'Pan Z', 'Xie Y', 'Zhao L', 'Lu Y', 'Han X', 'Li Z', 'Liu L']",,"['Department of Hematology, Shanghai No. 5 Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200240, P.R.

These findings underscore the importance of Flt3 to steady-state and malignant hematopoiesis. In this study, the expression of Flt3 protein and Flt3 mRNA by single cells within the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and HPC bone marrow compartments of C57/BL6 mice was investigated using flow cytometry and the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Flt3 was heterogeneously expressed by almost all of the populations studied, including long-term reconstituting HSC and short-term reconstituting HSC. The erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR) were also found to be heterogeneously expressed within the multipotent cell compartments. Co-expression of the mRNAs encoding Flt3 and EpoR rarely occurred within these compartments. Expression of both Flt3 and M-CSFR protein at the surface of single cells was more commonly observed. These results emphasize the heterogeneous nature of HSC and HPC and the new sub-populations identified are important to understanding the origin and heterogeneity of the acute myeloid leukemias.","['Mooney, Ciaran James', 'Cunningham, Alan', 'Tsapogas, Panagiotis', 'Toellner, Kai-Michael', 'Brown, Geoffrey']","['Mooney CJ', 'Cunningham A', 'Tsapogas P', 'Toellner KM', 'Brown G']",,"['Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK. c.mooney@smd15.qmul.ac.uk.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK. alan.cunningham43@gmail.com.', 'Developmental and Molecular Immunology, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Basel 4058, Switzerland. panagiotis.tsapogas@unibas.ch.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK. k.m.toellner@bham.ac.uk.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK. g.brown@bham.ac.uk.', 'Institute of Clinical Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK. g.brown@bham.ac.uk.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170512,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/genetics/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC5454949,2017/05/13 06:00,2018/02/23 06:00,['2017/05/13 06:00'],"['2017/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms18051037 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms18051037 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2017 May 12;18(5). pii: ijms18051037. doi: 10.3390/ijms18051037.,['NOTNLM'],"['Flt3', 'HSC', 'cytokines', 'growth factor receptors', 'hematopoiesis', 'leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the roles of transcription factor C-MYC and its ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 in tumor tissues from 137 patients with ATLL. Immunohistochemical tests showed >/=50% of lymphoma cells in 78.7% (48/61) of lymphoma-type, and 64.9% (24/37) of acute-type samples expressed C-MYC, significantly higher than was seen in smoldering-type (3.6%) and chronic-type (9.1%) samples (P<0.01). Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed C-MYC mRNA expression in lymphoma-type and acute-type samples were significantly higher than in smoldering-type (P<0.01). C-MYC expression was highly correlated with its mRNA levels (rho=0.65, P<0.0001), chromosomal amplification and duplication (rho=0.3, P=0.045) and MIB1 labeling index (rho=0.69, P<0.0001).

Seven patients with smoldering-type or chronic-type ATLL converted to acute-type, in 4 of whom C-MYC expression increased from <50% to >/=50%.

Because of the rarity of CML in the pediatric population, such abnormalities have not been investigated in a large group of children with CML. METHODS: The prognostic relevance of variant t(9;22) and ACAs at diagnosis was assessed in 301 children with CML in the chronic phase who were enrolled in the International Registry for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Children and Adolescents. RESULTS: Overall, 19 children (6.3%) presented with additional cytogenetic findings at diagnosis: 5 children (1.7%) had a variant t(9;22) translocation, 13 children (4.3%) had ACAs, and 1 had both. At 3 years, for children with a classic translocation, children with ACAs, and children with a variant t(9;22) translocation who were treated with imatinib as frontline therapy, the probability of progression-free survival (PFS) was 95% (95% confidence interval [CI], 91%-97%), 100%, and 75% (95% CI, 13%-96%), respectively, and the probability of overall survival (OS) was 98% (95% CI, 95%-100%), 100% (95% CI, 43%-98%), and 75% (95% CI, 13%-96%), respectively. No statistical difference was observed between the patients with classic cytogenetic findings and those with additional chromosomal abnormalities in terms of PFS and OS. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to adults with CML, additional chromosomal abnormalities observed at diagnosis do not seem to have a significant prognostic impact. Cancer 2017;123:3609-16.

The chromosomal aberration in 95% of APL cases is t(15; 17) (q22; q21), which prevents cell differentiation. Characterization of the underlying molecular lesion is valuable in determining optimal treatment strategy. The goal of this study was to develop a new and powerful Flow- FISH technique to detect the long isoform (L) of PML-RARa fusion transcript in NB4 cell line. METHODS: To achieve the best condition for fixation, two different fixatives including 2% paraformaldehyde and 75% ethanol were used. 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.2% saponin were used for the permeabilization step .In hybridization, a wide range of times and temperatures were used and probe was designed in FRET system. Results were confirmed by fluorescent microscope assay and reverse transcription PCR. RESULTS: In the present study, a novel technique was successfully optimized that combines in situ hybridization with flow cytometry to detect the presence of PML-RARa transcript. Using standard fixation and permeabilization protocol of 2% PFA and 0.2% saponin gave the best fluorescent results in flow cytometry. Also, results indicated that the optimum time and temperature for hybridization was 2 hr at 42 degrees C. The results of reverse transcription PCR and fluorescent microscopy confirmed the presence of PML-RARa transcript. CONCLUSION: The concordance between the results of Flow-FISH and those of two other techniques including reverse transcription PCR and FISH indicated that this method would be applicable as a diagnostic test for APL in clinical samples and MRD monitoring.","['Zahedipour, Fatemeh', 'Ranjbaran, Reza', 'Behzad Behbahani, Abbas', 'Afshari, Khalil Tavakol', 'Okhovat, Mohammad Ali', 'Tamadon, Gholamhossein', 'Sharifzadeh, Sedigheh']","['Zahedipour F', 'Ranjbaran R', 'Behzad Behbahani A', 'Afshari KT', 'Okhovat MA', 'Tamadon G', 'Sharifzadeh S']",,"['Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, Faculty of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, Faculty of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, Faculty of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Buali Research Institute, Immunology Research Center, Immunogenetic and Cell Culture Lab, Mashhad University of Medical Science, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, Faculty of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, Faculty of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, Faculty of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Iran,Avicenna J Med Biotechnol,Avicenna journal of medical biotechnology,101511065,,,,PMC5410127,2017/05/13 06:00,2017/05/13 06:01,['2017/05/13 06:00'],"['2017/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/13 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Avicenna J Med Biotechnol. 2017 Apr-Jun;9(2):104-108.,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'Flow cytometry', 'Fluorescent in situ hybridization', 'PML-RARalpha']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its presently known ligands, programmed death ligands (PD-Ls) 1 and 2, are expressed by a variety of cells including cancer cells, suggesting a role for these molecules as an immune evasion mechanism. Blocking of the PD-1-PD-L signaling axis has recently been shown to be effective and was clinically approved in relapsed/refractory tumors such as malignant melanoma and lung cancer, but also classical Hodgkin's lymphoma. A plethora of trials exploring PD-1 blockade in cancer are ongoing. Here, we review the role of PD-1 signaling in lymphoid malignancies, and the latest results of trials investigating PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking agents in this group of diseases. Early phase studies proved very promising, leading to the clinical approval of a PD-1 blocking agent in Hodgkin's lymphoma, and Phase III clinical studies are either planned or ongoing in most lymphoid malignancies.","['Ilcus, Cristina', 'Bagacean, Cristina', 'Tempescul, Adrian', 'Popescu, Cristian', 'Parvu, Andrada', 'Cenariu, Mihai', 'Bocsan, Corina', 'Zdrenghea, Mihnea']","['Ilcus C', 'Bagacean C', 'Tempescul A', 'Popescu C', 'Parvu A', 'Cenariu M', 'Bocsan C', 'Zdrenghea M']",,"['Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Laboratory of Immunology and Immunotherapy, Brest University Medical School, CHRU Morvan.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Institute of Cancerology and Hematology, Brest, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Ion Chiricuta Oncology Institute.', 'Biotechnology Research Center, University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Ion Chiricuta Oncology Institute.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170428,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC5417656,2017/05/13 06:00,2017/05/13 06:01,['2017/05/13 06:00'],"['2017/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S133385 [doi]', 'ott-10-2349 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2017 Apr 28;10:2349-2363. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S133385. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['b7 antigens', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'hematological cancer', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'lymphoma', 'programmed cell death 1']",['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is therefore important that therapeutic decisions are made based on an understanding of the CLL clonal architecture and its dynamics in individual patients. Identification of cytogenetic abnormalities by FISH remains the cornerstone of contemporary clinical practice and provides a simple means for prognostic stratification. Here, we demonstrate that multiplexed-FISH can enhance recognition of CLL subclonal repertoire and its dynamics during disease progression, both in patients and CLL patient-derived xenografts (PDX). We applied a combination of patient-specific FISH probes to 24 CLL cases before treatment and at relapse, and determined putative ancestral relationships between subpopulations with different cytogenetic features. We subsequently established 7 CLL PDX models in NOD/Shi-SCID/IL-2Rgammactm1sug/Jic (NOG) mice. Application of multiplexed-FISH to these models demonstrated that all of the identified cytogenetic subpopulations had leukemia propagating activity and that changes in their representation during disease progression could be spontaneous, accelerated by treatment or treatment-induced. We conclude that multiplexed-FISH in combination with PDX models have the potential to distinguish between spontaneous and treatment-induced clonal selection, and therefore provide a valuable tool for the pre-clinical evaluation of novel therapies.","['Davies, Nicholas J', 'Kwok, Marwan', 'Gould, Clive', 'Oldreive, Ceri E', 'Mao, Jingwen', 'Parry, Helen', 'Smith, Edward', 'Agathanggelou, Angelo', 'Pratt, Guy', 'Taylor, Alexander Malcolm R', 'Moss, Paul', 'Griffiths, Mike', 'Stankovic, Tatjana']","['Davies NJ', 'Kwok M', 'Gould C', 'Oldreive CE', 'Mao J', 'Parry H', 'Smith E', 'Agathanggelou A', 'Pratt G', 'Taylor AMR', 'Moss P', 'Griffiths M', 'Stankovic T']",,"['Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', ""West Midlands Regional Genetics Laboratory, Birmingham Women's NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK."", 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', ""West Midlands Regional Genetics Laboratory, Birmingham Women's NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK."", 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,IM,"['Animals', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clonal Evolution/*genetics', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Prognosis', 'Single-Cell Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC5546515,2017/05/13 06:00,2018/03/30 06:00,['2017/05/13 06:00'],"['2017/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/30 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['17432 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.17432 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jul 4;8(27):44749-44760. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.17432.,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'clonal evolution', 'cytogenetics', 'multiplexed-FISH', 'xenograft']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine whether the morphological features of bone marrow might aid in the differential diagnosis of these two entities, we studied a total of 139 patients with a diagnosis of chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified (n=17) or idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (n=122). As a group, abnormal bone marrow morphological features, resembling myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative neoplasm or myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, were identified in 40/139 (27%) patients: 16 (94%) of those with chronic eosinophilic leukemia and 24 (20%) of those with hypereosinophilic syndrome. Abnormal bone marrow correlated with older age (P<0.001), constitutional symptoms (P<0.001), anemia (P=0.041), abnormal platelet count (P=0.002), organomegaly (P=0.008), elevated lactate dehydrogenase concentration (P=0.005), abnormal karyotype (P<0.001), as well as the presence of myeloid neoplasm-related mutations (P<0.001). Patients with abnormal bone marrow had shorter survival (48.1 months versus not reached, P<0.001), a finding which was independent of other confounding factors (P<0.001). The association between abnormal bone marrow and shorter survival was also observed in hypereosinophilic syndrome patients alone. In summary, most patients with chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified and a proportion of those with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome show abnormal bone marrow features similar to the ones encountered in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm or BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm. Among patients who are currently considered to have idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome, abnormal bone marrow is a strong indicator of clonal hematopoiesis. Similar to other myeloid neoplasms, bone marrow morphology should be one of the major criteria to distinguish patients with chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified or clonal hypereosinophilic syndrome from those with truly reactive idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome.","['Wang, Sa A', 'Hasserjian, Robert P', 'Tam, Wayne', 'Tsai, Albert G', 'Geyer, Julia T', 'George, Tracy I', 'Foucar, Kathryn', 'Rogers, Heesun J', 'Hsi, Eric D', 'Rea, Bryan A', 'Bagg, Adam', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', 'Arber, Daniel A', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Orazi, Attilio']","['Wang SA', 'Hasserjian RP', 'Tam W', 'Tsai AG', 'Geyer JT', 'George TI', 'Foucar K', 'Rogers HJ', 'Hsi ED', 'Rea BA', 'Bagg A', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Arber DA', 'Verstovsek S', 'Orazi A']",,"['Department of Hematopathology, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA swang5@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, OH, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170511,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['Pdgfra-Associated Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*diagnosis', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders', 'Young Adult']",PMC5541870,2017/05/13 06:00,2018/06/26 06:00,['2017/05/13 06:00'],"['2017/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.165340 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.165340 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2017 Aug;102(8):1352-1360. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.165340.

Whereas previous studies have mostly focused on the mechanisms underlying how USP7 directly controls p53 stability, we recently showed that USP7 modulates the stability of the DNA damage responsive E3 ubiquitin ligase RAD18. This suggests that targeting USP7 may have therapeutic potential even in tumors with defective p53 or ibrutinib resistance. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of USP7 inhibition in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) where the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-p53 pathway is inactivated with relatively high frequency, leading to treatment resistance and poor clinical outcome. We demonstrate that USP7 is upregulated in CLL cells, and its loss or inhibition disrupts homologous recombination repair (HRR). Consequently, USP7 inhibition induces significant tumor-cell killing independently of ATM and p53 through the accumulation of genotoxic levels of DNA damage. Moreover, USP7 inhibition sensitized p53-defective, chemotherapy-resistant CLL cells to clinically achievable doses of HRR-inducing chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and in vivo in a murine xenograft model. Together, these results identify USP7 as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of hematological malignancies with DDR defects, where ATM/p53-dependent apoptosis is compromised.","['Agathanggelou, Angelo', 'Smith, Edward', 'Davies, Nicholas J', 'Kwok, Marwan', 'Zlatanou, Anastasia', 'Oldreive, Ceri E', 'Mao, Jingwen', 'Da Costa, David', 'Yadollahi, Sina', 'Perry, Tracey', 'Kearns, Pamela', 'Skowronska, Anna', 'Yates, Elliot', 'Parry, Helen', 'Hillmen, Peter', 'Reverdy, Celine', 'Delansorne, Remi', 'Paneesha, Shankara', 'Pratt, Guy', 'Moss, Paul', 'Taylor, A Malcolm R', 'Stewart, Grant S', 'Stankovic, Tatjana']","['Agathanggelou A', 'Smith E', 'Davies NJ', 'Kwok M', 'Zlatanou A', 'Oldreive CE', 'Mao J', 'Da Costa D', 'Yadollahi S', 'Perry T', 'Kearns P', 'Skowronska A', 'Yates E', 'Parry H', 'Hillmen P', 'Reverdy C', 'Delansorne R', 'Paneesha S', 'Pratt G', 'Moss P', 'Taylor AMR', 'Stewart GS', 'Stankovic T']",,"['Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Section of Experimental Haematology, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom.', 'Hybrigenics Services, Paris, France;

CD27 signaling provides costimulatory signals to cytotoxic T cells but also increases the frequency of regulatory T cells. Similar to other TNFR ligands, CD70 has been shown to initiate intracellular signaling pathways (CD70 reverse signaling). CD27 is expressed on a majority of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but its role in the immune control of lymphoma and leukemia is unknown. We therefore generated a cytoplasmic deletion mutant of CD27 (CD27-trunc) to study the role of CD70 reverse signaling in the immunosurveillance of B-cell malignancies in vivo. Expression of CD27-trunc on malignant cells increased the number of tumor-infiltrating interferon gamma-producing natural killer (NK) cells. In contrast, the antitumoral T-cell response remained largely unchanged. CD70 reverse signaling in NK cells was mediated via the AKT signaling pathway and increased NK cell survival and effector function. The improved immune control by activated NK cells prolonged survival of CD27-trunc-expressing lymphoma-bearing mice. Finally, CD70 reverse signaling enhanced survival and effector function of human NK cells in a B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenotransplants model. Therefore, CD70 reverse signaling in NK cells contributes to the immune control of CD27-expressing B-cell lymphoma and leukemia.","['Al Sayed, Mohamad F', 'Ruckstuhl, Carla A', 'Hilmenyuk, Tamara', 'Claus, Christina', 'Bourquin, Jean-Pierre', 'Bornhauser, Beat C', 'Radpour, Ramin', 'Riether, Carsten', 'Ochsenbein, Adrian F']","['Al Sayed MF', 'Ruckstuhl CA', 'Hilmenyuk T', 'Claus C', 'Bourquin JP', 'Bornhauser BC', 'Radpour R', 'Riether C', 'Ochsenbein AF']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4120-9057', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6571-6227', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2890-3191', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5632-7833', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7512-513X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1773-5436']","['Tumor Immunology, Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Tumor Immunology, Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Tumor Immunology, Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Tumor Immunology, Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Center, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; and."", ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Center, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; and."", 'Tumor Immunology, Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Tumor Immunology, Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Inselspital, University Hospital and University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Tumor Immunology, Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Inselspital, University Hospital and University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170511,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD27 Ligand)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'CD27 Ligand/genetics/*immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology/pathology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/deficiency/genetics/*immunology']",,2017/05/13 06:00,2017/08/17 06:00,['2017/05/13 06:00'],"['2016/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33187-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-12-756585 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Jul 20;130(3):297-309. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-12-756585.

In an effort to improve these outcomes, patients with persistent CLL who were 90 to 100 days beyond alloSCT with no evidence of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) were randomized to receive lenalidomide or standard care (withdrawal of immunosuppression followed by donor lymphocyte infusion). Lenalidomide was initiated at 5 mg every other day and increased to 10 mg daily, if tolerated, in each patient. Of 38 patients enrolled, 17 (45%) met the eligibility criteria for randomization. Of these 17 patients, 8 were randomized to undergo lenalidomide therapy. Five (62%) patients had to stop taking the drug because of toxicity. The main reason for drug discontinuation was acute GVHD in 43% of patients. This incidence was 11% in the patients who were randomized to not receive lenalidomide. With a median follow-up of 2.6 years, the median survival was 3.4 years for those receiving lenalidomide. This was not reached in patients randomized to not receive lenalidomide and in patients in complete remission who were not randomized. These results suggested that treatments other than lenalidomide are needed for persistent CLL after alloSCT.","['Khouri, Maria R', 'Jabbour, Elias J', 'Gulbis, Alison M', 'Turturro, Francesco', 'Ledesma, Celina', 'Korbling, Martin', 'Samuels, Barry I', 'Ahmed, Sairah', 'Alousi, Amin M', 'Ciurea, Stefan O', 'Marin, David', 'Patel, Krina K', 'Popat, Uday R', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', 'Bassett, Roland L Jr', 'Khouri, Issa F']","['Khouri MR', 'Jabbour EJ', 'Gulbis AM', 'Turturro F', 'Ledesma C', 'Korbling M', 'Samuels BI', 'Ahmed S', 'Alousi AM', 'Ciurea SO', 'Marin D', 'Patel KK', 'Popat UR', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Bassett RL Jr', 'Khouri IF']",,"['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Pharmacy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Diagnostic Radiology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.

Here, we compared three strategies aimed at enhancing the efficiency of the CRISPR-mediated t(11;22) translocation in human stem cells, including mesenchymal and induced pluripotent stem cells: (1) using end-joining DNA processing factors involved in repair mechanisms, or (2) ssODNs to guide the ligation of the double-strand break ends generated by CRISPR/Cas9; and (3) all-in-one plasmid or ribonucleoprotein complex-based approaches. We report that the generation of targeted t(11;22) is significantly increased by using a combination of ribonucleoprotein complexes and ssODNs.

Many novel targeted drugs have been developed based on a better molecular understanding of B-NHL. Areas covered: This article focuses on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as a representative for indolent lymphomas and paradigmatic for the tremendous progress in treating B-NHL on the one hand and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) as a representative for aggressive lymphomas and paradigmatic for many unsolved problems in lymphoma treatment or the other hand. We highlight salient points in current therapies targeting genetic, epigenetic, immunological and microenvironmental alterations. Possible reasons for drug failure in clinical trials like tumor heterogeneity, clonal evolution and drug resistance mechanisms are discussed. Based thereon, some perspectives for further drug discovery are given. Expert opinion: In view of the pathogenetic complexity of lymphomas, therapies targeting exclusively a single alteration may fail because resistance mechanisms are present either initially or evolve during treatment. Therefore, future therapies in B-NHL may have to target the greatest possible number of genetic, immunological or epigenetic alterations still allowing tolerability and to monitor these alterations during therapy.","['Kubuschok, Boris', 'Trepel, Martin']","['Kubuschok B', 'Trepel M']",,"['a Department of Internal Medicine II , Klinikum Augsburg , Augsburg , Germany.', 'b Department of Hematology and Oncology , University of Saarland Medical School , Homburg , Germany.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine II , Klinikum Augsburg , Augsburg , Germany.', 'c Department of Oncology and Hematology , University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf , Hamburg , Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170607,England,Expert Opin Drug Discov,Expert opinion on drug discovery,101295755,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Discovery/methods', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy']",,2017/05/13 06:00,2017/07/01 06:00,['2017/05/13 06:00'],"['2017/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17460441.2017.1329293 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Discov. 2017 Jul;12(7):733-745. doi: 10.1080/17460441.2017.1329293.

The complete remission (CR) rate was 51%, and 15 (45%) responders underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in CR. High leukemia burden (bone marrow blasts >50%) (P = .02), history of prior EM-ALL (P = .005), and active EM-ALL at the time of initiating blinatumomab (P = .05) predicted lower CR rate. Among refractory cases, 13 (41%) had evidence of EM-ALL progression, and CD19 expression was negative or dim in 18% and 23%, respectively. Among responders, 20 (61%) subsequently relapsed among whom EM-ALL relapse occurred in 8 (40%) patients, and CD19 expression was negative or dim in 35 and 6% of evaluable cases, respectively. Pretreatment moderate/strong CD19 expression (P = .01) and history of prior EM-ALL during ALL course (P = .04) were risk factors for developing EM-ALL at progression/relapse. However, no pretreatment factors predicted progression/relapse with CD19-negative ALL. Overall-survival (OS) and even-free survival were improved for patients underwent allogeneic HCT compared to responders who did not. Furthermore, OS was superior for patients responded to blinatumomab compared to those who did not. Extramedullary and CD19-negative disease are common during blinatumomab failure in r/r ALL. In addition to high leukemia burden, concurrent or prior history EM-ALL were associated with lower response to blinatumomab. Higher CD19 expression as well as prior history of EM-ALL were associated with EM-ALL at the time of blinatumomab failure.","['Aldoss, Ibrahim', 'Song, Joo', 'Stiller, Tracey', 'Nguyen, Tina', 'Palmer, Joycelynne', ""O'Donnell, Margaret"", 'Stein, Anthony S', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Forman, Stephen', 'Pullarkat, Vinod']","['Aldoss I', 'Song J', 'Stiller T', 'Nguyen T', 'Palmer J', ""O'Donnell M"", 'Stein AS', 'Marcucci G', 'Forman S', 'Pullarkat V']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9129-3424'],"['Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Information Sciences, Division of Biostatistics, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Pathology, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Pharmacy, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Pathology, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.']",['eng'],['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20170605,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD19 molecule, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/*administration & dosage', 'Antigens, CD19/blood', 'Blast Crisis/blood/*mortality/*therapy', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*mortality/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,2017/05/12 06:00,2017/08/10 06:00,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2017/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24783 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 Sep;92(9):858-865. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24783.

Despite a favorable prognosis, disease relapse remains the single cause of treatment failure in CBF-AML. Fusion products of these translocations recruit epigenetic silencing complexes resulting in hematopoietic maturation arrest. We hypothesized that maintenance therapy with hypomethylating agents (HMA), including decitabine (DAC) and azacitidine (AZA) after induction/consolidation, can be used for MRD elimination to ultimately prolong relapse free survival. Real-time quantitative (RTPCR) trends were reviewed in 23 patients (median age 53 years) with CBF-AML that received HMA therapy following induction/consolidation with fludarabine, cytarabine, and G-CSF (FLAG) with low dose gemtuzumab or idarubicin (NCT00801489). Of the 23 patients evaluated, 17 had a detectable RTPCR at HMA initiation. Five patients had progressive disease and a notable increase in RTPCR values over 1-2 cycles of HMA therapy. Twelve patients did not fail HMA and had a median RTPCR at HMA initiation of 0.06 (range, 0.01-0.91). Unlike the HMA failure subset, 11 of these patients had a reduction in RTPCR after the first or second cycle of HMA. Our data suggests that CBF-AML patients with low levels of RTPCR (between 0.01 and 0.05) at the conclusion of induction/consolidation chemotherapy benefit most from maintenance HMA, particularly those that have a reduction in the RTPCR within the first two cycles of HMA therapy.","['Ragon, Brittany Knick', 'Daver, Naval', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Oran, Betul', 'Ohanian, Maro', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Borthakur, Gautam']","['Ragon BK', 'Daver N', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Ravandi F', 'Cortes J', 'Kadia T', 'Oran B', 'Ohanian M', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Borthakur G']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2460-0698', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1670-6513', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1908-3307']","['Hematology/Oncology Fellowship, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20170609,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aminoglycosides/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'Decitabine', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Survival Rate', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",PMC5779853,2017/05/12 06:00,2017/08/10 06:00,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2016/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/11 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24782 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 Sep;92(9):845-850. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24782.

QT prolongation, torsades de pointes and sudden cardiac death have been implicated in the As2O3 therapy. So eugenol is a monoterpene compound is well known for its antioxidant properties and protective effect on the cardiovascular system. OBJECTIVE: In this study, the cardioprotective effect of eugenol on cardiac electrical conductivity, tissue electrolytes, myocardial markers, antioxidant system, lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide production was investigated in male Wistar rats treated with arsenic trioxide. RESULTS: The Inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopic (ICP-OES) analysis pointed out the accumulation of arsenic in heart tissue. The rats administered with arsenic trioxide (4mg/kg body wt) exhibited myocardial damage that was manifested by the elevation of cardiac markers (LDH, CK-MB) enzymes and deterioration in the antioxidant enzymes (GSH, GST, GPx). Combination treatment with eugenol (5mg/kg of body wt) upholds the tissue antioxidant level, Na(+)/K(+) - ATPase and Ca(2+-) ATPase activity and brings the cytosolic Ca(2+,) K(+) and Na (+) levels near to normal value. Conjoined therapy with eugenol ameliorated the membrane peroxidation, restored the normal heart rate and rectified the prolongation of QT interval in the electrocardiogram. Histological examination of cardiac segments also supported the beneficial role of eugenol against arsenic-induced oxidative damages. CONCLUSION: Our in vivo experimental findings suggest that monoterpenoid eugenol could be a potent and novel cytoprotective agent of clinical application against As2O3 induced cardiotoxicity.","['Binu, Prakash', 'Priya, Nellikunnath', 'Abhilash, Surendran', 'Vineetha, Radhakrishnan Chandraprabha', 'Nair, Raveendran Harikumaran']","['Binu P', 'Priya N', 'Abhilash S', 'Vineetha RC', 'Nair RH']",,"['Physiology Research Laboratory, School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kerala 686 560, India.', 'Physiology Research Laboratory, School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kerala 686 560, India.', 'Physiology Research Laboratory, School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kerala 686 560, India.', 'Physiology Research Laboratory, School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kerala 686 560, India.', 'Physiology Research Laboratory, School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kerala 686 560, India.

METHODS: Multicentre longitudinal qualitative study, with 67 UK parents of children (aged 1-12 years) receiving treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Analyses drew on the wider sample but focussed on 50 semistructured interviews with 20 parents and were informed by constant comparison. RESULTS: All 20 parents described problems with clinical care such as inadequate information or mistakes by staff but varied in how much the problems threatened their sense of relationship with clinicians. Some parents saw the problems as having no relevance to the parent-clinician relationship. Others saw the problems as threats to the clinical relationship but worked to ""contain"" the threat in ways that preserved a trusting relationship with at least one senior clinician. Parents' containment work protected the security they needed from the parent-clinician relationship, but containment was a tenuous process for some. A few parents were unable to contain the problems at all; lacking trust in clinicians, these parents suffered considerably. CONCLUSIONS: Given the complexity of childhood cancer care, problems with clinical care are inevitable. By engaging in containment work, parents met their needs to feel secure in the face of these problems, but the extent to which parents should have to do this work is debatable. Parents could benefit from support to seek help when problems arise which threaten their trust in clinicians. Attachment theory can guide clinicians in giving this support.","['Davies, Sarah', 'Salmon, Peter', 'Young, Bridget']","['Davies S', 'Salmon P', 'Young B']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6041-9901'],"['Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],['C19412/A6913/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],['Journal Article'],20170608,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Attitude to Health', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Family Relations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/psychology/*therapy', '*Professional-Family Relations', 'Qualitative Research', '*Trust']",PMC5600008,2017/05/12 06:00,2018/03/31 06:00,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2016/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/06 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/31 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pon.4454 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2017 Sep;26(9):1301-1306. doi: 10.1002/pon.4454.

Assessing the association of MRD status following induction therapy in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with relapse and mortality may improve the efficiency of clinical trials and accelerate drug development. Objective: To quantify the relationships between event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) with MRD status in pediatric and adult ALL using publications of clinical trials and other databases. Data Sources: Clinical studies in ALL identified via searches of PubMed, MEDLINE, and clinicaltrials.gov. Study Selection: Our search and study screening process adhered to the PRISMA Guidelines. Studies that addressed EFS or OS by MRD status in patients with ALL were included; reviews, abstracts, and studies with fewer than 30 patients or insufficient MRD description were excluded. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Study sample size, patient age, follow-up time, timing of MRD assessment (postinduction or consolidation), MRD detection method, phenotype/genotype (B cell, T cell, Philadelphia chromosome), and EFS and OS. Searches of PubMed and MEDLINE identified 566 articles. A parallel search on clinicaltrials.gov found 67 closed trials and 62 open trials as of 2014. Merging results of 2 independent searches and applying exclusions gave 39 publications in 3 arms of patient populations (adult, pediatric, and mixed). We performed separate meta-analyses for each of these 3 subpopulations. Results: The 39 publications comprised 13637 patients: 16 adult studies (2076 patients), 20 pediatric (11249 patients), and 3 mixed (312 patients). The EFS hazard ratio (HR) for achieving MRD negativity is 0.23 (95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI] 0.18-0.28) for pediatric patients and 0.28 (95% BCI, 0.24-0.33) for adults. The respective HRs in OS are 0.28 (95% BCI, 0.19-0.41) and 0.28 (95% BCI, 0.20-0.39). The effect was similar across all subgroups and covariates. Conclusions and Relevance: The value of having achieved MRD negativity is substantial in both pediatric and adult patients with ALL. These results are consistent across therapies, methods of and times of MRD assessment, cutoff levels, and disease subtypes. Minimal residual disease status warrants consideration as an early measure of disease response for evaluating new therapies, improving the efficiency of clinical trials, accelerating drug development, and for regulatory approval. A caveat is that an accelerated approval of a particular new drug using an intermediate end point, such as MRD, would require confirmation using traditional efficacy end points.","['Berry, Donald A', 'Zhou, Shouhao', 'Higley, Howard', 'Mukundan, Lata', 'Fu, Shuangshuang', 'Reaman, Gregory H', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Kelloff, Gary J', 'Jessup, J Milburn', 'Radich, Jerald P']","['Berry DA', 'Zhou S', 'Higley H', 'Mukundan L', 'Fu S', 'Reaman GH', 'Wood BL', 'Kelloff GJ', 'Jessup JM', 'Radich JP']",,"['Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'CCS Associates, Inc.', 'CCS Associates, Inc.', 'University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston.', 'US Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, Maryland.', 'University of Washington School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.', 'US National Cancer Institute, Bethsaida, Maryland.', 'Inova Fairfax Hospital.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.']",['eng'],['UL1 TR000371/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20170713,United States,JAMA Oncol,JAMA oncology,101652861,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC5824235,2017/05/12 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2017/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['2626509 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2017.0580 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Oncol. 2017 Jul 13;3(7):e170580. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2017.0580.

Airway epithelial cells (AEC) have distinct activation profiles that can influence ICS response. OBJECTIVES: A pilot study to identify gene expression markers of AEC dysfunction and markers of corticosteroid sensitivity in asthmatic and non-asthmatic control children, for comparison with published reports in adults. METHODS: AEC were obtained by nasal brushings and primary submerged cultures, and incubated in control conditions or in the presence of 10 ng/ml TNFalpha, 10-8M dexamethasone, or both. RT-PCR-based expression of FKBP51 (a steroid hormone receptor signalling regulator), NF-kB, IL-6, LIF (an IL-6 family neurotrophic cytokine), serpinB2 (which inhibits plasminogen activation and promotes fibrin deposition) and porin (a marker of mitochondrial mass) were determined. RESULTS: 6 patients without asthma (median age 11yr; min-max: 7-13), 8 with controlled asthma (11yr, 7-13; median daily fluticasone dose = 100 mug), and 4 with uncontrolled asthma (12yr, 7-14; 1000 mug fluticasone daily) were included. Baseline expression of LIF mRNA was significantly increased in uncontrolled vs controlled asthmatic children. TNFalpha significantly increased LIF expression in uncontrolled asthma.

The importance of TBK1 in antiviral immunity is well established in mammal models, but in chicken, the molecular characterization and potential function of TBK1 remain unclear. In the present study, the open-reading frame (ORF) of chicken TBK1 (chTBK1) was cloned and characterized. The sequencing results revealed that the chTBK1 ORF consists of 2190 base pairs (bp) encoding a deduced protein of 729 amino acid residues. Multiple sequence alignment analysis demonstrated chTBK1 similarity to other birds and mammals, which indicates that it is evolutionarily conserved. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) results showed that chTBK1 was ubiquitously expressed in chicken tissues and expression was especially high in immune tissues. In addition, the expression of chTBK1 was significantly up-regulated by infection with avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) both in vivo and in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) challenged with ALV-J or stimulated with poly I:C in vitro. Consistent with the activation of chTBK1, the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and IFNbeta gene in CEFs were also up-regulated after challenge with ALV-J or polyI:C. In contrast, the expression of IRF3 and IFNbeta in CEFs was significantly reduced by siRNA targeting the chTBK1 gene compared with a negative control (NC) during ALV-J infection or polyI:C transfection. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that chTBK1 may be an important immunoregulator for IRF3 and IFNbeta induction in response to viral stimulation in chicken.","['Wang, Yan', 'Yin, Yue', 'Lan, Xi', 'Ye, Fei', 'Tian, Kai', 'Zhao, Xiaoling', 'Yin, Huadong', 'Li, Diyan', 'Xu, Hengyong', 'Liu, Yiping', 'Zhu, Qing']","['Wang Y', 'Yin Y', 'Lan X', 'Ye F', 'Tian K', 'Zhao X', 'Yin H', 'Li D', 'Xu H', 'Liu Y', 'Zhu Q']",,"['Farm Animal Genetic Resources Exploration and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China.', ""Institute of Laboratory Animal of Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Chengdu, China."", 'Farm Animal Genetic Resources Exploration and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China.', 'Farm Animal Genetic Resources Exploration and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China.', 'Farm Animal Genetic Resources Exploration and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China.', 'Farm Animal Genetic Resources Exploration and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China.', 'Farm Animal Genetic Resources Exploration and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China.', 'Farm Animal Genetic Resources Exploration and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China.', 'Farm Animal Genetic Resources Exploration and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China.', 'Farm Animal Genetic Resources Exploration and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China.', 'Farm Animal Genetic Resources Exploration and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170511,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-3)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/genetics/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens/*genetics/virology', 'Computational Biology', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interferon-beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Phylogeny', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics']",PMC5426785,2017/05/12 06:00,2017/09/12 06:00,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2017/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0177608 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-06167 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 May 11;12(5):e0177608. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0177608. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) has been proposed as an alternative receptor for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. In this study, we examined the expression of DC-SIGN on DCs as well as on acute monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1. High doses of recombinant or human MBL inhibited binding of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 to both these cell types in the presence of complement derived from bovine serum. Further, anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibody inhibited binding of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 to both DC-SIGN-expressing DCs and THP-1 cells. This study demonstrates that high doses of MBL can inhibit binding of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus to DC-SIGN-expressing cells in the presence of complement.

Familial acute myelogenous leukemia related factor (FAMLF; GenBank accession No. EF413001.1) is a novel gene that was cloned by our research group, and miR-181b is located in the intron of the FAMLF gene. To verify the role of miR-181b and FAMLF in BL, RNAhybrid software was used to predict target site of miR-181b on FAMLF and real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) was used to detect expression of miR-181b and FAMLF in BL patients, Raji cells and unaffected individuals. miR-181b was then transfected into Raji and CA46 cell lines and FAMLF expression was examined by RQ-PCR and western blotting. Further, Raji cells viability and proliferation were detected by MTT and clone formation, and Raji cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. The results showed that miR-181b can bind to bases 21-42 of the FAMLF 5' untranslated region (UTR), FAMLF was highly expressed and miR-181b was lowly expressed in BL patients compared with unaffected individuals. FAMLF expression was significantly and inversely correlated to miR-181b expression, and miR-181b negatively regulated FAMLF at posttranscriptional and translational levels. A dual-luciferase reporter gene assay identified that the 5' UTR of FAMLF mRNA contained putative binding sites for miR-181b. Down-regulation of FAMLF by miR-181b arrested cell cycle, inhibited cell viability and proliferation in a BL cell line model. Our findings explain a new mechanism of BL pathogenesis and may also have implications in the therapy of FAMLF-overexpressing BL.","['Li, J G', 'Ding, Y', 'Huang, Y M', 'Chen, W L', 'Pan, L L', 'Li, Y', 'Chen, X L', 'Chen, Y', 'Wang, S Y', 'Wu, X N']","['Li JG', 'Ding Y', 'Huang YM', 'Chen WL', 'Pan LL', 'Li Y', 'Chen XL', 'Chen Y', 'Wang SY', 'Wu XN']",,"['Department of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Union Clinical Medical College, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Union Clinical Medical College, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Union Clinical Medical College, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Union Clinical Medical College, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Union Clinical Medical College, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'School of Public Health, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170504,Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,"['0 (MIrn181 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mir181A1HG, human)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",PMC5441277,2017/05/12 06:00,2017/09/26 06:00,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2016/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0100-879X2017000600701 [pii]', '10.1590/1414-431X20175661 [doi]']",epublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2017 May 4;50(6):e5661. doi: 10.1590/1414-431X20175661.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, none of these agents can achieve nonhomogenous subcellular distribution of PLSCR1. We have demonstrated that wogonoside possesses differentiation and anti-leukemic effects in AML cell lines by promoting PLSCR1 trafficking into nucleus. Here we report that wogonoside promotes the expression of PLSCR1 and enhances its nuclear translocation and binding to the 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate receptor 1 (IP3R1) promoter in AML patient-derived primary cells. Wogonoside activates IP3R1, in turn, promotes release of Ca(2+) from endoplasmic reticulum, and eventually leads to cell differentiation. Our in vivo study further confirms that wogonoside can promote PLSCR1 and IP3R1 expression in primary AML cells and reduce the AML cell counts in engrafted nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice. Taken together, our findings provide new insight into the mechanism of wogonoside-induced differentiation and anti-leukemic effect on primary AML cells, suggesting the therapeutic potential of wogonoside for AML, especially for non-APL AML.","['Li, Hui', 'Xu, Jingyan', 'Zhou, Yuxin', 'Liu, Xiao', 'Shen, L E', 'Zhu, Y U', 'Li, Zhiyu', 'Wang, Xiaotang', 'Guo, Qinglong', 'Hui, Hui']","['Li H', 'Xu J', 'Zhou Y', 'Liu X', 'Shen LE', 'Zhu YU', 'Li Z', 'Wang X', 'Guo Q', 'Hui H']",,"[""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated DrumTower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA.', ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170511,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Glucosides)', '0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PLSCR1 protein, human)', '0 (Phospholipid Transfer Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ETX4944Z3R (wogonoside)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects/genetics', 'Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Flavanones/*pharmacology', 'Glucosides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phospholipid Transfer Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC5520700,2017/05/12 06:00,2018/02/17 06:00,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2016/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/09 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/17 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2017175 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2017.175 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2017 May 11;8(5):e2768. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2017.175.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, ~10-15% of APL patients are not cured by ATRA- and ATO-based therapies, and a potential failure of ATRA and ATO in completely reversing PML/RARalpha-driven oncogenic alterations has not been comprehensively examined. Here we characterized the in vivo primary responses of dysregulated genes in APL cells treated with ATRA and ATO using a GFP-labeled APL model. Although induced granulocytic differentiation of APL cells was evident after ATRA or ATO administration, the expression of the majority of dysregulated genes in the c-Kit(+) APL progenitors was not consistently corrected. Irf8, whose expression increased along with spontaneous differentiation of the APL progenitors in vivo, represented such a PML/RARalpha-dysregulated gene that was refractory to ATRA/ATO signaling. Interestingly, Irf8 induction, but not its knockdown, decreased APL leukemogenic potential through driving monocytic maturation. Thus, we reveal that certain PML/RARalpha-dysregulated genes that are refractory to ATRA/ATO signaling are potentially crucial regulators of the immature status and leukemogenic potential of APL cells, which can be exploited for the development of new therapeutic strategies for ATRA/ATO-resistant APL cases.","['Liu, XiangZhen', 'Chen, Juan', 'Yu, ShanHe', 'Yan, Li', 'Guo, HeZhou', 'Dai, JianMin', 'Zhang, Wu', 'Zhu, Jiang']","['Liu X', 'Chen J', 'Yu S', 'Yan L', 'Guo H', 'Dai J', 'Zhang W', 'Zhu J']",,"['State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology and Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology and Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology and Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology and Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology and Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology and Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology and Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology and Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170511,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Monocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",PMC5520717,2017/05/12 06:00,2018/02/17 06:00,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2017/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/17 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2017197 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2017.197 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2017 May 11;8(5):e2782. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2017.197.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In preclinical studies, venetoclax bound to BCL-2 with high affinity and rapidly induced apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. In early-phase clinical trials in CLL, venetoclax treatment led to tumor lysis syndrome in some patients with a large tumor burden, but this risk was subsequently mitigated by a revised study design that included lower initial dosing with intrapatient dose ramp up and close tumor lysis syndrome monitoring and prophylaxis. Other toxicities, such as neutropenia and gastrointestinal adverse events, were manageable. Venetoclax monotherapy resulted in durable and deep responses in patients with relapsed, refractory CLL, including for those with deletion 17p, leading to the approval of venetoclax by the US FDA for relapsed or refractory deletion 17p CLL, and recently to additional approvals in Europe and Canada. Trials also suggest that venetoclax induces deeper and more durable responses when used in combination with rituximab, and combination studies with other agents are ongoing. Phase III trials are also underway, and will provide data on the efficacy and safety of venetoclax in combination with monoclonal antibodies and targeted therapies in larger patient populations.","['Crombie, Jennifer', 'Davids, Matthew S']","['Crombie J', 'Davids MS']",,"['Write Affiliation text here.

Compared to NPs that are not activated by light exposure, these NPs more efficiently reduce the clonogenicity of bone marrow cancer cells from patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and induce the differentiation of RA-low sensitive leukaemia cells. Importantly, we show that leukaemia cells transfected with light-inducible NPs containing RA can engraft into bone marrow in vivo in the proximity of other leukaemic cells, differentiate upon exposure to blue light and release paracrine factors that modulate nearby cells.

While survival rates for ALL have improved, central nervous system (CNS) relapse remains a significant cause of treatment failure and treatment-related morbidity. Accordingly, there is a need to identify more efficacious and less toxic CNS-directed leukemia therapies. Extensive research has demonstrated a critical role of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment in leukemia development, maintenance, and chemoresistance. Moreover, therapies to disrupt mechanisms of BM microenvironment-mediated leukemia survival and chemoresistance represent new, promising approaches to cancer therapy. However, in direct contrast to the extensive knowledge of the BM microenvironment, the unique attributes of the CNS microenvironment that serve to make it a leukemia reservoir are not yet elucidated. Recent work has begun to define both the mechanisms by which leukemia cells migrate into the CNS and how components of the CNS influence leukemia biology to enhance survival, chemoresistance, and ultimately relapse. In addition to providing new insight into CNS relapse and leukemia biology, this area of investigation will potentially identify targetable mechanisms of leukemia chemoresistance and self-renewal unique to the CNS environment that will enhance both the durability and quality of the cure for ALL patients.","['Gossai, Nathan P', 'Gordon, Peter M']","['Gossai NP', 'Gordon PM']",,"['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170426,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,,,PMC5405081,2017/05/12 06:00,2017/05/12 06:01,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2017/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2017.00090 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2017 Apr 26;5:90. doi: 10.3389/fped.2017.00090. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'central nervous system', 'chemoresistance', 'microenvironment', 'migration', 'niche']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cat had been receiving prednisolone at 0.5 mg/kg PO q12h for recent pancreatitis and concurrent inflammation of liver and small intestines confirmed by biopsies. Clinical examination revealed pale mucous membranes with a capillary refill time of <2 s. Haematology showed severely decreased packed cell volume (16%), and increased prothrombin time (42 s), partial thromboplastin time (>120 s) and fibrinogen serum concentration (3.5 g/l). Morphological changes of thrombocytes in the absence of thrombocytopenia were also noted. In-saline agglutination test was positive. Abdominal radiographic and ultrasonographic examinations excluded the presence of organ abnormalities and peritoneal effusion. Blood biochemistry was unremarkable. Feline leukaemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus tests were negative. On the basis of these findings, immune-mediated anaemia secondary to chronic carbimazole administration was suspected. Prednisolone was increased to 2 mg/kg PO q24h and carbimazole tablets were stopped. Despite close monitoring and intensive care, the cat died the same evening of admission to the hospital. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: This report suggests that severe haemotoxicity may occur as a sequel of chronic carbimazole administration in cats.

The p27 viral core protein is produced by the virus in infected feline cells, is found in the cytoplasm in several blood cells and can be free in the serum and plasma. ELISA or particle-based immunoassay are commonly used to detect the presence of the p27 core protein in samples obtained from blood. The objective of this study was to compare the performance of several in-clinic tests: the SNAP Feline Triple Test (IDEXX Laboratories), the WITNESS FeLV-FIV Test (Zoetis) and the VetScan Feline FeLV/FIV Rapid Test (Abaxis). METHODS: The sample population (100 positive, 105 negative samples) consisted of serum and plasma samples submitted to IDEXX's worldwide reference laboratory for feline retrovirus testing. Virus isolation and reverse transcriptase PCR results were not available and so samples were judged to be positive or negative based on the results of the ViraCHEK FeLV (Zoetis) microtiter plate assay. RESULTS: The percentage of samples positive and negative for FeLV p27 antigen using the three in-clinic tests compared with the ViraCHEK method were as follows: IDEXX Feline Triple (positive 98.0%, negative 100%); Zoetis WITNESS (positive 79.0%, negative 97.1%); Abaxis VetScan (positive 73.0%, negative 97.1%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The SNAP Feline Triple Test demonstrated a high level of agreement for FeLV-positive and FeLV-negative samples when assessed in this model. Results of FeLV assays can vary among tests.","['Liu, Jiayou', ""O'Connor, Thomas"", 'Beall, Melissa', 'Chandrashekar, Ramaswamy', 'Lappin, Michael']","['Liu J', ""O'Connor T"", 'Beall M', 'Chandrashekar R', 'Lappin M']",,"['IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, ME, USA.', 'IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, ME, USA.', 'IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, ME, USA.', 'IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, ME, USA.', 'Center for Companion Animal Studies, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20161005,England,JFMS Open Rep,JFMS open reports,101672978,,,,PMC5362870,2017/05/12 06:00,2017/05/12 06:01,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2016/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2055116916667757 [doi]', '10.1177_2055116916667757 [pii]']",epublish,JFMS Open Rep. 2016 Oct 5;2(2):2055116916667757. doi: 10.1177/2055116916667757. eCollection 2016 Jul-Dec.,,,"['Conflict of interest: The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of', 'interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this', 'article: The authors JL, TO, MB and RC are employees of IDEXX Laboratories.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cohort 1 (n = 2151 for FIV, n = 2241 for FeLV) consisted of cats surrendered to a shelter on the west coast of Australia (Perth, Western Australia [WA]). Cohort 2 (n = 2083 for FIV, n = 2032 for FeLV) consisted of client-owned cats with outdoor access recruited from around Australia through participating veterinary clinics. Cohort 3 (n = 169 for FIV, n = 166 for FeLV) consisted of cats presenting to Murdoch University Veterinary Hospital for a variety of reasons. Fresh whole blood was collected and tested using a commercially available point-of-care lateral flow ELISA kit that detects p27 FeLV antigen and antibodies to FIV antigens (p15 and p24) (cohorts 1 and 2), or one of two lateral flow immunochromatography kits that detect p27 antigen and antibodies to FIV antigen (p24 and/or gp40) (cohort 3). Data recorded for cats in cohort 2 included signalment, presenting complaint and postcode, allowing investigation of risk factors for FIV or FeLV infection, as well as potential geographical 'hot spots' for infection. RESULTS: The seroprevalence of FIV was 6% (cohort 1), 15% (cohort 2) and 14% (cohort 3), while the seroprevalence of FeLV was 1%, 2% and 4% in the same respective cohorts. Risk factors for FIV infection among cats in cohort 2 included age (>3 years), sex (male), neutering status (entire males) and location (WA had a significantly higher FIV seroprevalence compared with the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales and Victoria). Risk factors for FeLV infection among cats in cohort 2 included health status ('sick') and location (WA cats were approximately three times more likely to be FeLV-infected compared with the rest of Australia). No geographical hot spots of FIV infection were identified. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Both FIV and FeLV remain important infections among Australian cats. WA has a higher seroprevalence of both feline retroviruses compared with the rest of Australia, which has been noted in previous studies. A lower neutering rate for client-owned male cats is likely responsible for the higher seroprevalence of FIV infection in WA cats, while the reason for the higher seroprevalence of FeLV in WA cats is currently unknown.","['Westman, Mark E', 'Paul, Amanda', 'Malik, Richard', 'McDonagh, Phillip', 'Ward, Michael P', 'Hall, Evelyn', 'Norris, Jacqueline M']","['Westman ME', 'Paul A', 'Malik R', 'McDonagh P', 'Ward MP', 'Hall E', 'Norris JM']",,"['Faculty of Veterinary Science, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia.', 'Murdoch University Veterinary Hospital, Murdoch University, WA 6150, Australia.', 'Centre for Veterinary Education, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia.', 'Boehringer Ingelheim, North Ryde, NSW 2113, Australia.', 'Faculty of Veterinary Science, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia.', 'Faculty of Veterinary Science, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia.', 'Faculty of Veterinary Science, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160505,England,JFMS Open Rep,JFMS open reports,101672978,,,,PMC5362860,2017/05/12 06:00,2017/05/12 06:01,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2016/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2055116916646388 [doi]', '10.1177_2055116916646388 [pii]']",epublish,JFMS Open Rep. 2016 May 5;2(1):2055116916646388. doi: 10.1177/2055116916646388. eCollection 2016 Jan-Jun.,,,"['Conflict of interest: Phillip McDonagh is Head of Regulatory Affairs (Animal', 'Health) for Boehringer Ingelheim Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Serum antibodies were used to estimate the prevalence of exposure to A phagocytophilum, Bartonella species, B burgdorferi, Ehrlichia species and FIV; serum antigens were used to assess for infection by D immitis and FeLV; and molecular assays were used to amplify nucleic acids of Anaplasma species, Bartonella species, C felis, D immitis, Ehrlichia species, FCV, FHV-1, haemoplasmas, Mycoplasma species and Rickettsia species from blood and nasal or oral swabs. RESULTS: Of the 116 cats, 63 (54.3%) had evidence of infection by Bartonella species, FeLV, FIV or a haemoplasma. Anaplasma species, Ehrlichia species or Rickettsia species DNA was not amplified from these cats. A total of 18/116 cats (15.5%) were positive for FCV RNA (six cats), Mycoplasma species DNA (six cats), FHV-1 DNA (three cats) or C felis DNA (three cats).

Poor body condition, dehydration and generalised muscle wastage were evident on general examination. Neurological examination revealed mildly depressed mental status, non-ambulatory flaccid tetraparesis and severely decreased proprioception and spinal reflexes in all four limbs. The neuroanatomical localisation was to the peripheral nervous system. Haematology, feline immunodeficiency virus/feline leukaemia virus serology, serum biochemistry, including creatine kinase and thyroxine, thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasound did not reveal significant abnormalities. Electromyography revealed fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves in axial and appendicular muscles. Decreased motor conduction velocities and compound muscle action potential amplitudes were detected in ulnar and sciatic-tibial nerves. Residual latency was increased in the sciatic-tibial nerve. Histologically, several intramuscular nerve branches were depleted of myelinated fibres and a few showed mononuclear infiltrations. Toxoplasma gondii serology titres were compatible with active toxoplasmosis. Four days after treatment initiation with oral clindamycin the cat recovered the ability to walk. T gondii serology titres and neurological examination were normal after 11 and 16 weeks, respectively. Clindamycin was discontinued after 16 weeks. One year after presentation the cat showed mild relapse of clinical signs and seroconversion, which again resolved following treatment with clindamycin. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of distal polyneuropathy associated with toxoplasmosis in a cat. This case suggests the inclusion of toxoplasmosis as a possible differential diagnosis for acquired polyneuropathies in cats.","['Mari, Lorenzo', 'Shelton, G Diane', 'De Risio, Luisa']","['Mari L', 'Shelton GD', 'De Risio L']",,"['Neurology/ Neurosurgery Service, Centre for Small Animal Studies, Animal Health Trust, Newmarket, UK.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Neurology/ Neurosurgery Service, Centre for Small Animal Studies, Animal Health Trust, Newmarket, UK.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20160210,England,JFMS Open Rep,JFMS open reports,101672978,,,,PMC5362846,2016/02/10 00:00,2016/02/10 00:01,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2016/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/10 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2055116916630335 [doi]', '10.1177_2055116916630335 [pii]']",epublish,JFMS Open Rep. 2016 Feb 10;2(1):2055116916630335. doi: 10.1177/2055116916630335. eCollection 2016 Jan-Jun.,,,"['Conflict of Interest: The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest', 'with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After anamnesis the cat was submitted to a complete clinical examination. Blood was collected for determination of haematological and biochemical parameters, detection of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline coronavirus (FCoV) and Leishmania amastigotes. Fine-needle aspiration puncture from the skin nodules was also performed. After definitive diagnosis the animal was treated and followed up over a 2 year period. The animal tested negative for FIV-specific antibodies, FeLV antigen and feline coronavirus RNA. Leishmania amastigotes in the skin nodules were confirmed by cytology and molecular diagnosis. Treatment was initiated with allopurinol, resulting in a slight clinical improvement. Thus, N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate was added and administered for 30 days, with complete closure of the ulcerative lesions in the hindlimbs requiring a surgical approach. Close monitoring of the patient in the following 24 months indicated that combined therapy was safe and clinical cure was achieved without further relapses or side effects. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: Considering the increasing number of feline leishmaniosis cases and the inconsistent results of most therapeutic protocols described in the literature, the use of new approaches, especially in refractory cases, is essential. Although the use of allopurinol and N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate is off-label in cats, in this case the combination treatment was followed by an extensive analytical monitoring, supporting their safety and effectiveness.","['Basso, Maria Alexandra', 'Marques, Catia', 'Santos, Marcos', 'Duarte, Ana', 'Pissarra, Hugo', 'Carreira, L Miguel', 'Gomes, Lidia', 'Valerio-Bolas, Ana', 'Tavares, Luis', 'Santos-Gomes, Gabriela', 'Pereira da Fonseca, Isabel']","['Basso MA', 'Marques C', 'Santos M', 'Duarte A', 'Pissarra H', 'Carreira LM', 'Gomes L', 'Valerio-Bolas A', 'Tavares L', 'Santos-Gomes G', 'Pereira da Fonseca I']",,"['Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Animal Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Animal Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Animal Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Animal Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Animal Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Animal Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Animal Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Global Health and Tropical Medicine, Institute of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, New University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Animal Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Global Health and Tropical Medicine, Institute of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, New University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Animal Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20160210,England,JFMS Open Rep,JFMS open reports,101672978,,,,PMC5362848,2016/02/10 00:00,2016/02/10 00:01,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2016/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/10 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2055116916630002 [doi]', '10.1177_2055116916630002 [pii]']",epublish,JFMS Open Rep. 2016 Feb 10;2(1):2055116916630002. doi: 10.1177/2055116916630002. eCollection 2016 Jan-Jun.,,,"['Conflict of interest: The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest', 'with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Enrichment blood culture/PCR using Bartonella alpha Proteobacteria growth medium (BAPGM) confirmed initial infection with the same Bartonella henselae genotype in all three cases. With the exception of anemia and neutropenia, complete blood counts, serum biochemical profiles and urinalysis results were within reference intervals. Also, tests for feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, Toxoplasma gondii and feline coronavirus antibodies were negative. Serial daily temperature monitoring in one case confirmed a cyclic, relapsing febrile temperature pattern during 1 month, with resolution during and after treatment with azithromycin. Bartonella henselae Western immunoblot (WB) results did not consistently correlate with BAPGM enrichment blood culture/PCR results or B henselae indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) titers, and WB titration results were not informative for establishing antibiotic treatment failure. During the respective follow-up periods, no illnesses or additional febrile episodes were reported, despite repeat documentation of B henselae bacteremia in two cats available for follow-up (one with the same genotype and the other with a different B henselae genotype); one cat was, unfortunately, killed by dogs before follow-up testing. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: We conclude that microbiological diagnosis and treatment of B henselae infection in cats can be challenging, that antibody titration results and resolution of clinical abnormalities may not correlate with a therapeutic cure, and that fever and potentially neutropenia should be differential diagnostic considerations for young cats with suspected bartonellosis.","['Breitschwerdt, Edward B', 'Broadhurst, Jack J', 'Cherry, Natalie A']","['Breitschwerdt EB', 'Broadhurst JJ', 'Cherry NA']",,"['Intracellular Pathogens Research Laboratory and the Center for Comparative Medicine and Translational Research, College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Cat Health Clinic, Pinehurst, NC, USA.', 'Galaxy Diagnostics Inc, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20150903,England,JFMS Open Rep,JFMS open reports,101672978,,,,PMC5362002,2015/09/03 00:00,2015/09/03 00:01,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2015/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/09/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/03 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2055116915600454 [doi]', '10.1177_2055116915600454 [pii]']",epublish,JFMS Open Rep. 2015 Sep 3;1(2):2055116915600454. doi: 10.1177/2055116915600454. eCollection 2015 Jul-Dec.,,,"['Conflict of interest: In conjunction with Dr Sushama Sontakke and North Carolina', 'State University, Dr Breitschwerdt holds US Patent No. 7,115,385; Media and', 'Methods for cultivation of microorganisms, which was issued 3 October 2006.

The owners' complaints were that the cat had never used the litter tray, and it did not know how to play. After reviewing the behavioural history, a problem of substrate preferences acquisition was suspected with regard to the elimination problem. During the consultation, the physical examination was unremarkable, but the neurological examination revealed a moderate and hypermetric ataxic gait, and a bilateral lack of menace response. Some degree of visual impairment was suspected. The problem was located in the central nervous system (CNS); specifically, an intracranial and multifocal problem was diagnosed. After a complete work-up (complete ophthalmological examination, complete blood count and a complete biochemistry panel, feline immunodeficiency virus/feline leukaemia virus test, thorax radiographs, abdominal ultrasound, brain magnetic resonance imaging [0.2 T], cerebrospinal fluid analysis and a urinary metabolic screen test), a degenerative CNS problem was suspected. No treatment was prescribed for the neurological problem. Regarding the problem of soiling in the house, reward-based training with a clicker was used, and the cat partially improved in a few weeks. Three months later, the cat was referred to the neurology service in status epilepticus. A symptomatic treatment was prescribed, with a mild response. After 2 years of treatment and a progressive worsening, the cat was euthanased. Necropsy revealed spongiform polioencephalomyelopathy. In order to rule out prion aetiology a PrPsc inmunohistochemistry assay was performed, and the results were negative. Congenital spongiform polioencephalomyelopathy (CSP) was diagnosed. We strongly suggest that the cat's behavioural clinical signs were caused by the CSP, causing learning impairment. To the best of our knowledge, this would be the first case in which a congenital degenerative disease affected a cat's capability to learn, leading to behavioural signs as the main complaint of the owners, even before neurological signs are detected by the owners.","['Camps, Tomas', 'de la Fuente, Cristian', 'Pumarola, Marti', 'Amat, Marta', 'Le Brech, Susana', 'Manteca, Xavier']","['Camps T', 'de la Fuente C', 'Pumarola M', 'Amat M', 'Le Brech S', 'Manteca X']",,"['Department of Animal and Food Science, School of Veterinary Science, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Animal Medicine and Surgery, School of Veterinary Science, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Animal Medicine and Surgery, School of Veterinary Science, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Animal and Food Science, School of Veterinary Science, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Animal and Food Science, School of Veterinary Science, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Animal and Food Science, School of Veterinary Science, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20150810,England,JFMS Open Rep,JFMS open reports,101672978,,,,PMC5415296,2015/08/10 00:00,2015/08/10 00:01,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2015/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/08/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/10 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2055116915599172 [doi]', '10.1177_2055116915599172 [pii]']",epublish,JFMS Open Rep. 2015 Aug 10;1(2):2055116915599172. doi: 10.1177/2055116915599172. eCollection 2015 Jul-Dec.,,,"['Conflict of interest: The authors do not have any potential conflicts of interest', 'to declare.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Samples were tested between 1996 and 2011 by the Department of Clinical Virology at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria. All samples were sent to the university as part of routine diagnostic procedures, either to determine infection in clinically symptomatic individuals or to rule out infection prior to vaccination. To allow for statistical comparison, samples analysed between 2008 and 2011 were pooled into one population (n = 444) and evaluated against samples tested in 1996 (n = 840). Furthermore, analyses of subgroups were undertaken to determine the effect of sex and age on the prevalence of FeLV antigenaemia. RESULTS: With respect to the samples tested at the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna, it was determined that the level of FeLV antigenaemia in eastern Austria between 1996 and 2011 was 5.6%. The proportion of FeLV antigenaemic cats was highly variable and has not fallen significantly over this period, despite advances in vaccination, and the education of pet owners and animal welfare charities. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study confirms the importance of continued and regular vaccination against FeLV among Austrian cats, particularly those allowed access to the outdoors. Within the remit of this retrospective study, it was not possible to follow-up results of repeat testing or of other assays (PCR) of individual cats. As a result of this, no conclusions can be drawn as to the possibility of transient antigenaemic cats or false-positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results.","['Firth, Clair L', 'Mostl, Karin']","['Firth CL', 'Mostl K']",,"['Institute of Virology, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Veterinary Public Health, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Virology, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150729,England,JFMS Open Rep,JFMS open reports,101672978,,,,PMC5362014,2015/07/29 00:00,2015/07/29 00:01,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2015/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/29 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2055116915598336 [doi]', '10.1177_2055116915598336 [pii]']",epublish,JFMS Open Rep. 2015 Jul 29;1(2):2055116915598336. doi: 10.1177/2055116915598336. eCollection 2015 Jul-Dec.,,,"['Conflict of interest: The authors do not have any potential conflicts of interest', 'to declare.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Computed tomography scan revealed soft tissue opacities inside the right tympanic bulla, with bone remodelling, and concurrent nasopharyngeal and intracranial invasion. Endoscopically guided bioptic samples were collected from the nasopharynx and middle ear. Histology revealed dense sheets of round, large, neoplastic cells, often surrounding or invading vascular walls. Neoplastic cells expressed CD3, FeLV p27 and gp70 antigens. A middle ear angiocentric/angioinvasive T-cell lymphoma was diagnosed. After improvement of clinical conditions following radiation therapy, the cat died unexpectedly. At necropsy, hepatic and splenic spread was detected. Relevance and novel information Primary middle ear tumours are rare and their diagnosis is often delayed as clinical signs mimic more common otological conditions. Multiple bioptic specimens are pivotal for a definitive diagnosis. The young age of the cat, serology and immunohistochemistry revealed a possible transforming role of FeLV.","['Santagostino, Sara F', 'Mortellaro, Carlo M', 'Buchholz, Julia', 'Lugli, Margherita', 'Forlani, Annalisa', 'Ghisleni, Gabriele', 'Roccabianca, Paola']","['Santagostino SF', 'Mortellaro CM', 'Buchholz J', 'Lugli M', 'Forlani A', 'Ghisleni G', 'Roccabianca P']",,"['Department of Veterinary Science and Public Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Veterinary Science and Public Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Animal Oncology and Imaging Center, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Veterinary Science and Public Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Veterinary Science and Public Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Veterinary Science and Public Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Veterinary Science and Public Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20150706,England,JFMS Open Rep,JFMS open reports,101672978,,,,PMC5362019,2015/07/06 00:00,2015/07/06 00:01,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2015/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/06 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2055116915593966 [doi]', '10.1177_2055116915593966 [pii]']",epublish,JFMS Open Rep. 2015 Jul 6;1(2):2055116915593966. doi: 10.1177/2055116915593966. eCollection 2015 Jul-Dec.,,,"['Conflict of interest: The authors do not have any potential conflicts of interest', 'to declare.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therapy is directed at the haematocrit (HCT) to reduce the risk of thrombotic events and usually comprises low-dose aspirin and phlebotomy to maintain HCT at >45%. Frequently in addition, cytoreductive therapy is indicated in high-risk patients for normalizing haematological parameters to mitigate the occurrence of thromboembolic events. Unfortunately, there is no clear evidence that current therapies reduce the risk of transformation to myelofibrosis and for some a risk of a therapy related complication is unknown for example leukaemia due to hydroxycarbamide (HC). First-line therapy for treating PV remains HC or interferon, the latter most often in younger patients, especially those of childbearing age. However, therapy related intolerance or resistance is a common feature and results in limited treatment options for such patients. The discovery of the JAK2 V617F mutation and consequently targeted therapy with Janus kinase inhibitors, in particular ruxolitinib, has extended the spectrum of agents that can be used as second or third line in PV. The findings of the phase II trial RESPONSE and the preliminary data from RESPONSE 2 trial have identified a role for ruxolitinib in PV patients who are resistant or intolerant to HC. In this article, using clinical cases we demonstrate our experience with ruxolitinib highlighting the clinical benefits and limitations we encountered in clinical practice.","['Alimam, Samah', 'Harrison, Claire']","['Alimam S', 'Harrison C']",,"[""Guy's and St Thomas's NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK."", ""Guy's and St Thomas's NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170401,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,,PMC5405900,2017/05/12 06:00,2017/05/12 06:01,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620717693972 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620717693972 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2017 Apr;8(4):139-151. doi: 10.1177/2040620717693972.

Here, we determined the role of miR expression in cardiomyocyte apoptosis during hypoxia and reoxygenation. The rat cardiomyocyte cell line H9c2 was incubated for 3 h in normal or hypoxia medium, followed by reoxygenation for 24 h and transfection with a miR-302 mimic or antagomir. The effect of miR-302 on myeloid leukemia cell-differentiation protein-1 (Mcl-1) expression was determined by western blot, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and luciferase reporter assays, with cell viability assays. We observed that miR-302 expression was elevated by hypoxia/reoxygenation injury and increased further or decreased by transfection of the miR-302 mimic or miR-302 antagomir, respectively. Additionally, elevated miR-302 levels increased apoptosis-related protein levels and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and luciferase reporter assays revealed miR-302 binding to the Mcl-1 mRNA 3' untranslated region. Our findings suggested that miR-302 overexpression aggravated hypoxia/reoxygenation-mediated cardiomyocyte apoptosis by inhibiting antiapoptotic Mcl-1 expression, thereby activating proapoptotic molecules. Furthermore, results indicating cardiomyocyte rescue from hypoxia/reoxygenation injury following treatment with miR-302 antagomir suggested that miR-302 inhibition might constitute a therapeutic strategy for protection against cardiomyocyte apoptosis during hypoxia/reoxygenation injury.","['Fang, Yao-Ching', 'Yeh, Chi-Hsiao']","['Fang YC', 'Yeh CH']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8850-4144'],"['Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Keelung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Keelung, Taiwan.', 'College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170411,United States,Oxid Med Cell Longev,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,101479826,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, rat)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'MicroRNAs/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*biosynthesis', 'Myocardial Reperfusion Injury/metabolism/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*metabolism/pathology', 'Rats']",PMC5405583,2017/05/12 06:00,2018/02/21 06:00,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2016/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/30 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2017/7968905 [doi]'],ppublish,Oxid Med Cell Longev. 2017;2017:7968905. doi: 10.1155/2017/7968905.

Bone marrow cytogenetics, inspite of being incorporated as mandatory tool in diagnosis are done less frequently due to limited availability of this technique in Pakistan. The aim of the study was to study baseline clinicohematological and cytogenetic characteristics of patients presenting with de novo MDS. RESULTS: A retrospective cross sectional study was done at National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan from 2010 to 2016. Total of 177 patients were included in the study having median age 51 years and male to female ratio of 3:1. Pancytopenia was observed in 80 (45%) patients and bicytopenia in 74 (42%). Mean Hb% was 7.8 +/- 2.18 g/dl, total leukocyte count (TLC) 8.8 +/- 13.6 x 10(9)/l, platelet count was 82 +/- 95.7 x 10(9)/l. Of total 170 (96%) were transfusion dependent. Refractory cytopenias with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) was the most common world health organization (WHO) category. Karyotype was done in 98 (55%) patients out of which 44 (45%) had abnormal karyotype, complex karyotype (CK) was most commonly observed in 12 (12.2%) followed by monosomy 7 in 7 (7.1%). CONCLUSIONS: We found younger median age at diagnosis, higher mean TLC and no significant history of recurrent infections. CK and monosomy 7 carry bad prognostic implications and early disease transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Monosomy 7 being associated with bad overall survival, such patients must be identified early with close clinical follow up and offered stem cell transplant. This is the largest cohort of patients of MDS evaluated for baseline clinical and cytogenetic characteristics in our country.","['Anwar, Nida', 'Arshad, Aisha', 'Nadeem, Muhammad', 'Khurram, Sana', 'Fatima, Naveena', 'Sharif, Sumaira', 'Shan, Saira', 'Shamsi, Tahir']","['Anwar N', 'Arshad A', 'Nadeem M', 'Khurram S', 'Fatima N', 'Sharif S', 'Shan S', 'Shamsi T']",,"['National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation (NIBD), St 2/A block 17 Gulshan-e-Iqbal KDA scheme 24, Karachi, Pakistan.grid.429749.5', 'National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation (NIBD), St 2/A block 17 Gulshan-e-Iqbal KDA scheme 24, Karachi, Pakistan.grid.429749.5', 'National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation (NIBD), St 2/A block 17 Gulshan-e-Iqbal KDA scheme 24, Karachi, Pakistan.grid.429749.5', 'National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation (NIBD), St 2/A block 17 Gulshan-e-Iqbal KDA scheme 24, Karachi, Pakistan.grid.429749.5', 'National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation (NIBD), St 2/A block 17 Gulshan-e-Iqbal KDA scheme 24, Karachi, Pakistan.grid.429749.5', 'National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation (NIBD), St 2/A block 17 Gulshan-e-Iqbal KDA scheme 24, Karachi, Pakistan.grid.429749.5', 'National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation (NIBD), St 2/A block 17 Gulshan-e-Iqbal KDA scheme 24, Karachi, Pakistan.grid.429749.5', 'National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation (NIBD), St 2/A block 17 Gulshan-e-Iqbal KDA scheme 24, Karachi, Pakistan.grid.429749.5']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170508,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,,,PMC5423005,2017/05/12 06:00,2017/05/12 06:01,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2017/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13039-017-0318-4 [doi]', '318 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2017 May 8;10:17. doi: 10.1186/s13039-017-0318-4. eCollection 2017.,['NOTNLM'],"['Clinicohematological characteristics', 'Cytogenetics', 'Karyotype', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
