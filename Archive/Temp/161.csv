The secretion was completely inhibited by LaCl3 and pertussis toxin. The secretion was dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and mediated through the pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. Exposing RBL-m2 cells to 100 microM CCh for 30 min in Ca2+ -free medium (desensitizing treatment) inhibited the secretion induced by the subsequent addition of 10 microM CCh plus Ca2+, but not by stimulating the high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI). Desensitizing treatment of RBL-m2 cells reduced the affinity of the lipophilic ligand [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate to m2 mAChR without a reduction of the total m2 mAChR number. The treatment also decreased the cell surface mAChR number to 14% with a slight reduction in its affinity. Desensitizing treatment of RBL-m2 cells inhibited the CCh-induced transient increase in levels of IP3 and intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The results suggested that the CCh-induced desensitization of m2 mAChR-mediated secretion is due to the receptor sequestration followed by blocking the increase in [Ca2+]i and that this desensitizing mechanism is receptor-subtype-specific.","['Oishi, Kazuhiko', 'Sakurai, Akihiro', 'Seki, Noriyasu', 'Yoshizumi, Tomokazu', 'Uchida, Masaatsu K']","['Oishi K', 'Sakurai A', 'Seki N', 'Yoshizumi T', 'Uchida MK']","['Department of Pharmacology, Meiji Pharmaceutical University, Kiyose, Tokyo, Japan. oishikz@my-pharm.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Japan,J Pharmacol Sci,Journal of pharmacological sciences,101167001,"['0 (Receptor, Muscarinic M2)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', '8Y164V895Y (Carbachol)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carbachol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Muscarinic M2/*agonists/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection/*methods', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/*metabolism']",2004/09/11 05:00,2005/03/09 09:00,['2004/09/11 05:00'],"['2004/09/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/11 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Sci. 2004 Sep;96(1):73-83. doi: 10.1254/jphs.fp0040337.

Measurement of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) in peripheral blood is a means of quantifying recent thymic T-cell production and has been used after transplantation in many studies to estimate thymus-dependent T-cell reconstitution. We hypothesized that the quality of thymic function before transplantation affects thymus-dependent T-cell reconstitution after transplantation. We used real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to quantify signal-joint TRECs (sjTRECs) before and after transplantation. T-cell reconstitution was evaluated by T-cell receptor beta (TCRbeta) CDR3 size spectratyping. We tested 77 healthy sibling donors and 244 samples from 26 pediatric recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT). Blood from the healthy donors contained 1200 to 155,000 sjTREC copies/mL blood. Patients who had greater than 1200 copies/mL blood before transplantation showed early recovery of sjTREC numbers and TCRbeta repertoire diversity. In contrast, patients who had fewer than 1200 copies/mL blood before transplantation demonstrated significantly slower restoration of thymus-dependent T cells. We conclude that the rate of reconstitution of thymus-dependent T cells is dependent on the competence of thymic function in the recipients before transplantation. Therefore, pretransplantation measurement of sjTREC may provide an important tool for predicting thymus-dependent T-cell reconstitution after transplantation.","['Chen, Xiaohua', 'Barfield, Raymond', 'Benaim, Ely', 'Leung, Wing', 'Knowles, James', 'Lawrence, Dawn', 'Otto, Mario', 'Shurtleff, Sheila A', 'Neale, Geoffrey A M', 'Behm, Frederick G', 'Turner, Victoria', 'Handgretinger, Rupert']","['Chen X', 'Barfield R', 'Benaim E', 'Leung W', 'Knowles J', 'Lawrence D', 'Otto M', 'Shurtleff SA', 'Neale GA', 'Behm FG', 'Turner V', 'Handgretinger R']","[""Division of Stem Cell Transplantation, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis TN 38105-2794, USA. xiaohua.chen@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/immunology/*therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/metabolism', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*metabolism', 'Recovery of Function/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2004/09/11 05:00,2005/02/16 09:00,['2004/09/11 05:00'],"['2004/09/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/11 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jan 15;105(2):886-93. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-04-1405.

The viral genome encodes common structural and enzymatic proteins characteristic of all retroviruses and utilizes alternative splicing and alternate codon usage to make several regulatory and accessory proteins encoded in the pX region (pX ORF I to IV). Recent studies indicate that the accessory proteins p12I, p27I, p13II, and p30II, encoded by pX ORF I and II, contribute to viral replication and the ability of the virus to maintain typical in vivo expression levels. Proviral clones that are mutated in either pX ORF I or II, while fully competent in cell culture, are severely limited in their replicative capacity in a rabbit model. These HTLV-1 accessory proteins are critical for establishment of viral infectivity, enhance T-lymphocyte activation and potentially alter gene transcription and mitochondrial function. HTLV-1 pX ORF I expression is critical to the viral infectivity in resting primary lymphocytes suggesting a role for the calcineurin-binding protein p12I in lymphocyte activation. The endoplasmic reticulum and cis-Golgi localizing p12I activates NFAT, a key T cell transcription factor, through calcium-mediated signaling pathways and may lower the threshold of lymphocyte activation via the JAK/STAT pathway. In contrast p30II localizes to the nucleus and represses viral promoter activity, but may regulate cellular gene expression through p300/CBP or related co-activators of transcription. The mitochondrial localizing p13II induces morphologic changes in the organelle and may influence energy metabolism infected cells. Future studies of the molecular details HTLV-1 ""accessory"" proteins interactions will provide important new directions for investigations of HTLV-1 and related viruses associated with lymphoproliferative diseases. Thus, the accessory proteins of HTLV-1, once thought to be dispensable for viral replication, have proven to be directly involved in viral spread in vivo and represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention against HTLV-1 infection and disease.","['Bindhu, Michael', 'Nair, Amrithraj', 'Lairmore, Michael D']","['Bindhu M', 'Nair A', 'Lairmore MD']","['Center for Retrovirus Research and Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210-1093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Front Biosci,Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,9709506,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (pX protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Codon', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Library', 'Golgi Apparatus/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/virology', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Rabbits', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins', '*Virus Replication']",2004/09/11 05:00,2006/09/29 09:00,['2004/09/11 05:00'],"['2004/09/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/11 05:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Front Biosci. 2004 Sep 1;9:2556-76. doi: 10.2741/1417.,"['1417 [pii]', '10.2741/1417 [doi]']",20040901,"['CA-70529/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-14324/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 RR014324/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-09338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",160,PMC2829751,['NIHMS94124'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, all tested compounds were found to exert a synergistic lymphoproliferative activity with concanavalin A (ConA) on splenocytes. The concentrations where the saponins were found to be cytotoxic on Jurkat cells are far below the concentration of hemolysis. These results indicate that another mechanism than membrane permeabilization formation is responsible of the cell cytotoxicity. Thus, we demonstrated that at 5 microM for AdA and at 1 microM for AdD, these compounds induce apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Early apoptotic events were detected by flow cytometry analysis by using a double annexin-V-FITC and propidium iodide staining. In addition, a disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential was observed in cells treated with AdA, AdB, and AdD. Furthermore, a DNA ladder was observed when Jurkat cells were incubated with 1 microM AdD for 24h. By comparison between the biological activities of the native compounds with the prosapogenins, we show in this work the important role of the acylation and esterification by different moieties at C-21 and C-28 of the aglycone (acacic acid) in the apoptosis-inducing capacity. Particularly, the monoterpene-quinovosyl moiety is shown to be important for the induction of apoptosis.","['Haddad, Mohamed', 'Laurens, Veronique', 'Lacaille-Dubois, Marie-Aleth']","['Haddad M', 'Laurens V', 'Lacaille-Dubois MA']","[""Laboratoire de Pharmacognosie, UMIB EA 3660, Faculte de Pharmacie, Universite de Bourgogne, 7 Boulevard Jeanne d'Arc, BP 87900, 21079 Dijon Cedex, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Saponins)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (adianthifolioside A)', '0 (adianthifolioside B)', '50647-08-0 (prosapogenin)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)']",IM,"['Albizzia/*chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hemolysis', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Oleanolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives', 'Plants, Medicinal/chemistry', 'Saponins/chemistry/*isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Triterpenes/chemistry/*isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/09/11 05:00,2005/08/16 09:00,['2004/09/11 05:00'],"['2004/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/11 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2004 Sep 1;12(17):4725-34. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2004.06.025.,"['10.1016/j.bmc.2004.06.025 [doi]', 'S0968-0896(04)00428-6 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we show that hAPOBEC3G binds to HIV-1 Pr55 Gag and its NC domain and to the RT and IN domains contained in Pr160 Gag-Pol. We demonstrate that the expression of HIV-1 Gag is sufficient to induce the packaging of hAPOBEC3G into Gag particles. Gag-Pol polypeptides containing RT and IN domains, as well as HIV-1 genomic RNA, seem not to be necessary for hAPOBEC3G packaging.

Rubitecan is an oral compound being developed for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and other solid tumours by SuperGen. One of the major benefits of rubitecan is that it can be administered in an outpatient setting, so patients can be treated in their homes. Rubitecan was isolated by the Stehlin Foundation in the US. SuperGen is currently awaiting regulatory approval in the US and the EU for rubitecan in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. At the BIO-2004 conference, SuperGen announced it is seeking a partner for rubitecan for territories outside the US. SuperGen acquired exclusive worldwide rights to rubitecan from the Stehlin Foundation in 1997 except in Mexico, Canada, Spain, Japan, the UK, France, Italy and Germany. SuperGen has also received approval from the US FDA to use its own manufactured rubitecan in clinical trials. SuperGen and the Stehlin Foundation have an 8-year research agreement that secures global rights to other camptothecins and additional anticancer compounds for the former. In December 1999, SuperGen and Abbott signed a worldwide sales and marketing agreement for rubitecan. Under the terms of the agreement, Abbott had exclusive distribution and promotion rights for rubitecan outside the US, and co-promotion rights with SuperGen within the US. In return, Abbott made an initial equity investment in SuperGen. SuperGen and Abbott Laboratories ended their collaboration agreement in February 2002 by mutual consent with SuperGen stating that the dissolution of the agreement was based on commercial motivation rather than anything to do with rubitecan's safety or efficacy. Abbott no longer has rights or obligations to purchase shares of SuperGen stock or an option to purchase up to 49% of the company. For its part, SuperGen will no longer receive milestone payments worth up to $US57 million. SuperGen has formed a clinical and business alliance with US Oncology (created by the merger between American Oncology Resources and Physician Reliance Network in the US), and will collaborate on clinical trials of rubitecan. SuperGen believes that this relationship will increase the patient population available for trials and enable it to market the drug directly to Oncologists. SuperGen and Capital Research and Management Company have completed a $US16.6 million private placement transaction that will enable future funding for the rubitecan programme as well as other oncology programmes. In July 2004, SuperGen's European subsidiary, EuroGen Pharmaceuticals, submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application for rubitecan in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The application will be reviewed under the EMEA Centralised Procedure. In June 2003, the EMEA granted SuperGen orphan drug status for rubitecan for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The US FDA has also granted orphan drug status for rubitecan in the treatment of pancreatic cancer and fast-track status for rubitecan for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer that is resistant or refractory to chemotherapy. SuperGen has conducted three phase III pivotal trials in patients with pancreatic cancer. A phase III randomised trial in chemotherapy-naive patients was conducted at 132 centres throughout the US. The trial enrolled approximately 994 patients who were randomised to receive rubitecan or gemcitabine. Enrollment was completed in October 2001. Another phase III trial has compared rubitecan with the most appropriate chemotherapy in chemotherapy-resistant patients. Enrollment of over 400 patients at 200 medical centres across the US was completed in June 2001. Results from the trial were presented at the 39th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO-2003) [Chicago, US; 31 May - 3 June 2003], after they had been compiled, analysed and submitted to the FDA. The results of the study showed that rubitecan could not help all chemotherapy-resistant patients, but could increase survival in those that do respond. The other phase III pivotal trial was conducted in patients with pancreatic cancer who had failed treatment with gemcitabine. This trial completed enrollment in October 2001, and had enrolled approximately 448 patients. SuperGen is conducting phase II trials of rubitecan in patients with solid tumours in the UK, Italy, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark. Each trial will enroll 100-150 patients with various tumour types, including colorectal, lung, breast, gastric, prostate, cervical and head and neck cancers. Phase I/II trials are underway to investigate rubitecan as a radiosensitiser in patients with lung cancer, and phase II trials in patients with breast cancer are also being conducted. A phase II study in ovarian cancer patients is also being conducted. Results from an ongoing phase II study in cancer patients have shown that rubitecan was effective against chordomas, a rare type of bone cancer. Phase II studies are also underway in haematological malignancies including myelodysplastic syndrome (preleukaemia) and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. In February 2000, SuperGen announced that its IND submission for rubitecan had been approved by the Therapeutics Products Programme of Canada. The company stated that it intended to begin clinical trials in Canada in the near future. In February 2004, SuperGen announced an offering of shares of its common stock to finance the commercialisation of rubitecan capsules. In July 2003, SuperGen was granted a US patent covering combination therapies with chemotherapeutic anthracycline agents and structural modifications that may one day lead to next-generation rubitecan compounds. In December 2002, SuperGen was granted US patent No. 6,482,830, covering its polymorphic formulations of rubitecan. The patent also covers a class of polymorphs that are similar to the one at the centre of rubitecan. In addition, SuperGen was also issued US patent No. 6,485,514 in December 2002, covering the local delivery of rubitecan via stents and/or catheters to sites of proliferating cells. Stent- or catheter-delivered rubitecan may be beneficial in certain types of cardiac procedures, such as ablation or angioplasty, as well as for direct injection into a certain number of solid tumours. SuperGen is also developing an inhaled, liposomal formulation of rubitecan. It acquired the worldwide rights to this formulation from the Clayton Foundation in December 1999.

The main aim in this study was to determine the diagnostic value of PCT in predicting the clinical severity of febril neutropenic attacks, compare it with that of C-reactive protein (CRP), and clarify its importance in culture-positive attacks. METHODS: Between February 2001 and April 2002, 36 patients who were neutropenic due to various hematologic disorders and febrile were entered into the study. Blood samples were obtained on the first day of fever for the measurement of serum PCT and CRP levels. RESULTS: In clinically severe neutropenic fever attacks, means of serum PCT and CRP levels were measured as 0.93+/-1.33 ng/mL and 67+/-24 mg/L, while they were 0.37+/-0.23 ng/mL and 32+/-19 mg/L in clinically mild ones (p = 0.033 and p < 0.001). On the other hand, no statistical significance was found between culture-positive and negative attacks when either serum PCT or CRP levels were taken into consideration (p = 0.133 and p = 0.141). The specificity and positive predictive value of the serum PCT test for severe febrile neutropenia was higher than that of the serum CRP test (0.80 vs. 0.57 and 0.50 vs. 0.39). However, sensitivity and negative predictive value for CRP were higher than the values for PCT (1.00 vs. 0.40 and 1.00 vs. 0.73). Diagnostic value and positive likelihood ratio of CRP for severe febrile neutropenia were higher than those of PCT (71 vs. 67 and 2.32 vs. 2.00). CONCLUSIONS: PCT and CRP are comparable with each other in prediction of the clinical severity of febrile neutropenic attacks. Furthermore, serum CRP levels correlate with the duration of fever.","['Erten, Nilgun', 'Genc, Sema', 'Besisik, Sevgi K', 'Saka, Bulent', 'Karan, M Akif', 'Tascioglu, Cemil']","['Erten N', 'Genc S', 'Besisik SK', 'Saka B', 'Karan MA', 'Tascioglu C']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Istanbul School of Medicine, Istanbul University, Capa, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey. snilgunerten@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Chin Med Assoc,Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,101174817,"['0 (CALCA protein, human)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '9007-12-9 (Calcitonin)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)', 'JHB2QIZ69Z (Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'C-Reactive Protein/*analysis', 'Calcitonin/*blood', 'Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide', 'Female', 'Fever/blood/diagnosis/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/blood/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Protein Precursors/*blood']",2004/09/11 05:00,2005/01/06 09:00,['2004/09/11 05:00'],"['2004/09/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/11 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Chin Med Assoc. 2004 May;67(5):217-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One potential mechanism of apoptosis induced by benzene metabolites that has not been examined is the production of pro-apoptotic cytokines such as endothelial IL-8 from endothelial cells in bone marrow stroma. In this study, we utilized HL-60 cells which are known to produce the endothelial form of IL-8 (eIL-8) and human bone marrow endothelial cells (HBMEC) as model systems. Hydroquinone (HQ), Catechol (Cat) and benzenetriol (BT) all induced eIL-8 production and apoptosis in HL-60 cells. HQ induced a marked 50-70 fold stimulation of eIL-8 levels and HL-60 cells were shown to have the eIL-8 receptor, CXCR1 thus enabling an autocrine pathway of apoptosis. However, treatment with recombinant eIL-8 failed to induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells as previously reported and antibodies to either IL-8 or CXCR1 did not significantly abrogate benzene metabolite-induced apoptosis. HQ and Cat but not BT also induced stimulation of eIL-8 production in HBMEC. These data demonstrate that although metabolites of benzene induce marked stimulation of eIL-8, this is unlikely to be responsible for apoptosis induced in HL-60 cells. Our data also demonstrates that phenolic metabolites of benzene stimulate the production of eIL-8 from HBMEC suggesting that higher levels of endothelial-derived cytokines may occur in bone marrow after benzene exposure.","['Bironaite, Daiva', 'Siegel, David', 'Moran, Julie L', 'Weksler, Babette B', 'Ross, David']","['Bironaite D', 'Siegel D', 'Moran JL', 'Weksler BB', 'Ross D']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver 80262, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Benzene Derivatives)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8A)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies/immunology/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzene Derivatives/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8A/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins']",2004/09/11 05:00,2004/09/30 05:00,['2004/09/11 05:00'],"['2004/09/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/09/11 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2004 Aug 10;149(1):37-49. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2004.06.004.,"['S0009-2797(04)00066-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2004.06.004 [doi]']",,['R01 ES09554/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['Chem Biol Interact. 20004 Oct 15;149(2-3):175'],['Chem Biol Interact. 2004 Oct 15;149(2-3):177-88.

In this paper, we report a cell-saving imaging method for quick identification of the hematonosis cell apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs. By the combination of two-photon and confocal microscopy, three main apoptosis parameters (the change of nuclear morphology, collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, and increase of intracellular calcium) were recorded simultaneously for single As2O3-induced Molt-4 cells. The results are highly in accordance with those produced by classical flow cytometry.

A prenatal origin of childhood leukemia was further supported by the detection of clonotypic immunoglobulin gene rearrangements on neonatal blood spots of children with various other subtypes of ALL. However, no comprehensive study is available linking these clonotypic events. We describe a pair of 5-year-old monozygotic twins with concordant TEL-AML1-positive ALL. Separate leukemic clones were identified in the diagnostic samples since distinct IGH and IGK-Kde gene rearrangements could be detected. Additional differences characterizing the leukemic clones included an aberration of the second, nonrearranged TEL allele observed in one twin only. Interestingly, both the identical TEL-AML1 fusion sequence and distinct immunoglobulin gene rearrangements were identified on the neonatal blood spots indicating that separate preleukemic clones evolved already before birth. Finally, we compared the reported twins with an additional 31 children with ALL by using the microarray technology.

We established a new ALCL cell line (COST) from the peripheral blood of a patient with a small-cell variant of ALCL, at diagnosis.

Screening of 372 patients who were enrolled in two consecutive Austrian childhood ALL multicenter trials identified 94 (25%) TEL/AML1+ cases. TEL deletions, trisomy 21 and an additional der(21)t(12;21) were detected in 52 (55%), 13 (14%) and 14 (15%) TEL/AML1+ patients, respectively. The 12p aberrations (P=0.001) and near tetraploidy (P=0.045) were more common in TEL/AML1+ patients, whereas the incidence of diploidy, pseudodiploidy, hypodiploidy, low hyperdiploidy, near triploidy, del(6q), chromosome 9 and 11q23 abnormalities was similar among TEL/AML1+ and TEL/AML1- patients. None of the TEL/AML1+ patients had a high hyperdiploid karyotype.

However, recently we have demonstrated that in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells, survival of MM cells becomes independent of the IL-6/gp130/STAT3 pathway questioning the singular role of IL-6 in MM. Therefore, it was the aim of this study to identify additional factors and signaling pathways that might contribute to the growth and survival of MM cells. We found that in addition to IL-6 a number of bone marrow derived cytokines such as LIF, VEGF, bFGF, MIP-1alpha, SDF-1alpha, IL-1beta, SCF and IL-3 activate the MAPK pathway and induce proliferation of MM.1S and RPMI-8226 MM cells. In addition, these cytokines independently phosphorylate the forkhead family member FKHR via PI3-K/AKT and support survival of primary human MM cells. Inhibition of these pathways induces apoptosis in MM cell lines and primary MM cells. Thus, we provide evidence that in addition to IL-6 a number of different factors trigger important growth-promoting pathways to support the proliferation and survival of MM cells. Therefore, blocking such pathways, rather than blocking a single factor, might be a promising approach for the development of novel treatment strategies in MM.","['Lentzsch, S', 'Chatterjee, M', 'Gries, M', 'Bommert, K', 'Gollasch, H', 'Dorken, B', 'Bargou, R C']","['Lentzsch S', 'Chatterjee M', 'Gries M', 'Bommert K', 'Gollasch H', 'Dorken B', 'Bargou RC']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor immunology, Robert Rossle Cancer Clinic and HELIOS Clinics at the Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Humboldt University, Charite, Campus Buch, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (FOXO1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O1)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Aged', '*Apoptosis', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Forkhead Box Protein O1', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/09/10 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/10 05:00'],"['2004/09/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Nov;18(11):1883-90. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403486.,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2403486 [doi]', '2403486 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secondary clonal cytogenetic abnormalities have now been reported after noncytotoxic therapy in two additional settings: all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We propose that SAA, APL, CML, and MDS represent different manifestations of generalized insults to the bone marrow. In SAA, the insult to hematopoietic progenitors leads to an immune attack, while in APL, CML, and MDS, it gives rise to the malignant clones. A primary insult to bone marrow could simultaneously lead to several abnormal hematopoietic cell clones, with one dominating and the others present but below the level of detection. Such a 'field leukemogenic effect' would be analogous to the 'field cancerization effect' described in solid tumors. Nonspecific cytotoxic therapies, including antileukemic chemotherapy and allogeneic transplantation, have broad activity that could inhibit both the overt disease and other undetectable coexistent abnormal clones. In contrast, disease-specific targeted therapy such as immunosuppressive therapy in aplastic anemia, ATRA in APL, or imatinib in CML would have no activity against other abnormal clones, allowing them to expand and become detectable as the dominant clone declines.","['Brodsky, R A', 'Jones, R J']","['Brodsky RA', 'Jones RJ']","['The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA. brodsro@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology']",2004/09/10 05:00,2004/11/02 09:00,['2004/09/10 05:00'],"['2004/09/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Oct;18(10):1740-2. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403487.,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2403487 [doi]', '2403487 [pii]']",,,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was one complete response after 22.5 months of treatment, which continues at 27+ months, and 18 other patients had stable disease. In vitro exposure of patients' lymphocytes to aminophylline (75-250 microg/ml), the soluble form of theophylline, resulted in dose- and time-dependent induction of apoptosis in 9/20 patients studied. Apoptosis was documented flow-cytometrically by monitoring the expression of bcl-2 and bax, forward light scatter, fluorescence intensity of binding of CD45 antibody, and the binding of annexin. Patients whose leukemic lymphocytes were susceptible to apoptosis induction by aminophylline in vitro experienced a significantly longer progression-free survival than patients whose cells were resistant to the drug in culture (P=0.025). This suggests that in a CLL population treated with theophylline, induction of an apoptotic response to the drug in vitro is prognostic for absence of clinical progression.","['Wiernik, P H', 'Paietta, E', 'Goloubeva, O', 'Lee, S J', 'Makower, D', 'Bennett, J M', 'Wade, J L', 'Ghosh, C', 'Kaminer, L S', 'Pizzolo, J', 'Tallman, M S']","['Wiernik PH', 'Paietta E', 'Goloubeva O', 'Lee SJ', 'Makower D', 'Bennett JM', 'Wade JL', 'Ghosh C', 'Kaminer LS', 'Pizzolo J', 'Tallman MS']","['Our Lady of Mercy Cancer Center, New York Medical College, Bronx, NY 10466, USA.

Recent studies have shown that in certain cancer cells, TRAIL-mediated apoptosis is also dependent on mitochondrial involvement, suggesting that similar mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy might be implicated in the resistance of tumor cells to TRAIL. We have used TRAIL-resistant leukemic cells that are deficient in both Bax and Bak to determine the roles of these Bcl-2 members in TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Exposure of these cells to TRAIL did not have an impact on cell viability, although it induced the processing of caspase-3 to its active p20 subunit. The activity of the p20 caspase-3 appeared to be inhibited as no autoprocessing of this p20 subunit or cleavage of known caspase-3 substrates were detected. Also, in the absence of Bax and Bak, no release of mitochondrial apoptogenic proteins was observed following TRAIL treatment. Adenoviral transduction of the Bax, but not the Bak gene, to the Bax/Bak-deficient leukemic cells rendered them TRAIL-sensitive as assessed by enhanced apoptotic death and caspase-3 processing.

The promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) tumour suppressor of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) accumulates in the PML nuclear body, but cytoplasmic PML isoforms of unknown function have also been described. Here we show that cytoplasmic Pml is an essential modulator of TGF-beta signalling. Pml-null primary cells are resistant to TGF-beta-dependent growth arrest, induction of cellular senescence and apoptosis. These cells also have impaired phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the TGF-beta signalling proteins Smad2 and Smad3, as well as impaired induction of TGF-beta target genes. Expression of cytoplasmic Pml is induced by TGF-beta. Furthermore, cytoplasmic PML physically interacts with Smad2/3 and SARA (Smad anchor for receptor activation) and is required for association of Smad2/3 with SARA and for the accumulation of SARA and TGF-beta receptor in the early endosome. The PML-RARalpha oncoprotein of APL can antagonize cytoplasmic PML function and APL cells have defects in TGF-beta signalling similar to those observed in Pml-null cells. Our findings identify cytoplasmic PML as a critical TGF-beta regulator, and further implicate deregulated TGF-beta signalling in cancer pathogenesis.","['Lin, Hui-Kuan', 'Bergmann, Stephan', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo']","['Lin HK', 'Bergmann S', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Sloan-Kettering Institute, 1275 York Avenue, New York, New York, 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (SARA protein, mouse)', '0 (SMAD2 protein, human)', '0 (SMAD3 protein, human)', '0 (Smad2 Protein)', '0 (Smad2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Smad3 Protein)', '0 (Smad3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cellular Senescence/drug effects', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Endosomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Smad2 Protein', 'Smad3 Protein', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2004/09/10 05:00,2004/10/01 05:00,['2004/09/10 05:00'],"['2004/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 2004 Sep 9;431(7005):205-11. doi: 10.1038/nature02783.,"['10.1038/nature02783 [doi]', 'nature02783 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,['Nature. 2004 Sep 9;431(7005):142.

In the present study, we used B cells constitutively expressing CD70 to study the functional consequences of signaling through CD70. In vitro, CD70 ligation with anti-CD70 mAbs strongly supported proliferation and cell cycle entry of B cells submitogenically stimulated with either anti-CD40 mAb, LPS, or IL-4. In this process, the cell surface receptors CD25, CD44, CD69, CD95, and GL7 were up-regulated, whereas the expression of CD21, CD62L, surface IgM (sIgM), and sIgD was decreased. Addition of CD70 mAb to low dose LPS-stimulated CD70-positive B cells strongly diminished IgG secretion and enhanced production of IgM. Signaling through CD70 on B cells was dependent on the initiation of both PI3K and MEK pathways. In vivo exposure to either CD70 mAb or the CD70 counterreceptor CD27 down-regulated CD62L and sIgM on CD70-positive B cells. CD70 signaling during T cell-dependent immune responses also decreased IgG-specific Ab titers. Together, the in vitro and in vivo data demonstrate that CD70 has potent reverse signaling properties in B cells, initiating a signaling cascade that regulates expansion and differentiation.","['Arens, Ramon', 'Nolte, Martijn A', 'Tesselaar, Kiki', 'Heemskerk, Bianca', 'Reedquist, Kris A', 'van Lier, Rene A W', 'van Oers, Marinus H J']","['Arens R', 'Nolte MA', 'Tesselaar K', 'Heemskerk B', 'Reedquist KA', 'van Lier RA', 'van Oers MH']","['Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD27 Ligand)', '0 (CD70 protein, human)', '0 (Cd70 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'B7-1 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Biomarkers', 'CD27 Ligand', 'Cell Cycle/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/immunology/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/biosynthesis', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics/*immunology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Plasma Cells/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*immunology']",2004/09/10 05:00,2004/10/20 09:00,['2004/09/10 05:00'],"['2004/09/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2004 Sep 15;173(6):3901-8. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.173.6.3901.,"['173/6/3901 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.173.6.3901 [doi]']",,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In-depth analysis revealed that atypical JkappaRSS-intronRSS, Vkappa-intronRSS, and JkappaRSS-Kde recombinations not only occur in B cell malignancies, but rather reflect physiological gene rearrangements present in normal human B cells as well. Excision circle analysis and recombination substrate assays can discriminate between single-step vs multistep rearrangements. Using this combined approach, we unraveled that the atypical Vkappa-intronRSS and JkappaRSS-Kde pseudohybrid joints most probably result from ongoing recombination following an initial aberrant JkappaRSS-intronRSS signal joint formation. Based on our observations in normal and malignant human B cells, a model is presented to describe the sequential (classical and atypical) recombination events in the human IGK locus and their estimated relative frequencies (0.2-1.0 vs < 0.03). The initial JkappaRSS-intronRSS signal joint formation (except for Jkappa1RSS-intronRSS) might be a side event of an active V(D)J recombination mechanism, but the subsequent formation of Vkappa-intronRSS and JkappaRSS-Kde pseudohybrid joints can represent an alternative pathway for IGK allele inactivation and allelic exclusion, in addition to classical Ckappa deletions. Although usage of this alternative pathway is limited, it seems essential for inactivation of those IGK alleles that have undergone initial aberrant recombinations, which might otherwise hamper selection of functional Ig L chain proteins.","['Langerak, Anton W', 'Nadel, Bertrand', 'De Torbal, Anneke', 'Wolvers-Tettero, Ingrid L M', 'van Gastel-Mol, Ellen J', 'Verhaaf, Brenda', 'Jager, Ulrich', 'van Dongen, Jacques J M']","['Langerak AW', 'Nadel B', 'De Torbal A', 'Wolvers-Tettero IL', 'van Gastel-Mol EJ', 'Verhaaf B', 'Jager U', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. a.langerak@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin J-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage/genetics/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/immunology', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Light Chain', 'Genetic Markers/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin J-Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Palatine Tonsil/immunology/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Recombination, Genetic/*immunology']",2004/09/10 05:00,2004/10/20 09:00,['2004/09/10 05:00'],"['2004/09/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2004 Sep 15;173(6):3878-88. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.173.6.3878.,"['173/6/3878 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.173.6.3878 [doi]']",,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, loss of a functional FANCC results in decreased activation of STAT1 following IFN-gamma stimulation. Because type I IFN receptors influence the function of type II receptors, and vice versa, we conducted experiments designed to determine whether type I IFN-induced activation of other STAT proteins is compromised in FA-C cells and found that activation of STAT 1, 3, and 5 is diminished in type I IFN-stimulated cells bearing Fancc-inactivating mutations. We also determined that the reduced activation of STATs was accompanied by significant reduction of type I IFN-induced tyrosine kinase 2 and Jak1 phosphorylation. Because tyrosine kinase 2 plays a role in differentiation of Th cells, we quantified cytokine secretion from CD4+ cells and in vitro generated CD4+ Th cell subsets from splenocytes of Fancc null mice to that of heterozygous mice and discovered reduced CD4+ IFN-gamma secretion in the Fancc-/- mouse, indicating impaired Th1 differentiation. We suggest that Fancc mutations result in a subtle immunological defect owing to the failure of FANCC to normally support Jak/STAT signaling.","['Fagerlie, Sara R', 'Koretsky, Tara', 'Torok-Storb, Beverly', 'Bagby, Grover C']","['Fagerlie SR', 'Koretsky T', 'Torok-Storb B', 'Bagby GC']","['Oregon Health and Science University Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA. sfagerli@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fancc protein, mouse)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '156986-95-7 (Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Tyk2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/enzymology/immunology/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia/*enzymology/genetics/*immunology', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins', 'Gene Silencing/immunology', 'Interferon Type I/*physiology', 'Interferon-gamma/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-6/physiology', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding/immunology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta', 'Receptors, Interferon/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT2 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Spleen/immunology/pathology', 'TYK2 Kinase', 'Th1 Cells/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Trans-Activators/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2004/09/10 05:00,2004/10/20 09:00,['2004/09/10 05:00'],"['2004/09/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2004 Sep 15;173(6):3863-70. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.173.6.3863.,"['173/6/3863 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.173.6.3863 [doi]']",,"['HL48546/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL62923/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL72321/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,"['Copyright 2004 The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently constructed a novel chimeric suicide gene in which the entire coding region of HSV thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) was fused in-frame to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of human CD34 (DeltaCD34-tk). DeltaCD34-tk is an attractive candidate as a suicide gene in man because of the ensured expression of HSV-tk in all selected cells and the ability to rapidly and efficiently purify gene-modified cells using clinically approved CD34 immunoselection techniques. In this study we assessed the efficacy of the DeltaCD34-tk suicide gene in the absence of extended ex vivo manipulation by generating transgenic animals that express DeltaCD34-tk in the peripheral and thymic T cell compartments using the CD2 locus control region. We found that DeltaCD34-tk-expressing T cells could be purified to near homogeneity by CD34 immunoselection and selectively eliminated ex vivo and in vivo when exposed to low concentrations of GCV. The optimal time to administer GCV after allogeneic BMT with DeltaCD34-tk-expressing transgenic T cells was dependent on the intensity of the conditioning regimen, the leukemic status of the recipient, and the dose and timing of T cell infusion. Importantly, we used a controlled graft-vs-host reaction to promote alloengraftment in sublethally irradiated mice and provide a graft-vs-leukemia effect in recipients administered a delayed infusion of DeltaCD34-tk-expressing T cells. This murine model demonstrates the potential usefulness of DeltaCD34-tk-expressing T cells to control GVHD, promote alloengraftment, and provide a graft-vs-leukemia effect in man.","['Rettig, Michael P', 'Ritchey, Julie K', 'Prior, Julie L', 'Haug, Jeffrey S', 'Piwnica-Worms, David', 'DiPersio, John F']","['Rettig MP', 'Ritchey JK', 'Prior JL', 'Haug JS', 'Piwnica-Worms D', 'DiPersio JF']","['Division of Oncology, Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis/*genetics/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology/pathology', 'Cell Death/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Ganciclovir/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Genes, Transgenic, Suicide/*immunology', 'Graft Survival/drug effects/genetics/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics/*immunology/mortality/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Radiation Chimera/immunology', 'Simplexvirus/enzymology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/enzymology/pathology/*transplantation', 'Thymidine Kinase/biosynthesis/*genetics/immunology', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects']",2004/09/10 05:00,2004/10/20 09:00,['2004/09/10 05:00'],"['2004/09/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2004 Sep 15;173(6):3620-30. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.173.6.3620.,"['173/6/3620 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.173.6.3620 [doi]']",,"['P50CA94056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA83845/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,"['Copyright 2004 The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonetheless, few reports have assessed final height outcomes in survivors treated with GH. In the present study, we investigated which patient and treatment variables correlate with final height and change in height sd score (SDS) in a large cohort of cancer survivors treated with GH. We previously identified 361 participants in the multicenter Childhood Cancer Survivor Study who were treated with GH. Final height data were available in 183 survivors (120 males). Diagnoses included: central nervous system tumors (n = 90), acute leukemia (n = 64), soft tissue sarcomas (n = 23), and miscellaneous (n = 6). The median age at diagnosis of the primary cancer was 4.6 yr, and the median age at start of GH treatment was 11.3 yr. Mean height SDS at start of GH therapy was -2.03 +/- 0.8, and the mean final height SDS was -1.48 +/- 0.10 (P < 0.001). Final height SDS was positively associated with target height and dose of GH but negatively associated with the presence of concomitant endocrinopathies and dose of spinal RT. Change in height SDS (start of GH-final height) was positively associated with male gender, younger bone age at start of GH, and dose of GH; presence of concomitant endocrinopathies and dose of spinal RT were negatively associated with change in height SDS. Risk factors associated with a final height of -2.0 sd or less included lower doses of GH and exposure to higher doses of spinal RT. Thus, to maximize final height, our findings emphasize the importance of beginning GH therapy at the earliest bone age that is clinically feasible; treating with conventional higher doses of GH; and, when possible, minimizing the dose of spinal RT.","['Brownstein, Carrie M', 'Mertens, Ann C', 'Mitby, Pauline A', 'Stovall, Marilyn', 'Qin, Jing', 'Heller, Glenn', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Sklar, Charles A']","['Brownstein CM', 'Mertens AC', 'Mitby PA', 'Stovall M', 'Qin J', 'Heller G', 'Robison LL', 'Sklar CA']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Department of Pediatrics, 1275 York Avenue, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['33515-09-2 (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone)', '79561-22-1 (LHRH, Ala(6)-Gly(10)-ethylamide-)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Height/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Growth Hormone/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/radiation effects', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Survivors']",2004/09/10 05:00,2004/10/08 09:00,['2004/09/10 05:00'],"['2004/09/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2004 Sep;89(9):4422-7. doi: 10.1210/jc.2004-0160.,"['10.1210/jc.2004-0160 [doi]', '89/9/4422 [pii]']",,['U24-CA55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early on, when the objective of treatment was euthyroidism, the dose of radioiodine was low, and retreatment was frequently needed. Later, the doses used were increased. Over time, all but two patients became hypothyroid. Pregnancies did not result in an unusual number of congenital anomalies or spontaneous abortions.

Thus, CRD-BP is thought to promote cell proliferation by maintaining c-Myc at critical levels. CRD-BP also appears to be an oncofetal protein, based upon its expression during mammalian development and in some tumors. By using K562 leukemia cells as a model, we show that CRD-BP gene silencing by RNA interference significantly promoted proliferation, indicating an inhibitory effect of CRD-BP on proliferation. Unexpectedly, CRD-BP knockdown had no discernible effect on c-myc mRNA levels. CRD-BP is also known as insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) mRNA-binding protein-1. It has been reported to repress translation of a luciferase reporter mRNA containing an IGF-II 5'-untranslated region known as leader 3 but not one containing IGF-II leader 4. CRD-BP knockdown markedly increased IGF-II mRNA and protein levels but did not alter translation of luciferase reporter mRNAs containing 5'-untranslated regions consisting of either IGF-II leader 3 or leader 4. Addition of antibody against IGF-II to cell cultures inhibited the proliferative effect of CRD-BP knockdown, suggesting that regulation of IGF-II gene expression, rather than c-myc mRNA levels, mediates the proliferative effect of CRD-BP knockdown. Thus, we have identified a dominant function for CRD-BP in cell proliferation of human K562 cells, involving a possible IGF-II-dependent mechanism that appears independent of its ability to serve as a c-myc mRNA masking protein.","['Liao, Baisong', 'Patel, Meera', 'Hu, Yan', 'Charles, Sandy', 'Herrick, David J', 'Brewer, Gary']","['Liao B', 'Patel M', 'Hu Y', 'Charles S', 'Herrick DJ', 'Brewer G']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Microbiology, and Immunology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (IGF2BP1 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions"", 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coloring Agents/pharmacology', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Trypan Blue/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2004/09/10 05:00,2005/01/12 09:00,['2004/09/10 05:00'],"['2004/09/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/12 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Nov 19;279(47):48716-24. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M405853200.

METHODS: The MICM classification, clinical characteristics of 80 adolescents with ALL admitted to our hospital from January 1998 to December 2002 were retrospectively analyzed. Survival data were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and the prognostic factors were analyzed with the COX regression model. RESULTS: In the 80 patients, B-ALL and T-ALL accounted for 69.12% and 26.47%, respectively. The percentage of Ph(+)ALL was 18.37% (9/49), and that of hyperdiploidy was 4.08%. Patients at diagnosis with high leukocyte counts (> 50 x 10(9)/L) accounted for 27.94%. Among the 78 cases treated with VDP(L) or CODP(L) regimens, 73 (91.03%) obtained CR in 4 weeks.

Clinically, these patients manifested older in age, higher white blood cell counts with high blast fractions and lower platelet counts (PC). Phenotypically 82.6% of them were common ALL, 39.1% coexpressed myeloid antigens, and 56.5% expressed CD34 antigen. 65.4% of them (17/26) achieved complete remission (CR) and the median remission and survival durations were 4 months and 8 months, respectively.

METHODS: Genomic DNAs from 194 cases of AL were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gel electrophoresis for FLT3-ITD mutations. RESULTS: FLT3-ITDs were found in 37 (25.9%) of 143 de novo acute myeoloid leukemia (AML) patients, including 10/53 of M(2), 15/40 of M(3), 4/20 of M(4) and 8/23 of M(5). Significantly more FLT3 aberrations were found in AML M(3) and M(5) (P < 0.05). No FLT3-ITD was found in 25 acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), 2 acute hybrid leukemia, 17 myelodysplastic syndromes and 7 chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis. Sequence analysis of 5 cases with abnormal PCR electrophoretic patterns revealed that the ITDs were located within exon 14 from 21 bp to 60 bp, in 3 cases the ITD was a simple tandem duplication, and in 2 cases the ITD was tandem duplication with insertion, but all of the above ITD did not altered the FLT3 reading frame. FLT3-ITD was associated with a higher peripheral white cell count (P < 0.05) and a lower complete remission rate (P < 0.05), and was more prevalent in patients with normal karyotype (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: FLT3-ITD mutation occurs with a significant percentage in AML M(3) and M(5) patients. Sequences of the mutants are in frame mutation.

METHODS: Forty-six AL patients received allo-HSCT and 94 received auto-HSCT in CR(1). The conditioning regimens mainly consisted of TBICy, BuCy and MAC. Cyclosporine plus methotrexate, or cyclosporine alone, or FK506 alone was used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Among auto-HSCT group, 39 patients received purged autologous bone marrow and 38 received immunotherapy and/or maintenance chemotherapy after transplant. RESULTS: Myeloid reconstitution was achieved in all patients. After a median of 700 (range, 18 approximately 5563) days follow-up, the probabilities of leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 5 year were not significantly different in these two groups: (51.5 +/- 5.4)% for auto-HSCT group and (52.8 +/- 7.6)% for allo-HSCT group (P > 0.05). There was a lower cumulative relapse incidence (RI) [(26.3 +/- 6.9)% vs. (52.0 +/- 5.5)%, P > 0.05] but a significantly higher cumulative transplant-related mortality (TRM) [(37.6 +/- 7.8% vs. (14.4 +/- 4.1)%, P < 0.05] in the allo-HSCT group than in auto-HSCT group. Among auto-HSCT group, the patients received purged autografts and/or post-transplant therapy had significantly better LFS and lower RI (P < 0.05) than those received unpurged autografts or no post-transplant treatments [5-y LFS: (62.8 +/- 6.8)% and (38.4 +/- 8.4)%; RI: (37.7 +/- 6.8)% and (74.2 +/- 8.7)%, respectively]. CONCLUSION: The long-term LFS of auto-HSCT was comparable to that of allo-HSCT in the management of patients with AL in CR(1), because autograft purging and post-transplant treatment can significantly decrease relapse of auto-HSCT patients and auto-HSCT has lower therapy-related toxicities.","['Wang, He-hua', 'Feng, Si-zhou', 'Wang, Mei', 'Wei, Jia-lin', 'Jiang, Er-lie', 'Zhang, Li', 'Huang, Yong', 'Zhou, Shi-yong', 'Liu, Qing-guo', 'Qiu, Lu-gui', 'Han, Ming-zhe', 'Yan, Wen-wei']","['Wang HH', 'Feng SZ', 'Wang M', 'Wei JL', 'Jiang EL', 'Zhang L', 'Huang Y', 'Zhou SY', 'Liu QG', 'Qiu LG', 'Han MZ', 'Yan WW']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS and PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Purging', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/prevention & control', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/09/10 05:00,2008/05/06 09:00,['2004/09/10 05:00'],"['2004/09/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2004 Jul;25(7):389-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper is to evaluate the role of the SHIP gene in human leukemogenesis. METHODS: Expression of SHIP gene in bone marrow and/or peripheral blood from 32 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 9 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), as well as human hematopoietic cell lines was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: RT-PCR showed that all samples expressed SHIP gene. Mutations of SHIP gene were detected in 7 (22%) of 32 AML patients and one (12%) of 9 ALL patients. Interestingly, two missense mutations that had been observed in a AML patient at diagnosis disappeared after complete remission (CR). In addition, in vitro Akt phosphorylation was prolonged and increased following IL-3 stimulation of this patient's cells. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate for the first time the mutation of SHIP gene in acute leukemia and suggest a possible role of the mutation of this gene in the development of acute leukemia. SHIP may serve as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in hematopoietic cells.","['Luo, Jian-min', 'Liu, Ze-lin', 'Hao, Hong-ling', 'Wang, Fu-xu', 'Dong, Zuo-ren', 'Ryuzo, Ohno']","['Luo JM', 'Liu ZL', 'Hao HL', 'Wang FX', 'Dong ZR', 'Ryuzo O']","['Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050000, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.56 (Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'U937 Cells']",2004/09/10 05:00,2008/05/06 09:00,['2004/09/10 05:00'],"['2004/09/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2004 Jul;25(7):385-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most current methods for clustering samples are based on distance metrics utilizing all genes. This has the effect of obscuring clustering in samples that may be evident only when looking at a subset of genes, because noise from irrelevant genes dominates the signal from the relevant genes in the distance calculation. RESULTS: We describe an algorithm for automatically detecting clusters of samples that are discernable only in a subset of genes. We use iteration between Minimal Spanning Tree based clustering and feature selection to remove noise genes in a step-wise manner while simultaneously sharpening the clustering. Evaluation of this algorithm on synthetic data shows that it resolves planted clusters with high accuracy in spite of noise and the presence of other clusters. It also shows a low probability of detecting spurious clusters. Testing the algorithm on some well known micro-array data-sets reveals known biological classes as well as novel clusters. CONCLUSIONS: The iterative clustering method offers considerable improvement over clustering in all genes. This method can be used to discover partitions and their biological significance can be determined by comparing with clinical correlates and gene annotations.

Cytogenetic response is usually evaluated by analyzing 20-25 bone marrow metaphases using standard banding techniques. Since this methodology has very low sensitivity, we compared the results obtained by standard banding techniques to the ones obtained by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). This was also done to identify any possible discrepancies between the two techniques. We analyzed 40 Ph+ CML patients in the chronic phase who had previously been treated with interferon alpha (IFNalpha) and who were receiving imatinib. The studies were performed by utilizing the same BM cell samples fixed in acetic acid/methanol, before imatinib therapy and then quarterly. Comparison of cytogenetic results to FISH results at 3 and 6 months of imatinib treatment showed that some patients who had achieved major cytogenetic response (i.e.<35% of examined metaphases showing Ph), showed retention of a higher number of persisting Ph+ cells when examined by FISH, and they did not achieve major FISH response (i.e. <35% of examined interphase cells show the BCR-ABL fusion signal). The discrepancy we found between the results that were obtained by analyzing metaphases and interphase cells disappeared in the subsequent examinations. Moreover, we found that 4 patients (10%) were still Ph+ in all the metaphases we examined even though they achieved excellent clinical response. On the basis of this small series of patients, we suggest that cytogenetic evaluation of patients on imatinib therapy should be performed by utilizing the classic banding technique (metaphase examination), but also by using the FISH technique (interphase examination), since the two methodologies may provide different results.","['Fugazza, G', 'Miglino, M', 'Bruzzone, R', 'Quintino, S', 'Gatti, A M', 'Grasso, R', 'Gobbi, M', 'Frassoni, F', 'Sessarego, M']","['Fugazza G', 'Miglino M', 'Bruzzone R', 'Quintino S', 'Gatti AM', 'Grasso R', 'Gobbi M', 'Frassoni F', 'Sessarego M']","['Dipartimento di Medicina Interna and Dipartimento di Ematologia e Oncologia, Universita degli Studi di Genova, Genova.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interferon-alpha/adverse effects', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Metaphase', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate']",2004/09/10 05:00,2005/01/19 09:00,['2004/09/10 05:00'],"['2004/09/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Jun;23(2):295-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arsenic can act through a considerable number of different pathways including mitochondrial respiration and tubulin formation, affecting growth, blood flow, differentiation, and apoptosis. Recent studies on the apoptotic potential of arsenic trioxide have elucidated some of its causal mechanisms, including elevation of intracellular H2O2, inhibition of NF-kappaB activity, and inhibition of GTP-induced polymerization of tubulin. Because of the variety in cellular approaches available to arsenic, it has been hypothesized that the combination of arsenic trioxide and other chemotherapeutic agents may result in cytotoxic synergy. Recent studies have proven this true, with all-trans retinoic acid, IFN-alpha, and ascorbic acid all yielding promising results when used in conjunction with arsenic trioxide. In this study we tested sulindac sulfide, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) to test its effects with arsenic. Sulindac was used because it functions by some of the same pathways as arsenic, including the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and the NF-kappaB pathway. Our results show that sulindac sulfide enhances cytotoxicity when combined with arsenic trioxide, and that further studies on the exact mechanisms of their interaction are needed.","['Jiang, T T', 'Brown, S L', 'Kim, J H']","['Jiang TT', 'Brown SL', 'Kim JH']","['Dept of Radiation Oncology, Henry Ford Health Sciences Center, Detroit, Michigan 48098, USA. ttj@umich.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '184SNS8VUH (Sulindac)', '6UVA8S2DEY (sulindac sulfide)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Oxides/administration & dosage', 'Sulindac/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2004/09/10 05:00,2005/01/19 09:00,['2004/09/10 05:00'],"['2004/09/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Jun;23(2):259-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These genes are said to be differentially expressed. Differential expression can be detected by selecting the genes with P-values (derived using an appropriate hypothesis test) below a certain rejection level. This selection, however, is not possible without accepting some false positives and negatives since the two sets of P-values, associated with the genes whose expression is and is not affected by the distinction between the different malignancies, overlap. We describe a procedure for the study of differential expression in microarray data based on receiver-operating characteristic curves. This approach can be useful to select a rejection level that balances the number of false positives and negatives and to assess the degree of overlap between the two sets of P-values. Since this degree of overlap characterises the balance that can be reached between the number of false positives and negatives, this quantity can be seen as a quality measure of microarray data with respect to the detection of differential expression. As an example, we apply our method to data sets studying acute leukaemia.","['De Smet, F', 'Moreau, Y', 'Engelen, K', 'Timmerman, D', 'Vergote, I', 'De Moor, B']","['De Smet F', 'Moreau Y', 'Engelen K', 'Timmerman D', 'Vergote I', 'De Moor B']","['Department of Electrical Engineering, ESAT-SCD, K.U.Leuven, Kasteelpark Arenberg 10, 3001 Leuven-Heverlee, Belgium. frank.desmet@esat.kuleuven.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['False Negative Reactions', 'False Positive Reactions', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'ROC Curve', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2004/09/09 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/09 05:00'],"['2004/09/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/09 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2004 Sep 13;91(6):1160-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6602140.,"['10.1038/sj.bjc.6602140 [doi]', '6602140 [pii]']",,,,PMC2747693,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The stapled peptides, called ""stabilized alpha-helix of BCL-2 domains"" (SAHBs), proved to be helical, protease-resistant, and cell-permeable molecules that bound with increased affinity to multidomain BCL-2 member pockets. A SAHB of the BH3 domain from the BID protein specifically activated the apoptotic pathway to kill leukemia cells.

Previously, we have shown that IL-7 increases viability and proliferation of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells by up-regulating Bcl-2 and down-regulating the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1. Here, we examined the signaling pathways via which IL-7 mediates these effects. We investigated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt (protein kinase B) pathways, which have active roles in T cell expansion and have been implicated in tumorigenesis. IL-7 induced activation of the MEK-Erk pathway in T-ALL cells; however, inhibition of the MEK-Erk pathway by the use of the cell-permeable inhibitor PD98059, did not affect IL-7-mediated viability or cell cycle progression of leukemic cells. IL-7 induced PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream targets GSK-3, FOXO1, and FOXO3a. PI3K activation was mandatory for IL-7-mediated Bcl-2 up-regulation, p27kip1 down-regulation, Rb hyperphosphorylation, and consequent viability and cell cycle progression of T-ALL cells. PI3K signaling was also required for cell size increase, up-regulation of CD71, expression of the glucose transporter Glut1, uptake of glucose, and maintenance of mitochondrial integrity. Our results implicate PI3K as a major effector of IL-7-induced viability, metabolic activation, growth and proliferation of T-ALL cells, and suggest that PI3K and its downstream effectors may represent molecular targets for therapeutic intervention in T-ALL.","['Barata, Joao T', 'Silva, Ana', 'Brandao, Joana G', 'Nadler, Lee M', 'Cardoso, Angelo A', 'Boussiotis, Vassiliki A']","['Barata JT', 'Silva A', 'Brandao JG', 'Nadler LM', 'Cardoso AA', 'Boussiotis VA']","['Tumor Biology Unit, Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Lisbon Medical School, 1649-028, Lisbon, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (CD71 antigen)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Monosaccharide Transport Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (SLC2A1 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Glucose/*metabolism', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-7/*metabolism', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Monosaccharide Transport Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2004/09/09 05:00,2004/10/19 09:00,['2004/09/09 05:00'],"['2004/09/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/09 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2004 Sep 6;200(5):659-69. doi: 10.1084/jem.20040789.,"['10.1084/jem.20040789 [doi]', 'jem.20040789 [pii]']",,"['P01 CA068484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI046548/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 46548/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2212738,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 922 adult patients entered onto the trial according to risk groups: standard-risk ALL (group 1), high-risk ALL (group 2), Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL (group 3), and CNS-positive ALL (group 4). All received a standard four-drug/4-week induction course. Patients from group 1 who achieved a complete remission (CR) after one course of induction therapy were randomly assigned between intensive and less intensive postremission chemotherapy, whereas those who achieved CR after salvage therapy were then included in group 2. Patients in groups 2, 3, and 4 with an HLA-identical sibling were assigned to allogeneic SCT. In groups 3 and 4, autologous SCT was offered to all other patients, whereas in group 2 they were randomly assigned between chemotherapy and autologous SCT. RESULTS: Overall, 771 patients achieved CR (84%). Median disease-free survival (DFS) was 17.5 months, with 3-year DFS at 37%. In group 1, the 3-year DFS rate was 41%, with no difference between arms of postremission randomization. In groups 2 and 4, the 3-year DFS rates were 38% and 44%, respectively. In group 2, autologous SCT and chemotherapy resulted in comparable median DFS. Patients with an HLA-matched sibling (groups 2 and 4) had improved DFS. Three-year DFS was 24% in group 3. CONCLUSION: Allogeneic SCT improved DFS in high-risk ALL in the first CR. Autologous SCT did not confer a significant benefit over chemotherapy for high-risk ALL.","['Thomas, Xavier', 'Boiron, Jean-Michel', 'Huguet, Francoise', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Bradstock, Ken', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Kovacsovics, Tibor', 'Delannoy, Andre', 'Fegueux, Nathalie', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Stamatoullas, Aspasia', 'Vernant, Jean-Paul', 'Tournilhac, Olivier', 'Buzyn, Agnes', 'Reman, Oumedaly', 'Charrin, Christiane', 'Boucheix, Claude', 'Gabert, Jean', 'Lheritier, Veronique', 'Fiere, Denis']","['Thomas X', 'Boiron JM', 'Huguet F', 'Dombret H', 'Bradstock K', 'Vey N', 'Kovacsovics T', 'Delannoy A', 'Fegueux N', 'Fenaux P', 'Stamatoullas A', 'Vernant JP', 'Tournilhac O', 'Buzyn A', 'Reman O', 'Charrin C', 'Boucheix C', 'Gabert J', 'Lheritier V', 'Fiere D']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Edouard Herriot, 69437, Lyon Cedex 03, France. xavier.thomas@chu-lyon.fr""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2004/09/09 05:00,2004/11/05 09:00,['2004/09/09 05:00'],"['2004/09/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/09 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2004 Oct 15;22(20):4075-86. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2004.10.050.

Most patients respond to treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and the majority harbor mutations in the neutrophil elastase gene. In the subset of patients with SCN transforming to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), mutations that truncate the cytoplasmic tail of the G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) have been detected. Here, we report a novel mutation in the extracellular portion of the G-CSFR within the WSXWS motif in a patient with SCN without AML who was refractory to G-CSF treatment. The mutation affected a single allele and introduced a premature stop codon that deletes the distal extracellular region and the entire transmembrane and cytoplasmic portions of the G-CSFR. Expression of the mutant receptor in either myeloid or lymphoid cells was shown to alter subcellular trafficking of the wild-type (WT) G-CSFR by constitutively heterodimerizing with it. WT/mutant G-CSFR heterodimers appeared to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and/or Golgi and accumulate intracellularly. These findings together with 2 previous case reports of extracellular mutations in the G-CSFR in patients with SCN unresponsive to G-CSF suggest a common mechanism underlying G-CSF refractoriness.","['Druhan, Lawrence J', 'Ai, Jing', 'Massullo, Pam', 'Kindwall-Keller, Tamila', 'Ranalli, Mark A', 'Avalos, Belinda R']","['Druhan LJ', 'Ai J', 'Massullo P', 'Kindwall-Keller T', 'Ranalli MA', 'Avalos BR']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dimerization', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/congenital/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Parents', 'Point Mutation', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology']",2004/09/09 05:00,2005/02/16 09:00,['2004/09/09 05:00'],"['2004/09/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/09 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jan 15;105(2):584-91. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-07-2613.

Jab1 promotes degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1) by transportation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. However, there has been no clear evidence for whether and how Jab1 contributes to malignant transformation in human cancers. Here we show that Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase facilitates the down-regulation of p27 by modulating complex formation of Jab1/CSN through the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3) kinase signaling pathways. Nearly half of the chronic myelogenous leukemia cell lines and the murine hematopoietic precursor cells expressing Bcr-Abl exhibited a marked increase in the small loose Jab1 complex located in the cytoplasm. Inhibition of Bcr-Abl kinase by STI571 induced G1 arrest and caused a recovery of the p27 level with reduction of the small Jab1 complex from the cytoplasm. Either blockade of the MAP kinase and PI3 kinase pathways by specific inhibitors or Jab1 knockdown by small interfering RNA (siRNA) prevented p27 down-regulation as well as formation of the small complex. Thus, regulation of p27 via modulation of the Jab1 subcomplex is a novel mechanism whereby Bcr-Abl oncogenic signals accelerate abnormal cell proliferation.","['Tomoda, Kiichiro', 'Kato, Jun-ya', 'Tatsumi, Eiji', 'Takahashi, Takayuki', 'Matsuo, Yoshinobu', 'Yoneda-Kato, Noriko']","['Tomoda K', 'Kato JY', 'Tatsumi E', 'Takahashi T', 'Matsuo Y', 'Yoneda-Kato N']","['Department of Animal Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Nara, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.-.- (COPS5 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (COP9 Signalosome Complex)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/physiology', 'COP9 Signalosome Complex', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'K562 Cells', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/physiology']",2004/09/09 05:00,2005/02/16 09:00,['2004/09/09 05:00'],"['2004/09/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/09 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jan 15;105(2):775-83. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-04-1242.

In a complex with CREB, Tax contacts the minor groove of the promoter DNA at guanine and cytosine rich sequences that flank three of the off-consensus cyclic-AMP response elements (CREs). In this study, we used six Tax-directed pyrrole-imidazole polyamides specifically designed to block Tax binding to DNA at each GC sequence of the three viral CREs. We found that four of these polyamides disrupt binding of the Tax/CREB complex in vitro, and that these same molecules also inhibit Tax-mediated transcription in vitro on chromatin-assembled templates. However, of these four Tax/CREB-specific polyamides, only one polyamide appears to be uniquely Tax specific. We show that polyamides can enter the nuclei of HTLV-1 infected T-cells, and two of the four polyamides down-regulated virion production in these cells. Together, these data illustrate the importance of studying polyamide inhibition of gene expression in vitro and in vivo, as the function of the polyamides in living cells is not fully understood. Finally, our data indicates that targeted disruption of the Tax/CREB complex, or other complexes which assemble on the HTLV-1 promoter, may provide a novel approach for inhibiting viral replication in vivo.","['Livengood, Jill A', 'Fechter, Eric J', 'Dervan, Peter B', 'Nyborg, Jennifer K']","['Livengood JA', 'Fechter EJ', 'Dervan PB', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523-1870, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Front Biosci,Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,9709506,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Nylons)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/virology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/*chemistry', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Insecta', 'Nylons/*chemistry', 'Polyamines/*chemistry', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', '*Virus Replication']",2004/09/09 05:00,2006/09/29 09:00,['2004/09/09 05:00'],"['2004/09/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/09 05:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Front Biosci. 2004 Sep 1;9:3058-67. doi: 10.2741/1459.,"['1459 [pii]', '10.2741/1459 [doi]']",20040901,"['R01 CA055035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA055035-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM51747/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA55035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have developed cell culture systems, infectious molecular clones, and viral vectors that can be used to characterize the mechanisms of HTLV-1 infection and replication. Infection with cell-free HTLV-1 virions is orders of magnitude less efficient compared with other retroviruses. This inefficiency is the result of a block in the replication process after the virion is bound to the cell surface.

DESIGN: A single centre descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Bismillah Taqee Institute of Health Sciences and Blood Diseases Centre from September 1999 to June 2004. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with haematological malignancies were included who had received allogeneic PBSC transplantation of Filgrastim (rhG-CSF) mobilized peripheral blood stem cells from HLA-identical siblings (except one 5/6 antigen sibling) with Busulphan and Cyclophosphamide standard conditioning therapy in all patients. No patient received antibiotics for gut decontamination. Empirical antibiotics included Ceftriaxone and Amikacin for febrile neutropenia, oral Itraconazole for antifungal prophylaxis while oral acyclovir was used for antiviral prophylaxis. All donors and recipients were CMV IgG positive Cyclosporin A / Methotrexate were given for graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis. Stem cells were harvested using Haemonetics MCS+ cell separator. All patients received G-CSF starting from day +4 until their neutrophil count rose to normal. RESULTS: There were 21 patients with age range of 8-38 years and male to female ratio of 2:1. Engraftment was achieved in all patients; median time to absolute neutrophil count of > 0.5 x 10(9)/l was 10 days (range 8 - 12 days) and platelet count of > 20 x 10(9)/l was 14 days (12-17 days). Acute graft versus host disease ( aGvHD) was seen in 7 patients; one patient had grade IV skin and hepatic GvHD; another patient had grade III gut GvHD, grade II GvHD was seen in 3 patients while grade I skin aGvHD was seen in 2 patients. Median hospital stay was 34 days. Treatment related mortality was seen in 3 patients (18%). Chronic GvHD was seen in 5 patients. Four more patients died during the follow-up period. Malaria was seen in 2 while tuberculosis developed in one case. Relapse was seen in 2 patients. The estimated probability of survival at one hundred day, at one year and five years was 82, 47 and 40 percent respectively. CONCLUSION: Haematopoietic stem cell transplant programme can be developed in a developed country setting. Post transplant complications are similar to what have been reported in the developed countries. In endemic areas malaria could prove to be fatal if not recognised and treated early.","['Shamsi, T S', 'Irfan, M', 'Ansari, S H', 'Farzana, T', 'Khalid, M Z', 'Panjwani, V K', 'Baig, M I', 'Shakoor, N']","['Shamsi TS', 'Irfan M', 'Ansari SH', 'Farzana T', 'Khalid MZ', 'Panjwani VK', 'Baig MI', 'Shakoor N']","['Department of Haematology, Bismillah Taqee Institute of Health Sciences & Blood Diseases Centre, Karachi. btbdc@cyber.net.pk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Pakistan,J Coll Physicians Surg Pak,Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons--Pakistan : JCPSP,9606447,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*surgery', 'Male', 'Pakistan', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*surgery', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/09/09 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/09 05:00'],"['2003/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/09 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Coll Physicians Surg Pak. 2004 Sep;14(9):522-6. doi: 09.2004/JCPSP.522526.,"['09.2004/JCPSP.522526 [doi]', '040579197 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a previous study, we reported that protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors modulate the radiation responses in the human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line K562. The receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, delayed radiation-induced cell death, while non-recepter tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A (HMA) enhances radiation-induced apoptosis. In this study, we focused on the modulation of radiation-induced cell death by genistein and performed PCR-select suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) to understand its molecular mechanism. We identified human thymidine kinase 1 (TK1), which is cell cycle regulatory gene and confirmed expression of TK1 mRNA by Northern blot analysis. Expression of TK1 mRNA and TK1 enzymatic activity were parallel in their increase and decrease. TK1 is involved in G1-S phase transition of cell cycle progression. In cell cycle analysis, we showed that radiation induced G2 arrest in K562 cells but it was not able to sustain. However, the addition of genistein to irradiated cells sustained a prolonged G2 arrest up to 120 h. In addition, the expression of cell cycle-related proteins, cyclin A and cyclin B1, provided the evidences of G1/S progression and G2-arrest, and their relationship with TK1 in cells treated with radiation and genistein. These results suggest that the activation of TK1 may be critical to modulate the radiation-induced cell death and cell cycle progression in irradiated K562 cells.","['Jeong, Min Ho', 'Jin, Young Hee', 'Kang, Eun Young', 'Jo, Wol Soon', 'Park, Hwan Tae', 'Lee, Jae Dong', 'Yoo, Yeo Jin', 'Jeong, Soo Jin']","['Jeong MH', 'Jin YH', 'Kang EY', 'Jo WS', 'Park HT', 'Lee JD', 'Yoo YJ', 'Jeong SJ']","['Research Supporting Center for Medical Science (BK21 program), Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Res,Cell research,9425763,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (thymidine kinase 1)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Cyclin A/metabolism', 'Cyclin B/metabolism', 'Cyclin B1', 'Enzyme Activation', 'G1 Phase/drug effects/genetics/radiation effects', 'G2 Phase/drug effects/genetics/radiation effects', 'Genes, cdc/drug effects/*physiology', 'Genistein/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/genetics/radiotherapy', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'S Phase/drug effects/genetics/radiation effects', 'Thymidine Kinase/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2004/09/09 05:00,2005/03/30 09:00,['2004/09/09 05:00'],"['2004/09/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/09 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Res. 2004 Aug;14(4):295-302. doi: 10.1038/sj.cr.7290230.,['10.1038/sj.cr.7290230 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study investigated the potential of bone marrow CD34(+) progenitors in MDS patients to proliferate and differentiate into dendritic cells (DCs) in a cytokine-supplemented liquid culture system and analysed the status of blood DC subsets in these patients. CD34(+) progenitors had low potential to generate DCs in vitro, as the number of DCs obtained from one CD34(+) cell was significantly lower compared with controls (median value 0.2 vs. 4, P = 0.003). In patients, the survival and proliferation of CD34(+) cells in culture was not correlated to the degree of apoptosis. Phenotypically and functionally CD34(+)-derived DCs were similar in MDS patients and normal subjects. The percentage of both circulating DC subsets in patients was extremely diminished compared with controls (myeloid DC: 0.10 +/- 0.10% vs. 0.35 +/- 0.13%, P < 0.001; plasmacytoid DC: 0.11 +/- 0.10% vs. 0.37 +/- 0.14%, P < 0.001). In cases with the 5q deletion both CD34-derived DCs and blood DCs harboured the cytogenetic abnormality. Our results indicate that, in MDS, the production of DCs is affected by the neoplastic process resulting in ineffective 'dendritopoiesis' with low blood DC precursor numbers.

In AML, two types of mutations in Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) have been described; internal tandem duplications (ITD) and point mutations at aspartic acid residue 835 (D835). We analysed 24 myeloid sarcoma specimens from 20 patients for FLT3 ITD and D835 mutations. FLT3 ITD mutations were identified in three of 20 cases (15%); no D835 mutations were identified. The ITD inserts ranged in size from 33 to 198 base pairs (bp) and represented approximately 20-40% of the FLT3 alleles. Two cases showed discordance in FLT3 ITD mutational status. In one case, the leukaemia specimen was positive for a FLT3 ITD mutation and the myeloid sarcoma specimen was negative. In the second case, the myeloid sarcoma was positive for a FLT3 ITD mutation at diagnosis, but negative in subsequent relapse samples. Our findings suggest that small molecule inhibitors of FLT3 may be useful therapeutic agents for treatment of myeloid sarcomas-containing FLT3 mutations, however, the potential for discordance between the leukaemia and myeloid sarcoma, necessitates that the myeloid sarcoma tumour itself be analysed for FLT3 mutations.","['Ansari-Lari, M Ali', 'Yang, Ching-Fen', 'Tinawi-Aljundi, Rima', 'Cooper, Lisa', 'Long, Patricia', 'Allan, Robert H', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Berg, Karin D', 'Murphy, Kathleen M']","['Ansari-Lari MA', 'Yang CF', 'Tinawi-Aljundi R', 'Cooper L', 'Long P', 'Allan RH', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Berg KD', 'Murphy KM']","['Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Point Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2004/09/09 05:00,2004/11/04 09:00,['2004/09/09 05:00'],"['2004/09/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/09 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Sep;126(6):785-91. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05124.x.,"['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05124.x [doi]', 'BJH5124 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we found that PF induces apoptosis in both murine T-lineage cells and human T-cell leukemia Jurkat cells. This apoptosis was mediated through the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspase, and fragmentation of DNA. Interestingly, PF induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a reducing agent, dithiothreitol (DTT), and a ROS scavenger, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), successfully attenuated the PF-induced apoptosis. Additionally, PF induced the phosphorylation of three mitogen-activated protein (MAP) family kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAP kinase. Curcumin, an anti-oxidant and JNK inhibitor, inhibited PF-induced apoptosis, suggesting the possible involvement of curcumin-sensitive JNK or other redox-sensitive elements in PF-induced apoptosis.

This include exposure to structures and appliances that emit in the extremely low frequency (ELF) range of the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as emission coming from communication devices using the radiofrequency part of the spectrum. Biological effects of such exposures have been noted frequently, although the implication for specific health effects is not that clear. The basic interaction mechanism(s) between such fields and living matter is unknown. Numerous hypotheses have been suggested, although none is convincingly supported by experimental data. Various cellular components, processes, and systems can be affected by EMF exposure. Since it is unlikely that EMF can induce DNA damage directly, most studies have examined EMF effects on the cell membrane level, general and specific gene expression, and signal transduction pathways. In addition, a large number of studies have been performed regarding cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation, cell differentiation, metabolism, and various physiological characteristics of cells. Although 50/60 Hz EMF do not directly lead to genotoxic effects, it is possible that certain cellular processes altered by exposure to EMF indirectly affect the structure of DNA causing strand breaks and other chromosomal aberrations. The aim of this article is to present a hypothesis of a possible initial cellular event affected by exposure to ELF EMF, an event which is compatible with the multitude of effects observed after exposure. Based on an extensive literature review, we suggest that ELF EMF exposure is able to perform such activation by means of increasing levels of free radicals. Such a general activation is compatible with the diverse nature of observed effects. Free radicals are intermediates in natural processes like mitochondrial metabolism and are also a key feature of phagocytosis. Free radical release is inducible by ionizing radiation or phorbol ester treatment, both leading to genomic instability. EMF might be a stimulus to induce an ""activated state"" of the cell such as phagocytosis, which then enhances the release of free radicals, in turn leading to genotoxic events. We envisage that EMF exposure can cause both acute and chronic effects that are mediated by increased free radical levels: (1) Direct activation of, for example macrophages (or other cells) by short-term exposure to EMF leads to phagocytosis (or other cell specific responses) and consequently, free radical production. This pathway may be utilized to positively influence certain aspects of the immune response, and could be useful for specific therapeutic applications. (2) EMF-induced macrophage (cell) activation includes direct stimulation of free radical production. (3) An increase in the lifetime of free radicals by EMF leads to persistently elevated free radical concentrations. In general, reactions in which radicals are involved become more frequent, increasing the possibility of DNA damage. (4) Long-term EMF exposure leads to a chronically increased level of free radicals, subsequently causing an inhibition of the effects of the pineal gland hormone melatonin. Taken together, these EMF induced reactions could lead to a higher incidence of DNA damage and therefore, to an increased risk of tumour development. While the effects on melatonin and the extension of the lifetime of radicals can explain the link between EMF exposure and the incidence of for example leukaemia, the two additional mechanisms described here specifically for mouse macrophages, can explain the possible correlation between immune cell system stimulation and EMF exposure.","['Simko, Myrtill', 'Mattsson, Mats-Olof']","['Simko M', 'Mattsson MO']","['Division of Environmental Physiology, Institute of Cell Biology and Biosystems Technology, University of Rostock, Albert-Einstein-Strasse 3, D-18059 Rostock, Germany. myrtill.simko@biologie.uni-rostock.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,['0 (Free Radicals)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Dendritic Cells/physiology', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Free Radicals/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune System/*physiology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Macrophage Activation/*physiology', 'Macrophages/*radiation effects']",2004/09/08 05:00,2005/02/23 09:00,['2004/09/08 05:00'],"['2004/09/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/08 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2004 Sep 1;93(1):83-92. doi: 10.1002/jcb.20198.,['10.1002/jcb.20198 [doi]'],,,76,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All three family members bind to serum response factor (SRF) and strongly activate transcription from promoters with SRF binding sites. SRF is required for the serum induction of immediate early genes such as c-fos and for the expression of many muscle specific genes. Consistent with a role in muscle specific gene expression, myocardin is specifically expressed in cardiac and smooth muscle cells while MKL1 and 2 are broadly expressed. Myocardin has particularly been shown to be required for smooth muscle development while MKL1/2 are required for the RhoA signaling pathway for induction of immediate early genes. SRF can be activated by at least two families of coactivators, p62TCF and myocardin/MKL. These factors bind to the same region of SRF such that their binding is mutually exclusive. This provides one mechanism of regulation of SRF target genes by pathways that differentially activate the coactivators. The RhoA pathway appears to activate MKL1 by altering MKL1's binding to actin and causing MKL1's translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. However, this mechanism of activation of the myocardin/MKL family has not been observed in all cell types such that other regulatory mechanism(s) likely exist. In particular, rapid serum inducible phosphorylation of MKL1 was observed. The regulation of this coactivator family is key to understanding how SRF target genes are activated during muscle cell differentiation or growth factor induced cell proliferation.","['Cen, Bo', 'Selvaraj, Ahalya', 'Prywes, Ron']","['Cen B', 'Selvaraj A', 'Prywes R']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MRTFA protein, human)', '0 (MRTFB protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (myocardin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Muscles/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Serum Response Factor/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2004/09/08 05:00,2005/02/23 09:00,['2004/09/08 05:00'],"['2004/09/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/08 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2004 Sep 1;93(1):74-82. doi: 10.1002/jcb.20199.,['10.1002/jcb.20199 [doi]'],,,36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The time between the acquisitions of the 3D images is in the order of minutes. Therefore, it is not to be expected that the cell as a whole remains fixed in the water basin on the stage. This superimposes a motion on the protein dynamics that has to be removed. We present a robust registration technique to align the cell images that does not require the a priori establishment of point-to-point correspondences. Instead, it uses the distribution of the labeled proteins. After correction for the translation, the 3D rotation of the cell is estimated. A robust intrinsic body coordinate system is constructed via the inertia tensor from the intensity distribution. By combining basis transformation to this intrinsic coordinate system, we can calculated the rotation matrix in a conceptual and computational straightforward manner. We have evaluated the performance of this approach in three experiments with human osteaosarcoma cells (U-2 OS), where the nuclear proteins Histon H4 and PML were visualized. The PML is concentrated in several dozen nuclear spots. Expression of Histon H4 results in a total nuclear staining. The registration results for both channels computed independently are very similar. Practically, this means that only the labeled material needs to be observed and still registration of the cell as a whole can be achieved.","['Rieger, B', 'Molenaar, C', 'Dirks, R W', 'Van Vliet, L J']","['Rieger B', 'Molenaar C', 'Dirks RW', 'Van Vliet LJ']","['Quantitative Imaging Group, Faculty of Applied Sciences, Delft University of Technology, 2628 CJ Delft, The Netherlands. rieger@ph.tn.tudelft.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Microsc Res Tech,Microscopy research and technique,9203012,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Nucleus/*physiology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Histones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*methods', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal/*methods', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2004/09/08 05:00,2004/10/16 09:00,['2004/09/08 05:00'],"['2004/09/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/08 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Microsc Res Tech. 2004 Jun 1;64(2):142-50. doi: 10.1002/jemt.20069.,['10.1002/jemt.20069 [doi]'],,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, confocal microscopy can help in the definition of functional pathways using multiparameter analysis. In this report, we present acquisition and analysis procedures to obtain high-resolution data from tissue sections. Confocal microscopy coupled to computational restoration, statistical evaluation of spatial correlations, and morphological analysis over large tissue areas were applied to colorectal samples providing a molecular fingerprint of the biological differences inferred from classical histological examination.","['Transidico, Pietro', 'Bianchi, Marco', 'Capra, Maria', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', 'Faretta, Mario']","['Transidico P', 'Bianchi M', 'Capra M', 'Pelicci PG', 'Faretta M']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, 20141 Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Microsc Res Tech,Microscopy research and technique,9203012,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 2)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Colon/*cytology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Histocytological Preparation Techniques', 'Histone Deacetylase 1', 'Histone Deacetylase 2', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Microscopy, Confocal/*methods', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Microtomy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Rectum/*cytology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2004/09/08 05:00,2004/10/16 09:00,['2004/09/08 05:00'],"['2004/09/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/08 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Microsc Res Tech. 2004 Jun 1;64(2):89-95. doi: 10.1002/jemt.20062.,['10.1002/jemt.20062 [doi]'],,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to Pgp and MRP, p53 mutation or inactivation might play a relevant role in therapeutic failure. Some studies have demonstrated that Pgp and MRP may be activated in association with overexpression of mutant or inactivated p53 protein. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between p53 expression and MDR functional phenotype analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM). METHODS: Rhodamine-123 assay analyzed by FCM was used to detect the MDR phenotype that was positive in 18 out of 41 (43.9%) cases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 16 out of 28 (57.1%) chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) cases, 11 out of 28 (39.3%) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases, and four out of 22 (18.2%) acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) cases. RESULTS: Variable levels of p53 expression were observed in leukemic cells: 12 out of 41 (29.2%) in CML, nine out of 28 (32.1%) in CLL, 15 out of 28 (53.6%) in AML, and eight out of 22 (36.4%) in ALL samples. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, no significant association between p53 expression and MDR functional phenotype was observed in ALL, CLL, and AML. On the other hand, a significant association (P = 0.0003) of the coexpression was observed in CML. The p53 overexpression was more frequently seen in the accelerated phase and the blastic phase of this disease. Our results suggest that an MDR functional phenotype could be associated with p53 mutation in the advanced stage of leukemias.","['Cavalcanti, Geraldo Barroso Jr', 'Vasconcelos, Flavia da Cunha', 'Pinto de Faria, Giselle', 'Scheiner, Marcos Antonio Mauricio', 'de Almeida Dobbin, Jane', 'Klumb, Claudete Esteves', 'Maia, Raquel C']","['Cavalcanti GB Jr', 'Vasconcelos FC', 'Pinto de Faria G', 'Scheiner MA', 'de Almeida Dobbin J', 'Klumb CE', 'Maia RC']","['Laboratorio de Hematologia Celular e Molecular, Servico de Hematologia, Hospital do Cancer I, Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Mice that lack PML NBs have impaired immune function, exhibit chromosome instability and are sensitive to carcinogens. Although their direct role in nuclear activity is unclear, PML NBs are implicated in the regulation of transcription, apoptosis, tumour suppression and the anti-viral response. An emerging view is that they represent sites where multi-subunit complexes form and where post-translational modification of regulatory factors, such as p53, occurs in response to cellular stress. Following DNA damage, several repair factors transit through PML NBs in a temporally regulated manner implicating these bodies in DNA repair. We propose that PML NBs are dynamic sensors of cellular stress, which rapidly disassemble following DNA damage into large supramolecular complexes, dispersing associated repair factors to sites of damage. The dramatically increased total surface area available would enhance interactions between PML-associated factors regulating DNA repair and apoptosis.","['Dellaire, Graham', 'Bazett-Jones, David P']","['Dellaire G', 'Bazett-Jones DP']","['Programme in Cell Biology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Bioessays,"BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology",8510851,,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/ultrastructure', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational']",2004/09/08 05:00,2004/10/01 05:00,['2004/09/08 05:00'],"['2004/09/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/09/08 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bioessays. 2004 Sep;26(9):963-77. doi: 10.1002/bies.20089.,['10.1002/bies.20089 [doi]'],,,100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although both donor and recipient were euthyroid and negative for thyroid autoimmunity before BMT, the donor was positive for anti-nuclear and anti-single strand DNA autoantibodies. Studies on polymorphism for variable number of tandem repeat region of T-cell receptor gene suggested that the lymphocytes responsible for the hyperthyroidism were of donor origin.

He had been clinically euthyroid before transplantation. Family history revealed that his mother and sister had a history of Graves' disease.

Using these mice as a model to define the gene expression profile underlying the pro-survival actions of IGF-I, we screened 243 apoptosis-related genes by cDNA arrays and found that Mcl-1 was down-regulated in cerebella of IGF-I Tg mice. Contrary to the results obtained by cDNA array, Northern blot analyses showed that the Mcl-1 mRNA abundance in the cerebella of IGF-I Tg mice at postnatal day 14 (P14) was five times more than that of wild-type (Wt) controls. The increase in Mcl-1 mRNA expression in IGF-I Tg mice was detected as early as P8, peaked at P14, and remained detectable at P20. Both IGF-I Tg and Wt mice showed a similar expression pattern of Mcl-1 mRNA which coincided with the post-mitotic migration and the post-migratory maturation of granule cells. We measured the relative abundance of Mcl-1 protein in the cerebellum by immunoblots and found that anti-apoptotic Mcl-1L was the predominant form, while pro-apoptotic Mcl-1S was minimally detectable. Cerebellar Mcl-1L was 2.6-fold more abundant in IGF-I Tg mice compared with that in their Wt littermates. Using laser capture microdissection followed by RT-PCR, we determined that Mcl-1 mRNA was expressed in granule cells, but not in Purkinje cells. In summary, these findings show that the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 isoform is expressed in cerebellar granule neurons, which undergo apoptosis during postnatal cerebellar cortical lamination, and Mcl-1 expression is up-regulated by IGF-I overexpression in a developmentally specific manner. These data suggest that anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 may mediate IGF-I pro-survival actions on granule neurons during the development of cerebellar cortex. They also point out pitfalls of cDNA array analyses.","['Zhang, Jihui', ""D'Ercole, A Joseph""]","['Zhang J', ""D'Ercole AJ""]","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Endocrinology, CB# 7039, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7039, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Brain Res Dev Brain Res,Brain research.

In this study, we evaluated the possible apoptotic effects of glycolic acid on human leukemia cell line (HL-60) in vitro. The morphological changes, cell viability, apoptosis induction, and caspase-3 activity were measured by phase microscopy, flow cytometry, and Western blot analysis. Morphological changes including shrinkage of cells were clearly demonstrated in HL-60 cells treated with increasing concentrations of glycolic acid. Cell viability was significantly affected by glycolic acid treatment in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In comparison to the control group, glycolic acid treatment had a profound effect in the induction of apoptosis by flow cytometric assays. In the cell cycle analysis, glycolic acid caused the increased percentage of cells in G2/M phase and the decreased expression of the cyclin A and cyclin B1, suggesting the induction of G2/M arrest of cell cycle by glycolic acid. Moreover, glycolic acid treatment promoted caspase-9 and -3 activity in a dose-dependent manner, but caspse-8 activity was not affected during the same process. Glycolic acid co-administrated with broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk, caspase-3 activity was blunted and apoptosis was also markedly blocked in HL-60 cells. In conclusion, glycolic acid-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells may be through the activation of caspase-3.

However, the mechanisms through which megakaryocytic progenitors are inhibited by stroma are poorly understood. We examined the role of sulfated glycoconjugates, such as proteoglycans (PGs), on human bone marrow stroma (hBMS). To this end, PG structure was altered by desulfation or enzymatic cleavage. PGs participated in adhesion of human HPC, as desulfation resulted in about 50% decline in adhesion to hBMS. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) were found to be responsible by showing about 25% decline in adhesion after pre-incubation of HPC with heparin and about 15% decline in adhesion after enzymatic removal of HSPGs from hBMS. Furthermore, PGs were involved in binding cytokines. Both desulfation and enzymatic removal of stromal HSPGs increased release of megakaryocytopoiesis-inhibiting cytokines, that is, interleukin-8 (IL-8, 1.9-fold increase) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha, 1.4-fold increase). The megakaryocytic output of HPC grown in conditioned medium of desulfated stroma was decreased to 50% of the megakaryocytic output in CM of sulfated stroma. From these studies, it can be concluded that PGs in bone marrow, in particular HSPGs, are involved in binding HPC and megakaryocytopoiesis-inhibiting cytokines. Bone marrow stromal PGs thus reduce differentiation of HPC toward megakaryocytes.","['Zweegman, Sonja', 'Van Den Born, Jakob', 'Mus, Adriana M C', 'Kessler, Floortje L', 'Janssen, Jeroen J W M', 'Netelenbos, Tanja', 'Huijgens, Peter C', 'Drager, Angelika M']","['Zweegman S', 'Van Den Born J', 'Mus AM', 'Kessler FL', 'Janssen JJ', 'Netelenbos T', 'Huijgens PC', 'Drager AM']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands. s.zweegman@vumc.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '147016-17-9 (PRG2 protein, human)', '9050-30-0 (Heparitin Sulfate)', 'EC 3.1.27.- (Eosinophil Major Basic Protein)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Blood Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL3', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Eosinophil Major Basic Protein', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Heparitin Sulfate/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/pharmacology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Proteoglycans/*pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/*pathology']",2004/09/08 05:00,2004/10/16 09:00,['2004/09/08 05:00'],"['2004/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/06 00:00 [revised]', '2004/09/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/08 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2004 Oct 1;299(2):383-92. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.06.018.,"['10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.06.018 [doi]', 'S0014-4827(04)00361-1 [pii]']",,,,,,['Copyright 2004 Elsevier Inc.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For efficient gene transfer, B- and T-cells were electroporated under optimized conditions. To blind out the high background of non-transfected cells and cell death caused by the electroporation procedure itself, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was co-transfected with the gene of interest. However, if the gene of interest was a potent apoptosis inducer, most successfully transfected cells were killed before GFP was expressed to levels sufficient for standard flow cytometry analysis or apoptosis assays. After staining of the transfected cells with propidium iodide (PI), very few GFP+/PI+ cells were detectable. To overcome this problem, the cell death rate induced by the transiently expressed gene was determined as the reduction of living green cells in the apoptotic versus a reference sample. This was achieved by an advanced flow cytometrical analysis quantifying the number of surviving green cells in normalised sample volumes directly relating to the number of initially transfected cells. Functioning of the assay was demonstrated by transient transfection of the potent apoptosis inducers TNF-receptor-associated death domain protein (TRADD) and a fusion protein of the transmembrane domain of the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of Epstein-Barr virus and the signaling domain of TNF-receptor 1. We successfully applied the assay to the Burkitt lymphoma cell line BJAB and the T-leukemia cell line Jurkat.","['Schneider, Frank', 'Kieser, Arnd']","['Schneider F', 'Kieser A']","['Department of Gene Vectors, GSF-National Research Center for Environment and Health, Marchioninistrasse 25, D-81377 Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Proteins)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', 'Caspases/physiology', 'Electroporation', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Proteins/analysis/genetics/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 1']",2004/09/08 05:00,2004/10/20 09:00,['2004/09/08 05:00'],"['2004/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/17 00:00 [revised]', '2004/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/08 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2004 Sep;292(1-2):165-74. doi: 10.1016/j.jim.2004.06.014.,"['10.1016/j.jim.2004.06.014 [doi]', 'S0022-1759(04)00231-5 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Occurrence of major-route abnormality was not associated with either duration of chronic phase or survival time after BC. Patients treated with interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) showed lower frequency of major-route abnormalities and lower number of abnormal chromosomes than did patients treated with busulfan (Bu). The frequency of trisomy 8 was lower and monosomy 7 was higher in IFNalpha-treated than in Bu-treated patients. The frequency of unusual abnormalities at BC in IFNalpha-treated patients was indistinguishable from those in Bu-treated patients and, notably, a more common (40%) feature in IFNalpha-treated patients was no change in the cytogenetic picture.

The expected proportion of false positive genes in a set of genes, called the False Discovery Rate (FDR), has been proposed to measure the statistical significance of this set. Various procedures exist for controlling the FDR. However the threshold (generally 5%) is arbitrary and a specific measure associated with each gene would be worthwhile. RESULTS: Using process intensity estimation methods, we define and give estimates of the local FDR, which may be considered as the probability for a gene to be a false positive. After a global assessment rule controlling the false positive error, the local FDR is a valuable guideline for deciding wether a gene is differentially expressed. The interest of the method is illustrated on three well known data sets. A R routine for computing local FDR estimates from p-values is available at http://www.inapg.fr/ens_rech/mathinfo/recherche/mathematique/outil.html. CONCLUSIONS: The local FDR associated with each gene measures the probability that it is a false positive. It gives the opportunity to compute the FDR of any given group of clones (of the same gene) or genes pertaining to the same regulation network or the same chromosomic region.","['Aubert, J', 'Bar-Hen, A', 'Daudin, J J', 'Robin, S']","['Aubert J', 'Bar-Hen A', 'Daudin JJ', 'Robin S']","['UMR INAPG/INRA/ENGREF 518, 16, rue C, Bernard, 75231 Paris, France. aubert@inapg.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,"['0 (Apolipoprotein A-I)', '0 (Cholesterol, HDL)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Apolipoprotein A-I/genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Cholesterol, HDL/blood/genetics', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*statistics & numerical data', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*statistics & numerical data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Research Design/statistics & numerical data']",2004/09/08 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/08 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/08 05:00 [entrez]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2004 Sep 6;5:125. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-5-125.,"['10.1186/1471-2105-5-125 [doi]', '1471-2105-5-125 [pii]']",20040906,,,PMC520755,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Remodeling of the XY chromatin is brought about by recruitment of specific proteins to the X and Y chromosomes during meiosis, and also by post-translational modifications of histones and other chromatin-associated proteins. Here, we demonstrate that SUMO, a small ubiquitin-related modifier protein that regulates a wide variety of nuclear functions in somatic cells, dramatically localizes to the XY body. SUMO was first detected in the XY body of early pachytene spermatocytes and gradually accumulated, reaching maximal levels there during the mid to late pachytene stages. Several known SUMO substrates, including PML and DAXX, were also found to accumulate in the XY body of mid to late stage pachytene spermatocytes. These same proteins localize to PML nuclear bodies of somatic interphase nuclei.

As such, the current study examined various parameters, including the cytogenetics at presentation and clinical disease status at transplantation, regarding their effect on the transplant outcomes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients in an allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) setting. A total of 36 patients receiving an allogeneic PBSCT from matched sibling donors were included in a state of first complete remission (CR) (n=22, 61%) or beyond the first CR (n=14, 39%). The cytogenetic risk was classified according to Medical Research Council (MRC) 10 criteria: favorable, 7 patients (20%); intermediate, 21 patients (58%); unfavorable eight patients (22%). The 3-year overall survival rates were 80% for the favorable, 63% for the intermediate, and 0% for the unfavorable cytogenetic risk groups (p=0.0002), and 62% for the patients in a state of first CR and 35% for those beyond the first CR (p=0.0524). Multivariate analysis revealed that higher CD34+ cell doses, favorable cytogenetics at presentation, and a lower marrow blast percentage at transplantation were all strongly associated with favorable transplant outcomes, including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and the probability of progression. The cytogenetic risk at presentation was found to be a useful parameter in predicting the transplant outcomes for patients with AML, regardless of the clinical disease status. However, an additive innovative therapeutic strategy is still needed to overcome an unfavorable cytogenetic risk with refractory AML after allogeneic PBSCT.","['Kim, Dong Hwan', 'Sohn, Sang Kyun', 'Kim, Jong Gwang', 'Lee, Nan Young', 'Sung, Woo Jin', 'Baek, Jin Ho', 'Suh, Jang Soo', 'Lee, Kun Soo', 'Lee, Kyu Bo']","['Kim DH', 'Sohn SK', 'Kim JG', 'Lee NY', 'Sung WJ', 'Baek JH', 'Suh JS', 'Lee KS', 'Lee KB']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Jung-gu, 700-721 Daegu, South Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', '*Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/09/07 05:00,2005/05/18 09:00,['2004/09/07 05:00'],"['2004/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/07 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2005 Jan;84(1):25-32. doi: 10.1007/s00277-004-0942-z.

We utilized two probe panels for interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies to enhance the ability to detect genetic abnormalities in samples that were referred for routine cytogenetic studies for possible diagnoses of CLL or MM. The CLL panel consisted of probes for 11q22.3 (ATM gene), 13q14 (D13S319), the centromere of chromosome 12 (D12Z3) and 17p13.1 (P53 gene). The MM panel included probes for 14q32 (IgH gene) and/or t(11:14)(q13;q32) (BCL1/IgH), 13q14 (D13S319) and 17p13.1 (P53 gene). FISH detected clonal aberrations not identified by conventional cytogenetics in an additional 8 of 23 (35%) samples referred for possible CLL and 7 of 42 (17%) samples with possible MM. The prognostic significance of the aberrations identified ranged from favorable, to intermediate, to poor. Our studies indicate that many samples referred for routine cytogenetics testing for CLL and MM yield normal results for both conventional and FISH testing, likely due to lack of definitive diagnosis in a percentage of cases. However, FISH is more sensitive for the detection of clinically significant chromosome abnormalities and should be the testing methodology of choice for these disorders.","['Cady, Francois M', 'Muto, Deidra N', 'Ciabeterri, Gena', 'Johns, Alan', 'Gainey Church, Keisha', 'Wolff, Daynna J']","['Cady FM', 'Muto DN', 'Ciabeterri G', 'Johns A', 'Gainey Church K', 'Wolff DJ']","['Department of Pathology and Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) Laboratory Medicine, 165 Ashley Avenue, Suite 309, Charleston, SC 29425. wolffd@musc.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Assoc Genet Technol,Journal of the Association of Genetic Technologists,9807282,,,,2004/09/07 05:00,2004/09/07 05:01,['2004/09/07 05:00'],"['2004/09/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/07 05:01 [medline]', '2004/09/07 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Assoc Genet Technol. 2004;30(3):77-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data from Tianjin Cancer Hospital was analyzed for mortality of leukemia in children under 20 years from 1981 to 2000 in the city of Tianjin. METHODS: All physicians and medical staff of the hospitals and clinics in the registry area were responsible for filling out the report forms for every new case diagnosed as malignant tumors. Death certificates for malignant tumors have been registered at the local police station and the residential files were checked. All cancer cases with insufficient information were traced to his/her family and relevant persons worked in the clinic. Tianjin Cancer Registry Center periodically conducted an active re-checking program to review all patient records on cancers that was not registered in this period. Tumors diagnosed in this study were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O). Mortality rates were calculated by age, sex and date of death. RESULTS: The types of acute lymphoid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia were the most common types of childhood leukemia in Tianjin, comprised 69.3%, 20.9 % and 8.0%, respectively. The mortality for childhood leukemia decreased slowly during the period of 1981 to 2000 in Tianjin. Mortality and morbidity ratios were 0.51.

METHODS: Clonal IgH gene rearrangements of samples at diagnosis were identified by standard PCR assay with consensus primers. Monoclonal IgH gene rearrangements were analyzed using DNAPLOT software. Upstream primers were designed with the Primer Express software and allele specific oligonucleotide developed complementary to the V-D or D-J junction. Samples at diagnosis were serially diluted to generate the patient specific standard curves. RQ-PCR method was used to quantify the MRD of the follow up samples collected at five time points during chemotherapy. To check the quantity and quality of DNA, the investigators used RQ-PCR analysis for the albumin gene. RESULTS: Totally 16 monoclonal IgH gene rearrangements were identified from 34 patients with B-ALL. The analysis of the 16 monoclonal rearrangements showed that the most frequently used V segment was from V3 family and J segment from J4 and J6. The RQ-PCR sensitivity of 10(-4) to 10(-5) was mostly reached. Non-specific amplification was seen in 6 patients. The number of inserted and deleted nucleotides did not appear to be related to the sensitivity (P > 0.05). The correlation coefficients of all 16 standard curves were excellent (> or = 0.99). The mean slope of the standard curves was -3.4 +/- 0.37 and the mean intercept was 24.3 +/- 2.95. MRD analysis of follow up samples from the 16 patients showed an association between high degree of MRD and relapse. There was no apparent relationship between MRD degree at the end of induction chemotherapy and other high risk factors of ALL (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The study showed that the above approach with RQ-PCR was applicable to clinical detection of MRD in childhood ALL. Quantitative and dynamic study of MRD was of prognostic importance.","['Jia, Yue-Ping', 'Liu, Gui-Lan', 'Zhang, Le-Ping']","['Jia YP', 'Liu GL', 'Zhang LP']","[""Department of Pediatrics, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,,IM,"['Child', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Prognosis']",2004/09/07 05:00,2010/06/02 06:00,['2004/09/07 05:00'],"['2004/09/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2004/09/07 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2004 Aug;42(8):600-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: PEG-rHuMGDF was intravenously administered to healthy volunteers and patients with ITP, AML, MDS, and AA. The serum concentration of PEG-rHuMGDF was measured and the pharmacokinetics was investigated using non-linear mixed-effects modeling technique. RESULTS: The systemic clearance (CL) and volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) consistently decreased in the healthy subjects, when the dose increased. In AML patients, CL and Vss decreased when the dose increased, but the change of CL was not statistically significant. In contrast, no significant dose dependency of these parameter estimates was observed in MDS patients. In AA patients there was no significant change in Vss but the CL of the higher dose groups was slightly smaller than that of the lower dose groups. Relatively smaller CL and Vss in ITP patients than those of healthy volunteers at the same dose were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This saturable pathway of CL may involve the receptor-mediated endocytosis and degradation by megakaryocyte lineage cells and platelets. The saturable distribution space can be also explained by the receptors on hematopoietic cells. The non-saturable distribution space corresponds to the value of plasma and interstitial fluid volume.","['Tanaka, Hideji', 'Takama, Hirotaka', 'Arai, Yasumasa', 'Azuma, Junichi', 'Ohno, Ryuzo', 'Ikeda, Yasuo', 'Mizoguchi, Hideaki']","['Tanaka H', 'Takama H', 'Arai Y', 'Azuma J', 'Ohno R', 'Ikeda Y', 'Mizoguchi H']","['Pharmaceutical Division, Kirin Brewery Company, Ltd, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo, Japan. hidejit@kirin.co.jp']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Placebos)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (polyethylene glycol-recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development', 'factor)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Hematologic Diseases/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Placebos', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Proteins/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Single-Blind Method', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",2004/09/07 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/07 05:00'],"['2004/09/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/07 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2004 Oct;73(4):269-79. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00288.x.,"['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00288.x [doi]', 'EJH288 [pii]']",,,,,,['Copyright Blackwell Munksgaard 2004.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Molecular follow-up was carried out on 24 CML patients treated with imatinib. FISH analysis was performed according to the standard protocol. For RT-PCR the multiplex and RQ-PCR methods were used. RESULTS: Sixty-three percent and 52% of the patients achieved complete remission according to FISH and multiplex RT-PCR analyses, respectively. Seventy-five percent of the patients achieved remission within the first year of treatment. In 83% of the cases the FISH and RT-PCR results were concordant.

Although RQ-PCR is the most sensitive method for molecular follow-up, FISH and multiplex RT-PCR can be used as complementary tools, at least during the early period of treatment.","['Raanani, Pia', 'Ben-Bassat, Isaac', 'Gan, Shlomit', 'Trakhtenbrot, Luba', 'Mark, Ziva', 'Ashur-Fabian, Osnat', 'Itskovich, Svetlana', 'Brok-Simoni, Frida', 'Rechavi, Gideon', 'Amariglio, Ninette', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Raanani P', 'Ben-Bassat I', 'Gan S', 'Trakhtenbrot L', 'Mark Z', 'Ashur-Fabian O', 'Itskovich S', 'Brok-Simoni F', 'Rechavi G', 'Amariglio N', 'Nagler A']","['The Institute of Hematology, The Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel. praanani@012.net.il']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",2004/09/07 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/07 05:00'],"['2004/09/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/07 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2004 Oct;73(4):243-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00287.x.,"['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00287.x [doi]', 'EJH287 [pii]']",,,,,,['Copyright Blackwell Munksgaard 2004.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Assessing the drug resistance of leukemic cells is therefore an important aspect of treatment. One of the main mechanisms of resistance is rapid drug efflux mediated by various members of the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily, such as multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1), which encodes P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 1 and lung resistance protein. To quantify the degree of acquisition of resistance, several techniques, including drug-sensitivity studies, flow cytometry assay and quantitative gene analysis, have been developed to detect MDR1 and MRP1 gene expression in leukemic cells. However, a significant number of patients may relapse in spite of low expression of MDR1 or MRP1, suggesting the involvement of other intracellular mechanisms, possibly related to cytarabine resistance. This review focuses on the methods aimed at the assessment of drug resistance in acute myeloid leukemia.","['Funato, Tadao', 'Harigae, Hideo', 'Abe, Syouri', 'Sasaki, Takeshi']","['Funato T', 'Harigae H', 'Abe S', 'Sasaki T']","['Division of Molecular Diagnostics, Department of Internal Medicine, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Seiryomachi 1-1, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8574, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Mol Diagn,Expert review of molecular diagnostics,101120777,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles/genetics/metabolism']",2004/09/07 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/07 05:00'],"['2004/09/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/07 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Expert Rev Mol Diagn. 2004 Sep;4(5):705-13. doi: 10.1586/14737159.4.5.705.,"['ERM040515 [pii]', '10.1586/14737159.4.5.705 [doi]']",,,55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A report from the Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Italy, 1967-1998.",313-9,"UNLABELLED: The population-based Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont (CCRP) has collected data on incidence since 1967. The occurrence of early death (i.e. within 30 days of diagnosis) was investigated in 3006 cases of childhood cancer diagnosed during the period 1967-1998. The proportion of early deaths (178 of the 3006 cases) was analysed by period of diagnosis (three decennial periods), age group, major diagnostic group and hospital category, with univariate statistics and logistic regression. The proportion of children with cancer who died within 1 month of diagnosis was 10.8%, 5.3% and 1.8% for cases diagnosed during 1967-1978, 1979-1988 and 1989-1998, respectively. This trend may reflect earlier diagnosis, improved diagnosis, more effective therapy or more frequent referral to specialised centres. The risk factors for early death were: age <1 year and diffuse disease at diagnosis, diagnosis during 1967-1978, a diagnosis of acute non lymphocytic leukaemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, central nervous system tumour or hepatic tumour. Early death was not related to the sex of the child. Care in an extra-regional specialised centre was associated with lower risk of early death. CONCLUSION: No temporal changes in early mortality were found among children with acute non lymphocytic leukaemia diagnosed in the first, second or third decade of activity of the CCRP, the percentages of children dying within 1 month being 12.8%, 10.7% and 12.8%, respectively.

But recent reports indicated that some non-phagocytic cells also have the NADPH oxidase activity, and the ROS produced by it may act as cell signal molecule. But as far as today, whether the NADPH oxidase also plays similar role in phagocyte has not been paid much attention. Utilizing the undifferentiated HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells as a model, the aim of the present study was to determine whether NADPH oxidase plays a role on ROS generation in undifferentiated HL-60, and the ROS mediated by it was essential for cell's survival. For the first time, we verified that the release of ROS in undifferentiated HL-60 was significantly increased by the stimulation with Calcium ionophore or opsonized zymosan, which are known to trigger respiration burst in phagocytes by NADPH oxidase pathway. Diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or apocynin (APO), two inhibitors of NADPH oxidase, significantly suppressed the increasing of ROS caused by opsonized zymosan. Cell survival assay and fluorescence double dyeing with acridine orange and ethidium bromide showed that DPI and APO, as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) concentration-dependently decreased the viability of undifferentiated HL-60 cells, whereas exogenous H2O2 can rescue the cells from death obviously. Our results suggested that the ROS, generated by NADPH oxidase play an essential role in the survival of undifferentiated HL-60 cells.","['Dong, Jing-Mei', 'Zhao, Sheng-Guo', 'Huang, Guo-Yin', 'Liu, Qing']","['Dong JM', 'Zhao SG', 'Huang GY', 'Liu Q']","[""Department of Physical, Lanzhou Teacher's College, Lanzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Free Radic Res,Free radical research,9423872,"['0 (Acetophenones)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Onium Compounds)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '6HJ411TU98 (diphenyleneiodonium)', '9010-72-4 (Zymosan)', 'B6J7B9UDTR (acetovanillone)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)']",IM,"['Acetophenones/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidases/*metabolism', 'Onium Compounds/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Zymosan/pharmacology']",2004/09/07 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/07 05:00'],"['2004/09/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/07 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Free Radic Res. 2004 Jun;38(6):629-37. doi: 10.1080/10715760410001694053.,['10.1080/10715760410001694053 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is generally recommended not to administer DOX or DNR to patients in doses greater than 500 mg/sqm or 700 mg/sqm, respectively. the aim of the study was to follow up cardiotoxicity and efficacy of DNR or DOX above these limits in the 2nd complete remission (CR) patients pretreated with anthracyclines when they were given 30 minutes after cardioprotective agent dexrazoxane (DRZ) in the ratio 1:10 of DZR. RESULTS: Two patients (54 and 53 years old) with mantle cell or diffuse large cell B-NHL, stage IV, who had relapsed after 6-8 cycles of classical CHOP therapy, reached their 2nd CR after 2-3 cycles of IDEA therapy (ifosfamide 1000 mg/sqm/day x 4, dexamethasone 30 mg/sqm/day x 4, etoposide 75 mg/sqm/day x 4, DOX 30 mg/sqm/day on days 1 and 3). Then they received further 3 cycles IDEA with DRZ 300 mg/sqm before every dose of DOX. After cumulative doses of DOX 600 mg/sqm and 700 mg/sqm these patients survived 12 months in their 2nd CR without significant signs of cardiotoxicity, even after their successful autologous peripheral stem cells transplantation. Their left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) remained above 60%.

The CD56bright population had cytoplasmic granzyme A but lacked killer inhibitory receptor, suggesting they were immature NK cells. The CD56dim, CD33+, population lacked NK markers. They may represent a minor subset of normal monocytes at a developmental stage comparable with the rare CD56+ CD33+ hybrid myeloid/NK cell leukemia. Consistent with a monocyte nature, CD56dimCD33+ proliferated and produced a variety of cytokines upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation, including IL-8, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and macrophage-derived chemokine but not interferon-gamma. In a short-term cytotoxicity assay, they failed to kill but powerfully inhibited the proliferation of the NK-resistant cell line P815.

Established immunoassays measure a combination of uPAR forms. Our aim was to design immunoassays for specific quantification of the individual forms of uPAR. METHODS: Using appropriate combinations of epitope-mapped monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) for capture and europium-labeled detection Mabs, we designed two-site sandwich time-resolved fluorescence immunoassays (TR-FIAs): TR-FIA 1 to measure uPAR(I-III) alone; TR-FIA 2 to measure both uPAR(I-III) and uPAR(II-III); and TR-FIA 3 to measure uPAR(I). To avoid detection of uPAR(I-III) in TR-FIA 3, we used a combination of the peptide uPAR antagonist AE120 and a domain I antibody, R3. AE120 blocks the binding of R3 to uPAR(I-III). In contrast, AE120 does not interact with liberated domain I and therefore does not interfere with the binding of R3 to uPAR(I). RESULTS: The limits of quantification (CV <20%) determined by adding the proteins to uPAR-depleted plasma were <3 pmol/L in all three assays. The interassay CVs in plasma with added analytes were <11%, and recoveries were between 93% and 105%. Cross-reactivities of purified proteins in the three TR-FIAs were no more than 4%. Studies on chymotrypsin cleavage of uPAR and size-exclusion chromatography of plasma with and without added protein further supported the specificity of the assays. CONCLUSIONS: The three novel TR-FIAs accurately quantify uPAR(I-III) alone, uPAR(I-III) together with uPAR(II-III), and uPAR(I), respectively, in biological samples, including plasma, and thus are well suited for studies of the diagnostic and prognostic value of individual uPAR forms in cancer patients.","['Piironen, Timo', 'Laursen, Birgitte', 'Pass, Jesper', 'List, Karin', 'Gardsvoll, Henrik', 'Ploug, Michael', 'Dano, Keld', 'Hoyer-Hansen, Gunilla']","['Piironen T', 'Laursen B', 'Pass J', 'List K', 'Gardsvoll H', 'Ploug M', 'Dano K', 'Hoyer-Hansen G']","['Finsen Laboratory, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', 'EC 3.4.21.1 (Chymotrypsin)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Chymotrypsin/chemistry', 'Cross Reactions', 'Fluoroimmunoassay', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/urine', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/blood/diagnosis', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*analysis/blood/chemistry', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/*metabolism']",2004/09/04 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/04 05:00'],"['2004/09/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/04 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2004 Nov;50(11):2059-68. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2004.038232.

N-benzoyl staurosporine (PKC412), a highly effective inhibitor of mutated FLT3 receptors, has significant antileukemic efficacy in patients with FLT3-mutated AML. Mutation screening of FLT3 exon 20 in AML patients (n = 110) revealed 2 patients with a novel mutation (Y842C) within the highly conserved activation loop of FLT3. FLT3-Y842C-transfected 32D cells showed constitutive FLT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and interleukin 3 (IL-3)-independent growth. Treatment with PKC412 led to inhibition of proliferation and apoptotic cell death. Primary AML blasts bearing FLT3-Y842C mutations showed constitutive FLT3 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT-5) tyrosine phosphorylation. Ex vivo PKC412 treatment of primary blasts resulted in suppression of constitutive FLT3 and STAT-5 activation and apoptotic cell death. Inspection of the FLT3 structure revealed that Y842 is the key residue in regulating the switch from the closed to the open (= active) conformation of the FLT3 activation loop. Overall, our data suggest that mutations at Y842 represent a significant new activating mutation in AML blasts. Since FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as PKC412 are currently being investigated in clinical trials in AML, extended sequence analysis of FLT3 may be helpful in defining the spectrum of TKI-sensitive FLT3 mutations in AML.","['Kindler, Thomas', 'Breitenbuecher, Frank', 'Kasper, Stefan', 'Estey, Eli', 'Giles, Francis', 'Feldman, Eric', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Schiller, Gary', 'Klimek, Virginia', 'Nimer, Stephen D', 'Gratwohl, Alois', 'Choudhary, Chuna Ram', 'Mueller-Tidow, Constan', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Gschaidmeier, Harald', 'Cohen, Pamela S', 'Huber, Christoph', 'Fischer, Thomas']","['Kindler T', 'Breitenbuecher F', 'Kasper S', 'Estey E', 'Giles F', 'Feldman E', 'Ehninger G', 'Schiller G', 'Klimek V', 'Nimer SD', 'Gratwohl A', 'Choudhary CR', 'Mueller-Tidow C', 'Serve H', 'Gschaidmeier H', 'Cohen PS', 'Huber C', 'Fischer T']","['Johannes-Gutenberg University Mainz, 3rd Med Department, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Milk Proteins/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/genetics/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2004/09/04 05:00,2005/02/11 09:00,['2004/09/04 05:00'],"['2004/09/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/04 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jan 1;105(1):335-40. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-02-0660.

However, patients in CCR usually demonstrate evidence of residual BCR-ABL-positive progenitors. The mechanisms underlying persistence of small numbers of malignant progenitors in imatinib-sensitive patients are unclear. BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations affecting drug binding can lead to secondary resistance to imatinib. We show here that kinase mutations could be detected in CD34+ cells isolated from CML patients in CCR on imatinib. Most mutations seen have not been reported in previous clinical studies. Interestingly, several of the involved amino acid positions have been implicated in an in vitro mutagenesis screen. These BCR-ABL mutations were associated with varying levels of imatinib resistance. Two of 5 patients in whom mutations were detected on initial evaluation have relapsed. In addition, 4 patients in whom mutations were not initially detected, but with rising BCR-ABL mRNA levels on quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) analysis, had mutations detected on follow-up evaluation. We conclude that BCR-ABL kinase mutations can be detected in CD34+ cells from CML patients in CCR on imatinib, may contribute to persistence of small populations of malignant progenitors, and could be a potential source of relapse.","['Chu, Su', 'Xu, Helen', 'Shah, Neil P', 'Snyder, David S', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Sawyers, Charles L', 'Bhatia, Ravi']","['Chu S', 'Xu H', 'Shah NP', 'Snyder DS', 'Forman SJ', 'Sawyers CL', 'Bhatia R']","['Division of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Remission Induction']",2004/09/04 05:00,2005/03/25 09:00,['2004/09/04 05:00'],"['2004/09/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/04 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Mar 1;105(5):2093-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-03-1114.

In the present study we investigated the effect of N-rasm in human primary hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC). METHODS: Cord blood CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) were transduced with retroviral vectors containing green fluorescence protein (GFP) alone, or in combination with N-rasm. Cells were then cultured in vitro with a cytokine supplement or cocultured with murine stroma MS-5 cells. The in vivo behavior of transduced cells was examined in the NOD/SCID mouse model. RESULTS: N-rasm-transduced cells exhibited greater proliferative capacity; a higher frequency of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM); and an increase in myelomonocytic lineage cells with a concomitant decrease in lymphoid and erythroid cells. Analysis of transduced HPC in NOD/SCID mice revealed higher bone marrow engraftment by N-rasm HPC and increased numbers of myeloid lineage cells.

Although limitin uses the IFN-alpha/beta receptor, its signal transduction pathways to express the antiviral effects are different from those of IFN-alpha. To clarify the characteristics of limitin, we compared the biological activities of limitin, such as the antiviral, immunomodulatory, antitumor, and myelosuppressive effects, with IFN-alpha. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Limitin and IFN-alpha were titered with a cytopathic effect dye binding assay. Induction of MHC class I on a keratinocyte cell line PAM212 was estimated with flow cytometry. Induction of OVA-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity was analyzed with 51Cr release assay. Antiproliferative effects were evaluated with 3H-thymidine incorporation assay using WEHI3 and a lymphoblast cell line L1210. Myelosuppresive effects were evaluated with colony assay. In vivo side effects were estimated after the injection of limitin or IFN-alpha. RESULTS: Limitin had relatively higher antiviral activity than IFN-alpha. Limitin induced the surface expression of MHC class I, the enhancement of CTL activity, and the growth inhibition of lymphohematopoietic cell lines as strong as IFN-alpha. Nevertheless, the treatment of mice with limitin showed neither myelosuppression nor fever that are common adverse effects of IFN-alpha. CONCLUSIONS: Strong immunomodulatory, antitumor, and antiviral effects with weak myelosuppressive and weak acute toxic effects of limitin indicate that it may be useful as a new therapeutic drug for virus-hepatitis and cancers.","['Kawamoto, Shin-ichiro', 'Oritani, Kenji', 'Asakura, Eiji', 'Ishikawa, Jun', 'Koyama, Mamoru', 'Miyano, Kenmi', 'Iwamoto, Minori', 'Yasuda, Shin-ichiro', 'Nakakubo, Hirosi', 'Hirayama, Fumihiro', 'Ishida, Naoko', 'Ujiie, Hidetoshi', 'Masaie, Hiroaki', 'Tomiyama, Yoshiaki']","['Kawamoto S', 'Oritani K', 'Asakura E', 'Ishikawa J', 'Koyama M', 'Miyano K', 'Iwamoto M', 'Yasuda S', 'Nakakubo H', 'Hirayama F', 'Ishida N', 'Ujiie H', 'Masaie H', 'Tomiyama Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Molecular Science, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (limitin)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",2004/09/04 05:00,2004/10/22 09:00,['2004/09/04 05:00'],"['2003/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/17 00:00 [revised]', '2004/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/04 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2004 Sep;32(9):797-805. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2004.06.008.,"['10.1016/j.exphem.2004.06.008 [doi]', 'S0301-472X(04)00207-3 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as a powerful alternative vertebrate model for the study of development and disease. We review the recent application of zebrafish to the study of white blood cell development and its disruption, particularly leukemogenesis. Such studies have highlighted the overall conservation of these processes throughout vertebrates, and establish zebrafish as a useful experimental model.

The latter included patients with breast cancer (BrCa; n = 8), Hodgkin disease (HD; n = 4), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; n = 3), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 3). Progenitor cells from normal bone marrow (BM) and umbilical cord blood (UCB) were included as controls. HPC, enriched by a negative selection procedure, were cultured for 25 days, in serum-free liquid media in the presence of a cytokine combination including early- and late-acting cytokines. Our results demonstrate that the in vitro biological properties of progenitor cells present in MPB differ, depending on whether they are derived from healthy individuals, from patients with solid tumors, or from patients with hematological neoplasias. Among all cell sources analyzed, UCB-derived progenitors showed the greatest proliferation and expansion potentials (1000-fold increase in total cell numbers on day 15, and a 22-fold increase in myeloid progenitor cell numbers, at day 10). Progenitor cells present in MPB from hematologically normal individuals showed proliferation and expansion potentials comparable to those of HPC from normal BM (500-fold increase in total cell numbers on day 15, and a 14-fold increase in myeloid progenitor cell numbers, at day 10). The proliferation/expansion potentials of MPB progenitors from BrCa patients were also within the normal range, although in the lower levels (327-fold increase in total cell numbers, on day 15, and 11.8-fold increase in myeloid progenitors, at day 10). In contrast, progenitors present in MPB from patients with HD, NHL, and especially AML, showed reduced in vitro capacities (119-, 102-, and 51-fold increase in total cell numbers, respectively; and 8-, 4-, and 2.6-fold increase in myeloid progenitor cells, respectively).

A total of 39 consecutive CD34(+) ICS were performed with the Isolex 300i (Baxter) device on 39 LKF from 9 HLA haploidentical donors and 20 patients.

Both simple total array intensity-based as well as more complex ""local intensity level"" dependent normalization methods have been developed, some of which are widely used. Much less developed methods for microarray data analysis include those that bypass the normalization step and therefore yield results that are not confounded by potential normalization errors. RESULTS: Instead of focusing on the raw intensity levels, we developed a new method for microarray data analysis that maps each gene's expression intensity level to a high dimensional space of SEDs (Signs of Expression Difference), the signs of the expression intensity difference between a given gene and every other gene on the array. Since SED are unchanged under any monotonic transformation of intensity levels, the SED based method is normalization free. When tested on a multi-class tumor classification problem, simple Naive Bayes and Nearest Neighbor methods using the SED approach gave results comparable with normalized intensity-based algorithms. Furthermore, a high percentage of classifiers based on a single gene's SED gave good classification results, suggesting that SED does capture essential information from the intensity levels. CONCLUSION: The results of testing this new method on multi-class tumor classification problems suggests that the SED-based, normalization-free method of microarray data analysis is feasible and promising.","['Wang, Huajun', 'Huang, Hui']","['Wang H', 'Huang H']","['Oscient Pharmaceuticals Corporation, 100 Beaver St, Waltham, Massachusetts 02453, USA. hw14@columbia.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Validation Study']",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['Central Nervous System Neoplasms/classification', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genes, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification', 'Lymphoma/classification', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/classification/genetics', 'Normal Distribution', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/classification', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/classification']",2004/09/04 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/04 05:00'],"['2004/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/04 05:00 [entrez]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2004 Sep 2;5:121. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-5-121.,"['10.1186/1471-2105-5-121 [doi]', '1471-2105-5-121 [pii]']",20040902,"['R44 AG022242/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R44 AG022242-01/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC517708,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the reported doses of VP-16 were different. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of a VP-16 (at less than the usual dose)/CY/TBI regimen for adults with hematological malignancies who are required to receive allo-BMT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients received VP-16, CY and TBI (VP/CY/TBI) as a preconditioning regimen for allo-BMT. Twenty-one patients were in first complete remission (1CR), six patients were in second remission (2CR) and 11 patients were in non-remission status (non-CR) before allo-BMT. These patients received allo-BMT from related donors (n=14) and unrelated donors (n=24). The preconditioning regimen consisted of VP-16 (15 mg/kg/d for 2 d), CY (60 mg/kg/d for 2 d) and 12 Gy TBI in six fractions for 3 d. RESULTS: Two patients died on day 30 after transplantation. The median follow-up period for all patients was 35.0 months (range 0.8-159.6 months). At the time of analysis, 10 patients had died. Seven of those 10 patients died because of relapse. The estimated 5-yr disease-free survival (DFS) rates for all cases and acute myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases were 73.6, 66.7 and 100%, respectively. The estimated 5-yr DFS rates for 1CR, 2CR and non-CR cases were 90.5, 83.3 and 40.9%, respectively (p < 0.05).

MCL-1 is involved in viability and immortalization of normal and neoplastic B cells, and expression is regulated transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally, resulting in an anti-apoptotic (full length) or a pro-apoptotic (short isoform) gene product. In this study, we assessed 151 B-cell lymphomas for MCL-1 expression and analyzed for expression of the full-length and short isoforms of MCL-1 in B-cell lymphoma cell lines. By using immunohistochemistry, a subset of neoplasms in 9 lymphoma types studied expressed MCL-1, but expression was more frequent and intense in high-grade (43 of 49, 88%) compared with low-grade (34 of 92, 37%) lymphomas (P < 0.0001). In follicular lymphomas, MCL-1 expression positively correlated with increasing grade; 1 (14%) of eight grade 1, 7 (70%) of ten grade 2, and all 9 (100%) grade 3 were positive (P < 0.0008). All plasma cell myeloma cases assessed were also MCL-1 positive. By using Western blot analysis, 6 of 7 high-grade B-cell lymphoma cell lines showed predominant expression of full-length MCL-1, compared with no or weak expression of the short isoform. One myeloma and 1 of 2 mantle cell lymphoma cell lines also tested showed only full-length isoform expression. Our data suggest that MCL-1 is frequently expressed in high-grade B-cell lymphomas and plasma cell myeloma, most likely in its full-length isoform that is an active anti-apoptotic gene product. MCL-1 expression also correlates with grade and may contribute to transformation in follicular lymphomas.","['Cho-Vega, Jeong Hee', 'Rassidakis, George Z', 'Admirand, Joan H', 'Oyarzo, Mauricio', 'Ramalingam, Preetha', 'Paraguya, Aris', 'McDonnell, Timothy J', 'Amin, Hesham M', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey']","['Cho-Vega JH', 'Rassidakis GZ', 'Admirand JH', 'Oyarzo M', 'Ramalingam P', 'Paraguya A', 'McDonnell TJ', 'Amin HM', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Department of Pathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Protein Isoforms/*biosynthesis', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2']",2004/09/03 05:00,2004/10/22 09:00,['2004/09/03 05:00'],"['2004/09/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2004 Sep;35(9):1095-100. doi: 10.1016/j.humpath.2004.04.018.,"['S0046817704003296 [pii]', '10.1016/j.humpath.2004.04.018 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mortality in the disease results from pancytopenia or transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. There are frequent cytogenetic abnormalities, including deletions of chromosomes 5, 7, or both. Recurring chromosomal translocations in myelodysplasia are rare, but the most frequent are the t(3;3)(q21;q26) and the inv(3)(q21q26), which lead to the inappropriate activation of the EVI1 gene located at 3q26. To better understand the role of EVI1 in this disease, we have generated a murine model of EVI1-positive myelodysplasia by BM infection and transplantation. We find that EVI1 induces a fatal disease of several stages that is characterized by severe pancytopenia. The disease does not progress to acute myeloid leukemia. Comparison of in vitro and in vivo results suggests that EVI1 acts at two levels. The immediate effects of EVI1 are hyperproliferation of BM cells and downregulation of EpoR and c-Mpl, which are important for terminal erythroid differentiation and platelet formation. These defects are not fatal, and the mice survive for about 10 months with compensated hematopoiesis. Over this time, compensation fails, and the mice succumb to fatal peripheral cytopenia.","['Buonamici, Silvia', 'Li, Donglan', 'Chi, Yiqing', 'Zhao, Rui', 'Wang, Xuerong', 'Brace, Larry', 'Ni, Hongyu', 'Saunthararajah, Yogen', 'Nucifora, Giuseppina']","['Buonamici S', 'Li D', 'Chi Y', 'Zhao R', 'Wang X', 'Brace L', 'Ni H', 'Saunthararajah Y', 'Nucifora G']","['Department of Pathology and Cancer Center, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/growth & development/metabolism/pathology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Retroviridae', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",2004/09/03 05:00,2004/10/16 09:00,['2004/09/03 05:00'],"['2004/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2004/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2004 Sep;114(5):713-9. doi: 10.1172/JCI21716.,['10.1172/JCI21716 [doi]'],,"['R01 CA067189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA067189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA89622/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC514587,,,['J Clin Invest. 2005 Aug;115(8):2296'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the transmission of PERV to human cells in vivo using a model in which immunodeficient NOD/SCID transgenic mice were transplanted with porcine and human lymphohematopoietic tissues. Our results demonstrate, we believe for the first time, that human and pig cells can coexist long-term (up to 25 weeks) without direct PERV infection of human cells. Despite the transplantation of porcine cells that did not produce human-tropic PERV, human cells from the chimeric mice were frequently found to contain PERV sequences. However, this transmission was due to the pseudotyping of PERV-C (a virus without human tropism) by xenotropic murine leukemia virus, rather than to de novo generation of human-tropic PERV. Thus, pseudotyping might account for the PERV transmission previously observed in mice. The absence of direct human cell infection following long-term in vivo coexistence with large numbers of porcine cells provides encouragement regarding the potential safety of using pigs that do not produce human-tropic PERV as source animals for transplantation to humans.","['Yang, Yong-Guang', 'Wood, James C', 'Lan, Ping', 'Wilkinson, Robert A', 'Sykes, Megan', 'Fishman, Jay A', 'Patience, Clive']","['Yang YG', 'Wood JC', 'Lan P', 'Wilkinson RA', 'Sykes M', 'Fishman JA', 'Patience C']","['Transplantation Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. yongguang.yang@tbrc.mgh.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Liver Transplantation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Retroviridae/*physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*transmission/virology', 'Species Specificity', 'Swine', 'Thymus Gland/transplantation', 'Transplantation Chimera/virology', '*Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Virus Replication']",2004/09/03 05:00,2004/10/16 09:00,['2004/09/03 05:00'],"['2004/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2004 Sep;114(5):695-700. doi: 10.1172/JCI21946.,['10.1172/JCI21946 [doi]'],,"['P01 AI045897/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-AI45897/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC514590,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We prospectively monitored blood DC in 30 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients before and after imatinib mesylate therapy. We found a dramatic reduction in PDC and MDC prior treatment. This reduction was associated with high plasmatic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a central regulator of angiogenesis which also participates to tumor-associated immune deficiencies. Phenotypic analysis of DC revealed in some patients a deficient expression of BDCA-4/neuropilin-1 on PDC, a molecule involved in angiogenesis and DC-T-cell interactions. High VEGF correlated to an altered Th1/Th2 balance in vivo and shifted PDC-induced T-cell polarization towards Th2 in vitro. Upon imatinib treatment, plasmatic VEGF rapidly decreased and a normal BDCA-4 expression was restored. PDC and MDC increased but did not reach the levels observed in healthy individuals. We conclude that VEGF may be a key player in blood DC deficiency in CML and we show that imatinib inhibits VEGF overproduction. Incomplete recovery of blood DC under imatinib despite VEGF normalization suggests a negative impact of this drug on dendritopoiesis in vivo and may result in a sustained defect in DC-mediated anti-CML responses.","['Boissel, N', 'Rousselot, P', 'Raffoux, E', 'Cayuela, J-M', 'Maarek, O', 'Charron, D', 'Degos, L', 'Dombret, H', 'Toubert, A', 'Rea, D']","['Boissel N', 'Rousselot P', 'Raffoux E', 'Cayuela JM', 'Maarek O', 'Charron D', 'Degos L', 'Dombret H', 'Toubert A', 'Rea D']","[""Unite INSERM U396 d'Immunogenetique Humaine, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (blood dendritic cell antigen 4, human)', '144713-63-3 (Neuropilin-1)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Surface/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Blood Cells', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Neuropilin-1/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Th1 Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Th2 Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*blood']",2004/09/03 05:00,2004/11/02 09:00,['2004/09/03 05:00'],"['2004/09/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Oct;18(10):1656-61. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403474.,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2403474 [doi]', '2403474 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although these findings will require validation in an independent series of TL and AMKL samples, they indicate that TL and AMKL have distinct gene signatures, and provide a basis for studies of the different mechanisms underlying either the resolution of TL or its progression to AMKL.","['Lightfoot, J', 'Hitzler, J K', 'Zipursky, A', 'Albert, M', 'Macgregor, P F']","['Lightfoot J', 'Hitzler JK', 'Zipursky A', 'Albert M', 'Macgregor PF']","['Microarray Centre, Clinical Genomics Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Progression', 'Down Syndrome/complications/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis']",2004/09/03 05:00,2004/11/02 09:00,['2004/09/03 05:00'],"['2004/09/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Oct;18(10):1617-23. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403466.,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2403466 [doi]', '2403466 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PELs manifest constitutive activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), and inhibition of NF-kappaB induces apoptosis of PELs and sensitizes to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced death. Bortezomib (PS-341), a peptidyl boronic acid inhibitor of the proteasome, is a potent agent against a wide range of hematologic malignancies and has been shown to inhibit NF-kappaB. Thus, we examined the cytotoxic effects of bortezomib alone and in combination with various drugs. Bortezomib potently inhibited NF-kappaB in PEL cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, bortezomib inhibited growth and induced apoptosis of PEL cell lines (IC(50) values of 3.4-5.0 nM). Results of drug interactions between bortezomib and chemotherapy (doxorubicin and Taxol) were schedule-dependent: synergistic interactions were generally observed when PEL cells were pretreated with bortezomib prior to chemotherapy, whereas additive or even antagonistic interactions occurred with chemotherapy pretreatment or simultaneous treatment with bortezomib and chemotherapy. Most schedules of bortezomib and dexamethasone were synergistic, although pretreatment with dexamethasone resulted in additive interactions. Effects of combinations of bortezomib and TRAIL were generally additive. Thus, bortezomib represents a promising potential therapy for the treatment of PEL.","['An, J', 'Sun, Y', 'Fisher, M', 'Rettig, M B']","['An J', 'Sun Y', 'Fisher M', 'Rettig MB']","['VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, Los Angeles, CA 90073, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Boronic Acids/administration & dosage', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/administration & dosage', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage', 'Pleural Effusion, Malignant/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/administration & dosage', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/administration & dosage']",2004/09/03 05:00,2004/11/02 09:00,['2004/09/03 05:00'],"['2004/09/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Oct;18(10):1699-704. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403460.,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2403460 [doi]', '2403460 [pii]']",,['5R01CA80004/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fourteen of these cases (74%) demonstrated near-complete loss of HLA-DR expression, while the other five cases showed partial loss of HLA-DR. A total of 16 of the cases (84%) demonstrated internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the Flt3 gene.

To characterize AML-cuplike in an unselected series of AMLs, we analyzed 42 consecutive nonpromyelocytic/nonmonocytic AMLs diagnosed in our laboratory during a 6-month period in 2002. Strikingly, in this unselected series, there was a statistically significant coincidence of invaginated nuclear morphology, loss of HLA-DR, and presence of the Flt3 ITD beyond that expected if these three features were unrelated, suggesting that AMLs with these three features may represent a distinct AML subset.","['Kussick, S J', 'Stirewalt, D L', 'Yi, H S', 'Sheets, K M', 'Pogosova-Agadjanyan, E', 'Braswell, S', 'Norwood, T H', 'Radich, J P', 'Wood, B L']","['Kussick SJ', 'Stirewalt DL', 'Yi HS', 'Sheets KM', 'Pogosova-Agadjanyan E', 'Braswell S', 'Norwood TH', 'Radich JP', 'Wood BL']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. skussick@u.washington.edu <skussick@u.washington.edu>']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Nucleus/*pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Duplication', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2004/09/03 05:00,2004/11/02 09:00,['2004/09/03 05:00'],"['2004/09/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Oct;18(10):1591-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403458.,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2403458 [doi]', '2403458 [pii]']",,"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA92405/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in primate ES cells, including those from humans and monkeys, LIF alone is not sufficient to maintain self-renewal. The precise role of the LIF/gp130/STAT3 pathway for self-renewal in primate ES cells is still unclear. In this study, we found that stimulation of cynomolgus monkey ES cells with LIF or interleukin (IL)-6/soluble IL-6 receptor leads to STAT3 phosphorylation, an effect seen previously in murine ES cells. Concomitant with this notion, nuclear translocalization and transcriptional activation of STAT3 were observed in a LIF-dependent manner. Moreover, the analysis of a dominant interfering mutant, STAT3F, showed that even though the phosphorylation, nuclear translocalization, and transcriptional activation of endogenous STAT3 after LIF stimulation were completely abrogated by over-expressing STAT3F in monkey ES cells, they continued to proliferate in an undifferentiated state, retaining their pluripotency. These results demonstrate that the LIF/gp130/STAT3 pathway functions in cynomolgus monkey ES cells but is not essential for the maintenance of self-renewal. They also suggest that cynomolgus monkey ES cells, unlike murine ES cells, are maintained in an undifferentiated state through LIF/gp130/STAT3-independent signaling.","['Sumi, Tomoyuki', 'Fujimoto, Yasuko', 'Nakatsuji, Norio', 'Suemori, Hirofumi']","['Sumi T', 'Fujimoto Y', 'Nakatsuji N', 'Suemori H']","['Laboratory of Embryonic Stem Cell Research, Stem Cell Research Center, Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*genetics', 'Species Specificity', 'Trans-Activators/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects/genetics']",2004/09/03 05:00,2005/03/26 09:00,['2004/09/03 05:00'],"['2004/09/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/26 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2004;22(5):861-72. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.22-5-861.,"['10.1634/stemcells.22-5-861 [doi]', '22/5/861 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Feeder-free culture conditions that maintain hESCs in an undifferentiated state do not show activation of STAT3, suggesting that distinct signaling mechanisms govern the self-renewal of hESCs.","['Daheron, Laurence', 'Opitz, Sarah L', 'Zaehres, Holm', 'Lensch, M William', 'Andrews, Peter W', 'Itskovitz-Eldor, Joseph', 'Daley, George Q']","['Daheron L', 'Opitz SL', 'Zaehres H', 'Lensch MW', 'Andrews PW', 'Itskovitz-Eldor J', 'Daley GQ']","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Protein Subunits/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism']",2004/09/03 05:00,2005/03/26 09:00,['2004/09/03 05:00'],"['2004/09/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/26 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2004;22(5):770-8. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.22-5-770.,"['10.1634/stemcells.22-5-770 [doi]', '22/5/770 [pii]']",,"['DK59279/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL71265/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,"['Stem Cells. 2007 Dec;25(12):3273.

Damage to macromolecules resulting from benzene metabolites and misrepair of DNA lesions may lead to changes in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that give rise to leukemic clones. We have shown previously that male mice exposed to benzene by inhalation were significantly more susceptible to benzene-induced toxicities than females. Because HSCs are targets for benzene-induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, we investigated DNA damage responses in HSC from both genders of 129/SvJ mice after exposure to 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ) in vitro or benzene in vivo. 1,4-BQ is a highly reactive metabolite of benzene that can cause cellular damage by forming protein and DNA adducts and producing reactive oxygen species. HSCs cultured in the presence of 1,4-BQ for 24 hours showed a gender-independent, dose-dependent cytotoxic response. RNA isolated from 1,4-BQ-treated HSCs and HSCs from mice exposed to 100 ppm benzene by inhalation showed altered expression of apoptosis, DNA repair, cell cycle, and growth control genes compared with unexposed HSCs. Rad51, xpc, and mdm-2 transcript levels were increased in male but not female HSCs exposed to 1,4-BQ. Males exposed to benzene exhibited higher mRNA levels for xpc, ku80, ccng, and wig1. These gene expression differences may partially explain the gender disparity in benzene susceptibility. HSC culture systems such as the one used here will be useful for testing the hematotoxicity of various substances, including other benzene metabolites.","['Faiola, Brenda', 'Fuller, Elizabeth S', 'Wong, Victoria A', 'Pluta, Linda', 'Abernethy, Diane J', 'Rose, Jason', 'Recio, Leslie']","['Faiola B', 'Fuller ES', 'Wong VA', 'Pluta L', 'Abernethy DJ', 'Rose J', 'Recio L']","['CIIT Centers for Health Research, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA.

METHODS: Between July 1994 and February 1999, we randomly assigned 636 women who were 70 years of age or older and who had clinical stage I (T1N0M0 according to the tumor-node-metastasis classification), estrogen-receptor-positive breast carcinoma treated by lumpectomy to receive tamoxifen plus radiation therapy (317 women) or tamoxifen alone (319 women). Primary end points were the time to local or regional recurrence, the frequency of mastectomy for recurrence, breast-cancer-specific survival, the time to distant metastasis, and overall survival. RESULTS: The only significant difference between the two groups was in the rate of local or regional recurrence at five years (1 percent in the group given tamoxifen plus irradiation and 4 percent in the group given tamoxifen alone, P<0.001). There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to the rates of mastectomy for local recurrence, distant metastases, or five-year rates of overall survival (87 percent in the group given tamoxifen plus irradiation and 86 percent in the tamoxifen group, P=0.94). Assessment by physicians and patients of cosmetic results and adverse events uniformly rated tamoxifen plus irradiation inferior to tamoxifen alone. CONCLUSIONS: Lumpectomy plus adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen alone is a realistic choice for the treatment of women 70 years of age or older who have early, estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer.","['Hughes, Kevin S', 'Schnaper, Lauren A', 'Berry, Donald', 'Cirrincione, Constance', 'McCormick, Beryl', 'Shank, Brenda', 'Wheeler, Judith', 'Champion, Lorraine A', 'Smith, Thomas J', 'Smith, Barbara L', 'Shapiro, Charles', 'Muss, Hyman B', 'Winer, Eric', 'Hudis, Clifford', 'Wood, William', 'Sugarbaker, David', 'Henderson, I Craig', 'Norton, Larry']","['Hughes KS', 'Schnaper LA', 'Berry D', 'Cirrincione C', 'McCormick B', 'Shank B', 'Wheeler J', 'Champion LA', 'Smith TJ', 'Smith BL', 'Shapiro C', 'Muss HB', 'Winer E', 'Hudis C', 'Wood W', 'Sugarbaker D', 'Henderson IC', 'Norton L']","['Avon Comprehensive Breast Evaluation Center, Breast/Ovarian Cancer Genetics and Risk Assessment Program, Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Surgical Oncology, Boston 02114, USA. kshughes@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy/surgery/*therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', '*Mastectomy, Segmental/adverse effects', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Hormone-Dependent/drug therapy/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tamoxifen/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",2004/09/03 05:00,2004/09/08 05:00,['2004/09/03 05:00'],"['2004/09/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/08 05:00 [medline]', '2004/09/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2004 Sep 2;351(10):971-7. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa040587.,"['10.1056/NEJMoa040587 [doi]', '351/10/971 [pii]']",,"['CA02599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA04326/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA04457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA07968/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA08025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47555/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA74811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77406/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['Copyright 2004 Massachusetts Medical Society'],,,"['N Engl J Med. 2004 Sep 2;351(10):1021-3.

Binding of the substrate to the SCFSkp2 complex catalyzes the conjugation of ubiquitin molecules to the bound substrate, resulting in multi-ubiquitination and rapid degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Using Skp2 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified UBP43 as a novel substrate for Skp2. UBP43 belongs to the family of ubiquitin isopeptidases and specifically cleaves ISG15, a ubiquitin-like molecule that is induced by cellular stresses, such as type 1 interferons (IFN), nephrotoxic damage, and bacterial infection. UBP43 was originally identified as an up-regulated gene in knock-in mice expressing an acute myelogenous leukemia fusion protein, AML1-ETO, as well as in melanoma cell lines treated with IFN-beta. The phenotype of UBP43 knockout mice includes shortened life span, hypersensitivity to IFN, and neuronal damage, suggesting that tight regulation of ISG15 conjugation is critical for normal cellular function. In this study, we demonstrate that UBP43 is ubiquitinated in vivo and accumulates in cells treated with proteasome inhibitors. We also show that Skp2 promotes UBP43 ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in higher levels of ISG15 conjugates. In Skp2-/- mouse cells, levels of UBP43 are consistently up-regulated, whereas levels of ISG15 conjugates are reduced. Our results demonstrate that the SCFSkp2 is involved in controlling UBP43 protein levels and may therefore play an important role in modulating type 1 IFN signaling.","['Tokarz, Sara', 'Berset, Catherine', 'La Rue, Janna', 'Friedman, Kevin', 'Nakayama, Kei-Ichi', 'Nakayama, Keiko', 'Zhang, Dong-Er', 'Lanker, Stefan']","['Tokarz S', 'Berset C', 'La Rue J', 'Friedman K', 'Nakayama K', 'Nakayama K', 'Zhang DE', 'Lanker S']","['Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Oregon Health and Sciences University, Portland, Oregon 97239, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (USP18 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (ATP dependent 26S protease)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Endopeptidases/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Interferon-beta/metabolism', 'Interferons/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neurons/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Transgenes', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2004/09/03 05:00,2004/12/29 09:00,['2004/09/03 05:00'],"['2004/09/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Nov 5;279(45):46424-30. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M403189200.

In this investigation, we take advantage of population-based registers in Sweden to examine maternal smoking during pregnancy and childhood risk of leukemia and lymphoma. Prospective data were available from 1,440,542 Swedish children born between 1983 and 1997. Proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) controlling for potential confounders. In the study base, 750 hemopoietic cancers occurred across 11 million person-years. Incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were 4.7 for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 0.45 for acute myelogenous leukemia, and 0.76 for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Maternal smoking was associated with a lower risk of ALL (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.58-0.91). On the other hand, there was a higher risk of acute myelogenous leukemia (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.74-2.67) particularly among heavy (> or =10 cigarettes per day) smokers (HR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.05-4.94). The data also suggested a small excess risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.76-2.04). Evidence from this large cohort suggests that maternal smoking affects the risk of childhood leukemia and lymphoma in the offspring. The Swedish registries provide unique opportunities to examine this research question, with a design inherently free of selection and recall biases. The apparent protective effect with ALL needs to be explored further and in no way supports maternal smoking as beneficial, given its adverse association with common pregnancy outcomes.","['Mucci, Lorelei A', 'Granath, Frederik', 'Cnattingius, Sven']","['Mucci LA', 'Granath F', 'Cnattingius S']","['Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk', 'Sex Factors', 'Smoking/*adverse effects/epidemiology', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",2004/09/03 05:00,2005/02/03 09:00,['2004/09/03 05:00'],"['2004/09/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2004 Sep;13(9):1528-33.,['13/9/1528 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It binds to DNA via the ETS domain and interacts with itself or TEL1 via the pointed domain. The expression of TEL2 in normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells suggests a role in hematopoietic development. In this article, we describe the role of TEL2 in hematopoietic differentiation and cellular transformation. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed that the expression of TEL2 mRNA was down-regulated during monocytic differentiation of U937 and HL60 induced by 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, respectively. Overexpression of TEL2 in U937 cells inhibited differentiation induced by vitamin D3. In contrast, overexpression of a TEL2 mutant lacking either the pointed domain or a functional ETS domain induced both differentiation of U937 cells and inhibited their growth in vitro and in vivo. In addition, these mutants blocked TEL2-mediated transcriptional repression of a synthetic promoter containing TEL2 binding sites. These data suggest that dominant-negative inhibition of TEL2 might cause differentiation. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated that TEL2 is expressed at higher level in some primary human leukemia samples than in normal bone marrow. Furthermore, overexpression of TEL2 in NIH3T3-UCLA cells blocked the inhibitory effect of TEL1 on Ras-induced cellular transformation. These results suggest that TEL2 may play an important role in hematopoiesis and oncogenesis.","['Kawagoe, Hiroyuki', 'Potter, Mark', 'Ellis, John', 'Grosveld, Gerard C']","['Kawagoe H', 'Potter M', 'Ellis J', 'Grosveld GC']","[""Department of Genetics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '181233-60-3 (ELF2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcitriol/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/pathology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/*cytology/pathology', 'Mutation', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation', 'ras Proteins/genetics/*physiology']",2004/09/03 05:00,2004/10/06 09:00,['2004/09/03 05:00'],"['2004/09/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Sep 1;64(17):6091-100. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0839.,"['10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0839 [doi]', '64/17/6091 [pii]']",,['CA72999-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also observed a proportionate increase in the methylation density of these regions with disease progression. Seven genes, which were expressed in normal T cells, but suppressed in ATL cells, were identified near the hypermethylated regions. Among these silenced genes, Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) gene is a cell cycle regulator and early growth response 3 (EGR3) gene is a critical transcriptional factor for induction of Fas ligand (FasL) expression. Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine resulted in the recovery of their transcription, indicating that their silencing might be associated with DNA hypermethylation. To study their functions in ATL cells, we transfected recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing KLF4 and EGR3 genes. Expression of KLF4 induced apoptosis of ATL cells whereas enforced expression of EGR3 induced the expression of FasL gene, resulting in apoptosis. Thus, suppressed expression of EGR3 enabled ATL cells to escape from activation-induced cell death mediated by FasL. Our results showed that the methylated CpG island amplification/representational difference analysis method allowed the isolation of hypermethylated DNA regions specific to leukemic cells and thus shed light on the roles of DNA methylation in leukemogenesis.","['Yasunaga, Jun-Ichirou', 'Taniguchi, Yuko', 'Nosaka, Kisato', 'Yoshida, Mika', 'Satou, Yorifumi', 'Sakai, Tatsunori', 'Mitsuya, Hiroaki', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Yasunaga J', 'Taniguchi Y', 'Nosaka K', 'Yoshida M', 'Satou Y', 'Sakai T', 'Mitsuya H', 'Matsuoka M']","['Laboratory of Virus Immunology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan. jyasunag@virus.kyoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EGR3 protein, human)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '144516-98-3 (Early Growth Response Protein 3)']",IM,"['*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Growth Response Protein 3', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/chemistry', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics']",2004/09/03 05:00,2004/10/06 09:00,['2004/09/03 05:00'],"['2004/09/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Sep 1;64(17):6002-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1422.,"['10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1422 [doi]', '64/17/6002 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pba/PDT caused a rapid release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol. Sequentially, activation of caspase-3 and the cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) were followed. Meanwhile, no evidence of activation of caspase-8 was indicated in the cells. In experiments with caspase inhibitors, it was found that caspase-3 alone was sufficient initiator for the Pba-induced apoptosis of the cells. Pba specific emission spectra were confirmed in the mitochondrial fraction and the light irradiation caused a rapid change in its membrane potential. Thus, mitochondria were entailed as the crucial targets for Pba as well as a responsible component for the cytochrome c release to initiate apoptotic pathways.

Besides inducing a catabolic response in articular chondrocytes it also strongly induces synergistic mediators such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6).

The aim of our study was to evaluate in vitro and in vivo whether IL-6 and LIF are differentially expressed in normal human and osteoarthritic adult articular chondrocytes and to investigate the potential intracellular signaling pathways of IL-1 involved in these gene regulation events. IL-6 and LIF mRNA expressions were found only at low levels in normal adult articular cartilage. Neither IL-6 nor LIF was strongly over-expressed in osteoarthritic cartilage degeneration. Clearly, both IL-6 and LIF can be very efficiently induced by IL-1beta in articular chondrocytes in vitro. However, this induction was somewhat less in osteoarthritic cells, which were overall activated in terms of expression of both cytokines without stimulation. Experiments using pathway selective inhibitors showed that intracellular signaling of IL-1beta for IL-6 and LIF is mediated by a mixture of the IL-1 signaling cascades. However, the ERK-pathway appeared to be particularly important and might be, therefore, of particular potential if one intends to block induction of these molecules by IL-1 in arthritic joint disease.","['Fan, Zhiyong', 'Bau, Brigitte', 'Yang, Huiqing', 'Aigner, Thomas']","['Fan Z', 'Bau B', 'Yang H', 'Aigner T']","['Osteoarticular and Arthritis Research Group, Department of Pathology, University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Krankenhausstrasse 8-10, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cartilage, Articular/*immunology/pathology/physiology', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects/immunology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/*immunology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Osteoarthritis/immunology/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reference Values', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2004/09/03 05:00,2005/03/05 09:00,['2004/09/03 05:00'],"['2003/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/29 00:00 [revised]', '2004/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2004 Oct 7;28(1):17-24. doi: 10.1016/j.cyto.2004.06.003.,"['10.1016/j.cyto.2004.06.003 [doi]', 'S1043-4666(04)00184-X [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The increase of intracellular content of Hsp70 in human leukemia U-937 cells was attained by a mild heat stress or by transfection of cells with the human hsp70 gene. The elevation of Hsp70 quantity, irrespective of the way it was performed, leads to the inhibition of apoptosis in cells treated with two substances, etoposide or adriamycin. The inhibition of apoptosis was accompanied with the reducing of the share of cells with fragmented nuclei and with the delay in caspase activation. It is suggested that in addition to the previously discovered targets, whose activity is suppressed by the Hsp70 chaperone, this protein can inhibit the activity of caspase-3 and -7; this delays the onset of apoptosis in part of a cancer cell population.","['Komarova, E Iu', 'Margulis, B A', 'Guzhova, I V']","['Komarova EIu', 'Margulis BA', 'Guzhova IV']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Russia (Federation),Tsitologiia,Tsitologiia,0417363,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 7', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Transfection']",2004/09/03 05:00,2004/10/20 09:00,['2004/09/03 05:00'],"['2004/09/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Tsitologiia. 2004;46(6):550-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rol' shaperona Hsp70 v reaktsii kletok leikemii cheloveka na protivoopukholevye preparaty.,,,,,,,

In this study we investigated c-Kit in CHRF cells, a megakaryoblastic cell line of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (FAB M7). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We characterized the interactions between c-Kit and PI 3-kinase (p85) after stimulation with SCF (stem cell factor) as well as the regulation of SHP-1 and SHP-2 associated with Kit in this cell line. RESULTS: Stimulation with SCF leads to a significant increase in interaction between Kit and p85 as well as in receptor associated PI 3-kinase activity. Interestingly, using different kinds of substances (AG 1295, CGP 53716) to inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of c-Kit blocked activation of c-Kit, but the association of p85 still increased after SCF stimulation even when the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor was completely blocked. In contrast, the other known interaction partners of c-Kit, SHP-1 and SHP-2, exhibited a basal association with c-Kit and no change of the association could be detected after stimulation of CHRF cells with SCF or treatment with the kinase inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, we suggest that association of p85, SHP-1, and SHP-2 to c-Kit in CHRF cells can, at least in part, occur in a c-Kit kinase-activity independent manner. In contrast, the kinase activity of c-Kit is necessary for the activation of receptor-associated PI 3-kinase.","['Scholl, Sebastian', 'Kirsch, Cornelia', 'Bohmer, Frank D', 'Klinger, Reinhard']","['Scholl S', 'Kirsch C', 'Bohmer FD', 'Klinger R']","['Department of Internal Medicine II (Hematology and Oncology), Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Germany. sebastian.scholl@med.uni-jena.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (6,7-dimethoxy-2-phenylquinoxaline)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology']",2004/09/02 05:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2004/09/02 05:00'],"['2003/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2004 Dec;130(12):711-8. doi: 10.1007/s00432-004-0602-7.

In this study, the methylene chloride fraction of Spatholobi Caulis (MCSC) was examined to determine if it possesses anti-cancer activity via its apoptosis-inducing activity. MCSC exhibited a strong cytotoxic effect against human monocyte leukemia U937 cells (IC(50)=15.1 microg/ml). A TUNEL assay showed that the MCSC caused a characteristic ladder pattern of discontinuous DNA fragments and apoptotic bodies. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed that MCSC significantly increases the number of apoptotic cells stained by annexin V(+)/PI(-) cells. Western blotting revealed that MCSC activated caspase-3 expression and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in a concentration-dependent manner. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) demonstrated that MCSC significantly activated the caspase-3 activity compared with the untreated control by.

We have shown recently that decreased cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-dependent transcription contributes to the loss of hRFC gene expression in multiple antifolate-resistant cell lines. This was associated with markedly decreased levels of phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein 1 (pCREB-1) and CRE-binding. Consistent with the autoregulation of CREB-1 gene expression by pCREB-1, prominently decreased CREB-1 mRNA levels were observed in antifolate-resistant cells. We therefore explored the possibility that these cells were defective in CREB-1 phosphorylation, thereby resulting in down-regulation of some cAMP-responsive genes. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that CREB-1 and its phosphoisoforms were markedly decreased in these cells. Treatment with forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase, restored both CREB-1 and pCREB-1 levels; this resulted in the restoration of CRE-binding, CRE-reporter activity, and CREB-1 and RFC mRNA levels. Hence, the protein kinase A pathway was examined using various agents that augment intracellular cAMP levels, including cholera toxin, an upstream agonist that renders stimulatory G-proteins (Galphas) constitutively active. Treatment of antifolate-resistant cells with these agents resulted in the restoration of pCREB-1 levels and CRE-reporter activity. Furthermore, transient transfection with a constitutively transcriptionally active VP16-CREB-1 that does not require phosphorylation for its activity resulted in restoration of CREB mRNA levels but not pCREB-1 levels. This is the first demonstration that resistance to various antifolates may potentially be associated with impaired activity of Galphas or their coupled receptors, resulting in loss of CREB-1 phosphorylation and consequent down-regulation of cAMP-responsive genes.","['Rothem, Lilah', 'Stark, Michal', 'Assaraf, Yehuda G']","['Rothem L', 'Stark M', 'Assaraf YG']","['Department of Biology, the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, 32000, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (CREB1 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'TBT296U68M (1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine)']",IM,"['1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine/pharmacology', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",2004/09/02 05:00,2005/03/25 09:00,['2004/09/02 05:00'],"['2004/09/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2004 Dec;66(6):1536-43. doi: 10.1124/mol.104.004135.

The formation of gp130/LIFR complex triggers the auto/trans-phosphorylation of associated Janus kinases, leading to the activation of Janus kinase/STAT and MAPK (ERK1 and -2) signaling pathways. Since adipocytes express both gp130 and LIFR proteins and are responsive to other IL-6 family cytokines, we examined the effects of CT-1 on 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our studies have shown that CT-1 administration results in a dose- and time-dependent activation and nuclear translocation of STAT1, -3, -5A, and -5B as well as ERK1 and -2. We also confirmed the ability of CT-1 to induce signaling in fat cells in vivo. Our studies revealed that neither CT-1 nor ciliary neurotrophic factor treatment affected adipocyte differentiation. However, acute CT-1 treatment caused an increase in SOCS-3 mRNA in adipocytes and a transient decrease in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) mRNA that was regulated by the binding of STAT1 to the PPARgamma2 promoter. The effects of CT-1 on SOCS-3 and PPARgamma mRNA were independent of MAPK activation. Chronic administration of CT-1 to 3T3-L1 adipocytes resulted in a decrease of both fatty acid synthase and insulin receptor substrate-1 protein expression yet did not effect the expression of a variety of other adipocyte proteins. Moreover, chronic CT-1 treatment resulted in the development of insulin resistance as judged by a decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In summary, CT-1 is a potent regulator of signaling in adipocytes in vitro and in vivo, and our current efforts are focused on determining the role of this cardioprotective cytokine on adipocyte physiology.","['Zvonic, Sanjin', 'Hogan, Jessica C', 'Arbour-Reily, Patricia', 'Mynatt, Randall L', 'Stephens, Jacqueline M']","['Zvonic S', 'Hogan JC', 'Arbour-Reily P', 'Mynatt RL', 'Stephens JM']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70803, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat1 protein, rat)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Adipocytes/cytology/*drug effects/physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cytokines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Insulin/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'PPAR gamma/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",2004/09/02 05:00,2005/01/22 09:00,['2004/09/02 05:00'],"['2004/09/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Nov 12;279(46):47572-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M403998200.

However, potent cell differentiation effects of ATRA are so far largely restricted to this disease and long-term survival rates in non-APL acute myelogeneous leukemia (AML) remain unacceptably poor, requiring development of novel therapeutic strategies. We demonstrate here that myelomonocytic growth factors (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF] and/or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) potentiate differentiation effects of ATRA in different AML cell lines and primary cells from patients with myeloid leukemia. The ligand-dependent activities of endogenous and transiently expressed retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) isoforms can be potentiated by G/GM-CSF in U-937 cells and correlate with increased expression of ATRA-inducible RARalpha2 isoform. Specific inhibitors of mitogen mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (MEK)-1/-2 or p38 extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) kinase diminish the ATRA as well as ATRA and G/GM-CSF-induced activation of the RARalpha proteins and decreased the differentiation-induced decline in cell numbers. Our data demonstrate that acting, at least in part, via the MAP kinase pathways, myelomonocytic growth factors enhance ATRA-dependent activation of the RARalpha isoforms and maturation of myeloid leukemia cells.

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential benefit of combination therapy with imatinib and arsenic sulfide (As(4)S(4)). Analysis of cell proliferation and clonogenic ability showed that As(4)S(4) and imatinib exerted synergistic effects on both K562 cells and fresh CML cells. The effective concentrations on fresh CML cells were pharmacokinetically available in vivo but had much less inhibitory effect on CD34(+) cells from the nonleukemic donors. Examination of cell cycles showed that As(4)S(4) induced G(2)/M arrest whereas imatinib induced G(1) arrest. Using a number of parameters such as morphology, annexin V/propidium iodide (PI), mitochondrial transmembrane potential, caspase-3 activity, and Fas/Fas-L, the synergistic effects were revealed on induction of cell apoptosis, largely through the mitochondrial pathway. The 2 drugs also exhibited a synergistic effect in targeting BCR-ABL protein.

However, CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can kill CLL B cells via a Fas-ligand (CD178)-dependent process within 24 hours after CD40 cross-linking, when ligation of CD95 alone is insufficient to induce apoptosis. In addition to CD95, CD40-activated CLL cells also express DR5, a receptor for tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) that is expressed by CD4+ CTL. In addition, CD40 ligation in vitro and in vivo induces CLL cells to express the proapoptotic protein, BH3 interacting domain death agonist (Bid), which can facilitate crosstalk between mitochondrial-dependent, apoptosis-inducing pathways and death receptors, such as death receptor 5 (DR5). To evaluate whether ligation of CD95 and/or DR5 can induce apoptosis of CD40-activated CLL cells, we generated artificial cytotoxic effector cells that express both human TRAIL and CD178 (Chinese hamster ovary [CHO]-CD178/TRAIL) or only TRAIL (CHO-TRAIL) or CD178 (CHO-CD178). CHO-CD178/TRAIL cells were significantly more effective in killing CD40-activated CLL cells than either CHO-TRAIL or CHO-CD178 and, unlike the latter, could kill CLL cells 24 hours after CD40 ligation. We conclude that CD40 ligation induces CLL cells to express the proapoptotic molecule Bid and the death receptors CD95 and DR5, the latter of which can act synergistically to induce caspase-dependent apoptosis of CD40-activated CLL B cells.","['Dicker, Frank', 'Kater, Arnon P', 'Fukuda, Tetsuya', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Dicker F', 'Kater AP', 'Fukuda T', 'Kipps TJ']","['University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093-0663, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'CD40 Antigens/*metabolism', 'CHO Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/physiology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",2004/09/02 05:00,2005/05/14 09:00,['2004/09/02 05:00'],"['2004/09/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/14 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Apr 15;105(8):3193-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-10-3684.

Additional support for a gene dosage effect of chromosome 21 or RUNX1 in leukemia.,ECR26,"Atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) is a rare leukemic disorder with no specific genetic lesion. Here we demonstrate clonal occurrences of tetrasomy for the long arm of chromosome 21 in a patient with aCML, and a thorough review of the literature provides evidence that this chromosomal anomaly is a so far not recognised recurrent finding in aCML. Further, the timely association of the occurrence of the tetrasomy 21q with acceleration of the leukemia suggests a role for chromosome 21 in leukemic disease progression. The chromosome 21 gene most strongly implicated in both normal and abnormal hematopoiesis is RUNX1. Also, RUNX1 haploinsufficiency due to RUNX1 point mutations characterises the familial platelet disorder with propensity to develop leukemia, and thromboytopenia was a leading feature in the present case. Therefore, an extensive molecular analysis of RUNX1 was performed. However, these analyses did not reveal a mutation, and the results support a gene dosage effect for RUNX1 in myeloid disease similar to observations in lymphoid disease.

The biological and clinical characteristics of relapsed AML are analyzed here. DESIGN AND METHODS: Most relevant literature in English language on relapsed AML from 1990 to 2004 was considered paying particular attention to the heterogeneity of the disease and prognostic factors at the time of relapse; therapeutic results in terms of second complete remission (CR) with conventional chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation and new agents are also summarized. RESULTS: Molecular relapse is a current indication for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL); however, data are emerging for the treatment of molecular relapse in AML other than APL, such as AML with t(8;21) and AML with inv(16). Age, duration of first remission and cytogenetics are the most relevant prognostic factors in relapsed AML. Promising therapeutic results have been reported for the antiCD33 monoclonal antibody conjugated with calicheamicin and the new nucleoside analog clofarabine; preliminary studies indicate that FLT3, farnesyl-transferase and bcl-2 inhibitors are active in relapsed AML.

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) is an immunoconjugate that has shown activity in relapsed AML with a favorable safety profile. The aim of this collaborative trial was to assess the feasibility, safety, and antileukemic activity of administering GO followed by conventional chemotherapy as first line therapy in patients aged 61-75 years with AML. DESIGN AND METHODS: Eligible patients received frontline treatment with GO 9 mg/m2 infused intravenously on days 1 and 15. Following response assessment to GO, patients were started on conventional chemotherapy consisting of the MICE regimen (mitoxantrone, cytarabine, etoposide). No further treatment was planned for complete responders. RESULTS: Among the 57 evaluable patients, 38 (67%) completed the entire sequential treatment as planned. The overall response rate to the entire induction sequence was 54.4% (31/57), with complete remission (CR) in 35.1% and complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) in 19.3%. Rates of failure due to treatment-related mortality or resistant disease were 14.1% (3 toxic deaths during the GO segment, 5 during MICE) and 29.9%, respectively. An initial response to GO was documented in 20 patients (35.1%), with CR in 22.8% and CRp in 12.3%; 6 additional patients entered a partial remission. Reversible myelosuppression and liver toxicity were the main adverse events during both segments of induction. Frontline GO was associated with modest mucosal and gastrointestinal toxicity, but grade 3-4 pancytopenia was universal and prolonged. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease developed in 3 patients after GO and 2 after MICE, resulting in 4 deaths from liver failure. One-year survival at follow-up was 34%. Twelve patients continue in CR/CRp after a median of 226 days. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The sequential combination of GO and conventional chemotherapy is a feasible and active treatment strategy for older patients with untreated AML. This novel regimen is now being compared in a phase III trial (AML-17).","['Amadori, Sergio', 'Suciu, Stefan', 'Willemze, Roel', 'Mandelli, Franco', 'Selleslag, Dominique', 'Stauder, Reinhard', 'Ho, Anthony', 'Denzlinger, Claudio', 'Leone, Giuseppe', 'Fabris, Piero', 'Muus, Petra', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Hagemeijer, Anne', 'Beeldens, Filip', 'Anak, Ozlem', 'De Witte, Theo']","['Amadori S', 'Suciu S', 'Willemze R', 'Mandelli F', 'Selleslag D', 'Stauder R', 'Ho A', 'Denzlinger C', 'Leone G', 'Fabris P', 'Muus P', 'Vignetti M', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Beeldens F', 'Anak O', 'De Witte T']","['Department of Hematology, University Tor Vergata, St. Eugenio Hospital, Rome, Italy. mc7673@mclink.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'RSA8KO39WH (Vindesine)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)', 'MICE regimen']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aminoglycosides/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitomycin/administration & dosage', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vindesine/administration & dosage']",2004/09/02 05:00,2006/03/09 09:00,['2004/09/02 05:00'],"['2004/09/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2004 Aug;89(8):950-6.,,,"['5U10-CA11488-29/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U10-CA11488-30/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U10-CA11488-31/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U10-CA11488-32/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,"['EORTC leukemia group', 'GIMEMA leukemia group']",,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: Two hundred patients up to 60 years old received idarubicin, standard dose cytarabine and etoposide as induction chemotherapy and one consolidation course including intermediate dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone. Subsequently, patients with favorable cytogenetics, [i.e., t(8;21), inv(16)] were scheduled to receive 2 courses of high-dose cytarabine. The remainder were scheduled for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), if <or= 50 years old and with an HLA-identical sibling, or autologous SCT if >50 years old or lacking a donor. RESULTS: In patients with favorable cytogenetics the 4-year probabilities of survival and leukemia-free survival (LFS) were 62+/-9% and 41+/-10%, respectively. The results were better in patients with t(8;21). LFS at 4 years in patients <or= 50 years old allocated to allogeneic SCT was 41+/-9% vs 48+/-8% after autologous SCT (p=0.22). Patients >50 years old assigned to auto-SCT had a 4-year LFS of 17+/-9%. Adverse cytogenetics and white blood cell count >or= 20 yen 109/L at diagnosis were associated with lower probability of survival and leukemia-free survival. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that high-dose cytarabine seems a good option for patients with t(8;21). Autologous and allogeneic SCT led to similar leukemia-free survival in patients <or= 50 years of age. In older patients, the results of auto-SCT were poor. Finally, cytogenetics and white cell count at diagnosis, together with new prognostic markers, should be considered in the design of future risk-adapted trials.","['Brunet, Salut', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Berlanga, Joan', 'Ribera, Josep M', 'Bueno, Javier', 'Marti, Josep M', 'Bargay, Joan', 'Guardia, Ramon', 'Julia, Antoni', 'Granena, Albert', 'Montserrat, Emili', 'Sierra, Jorge']","['Brunet S', 'Esteve J', 'Berlanga J', 'Ribera JM', 'Bueno J', 'Marti JM', 'Bargay J', 'Guardia R', 'Julia A', 'Granena A', 'Montserrat E', 'Sierra J']","['Hematology Department, Hospital de la Sant Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain. sbrunet@hsp.santpau.es']",['eng'],"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*drug therapy/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",2004/09/02 05:00,2006/03/09 09:00,['2004/09/02 05:00'],"['2004/09/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2004 Aug;89(8):940-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Grupo Cooperativo de Estudio y Tratamiento de las Leucemias Agudas y', 'Mielodisplasias']",,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: The expression of MDR1 and bcl-2 was analyzed by flow cytometry in a large series of 256 consecutive cases of AML. The results were recorded as percentage of positivity and relative mean fluorescence intensity (rMFI). To determine individual protein levels, an index which equals the product of the percentage of positive cells and rMFI was generated. RESULTS: Using cut-offs of >or=800 and 300 of the index value for bcl-2 and MDR1 expression, respectively, we identified 4 different classes of AML: 1) double negative; 2) single positive bcl-2+/MDR1-; 3) single positive bcl-2-/MDR1+; 4) double positive. The highest incidence of double negative cases was observed in the M2 class whereas double positive cases occurred more frequently in the M4, M5 and M6 subgroups. Seventy-eight percent and 71% of M0 and M1, respectively, showed single positive bcl-2+/MDR1- expression (p = 0.00001). Twenty-eight percent of patients belonging to the double positive category achieved complete remission, whereas for double negative, single positive bcl-2+MDR1- and single positive bcl-2-/MDR1+ category, the complete remission rate was 69%, 52% and 56%, respectively (p = 0.00038). In multivariate analysis, the double positive status independently affected frequency of complete remission (p = 0.008). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Bcl-2 is over-expressed in CD34+ AML; conversely, MDR1 is over-expressed in CD34- AML. However, the combined expression of the two proteins defines a subset of AML with a very poor prognosis.","['Venditti, Adriano', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Maurillo, Luca', 'Buccisano, Francesco', 'Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Mazzone, Carla', 'Tamburini, Anna', 'Cox, Christina', 'Panetta, Paola', 'Neri, Benedetta', 'Ottaviani, Licia', 'Amadori, Sergio']","['Venditti A', 'Del Poeta G', 'Maurillo L', 'Buccisano F', 'Del Principe MI', 'Mazzone C', 'Tamburini A', 'Cox C', 'Panetta P', 'Neri B', 'Ottaviani L', 'Amadori S']","[""Cattedra di Ematologia, Universita di Roma Tor Vergata, Divisione di Ematologia, Osp.S.Eugenio, p.le dell'Umanesimo 10, 00144 Rome, Italy. adriano.venditti@uniroma2.it""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*blood', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antigens, CD34/*blood', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*blood']",2004/09/02 05:00,2006/03/09 09:00,['2004/09/02 05:00'],"['2004/09/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2004 Aug;89(8):934-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several studies have reported the usefulness of quantitative assessment of WT1 expression as a molecular marker of minimal residual disease. However, the biological significance and the prognostic impact of WT1 overexpression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is still uncertain. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the prognostic relevance of WT1 expression in a cohort of 77 adult patients with AML, using a real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction approach. RESULTS: WT1 expression was significantly higher in AML patients than in normal controls (p = 0.0001). The normalized levels of WT1 with respect to the control gene for beta-glucuronidase (GUS) in AML samples showed a median WT1/GUS ratio of 0.93 (range 0-25). We classified the patients into two groups according to this ratio. Forty patients (52%) showed a WT1/GUS ratio <or= 1 and 37 (48%) had a ratio > 1. A ratio > 1, although significantly associated with FLT3 mutations, was the strongest independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival (p = 0.004), relapse risk (p = 0.005) and cumulative incidence risk (p = 0.01). This adverse prognostic value was more evident in patients aged 60 years and younger. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The WT1/GUS ratio is an independent prognostic factor for predicting relapse in patients with AML and it could be included as part of the initial evaluation to establish more defined risk groups.","['Barragan, Eva', 'Cervera, Jose', 'Bolufer, Pascual', 'Ballester, Sandra', 'Martin, Guillermo', 'Fernandez, Pascual', 'Collado, Rosa', 'Sayas, Maria Jose', 'Sanz, Miguel Angel']","['Barragan E', 'Cervera J', 'Bolufer P', 'Ballester S', 'Martin G', 'Fernandez P', 'Collado R', 'Sayas MJ', 'Sanz MA']","['Molecular Biology Laboratory, Dept.

Gain-of-function mutations in the second intracellular kinase domain (TK2) and in the juxtamembrane domain are described in patients with core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (CBFL) and are associated with leukocytosis. We evaluated the incidence of KIT mutation in 52 adult patients with de novo CBFL and in 49 FLT3/ITD-negative childhood patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML), excluding cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: In order to analyze the role of KIT in CBFL we examined the KIT mutations in 52 adult CBFL, including 15 previously reported patients, and in 49 non-APL childhood AML patients using sensitive detection methods. We correlated our findings with the presence of trisomy 4 and investigated the relationship of the extra chromosome 4 with KIT mutations. RESULTS: Several kinds of gain-of-function KIT mutations were found in 24 of the 52 (46.1%) adult CBFL cases and 6 of the 49 (12.2%) non-APL childhood AML patients. KIT mutations were detected in 4 of the 8 adult patients and one childhood AML case bearing trisomy of chromosome 4 as either the sole cytogenetic aberration or a karyotypic aberration additional to t(8;21). In three of the trisomy 4 cases we demonstrated that trisomy 4 leads to duplication of the KIT mutated allele. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results underline that the KIT gene is activated in AML characterized by distinct cytogenetic and molecular genetic patterns and represents the most frequently mutated target in adult CBFL.","['Beghini, Alessandro', 'Ripamonti, Carla B', 'Cairoli, Roberto', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Colapietro, Patrizia', 'Elice, Francesca', 'Nadali, Gianpaolo', 'Grillo, Giovanni', 'Haas, Oskar A', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Morra, Enrica', 'Larizza, Lidia']","['Beghini A', 'Ripamonti CB', 'Cairoli R', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Colapietro P', 'Elice F', 'Nadali G', 'Grillo G', 'Haas OA', 'Biondi A', 'Morra E', 'Larizza L']","['Department of Biology and Genetics for Medical Sciences, Medical Faculty, University of Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Core Binding Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Core Binding Factors/blood/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', '*Gene Duplication', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics']",2004/09/02 05:00,2006/03/09 09:00,['2004/09/02 05:00'],"['2004/09/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2004 Aug;89(8):920-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the available evidence indicates that MDS is among the most common hematologic diseases. DESIGN AND METHODS: In a previous study, we showed that incidence rates rose from 1 to 4.1 in the period 1976-1990, with no increase between 1986 and 1990. We extended our study, covering the years 1991 through 2001. Diagnostic criteria and cytomorphology remained the same, consistently applying the criteria of the FAB classification. RESULTS: Three-hundred and eight new cases of MDS were identified in the town district of Dusseldorf, which provides the reference population for calculating incidences. There was no further rise in MDS incidence. The crude incidence in the period 1991-2001 was 4.9 (5.52 in males, 4.36 in females), which is similar to that in the 1986-1990 period. Age specific incidences were 8.7, 24.5, and 31.3 for the age groups 60-70, 71-80, and 80-90, respectively. The incidence of MDS in the age group >70 years was significantly higher among males (42.3) than among females (19.0). The preponderance of males was found among patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts (16 vs 3), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (7 vs 2), refractory anemia (15 vs 6) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (7 vs 2), whereas, somewhat surprisingly, the age-related incidences refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts was similar for males and females (4 vs 5). The data on MDS incidence in the town district of Dusseldorf showed a plateau since 1986. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Interpreting our data covering a 26-year period, we feel that the increase in the early years primarily reflected improved case ascertainment, whereas our new data may provide a good approximation of the true incidence of MDS. There is no evidence that the age-adjusted incidence of MDS is rising.","['Germing, Ulrich', 'Strupp, Corinna', 'Kundgen, Andrea', 'Bowen, David', 'Aul, Carlo', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Gattermann, Norbert']","['Germing U', 'Strupp C', 'Kundgen A', 'Bowen D', 'Aul C', 'Haas R', 'Gattermann N']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine University of Dusseldorf, Germany. germing@med.uni-duesseldorf.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*epidemiology']",2004/09/02 05:00,2006/03/09 09:00,['2004/09/02 05:00'],"['2004/09/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2004 Aug;89(8):905-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surveillance of cancer incidence data indicates that a large proportion of these cases occurred among males ages 65 and older. Shoe and boot manufacturing has been the largest single industry in this area throughout much of the past century. Occupational studies from Europe suggest a link between leukaemia and employment in the shoe and boot manufacturing industry. However, researchers have not found a positive association between leukaemia and employment in the shoe industry among workers in the United States. METHODS: A matched case-control study was conducted to investigate the association between leukaemia incidence among males 65 and older and employment in the shoe and boot manufacturing industry. Thirty-six cases of leukaemia occurring between 1981-1990; among males age 65 and older; residing in the town of Union met the study case criteria. Death certificates were obtained for each of the cases. These were matched to death certificates of 144 controls on date of death and date of birth +/- 1 year. Death certificates were then examined to determine the employer and occupation of each study subject. Conditional logistic regression was used to determine the risk of leukaemia among those working in the industry. RESULTS: The risk of both leukaemia (OR = 1.47; 95% CI 0.70, 3.09) and acute myeloid leukaemia (OR = 1.19; 95% CI 0.33, 4.28) were elevated among those employed in the shoe and boot manufacturing industry, however neither was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The results, though suggestive of an association between leukaemia and employment in the shoe and boot manufacturing industry, were not statistically conclusive due mainly to limited study power. Several additional limitations may also have prevented the observance of more conclusive findings. Better exposure assessment, information on length of exposure and types of job held, control of confounding factors and information on chemicals used by this company would strengthen any future investigation.","['Forand, Steven P']",['Forand SP'],"['Bureau of Environmental and Occupational Epidemiology, New York State Department of Health, Troy, New York 12180, USA. spf02@health.state.ny.us']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Environ Health,Environmental health : a global access science source,101147645,"['0 (Dust)', '0 (Solvents)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Death Certificates', 'Dust/analysis', 'Humans', '*Industry', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'New York/epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Odds Ratio', 'Registries', '*Shoes', 'Solvents/toxicity']",2004/09/02 05:00,2005/08/27 09:00,['2004/09/02 05:00'],"['2004/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/02 05:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Environ Health. 2004 Aug 30;3(1):7. doi: 10.1186/1476-069X-3-7.,"['10.1186/1476-069X-3-7 [doi]', '1476-069X-3-7 [pii]']",20040830,,,PMC517727,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Representative data are presented to summarize the extensive experience of the NCGS. This study is a multicenter, observational surveillance registry begun in 1985 in coordination with the release of the first recombinant DNA biosynthetic GH. RESULTS: After almost 20 years, data from over 47 000 patients representing 165 000 patient years have been collected. There are over 12 000 active subjects (estimated to be approximately 75% of all current patients treated with a Genentech GH product) at 435 centers, providing extensive efficacy and safety data. The GrowTrak program is a secure, user-friendly database which encourages a high level of participation by the pediatric endocrine community in the USA. Efficacy has been shown in a variety of clinical diagnoses, including isolated (IGHD) and organic growth hormone deficiency (OGHD), idiopathic short stature (ISS), and Turner syndrome. Safety monitoring of this large population has provided reassuring evidence that leukemia (de novo or relapse), extracranial nonleukemic neoplasms and central nervous system (CNS) tumor recurrence are not associated with GH therapy. A small risk of intracranial hypertension and slipped capital femoral epiphyses has been suggested, especially in children with renal disease or Turner syndrome. NCGS substudies have also provided important insights into actual clinical practice. For example, screening for renal, cardiac, or auditory comorbidities in Turner syndrome is often done less than is recommended by national guidelines (NCGS 9). Furthermore, almost 65% of children referred for short stature may be lost to follow-up before an evaluation is completed (NCGS 8). CONCLUSIONS: The NCGS has proven to be a valuable method of monitoring the safety and efficacy of biosynthetic GH. The study has attracted wide physician participation due to the data collection software used and the extensive sharing of the analyses of that data with the providers.","['Wyatt, David']",['Wyatt D'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, 8701 Watertown Plank Road, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA. dwyatt@mail.mcw.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Eur J Endocrinol,European journal of endocrinology,9423848,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)', '82030-87-3 (somatrem)']",IM,"['Body Height', 'Child', 'Female', 'Growth Disorders/*drug therapy', 'Human Growth Hormone/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Product Surveillance, Postmarketing', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'United States']",2004/09/02 05:00,2004/10/16 09:00,['2004/09/02 05:00'],"['2004/09/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Endocrinol. 2004 Aug;151 Suppl 1:S55-9. doi: 10.1530/eje.0.151s055.,['10.1530/eje.0.151s055 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to disease refractoriness, rare instances of disease progression from chronic phase to blast crisis during imatinib therapy have recently been anecdotally reported. OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinicopathologic features of 3 patients with CML who rapidly progressed from chronic phase to blast crisis while taking imatinib and to perform a review of the literature. DESIGN: Morphologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic analyses were performed on the 3 patients at the time of initial diagnosis, during imatinib therapy, and at blast crisis. RESULTS: The 3 patients were men, aged 39, 42, and 43 years. Two had been treated with hydroxyurea for 16 and 21 months before imatinib therapy, while 1 was started on a regimen of imatinib following diagnosis. Despite a hematologic response in all 3 patients, none of them achieved cytogenetic remission, and all progressed to blast crisis at 7 to 10 months of imatinib therapy. Blood findings during blast transformation were heterogeneous, including normal blood morphologic findings in 1 patient, leukocytosis with circulating blasts and basophilia in 1, and marked pancytopenia in 1. All 3 marrow specimens demonstrated moderate to marked diffuse reticulin fibrosis with more than 20% blasts. Clonal cytogenetic evolution was evident in 2 of the 3 patients and included an extra Philadelphia chromosome in both. All 3 patients underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. One was alive with no evidence of disease at 14 month follow-up, while 2 had residual disease after bone marrow transplantation and died of complications at 4 and 5 months after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Blood data did not always reflect marrow status. Therefore, bone marrow follow-up is critical for monitoring of response. Our findings suggest that significant progression of marrow reticulin fibrosis during imatinib therapy can be an indicator for a return or progression of CML and, in some patients with CML, imatinib may promote cytogenetic clonal evolution, resulting in a poor response to treatment.","['Xu, Yin', 'Wahner, Andrea E', 'Nguyen, Phuong L']","['Xu Y', 'Wahner AE', 'Nguyen PL']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Minnesota School of Medicine, Minneapolis, USA. yin.xu@utsouthwestern.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Fibrosis', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",2004/09/02 05:00,2005/03/01 09:00,['2004/09/02 05:00'],"['2004/09/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/02 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2004 Sep;128(9):980-5. doi: 10.5858/2004-128-980-POCMLT.,['10.5858/2004-128-980-POCMLT [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Functional disruption of NBS1 could therefore induce genomic instability and carcinogenesis. Four children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia have been reported to be heterozygous for a germline and/or somatic missense mutation in NBS1, leading to the I171V substitution. We screened healthy controls and pediatric patients with hematological malignancies and aplastic anemia (AA) for the presence of I171V. Of the 62 patients, one individual with AA was confirmed to harbor a homozygous I171V mutation. Genetic analysis of NBS1 in this patient and her healthy parents indicated that she inherited the germline I171V mutation from her father and the wild-type allele from her mother, and that the second I171V hit occurred on the wild-type allele early in embryonic development.

This study was to evaluate some health effect of RF exposure by the AM radio broadcasting towers in Korea. METHODS: We calculated cancer mortality rates using Korean death certificates over the period of 1994-1995 and population census data in ten RF-exposed areas, defined as regions that included AM radio broadcasting towers of over 100 kW, and in control areas, defined as regions without a radio broadcasting tower inside and at least 2 km away from the towers. RESULTS: All cancers-mortality was significantly higher in the exposed areas [direct standardized mortality rate ratio (MRR) = 1.29, 95%CI = 1.12-1.49]. When grouped by each exposed area and by electrical power, MRRs for two sites of 100 kW, one site of 250 kW and one site of 500 kW, for all subjects, and for one site of 100 kW and two sites of 250 kW, for male subjects, showed statistically significant increases without increasing trends according to the groups of electric power. Leukemia mortality was higher in exposed areas (MRR = 1.70, 95% CI = 0.84-3.45), especially among young adults aged under 30 years (0-14 years age group, MRR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.05-5.98; 15-29 age group, MRR = 2.44, 95% CI = 1.07-5.24). CONCLUSIONS: We observed higher mortality rates for all cancers and leukemia in some age groups in the area near the AM radio broadcasting towers. Although these findings do not prove a causal link between cancer and RF exposure from AM radio broadcasting towers, it does suggest that further analytical studies on this topic are needed in Korea.","['Park, Sue Kyung', 'Ha, Mina', 'Im, Hyung-Jun']","['Park SK', 'Ha M', 'Im HJ']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, Konkuk University College of Medicine, Chungju, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Int Arch Occup Environ Health,International archives of occupational and environmental health,7512134,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Death Certificates', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects/classification', 'Female', 'Geography', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Korea/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/classification/*mortality', 'Radio', 'Radio Waves/*adverse effects/classification', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sex Factors']",2004/09/01 05:00,2005/02/19 09:00,['2004/09/01 05:00'],"['2003/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/01 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int Arch Occup Environ Health. 2004 Aug;77(6):387-94. doi: 10.1007/s00420-004-0512-7.

To investigate the erythrocyte features during anemia in these patients, we studied the altered characters of these cells and oxidative stress imposed in their serum. This investigation reveals that erythrocytes from ALL patients show (1) increased membrane fluidity detected by fluorescence anisotropy studies, increased osmotic fragility detected by hemolysis of erythrocytes in different saline concentrations, and increased hydrophobicity as measured by binding with 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid, (2) enhanced (approximately threefold) glycosylation and sialylation, monitored by digoxigenin enzyme assay, and (3) expression of disease-specific 210, 105, 83, 54, and 28 kDa 9-O-acetyl sialoglycoconjugates (9-O-AcSGs) demonstrated by Western blot analysis and fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis studies using Achatinin-H with specificity towards 9-O-AcSAalpha2-6GalNAc as the analytical probe. (4) In addition, induced oxidative stress was observed in the sera of these children as indicated by increased nitric oxide (approximately fourfold) and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) reactive species (twofold) as detected by Griess reaction and TBA assay, respectively. For all the experiments, erythrocytes from normal individuals served as controls. Thus, the altered membrane characteristics together with their exposure to induced oxidative stress in serum are found to be a few features restricted to diseased erythrocytes. Taken together, our results are suggestive of their interplay in the contribution to the observed anemia in these patients, which may be exploited for better management of the disease.","['Ghosh, Shyamasree', 'Bandyopadhyay, Suman', 'Bhattacharya, Dilip K', 'Mandal, Chitra']","['Ghosh S', 'Bandyopadhyay S', 'Bhattacharya DK', 'Mandal C']","['Immunobiology Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, 4 Raja S.C.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May 1990 and July 1995, eligible pediatric patients with stage II or recurrent from stage I (as a stage II) testicular MGCT and stages I and II ovarian MGCT were enrolled onto this Pediatric Oncology Group and Children's Cancer Group study. PEB chemotherapy consisted of bleomycin 15 U/m2 on day 1, cisplatin 20 mg/m2/d on days 1 to 5, and etoposide 100 mg/m2/d on days 1 to 5. Patients received four cycles of therapy at 21-day intervals. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients with a median age of 10.5 years (range, 8.7 months to 16.7 years) were enrolled. Primary sites included: stage II testicular (n = 17), stage I ovarian (n = 41), and stage II ovarian MGCT (n = 16). Treatment with standard PEB resulted in 6-year EFS of 95% and overall survival (OS) of 95.7%.

Recent studies suggest that risk is most apparent in females treated with cranial radiation at a younger age. Because radiation at a young age may affect the hypothalamus causing leptin receptor insensitivity, we hypothesized that a polymorphism in the leptin receptor (LEPR) gene, Gln223Arg, might influence susceptibility to obesity in survivors of childhood ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We genotyped 600 non-Hispanic white adult ALL survivors enrolled onto the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. BMI was compared between those with two copies of the Arg allele to those who had at least one copy of the Gln allele. RESULTS: Female survivors with BMI > or = 25 kg/m2 were more likely Arg homozygous than those with BMI less than 25 kg/m2 (24% v 12%; P =.007). This difference was not observed in males. Moreover, among females treated with > or = 20 Gy cranial radiation, Arg/Arg individuals had six times higher odds of having BMI > or = 25 kg/m2 (95% CI, 2.1 to 22.0) than those with a Gln allele (P =.04 for interaction). CONCLUSION LEPR polymorphism may influence obesity in female survivors of childhood ALL, particularly those exposed to cranial radiation. Because obesity is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in later life, identification of children at high risk might allow for early targeted interventions.","['Ross, Julie A', 'Oeffinger, Kevin C', 'Davies, Stella M', 'Mertens, Ann C', 'Langer, Erica K', 'Kiffmeyer, William R', 'Sklar, Charles A', 'Stovall, Marilyn', 'Yasui, Yutaka', 'Robison, Leslie L']","['Ross JA', 'Oeffinger KC', 'Davies SM', 'Mertens AC', 'Langer EK', 'Kiffmeyer WR', 'Sklar CA', 'Stovall M', 'Yasui Y', 'Robison LL']","['Division of Pediatric Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. ross@epi.umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (LEPR protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Leptin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics', 'Receptors, Leptin', 'Sex Factors']",2004/09/01 05:00,2004/09/21 05:00,['2004/09/01 05:00'],"['2004/09/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/09/01 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2004 Sep 1;22(17):3558-62. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2004.11.152.,"['10.1200/JCO.2004.11.152 [doi]', '22/17/3558 [pii]']",,['U24 CA-55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously cloned the promoter region of the COMP gene and delineated a minimal negative regulatory element (NRE) that is both necessary and sufficient to repress its promoter (Issack, P. S., Fang, C. H., Leslie, M. P., and Di Cesare, P. E. (2000) J. Orthop. Res. 18, 345-350; Issack, P. S., Liu, C. J., Prazak, L., and Di Cesare, P. E. (2004) J. Orthop. Res. 22, 751-758). In this study, a yeast one-hybrid screen for proteins that associate with the NRE led to the identification of the leukemia/lymphoma-related factor (LRF), a transcriptional repressor that contains a POZ (poxvirus zinc finger) domain, as an NRE-binding protein. LRF bound directly to the NRE both in vitro and in living cells. Nine nucleotides (GAGGGTCCC) in the 30-bp NRE are essential for binding to LRF. LRF showed dose-dependent inhibition of COMP-specific reporter gene activity, and exogenous overexpression of LRF repressed COMP gene expression in both rat chondrosarcoma cells and bone morphogenetic protein-2-treated C3H10T1/2 progenitor cells.

Here, we report that cross-talk between CCR1-mediated signaling pathway and FcepsilonRI-mediated signaling pathway affects degranulation positively but affects chemotaxis of mast cells adversely. Costimulation via FcepsilonRI engagement with IgE/antigen and CCR1 engagement with recombinant human CCL3 synergistically enhanced degranulation in rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cells expressing human CCR1 (RBL-CCR1). Interestingly, FcepsilonRI engagement inhibited CCL3-mediated chemotaxis and membrane ruffling of RBL-CCR1 cells. Small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family, Rac, Cdc42, and Rho control chemotaxis by mediating the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Both a Rho inhibitor C3 exoenzyme and a Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 inhibited chemotaxis of RBL-CCR1 cells toward CCL3, indicating that activation of the Rho/ROCK signaling pathway is required for the CCL3-mediated chemotaxis of the cells. Costimulation with IgE/antigen and CCL3 enhanced Rac and Cdc42 activation but decreased ROCK activation in RBL-CCR1 cells compared with that in the cells stimulated with CCL3 alone. These results suggest that costimulation via FcepsilonRI and CCR1 engagements induced 1) inhibition of membrane ruffling, 2) decreased ROCK activation, and 3) reciprocal imbalance between Small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family, which result in the inhibition of chemotaxis of RBL-CCR1 cells. The cross-talk between FcepsilonRI-mediated signaling pathway and CCR-mediated signaling pathway would induce optimal activation and arrested chemotaxis of mast cells, thus contributing to allergic inflammation.","['Toda, Masako', 'Dawson, Maria', 'Nakamura, Takao', 'Munro, Peter M G', 'Richardson, Ricardo Micheler', 'Bailly, Maryse', 'Ono, Santa Jeremy']","['Toda M', 'Dawson M', 'Nakamura T', 'Munro PM', 'Richardson RM', 'Bailly M', 'Ono SJ']","['Division of Ocular Immunology, Institutes of Ophthalmology, University College London, London EC1V 9EL, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CCR1 protein, human)', '0 (Ccr1 protein, rat)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CCR1)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (rho-Associated Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Degranulation/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*physiology', 'Chemokines, CC/immunology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mast Cells/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, CCR1', 'Receptors, Chemokine/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, IgE/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'rho-Associated Kinases']",2004/09/01 05:00,2005/01/22 09:00,['2004/09/01 05:00'],"['2004/09/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/01 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Nov 12;279(46):48443-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M408725200.

Calcium is accumulated in the ER by various biochemically distinct sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium transport ATPase isoenzymes (SERCA isoforms). Experimental data indicate that the SERCA composition of some carcinoma and leukaemia cell types undergoes significant changes during differentiation, and that this is accompanied by modifications of SERCA-dependent calcium accumulation in the ER. Because ER calcium homeostasis can also influence cell differentiation, we propose that the modulation of the expression of various SERCA isoforms, and in particular, the induction of the expression of SERCA3-type proteins, is an integral part of the differentiation program of some cancer and leukaemia cell types. The SERCA content of the ER may constitute a new parameter by which the calcium homeostatic characteristics of the organelle are adjusted.

The neurosurgical management of these patients can be problematic. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report about a 46-year-old patient, who had BMT because of a Pre-T-ALL and who developed symptomatic bihemispheric chronic subdural hematomas (cSDHs). Pre-T-ALL is a form of an acute lymphatic leukemia of T cell type characterized by certain immunologic markers with a worse prognosis. A few hours after evacuation of the cSDHs, the patient developed a fulminant intracerebral hemorrhage on each hemisphere and expired 2 days later. We reviewed the literature reporting similar cases to discuss the indication for a neurosurgical intervention. CONCLUSION: We presume a higher incidence of intracranial hemorrhage in BMT patients than reported. This is caused by the pathologically altered parenchyma related to the extensive therapy in these patients. BMT patients are typically at high risk for intracranial bleeding and are treated conservatively or surgically. We cannot generally recommend the conservative management for symptomatic subdural hematomas/hygromas. The risk for an acute worsening, secondary to repeated hemorrhage, is equivalent to the risk of surgical intervention. Although the outcome of our case is tragic, it should not deter surgical intervention.","['Renner, C', 'Hegenbarth, U', 'Schneider, J P', 'Meixensberger, J']","['Renner C', 'Hegenbarth U', 'Schneider JP', 'Meixensberger J']","['Department of Neurosurgery, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Surg Neurol,Surgical neurology,0367070,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/diagnostic imaging/*etiology', 'Drainage/*adverse effects', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Hematoma, Subdural, Chronic/diagnostic imaging/*etiology/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiography']",2004/09/01 05:00,2004/10/16 09:00,['2004/09/01 05:00'],"['2003/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2003/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/01 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Surg Neurol. 2004 Sep;62(3):260-3; discussion 263. doi: 10.1016/j.surneu.2003.11.034.,"['10.1016/j.surneu.2003.11.034 [doi]', 'S0090301904000230 [pii]']",,,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trisenox, the active ingredient of which is trivalent arsenic, is the first line of treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia. Since drug action usually requires uptake of the drug, it is of importance to determine the transport system responsible for Trisenox uptake. Recently, human aquaglyceroporin 9 (AQP9) has been shown to transport As(III) in Xenopus oocytes. In this study we report to show that AQP9 expression modulates the drug sensitivity of leukemic cells. AQP9 was transfected into the chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562. The transfectants became hypersensitive to Trisenox and Sb(III). The promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 treated with vitamin D showed higher expression of AQP9 and hypersensitivity to Trisenox and Sb(III). This sensitivity was due to higher rates of uptake of the trivalent metalloids by the cell lines overexpressing AQP9. Trisenox hypersensitivity results from increased expression of AQP9 drug uptake system. The possibility of using pharmacological agents to increase expression of AQP9 gene delivers the promise of new therapies for the treatment of leukemia. Thus, drug hypersensitivity can be correlated with increased expression of the drug uptake system. This is the first demonstration that AQP9 can modulate drug sensitivity in cancer.","['Bhattacharjee, Hiranmoy', 'Carbrey, Jennifer', 'Rosen, Barry P', 'Mukhopadhyay, Rita']","['Bhattacharjee H', 'Carbrey J', 'Rosen BP', 'Mukhopadhyay R']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Wayne State University, School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (AQP9 protein, human)', '0 (Aquaporins)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Aquaporins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Transport', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Ion Channels/genetics/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Oxides/pharmacokinetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Vitamin D/pharmacology']",2004/09/01 05:00,2004/11/02 09:00,['2004/09/01 05:00'],"['2004/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/01 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2004 Sep 24;322(3):836-41. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.08.002.,"['10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.08.002 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(04)01718-8 [pii]']",,['GM 52216/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the role of ferrous iron in the cytotoxicity of artemisinins toward tumor cells. Iron(II)-glycine sulfate (Ferrosanol) and transferrin increased the cytotoxicity of free artesunate, artesunate microencapsulated in maltosyl-beta-cyclodextrin, and artemisinin toward CCRF-CEM leukemia and U373 astrocytoma cells 1.5- to 10.3-fold compared with that of artemisinins applied without iron. Growth inhibition by artesunate and ferrous iron correlated with induction of apoptosis. Cell cycle perturbations by artesunate and ferrous iron were not observed. Treatment of p53 wild-type TK6 and p53 mutated WTK1 lymphoblastic cells showed that mutational status of the tumor suppressor p53 did not influence sensitivity to artesunate. The effect of ferrous iron and transferrin was reversed by monoclonal antibody RVS10 against the transferrin receptor (TfR), which competes with transferrin for binding to TfR. CCRF-CEM and U373 cells expressed TfR in 95 and 48% of the cell population, respectively, whereas TfR expression in peripheral mononuclear blood cells of four healthy donors was confined to 0.4-1.3%. This indicates that artemisinins plus ferrous iron may affect tumor cells more than normal cells.

Recent publications have described a physical interaction between pRas and pRaf-1, either as ectopic proteins in yeast or as recombinant proteins added to cellular extracts. Until now, however, physical complexes that include pRas and pRaf-1 have not been identified as native structures in mammalian cells. RESULTS: We have directly identified a pRas-pRaf-1 complex in extracts of mammalian cells. Formation of the complex is augmented in neoplastically transformed cells expressing constitutively activated pRas. Moreover, the complexes form in concert with the activation of pRas during intracellular signalling through the T-cell receptor in T-leukemia cells. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that, pRas signals to pRaf-1 in vivo by means of a direct physical interaction that results in activation of the pRaf-1 protein kinase.","['Finney, R E', 'Robbins, S M', 'Bishop, J M']","['Finney RE', 'Robbins SM', 'Bishop JM']","['The George Williams Hooper Foundation, University of California, Box 0552, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Curr Biol,Current biology : CB,9107782,,,,1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/04 00:00 [received]', '1993/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '1993/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Biol. 1993 Dec 1;3(12):805-12. doi: 10.1016/0960-9822(93)90214-9.,"['0960-9822(93)90214-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0960-9822(93)90214-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These tails are thought to be involved either in signal transduction or in the association of transmembrane proteins with the cytoskeleton. We have previously identified, in the cytoplasmic tails of components of B and T lymphocyte antigen receptors, an amino-acid motif that is required for signalling. The same motif is also found in the cytoplasmic tails of two viral proteins: the latent membrane protein, LMP2A, of Epstein Barr virus and the envelope protein, gp30, of bovine leukaemia virus. Interestingly, both viruses can activate infected B lymphocytes to proliferate, as does signalling by the B-cell receptor. RESULTS: In this study, we show that the cytoplasmic tails of the two viral proteins, and the cytoplasmic tail of the B-cell receptor immunoglobulin-alpha chain, when linked to CD8 in chimeric transmembrane proteins, can transduce signals in B cells. Cross-linking of these chimeric receptors activates B-cell protein tyrosine kinases and results in calcium mobilization. Furthermore, these cytoplasmic sequences are also protein tyrosine kinase substrates and may interact with cytosolic proteins carrying SH2 protein-protein interaction domains. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that viral transmembrane proteins can mimic the antigen-induced stimulation of the B-cell antigen receptor and thus can influence the activation and/or survival of infected B lymphocytes.","['Alber, G', 'Kim, K M', 'Weiser, P', 'Riesterer, C', 'Carsetti, R', 'Reth, M']","['Alber G', 'Kim KM', 'Weiser P', 'Riesterer C', 'Carsetti R', 'Reth M']","['Max-Planck-Institut fur Immunbiologie, Stubeweg 51, W-7800 Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Curr Biol,Current biology : CB,9107782,,,,1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/08 00:00 [received]', '1993/05/07 00:00 [revised]', '1993/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Biol. 1993 Jun 1;3(6):333-9. doi: 10.1016/0960-9822(93)90196-u.,"['0960-9822(93)90196-U [pii]', '10.1016/0960-9822(93)90196-u [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumour-targeted delivery of a cytotoxic agent in the form of an immunoconjugate is expected to improve its antitumour activity and safety. Calicheamicin is a cytotoxic natural product isolated from Micromonospora echinospora that is at least 1000-fold more potent than conventional cytotoxic chemotherapeutics. Calicheamicin binds DNA in the minor groove and causes double-strand DNA breaks, leading to cell death. Immunoconjugates of calicheamicin targeted against tumour-associated antigens exhibit tumour-specific cytotoxic effects and cause regression of established human tumour xenografts in nude mice. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is the first clinically validated cytotoxic immunoconjugate in which a humanised anti-CD33 antibody is linked to a derivative of calicheamicin. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is indicated for the treatment of elderly patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukaemia. A similar conjugate, inotuzumab ozogamicin, is being evaluated at present in Phase I clinical trials in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Select cases may require additional ancillary cytogenetic and molecular studies for diagnosis. The purpose of this review is to focus on the applications of flow cytometric and immunohistochemical immunophenotyping of paraffin-embedded tissue to diagnostic hematopathology. Advantages and disadvantages of these techniques are examined. DATA SOURCES: The literature is extensively reviewed (PubMed 1985-2003) with an emphasis on the most recent applications and those that are most useful clinically, both diagnostically and prognostically. Study Selection.-Studies were selected based on statistically significant results in large studies with reported adequate clinical follow-up. DATA EXTRACTION: The methodology was reviewed in the selected studies to ensure reliable comparison of reported data. DATA SYNTHESIS: Flow cytometric immunophenotyping offers the sensitive detection of antigens for which antibodies may not be available for paraffin immunohistochemical immunophenotyping. However, paraffin immunohistochemical immunophenotyping offers preservation of architecture and evaluation of expression of some proteins, which may not be available by flow cytometric immunophenotyping. These techniques should be used as complimentary tools in diagnostic hematopathology. CONCLUSIONS: There are extensive applications of flow cytometric and immunohistochemical immunophenotyping to diagnostic hematopathology. As cytogenetic and molecular findings evolve in diagnostic hematopathology, there may be additional applications of flow cytometric and immunohistochemical immunophenotyping to this field of pathology.","['Dunphy, Cherie H']",['Dunphy CH'],"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599-7525, USA. cdunphy@unch.unc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,,IM,"['*Flow Cytometry', 'Hematologic Diseases/pathology', 'Hematology/*methods', '*Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymphoma/pathology']",2004/09/01 05:00,2005/03/01 09:00,['2004/09/01 05:00'],"['2004/09/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/01 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2004 Sep;128(9):1004-22. doi: 10.5858/2004-128-1004-AOFCAI.,"['RA4013 [pii]', '10.5858/2004-128-1004-AOFCAI [doi]']",,,146,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Part 1: Anemia, quality of life, and possible effects on survival.","249-56, 258-9; discussion 257-8","Erythropoietic agents have been shown to be well tolerated and highly effective in correcting the anemia associated with cancer. Studies aimed at optimizing their use in this regard are ongoing and are evaluating the potential value of early dose intensification through ""front-loading"" schedules, the feasibility of reducing the frequency of dosing, and the value of early initiation of erythropoietic agents to prevent anemia. The potential for erythropoietic therapy to contribute to survival in cancer patients also is being investigated. Anemia is an independent poor prognostic factor in several cancer settings, such as head-and-neck, lung, and cervical cancer. In patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, it is possible that the period of stable disease--that is, postponement of the need for cytotoxic chemotherapy--may be prolonged when patients are ""downstaged"" through correction of their anemia. In addition, anemia may affect the patient's quality of life in ways that impact compliance and/or the ability to tolerate therapy. Retrospective analysis of large phase III trials designed to evaluate the effect of erythropoietic agents on anemia in cancer patients has reported a trend toward improved survival among patients who received erythropoietic therapy. Trials to evaluate how correction of anemia in cancer patients might impact survival are ongoing. In this first installment of a two-part article, the author reviews the clinical data supporting the use of erythropoietic agents for the management of the fatigue due to anemia, the effect of anemia control on quality of life, and the evidence available so far that control of such anemia may actually lengthen survival.

Studies of families with a Mendelian predisposition to hematological malignancies have identified the gene coding for the transcription factor RUNX1 as a leukemia-predisposing gene involved in the first steps of leukemogenesis. Using two families, another autosomal dominant familial leukemia locus was linked to chromosome band 16q22 where the CBFB gene maps. Although CBFB forms a core-binding factor transcriptional complex with RUNX1, previous analyses have excluded the CBFB gene as the leukemia-predisposing gene in these families. In the current study, we performed an extended molecular analysis in these families of the four other transcription factor genes in the 16q22 critical region as well as of two other genes with a known association with leukemia. Several previously undescribed but nonpathogenic sequence variants were identified. We demonstrated that the transcription factors E2F4, CTCF, NFATC3, and NFAT5, and the genes coding for NAD(P)H:quinone oxido-reductase 1 (NQO1) and for E-cadherin are not responsible for the leukemia susceptibility in these families. The presence of NQO1 polymorphisms may suggest a role for this gene in disease risk modification in these families.","['Escher, Robert', 'Jones, Antonia', 'Hagos, Fitsum', 'Carmichael, Catherine', 'Horwitz, Marshall', 'Olopade, Olufunmilayo I', 'Scott, Hamish S']","['Escher R', 'Jones A', 'Hagos F', 'Carmichael C', 'Horwitz M', 'Olopade OI', 'Scott HS']","['Genetics and Bioinformatics Division, the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (CCCTC-Binding Factor)', '0 (CTCF protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NFAT5 protein, human)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (transcription factor NF-AT c3)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NQO1 protein, human)']",IM,"['CCCTC-Binding Factor', 'Chromosome Banding/*methods', 'Chromosomes/ultrastructure', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/*genetics/metabolism', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2004/08/31 05:00,2004/10/27 09:00,['2004/08/31 05:00'],"['2004/08/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/31 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2004 Nov;41(3):278-82. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20084.,['10.1002/gcc.20084 [doi]'],,"['DK55820/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK58161/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed the involvement of the ETV6 gene in 12p13. ETV6 primers were specifically designed for 3'- and 5'-RACE-PCR experiments, which led to the identification of the other two rearranged genes. The derivative chromosome 5 harbored a fusion of the ETV6 sequence with that of the LOC115548 gene. The two genes were placed in opposite orientation and did not encode a fusion protein. On the derivative chromosome 12, ETV6 was fused to the MN1 gene on chromosome 22. Also in this case, the insertion, within the MN1 sequence, of a portion of chromosome 3 prevented the formation of a fusion protein. Finally, the derivative chromosome 22 contained the 3' portions of both LOC115548 and MN1, and no fusion transcript with coding potential could be predicted. In conclusion, all chromosome breakpoints led to the truncation of the three involved genes in the absence of predicted fusion proteins.

We report on 12 ALL patients with an unusual FISH result consisting of the following signal pattern: one 5' green, no 3' red, and one/two fusion signals. This configuration is consistent with a MLL translocation and simultaneous deletion of 3' MLL-a well-established phenomenon-which has been interpreted as a positive result. G-banded and complementary metaphase FISH analyses confirmed an 11q23/MLL translocation in 8 of the 12 cases, whereas in one case, the identification of a del(11)(q23) was restricted to G-banded analysis only. In three cases, an MLL rearrangement was excluded by extensive FISH analysis and/or Southern blotting.

L3MBTL is highly homologous to the D-lethal(3) malignant brain tumor [D-l(3)mbt] gene, which is a putative tumor-suppressor gene (TSG) identified in Drosophila and which is closely related to the Drosophila sex combs on midleg (SCM) protein, a member of the Polycomb group (PcG) family of transcriptional repressors. To examine whether L3MBTL functions as a ""classic"" TSG in human hematologic malignancies, we screened a panel of 17 myeloid leukemia cell lines and peripheral blood or bone marrow samples from 29 MDS and 13 MPD patients for mutations in the entire L3MBTL coding sequence, including intron/exon splice junctions. No mutations were identified, although two single nucleotide differences were found (in intron 14 and in exon 15), which were interpreted as polymorphic changes. We used real-time RT-PCR to quantify the level of L3MBTL mRNA in various normal myeloid and lymphoid cell populations. L3MBTL is expressed in normal CD34+ bone marrow cells, and we found that the pattern of L3MBTL expression was similar to that of BMI1, a well-studied PcG gene with oncogenic activity, suggesting that L3MBTL and BMI1 may be co-regulated during hematopoiesis. The expression of L3MBTL mRNA in 30 of 35 cell lines and 13 of 15 AML samples was comparable to the level of L3MBTL expression in the normal cell populations. However, five leukemia cell lines showed no L3MBTL expression, and two of the AML samples showed aberrant L3MBTL expression. These data suggest that L3MBTL is not mutated in MDS or MPD. However, given the known dosage effects of PcG proteins in regulating gene expression, reduced or absent L3MBTL expression may be relevant in some cases of myeloid leukemia.","['MacGrogan, Donal', 'Kalakonda, Nagesh', 'Alvarez, Sara', 'Scandura, Joseph M', 'Boccuni, Piernicola', 'Johansson, Bertil', 'Nimer, Stephen D']","['MacGrogan D', 'Kalakonda N', 'Alvarez S', 'Scandura JM', 'Boccuni P', 'Johansson B', 'Nimer SD']","['Laboratory of Molecular Aspects of Hematopoiesis, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (L3MBTL1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Exons', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'RNA/chemistry', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2004/08/31 05:00,2004/10/27 09:00,['2004/08/31 05:00'],"['2004/08/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/31 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2004 Nov;41(3):203-13. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20087.,['10.1002/gcc.20087 [doi]'],,['R01CA102202/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the technique of comparative expressed sequence hybridization (CESH), we sought to address the question of whether increased chromosome copies in hyperdiploid ALL lead to increased gene expression. Relative expression of hyperdiploid ALL blasts versus peripheral blood mononuclear cells was analyzed in 18 patients. Common regions of overexpression corresponding to the presence of tri-/tetrasomies included: Xp22.1-22.2, 4q28, 6q14-15, 6q24, 10p13, 14q23-24, 17q21, 18q12, and 21q21, identified in 28-89% of cases. However, increased expression without underlying trisomy occurred at 3p21.3, 7q11.2, 8p21, and 8q24.1 in 39-90% of cases. High expression at 7q11.2, the most consistent change detected, was confirmed by quantitative PCR. Poor correlation between the presence of tri-/tetrasomy and overexpression was observed for chromosomes 14 and 17. Two cases were reanalyzed versus (i) B cells, (ii) transformed B cells, and (iii) CD34+19+ cells (the putative counterpart of the leukemic cell). A reduction in the number of relatively overexpressed regions was observed with CD34+19+ cells. In particular, the peak at 7q11.2 disappeared, suggesting up-regulation of genes from this region in the early ontology of normal B-cell development. In conclusion, we have shown that tri-/tetrasomies in hyperdiploid ALL lead to an increase in the expression of associated sequences. The choice of a biologically relevant reference is crucial for data interpretation.","['Gruszka-Westwood, Alicja M', 'Horsley, Sharon W', 'Martinez-Ramirez, Angel', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Kempski, Helena', 'Moorman, Anthony V', 'Ross, Fiona M', 'Griffiths, Michael', 'Greaves, Mel F', 'Kearney, Lyndal']","['Gruszka-Westwood AM', 'Horsley SW', 'Martinez-Ramirez A', 'Harrison CJ', 'Kempski H', 'Moorman AV', 'Ross FM', 'Griffiths M', 'Greaves MF', 'Kearney L']","['Section of Haematological Oncology, Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Diploidy', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",2004/08/31 05:00,2004/10/27 09:00,['2004/08/31 05:00'],"['2004/08/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/31 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2004 Nov;41(3):191-202. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20085.,['10.1002/gcc.20085 [doi]'],,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assure the safety of pharmaceutical proteins, validation of the ability of manufacturing processes to clear retrovirus-like particles is required for product registration. Xenotropic murine leukemia virus (X-MuLV) is often used as a model virus for clearance studies. Traditionally, cell-based infectivity assay has been the standard virus quantification method. In this article, a real time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) method has been developed for X-MuLV detection/quantification. This method provides accurate and reproducible quantification of X-MuLV particle RNA (pRNA) over a linear dynamic range of at least 100,000-fold with a quantification limit of approximately 1.5 pRNA copies microL(-1). It is about 100-fold more sensitive than the cell-based infectivity assay. High concentrations of protein and cellular DNA present in test samples have been demonstrated to have no impact on X-MuLV quantification. The X-MuLV clearance during chromatography and filtration procedures determined by this method is highly comparable with that determined by the cell-based infectivity assay. X-MuLV clearance measured by both methods showed that anion exchange chromatography (QSFF) and DV50 viral filtration are robust retroviral removal steps. In addition, combination of the two methods was able to distinguish the viral removal from inactivation by the Protein A chromatography, and fully recognize the viral clearance capacity of this step. This new method offers significant advantages over cell-based infectivity assays. It could be used to substitute cell-based infectivity assays for process validation of viral removal procedures, but not inactivation steps. Its availability should greatly facilitate and reduce the cost of viral clearance evaluations for new biologic product development.","['Shi, Liming', 'Chen, Qi', 'Norling, Lenore A', 'Lau, Allen S L', 'Krejci, Sherrie', 'Xu, Yuan']","['Shi L', 'Chen Q', 'Norling LA', 'Lau AS', 'Krejci S', 'Xu Y']","['Process Sciences, Genentech, Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,"['0 (Pharmaceutical Preparations)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromatography/*methods', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Drug Contamination/prevention & control', 'Online Systems', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations/*isolation & purification', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Receptors, Virus/*analysis/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Recombinant Proteins/*isolation & purification/*therapeutic use', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor']",2004/08/31 05:00,2005/02/11 09:00,['2004/08/31 05:00'],"['2004/08/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/31 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2004 Sep 30;87(7):884-96. doi: 10.1002/bit.20198.,['10.1002/bit.20198 [doi]'],,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we explore a strategy aimed at obtaining silencing of AR-regulated genes, based on the properties of the transcriptional repressor promyelocytic leukamia zinc-finger protein (PLZF). In order to do this, we have made a fusion protein between PLZF and AR, named PLZF-AR, and show that PLZF-AR is able to bring about silencing of genomically encoded AR-regulated genes and inhibit the androgen-regulated growth of LNCaP prostate cancer cells.

Recent identification of several functionally divergent survivin variants augments the complexity of survivin action as well as its regulation. Here we report that survivin-2B (retaining a part of intron 2 as a cryptic exon) is positively regulated by p53, and its overexpression plays a role in sensitizing leukemia cells to chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. Doxorubicin treatment activated p53, downregulated survivin and survivin-DeltaEx3 but upregulated survivin-2B in EU-3, an acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cell line with wild-type (wt)-p53 phenotype. In contrast, doxorubicin treatment failed to induce these alterations in EU-6 cells, a mutant-p53 ALL cell line. To specify the role of wt-p53 in regulating survivin and its variants, a temperature-sensitive p53 mutant plasmid p53-143 was transfected into EU-4, a p53-null ALL cell line, to establish a subline EU-4/p53-143. When EU-4/p53-143 cell culture was shifted from 37.5 degrees C to the wt-p53-permissive temperature (32.5 degrees C), the expression of survivin and survivin-DeltaEx3 was decreased whereas survivin-2B expression was increased, confirming the distinct regulatory effect of p53 on survivin and its variants. To clarify the role of survivin-2B in the process of apoptosis, survivin-2B cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3HA vector and transfected into EU-4 cells. Enforced expression of survivin-2B in EU-4 cells inhibited cell growth and sensitized these cells to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that survivin-2B variant is a proapoptotic factor and its expression is upregulated by p53.","['Zhu, Ningxi', 'Gu, Lubing', 'Findley, Harry W', 'Li, Fengzhi', 'Zhou, Muxiang']","['Zhu N', 'Gu L', 'Findley HW', 'Li F', 'Zhou M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Survivin', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Up-Regulation']",2004/08/31 05:00,2004/11/04 09:00,['2004/08/31 05:00'],"['2004/08/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/31 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Sep 30;23(45):7545-51. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208038.,"['10.1038/sj.onc.1208038 [doi]', '1208038 [pii]']",,['R01 CA82323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These interactions are mediated by a conserved ETO TAF4 homology domain and a 17-amino acid p300/CBP and ETO target motif within AD1 activation domains of E proteins. In t(8;21) leukemic cells, very stable interactions between AML1-ETO and E proteins underlie a t(8;21) translocation-specific silencing of E protein function through an aberrant cofactor exchange mechanism.

The mutation of c-kit, cording KIT, is essential in the development of GIST. Imatinib mesylate (IM), an agent for chronic myeloid leukemia, was reported to inhibit tyrosine kinase activity of KIT and to be highly effective for GIST. We report, here, a case of huge gastric GIST who underwent neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection. The patient was a 62-year-old man with GIST in cardia (KIT+, CD34+, mitotic rate 5/50 HPF), whose chief complaint was general fatigue. Because the huge tumor, 7.5 cm in size, directly invaded the pancreas, total gastrectomy with distal pancreatosplenectomy was necessary for curative resection. IM was administered (400 mg/body/day) as a neoadjuvant treatment for down-staging of the tumor. Leucopenia (grade 2) and diarrhea (grade 1) were observed as the adverse effects of IM. Partial response was obtained. He underwent proximal gastrectomy without pancreatosplenectomy since CT no longer showed direct invasion to the pancreas. Histological examination of the resected specimen revealed the extensive degeneration of the tumor, in which tumor cells containing condensed nuclei had decreased remarkably. Interestingly, mitotic rate decreased to 0/50 HPF in the effective area of the resected specimen, indicating that recurrent risk might be decreased. A part of the viable tumor cells, however, had the same feature to that in the biopsied specimen before treatment. The results suggest that the heterogeneity of GIST induces different sensitivity to IM. The postoperative course was uneventful and no sign of recurrence was observed 3 months after surgery. Neoadjuvant therapy with IM may become a useful strategy for GIST, as it reduces the tumor size and decreases the recurrence rate.","['Hiramatsu, Yoshihiro', 'Konno, Hiroyuki', 'Kamiya, Kinji', 'Baba, Megumi', 'Ohta, Manabu', 'Kondo, Kenji', 'Yamamoto, Masayoshi', 'Kikuchi, Hirotoshi', 'Tanaka, Tatsuo', 'Sugimura, Haruhiko', 'Nakamura, Satoshi']","['Hiramatsu Y', 'Konno H', 'Kamiya K', 'Baba M', 'Ohta M', 'Kondo K', 'Yamamoto M', 'Kikuchi H', 'Tanaka T', 'Sugimura H', 'Nakamura S']","['Second Dept of Surgery, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

The artificial Mx1-yellow fluorescent protein body showed a very similar mobility compared with PML and Cajal bodies. The data are described quantitatively by a mechanism of nuclear body movement consisting of two components: diffusion of the body within a chromatin corral and its translocation resulting from chromatin diffusion.

Here we report that JCV virions are efficiently assembled at nuclear domain 10 (ND10), which is also known as promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies. The major capsid protein VP1, the minor capsid proteins VP2 and VP3, and a regulatory protein called agnoprotein were coexpressed from a polycistronic expression vector in COS-7 cells. We found that VP1 accumulated to distinct subnuclear domains in the presence of VP2/VP3 and agnoprotein, while VP1 expressed alone was distributed both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Mutation analysis revealed that discrete intranuclear accumulation of VP1 requires the presence of either VP2 or VP3. However, VP2 or VP3 expressed in the absence of VP1 showed diffuse, not discrete, nuclear localization. The C-terminal sequence of VP2/VP3 contains two basic regions, GPNKKKRRK (cluster 1) and KRRSRSSRS (cluster 2). The deletion of cluster 2 abolished the accumulation of VP1 to distinct subnuclear domains. Deletion of the C-terminal 34 residues of VP2/VP3, including both cluster 1 and cluster 2, caused VP1 to localize both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Using immunoelectron microscopy of cells that coexpressed VP1, VP2/VP3, and agnoprotein, we detected the assembly of virus-like particles in discrete locations along the inner nuclear periphery. Both in oligodendrocytes of the human brain and in transfected cells, discrete nuclear domains for VP1 accumulation were identified as ND10, which contains the PML protein. These results indicate that major and minor capsid proteins cooperatively accumulate in ND10, where they are efficiently assembled into virions.","['Shishido-Hara, Yukiko', 'Ichinose, Shizuko', 'Higuchi, Kayoko', 'Hara, Yoshinobu', 'Yasui, Kotaro']","['Shishido-Hara Y', 'Ichinose S', 'Higuchi K', 'Hara Y', 'Yasui K']","['Department of Microbiology, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience, Japan. shishido-hara@par.odn.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (VP1 protein, polyomavirus)', '0 (VP2 protein, Polyomavirus)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (agnoprotein, polyomavirus)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Capsid Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/ultrastructure/virology', 'Humans', 'JC Virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Transfection', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins', 'Virus Assembly/*physiology']",2004/08/28 05:00,2004/09/29 05:00,['2004/08/28 05:00'],"['2004/08/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/29 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Sep;78(18):9890-903. doi: 10.1128/JVI.78.18.9890-9903.2004.,"['10.1128/JVI.78.18.9890-9903.2004 [doi]', '78/18/9890 [pii]']",,,,PMC514983,,['Copyright 2004 American Society for Microbiology'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elimination of these contaminants from retroviral vector preparations is helpful to reduce unwanted side effects, and purified vector preparations are desirable to improve reproducibility of therapeutic effect. Here we report a novel approach to engineer a metal binding peptide (MBP)-tagged murine leukemia virus (MuLV), allowing for one-step purification of retroviral vectors by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). We inserted a His6 peptide into an ecotropic envelope protein (Env) by replacing part of its hypervariable region sequence with a sequence encoding the His6 peptide. Display of the His6 tag on the surface of Env endowed the vectors with a high affinity for immobilized metal ions, such as nickel. We demonstrated that the His6-tagged MuLV could be produced to high titers and could be highly purified by one-step IMAC.

Leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) belongs to a small subfamily of RhoGEFs that are RhoA-selective and directly activated by the Galpha12/13 family of heterotrimeric G proteins. Herein we describe the atomic structures of the catalytic Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains of LARG alone and in complex with RhoA. These structures demonstrate that the DH/PH domains of LARG can undergo a dramatic conformational change upon binding RhoA, wherein both the DH and PH domains directly engage RhoA. Through mutational analysis we show that full nucleotide exchange activity requires a novel N-terminal extension on the DH domain that is predicted to exist in a broader family of RhoGEFs that includes p115-RhoGEF, Lbc, Lfc, Net1, and Xpln, and identify regions within the LARG PH domain that contribute to its ability to facilitate nucleotide exchange in vitro. In crystals of the DH/PH-RhoA complex, the active site of RhoA adopts two distinct GDP-excluding conformations among the four unique complexes in the asymmetric unit. Similar changes were previously observed in structures of nucleotide-free Ras and Ef-Tu. A potential protein-docking site on the LARG PH domain is also evident and appears to be conserved throughout the Lbc subfamily of RhoGEFs.","['Kristelly, Romana', 'Gao, Guang', 'Tesmer, John J G']","['Kristelly R', 'Gao G', 'Tesmer JJ']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712-0165, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ARHGEF1 protein, human)', '0 (ARHGEF3 protein, human)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '124671-05-2 (RHOA protein, human)', '146-91-8 (Guanosine Diphosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Peptide Elongation Factor Tu)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA/chemistry', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/chemistry', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*metabolism', 'Guanosine Diphosphate/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides/chemistry', 'Peptide Elongation Factor Tu/chemistry', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Time Factors', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/chemistry/*physiology']",2004/08/28 05:00,2004/12/29 09:00,['2004/08/28 05:00'],"['2004/08/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Nov 5;279(45):47352-62. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M406056200.

PML I was able to recruit AML1 and coactivator p300 in PML nuclear bodies and enhance the AML1-mediated transcription in the presence of p300. A specific C-terminal region of PML I and a C-terminal region of AML1 were found to be required for both their association and colocalization in the nuclear bodies.

The kinetics of cytotoxicity of docetaxel showed a delayed response of K562 cells compared to HL-60 cells. After treatment with 10(-8)M docetaxel, DNA fragmentation and sub-G0/G1 cells were evident in HL-60 cells in less than 6 h, while K562 cells gradually arrested in G2/M phase of the cell cycle and appeared normal for 24 h before developing similar apoptotic changes. The delayed apoptotic changes in K562 cells were accompanied by delayed activation of caspase-3. Additionally, NADPH oxidase inhibition with diphenylene iodonium showed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst mediated critically in the caspase-3 activation and apoptosis in HL-60 cells but was only partially involved in those events of K562 cells. These results suggested that docetaxel exposure triggered the delayed apoptosis in K562 cells and the different ROS-dependent or independent signal pathways might account for this phenomenon. Docetaxel elicited ROS production from NADPH oxidase, which in turn triggered activation of caspase-3, leading to apoptosis in HL-60 cells.

Furthermore, the expression of C-KIT has been described in Hodgkin's disease and nodal CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs). As it is possible to inhibit C-KIT by innovative kinase inhibitors like STI571, it may be an attractive target for new therapeutical approaches. Therefore, we screened more than 50 different types of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (TCLs) for the presence of C-KIT. Immunohistochemical stainings were performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections using a polyclonal rabbit anti-human C-KIT antibody. Naphtol-ASD-chloroacetate esterase (NASDCE)-control stainings were performed on every positive sample to distinguish C-KIT-positive lymphoma cells from C-KIT-positive mast cells. RESULTS: We found weak expression of C-KIT in seven of 18 patients with primary cutaneous CD30+ ALCL, two of eight patients with primary cutaneous pleomorphic TCL, six of 18 patients suffering from mycosis fungoides, and three of five patients with Sezary's syndrome. Generally, only a very small population of the lymphoma cells expressed C-KIT. This finding indicates a difference to the systemic variant of CD30+ ALCL. The potential use of C-KIT targeting new therapeutical approaches is therefore discussed critically, because C-KIT expression is very rare in all investigated types of primary cutaneous lymphoma.","['Brauns, Tilmann C', 'Schultewolter, Thomas', 'Dissemond, Joachim', 'Maschke, Jan', 'Goos, Manfred']","['Brauns TC', 'Schultewolter T', 'Dissemond J', 'Maschke J', 'Goos M']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Essen, Essen, Germany. tilmannbrauns@aol.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Ki-1 Antigen)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ki-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*biosynthesis', 'Skin Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology']",2004/08/28 05:00,2004/12/23 09:00,['2004/08/28 05:00'],"['2004/08/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2004 Oct;31(9):577-82. doi: 10.1111/j.0303-6987.2004.00182.x.,"['10.1111/j.0303-6987.2004.00182.x [doi]', 'CUP182 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tried to clarify functions of a cell surface microdomain, lipid raft, in neuroepithelial cells (NECs). NECs are suggested to adhere to fibronectin substratum dependently on integrin molecules. We found that beta1 integrin, a component of fibronectin receptors, was distributed in lipid rafts. Methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MBCD), an inhibitor of lipid raft formation, inhibited the integrin-fibronectin interaction-dependent adhesion of NECs. However, inhibition of synthesis of glycosphingolipids (GSL), components of lipid rafts, did not affect NEC adhesion. Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), an interleukin 6 type cytokine, induces astrocyte differentiation of NECs via activation of a transcription factor STAT3. We detected gp130, JAK1 and Ras but not STAT3 and ERK2 molecules in lipid rafts of NECs. Disruption of lipid rafts by MBCD inhibited LIF-induced ERK activation but not STAT3 activation. It is thus suggested that LIF-downstream molecules have differential lipid raft-dependency in terms of activation upon LIF-stimulation.

The Rad51-Tyr315 residue is known to be constitutively phosphorylated in leukaemia cells and is thought to reside within the subunit-subunit interface of the Rad51 filament. To study the function of the Tyr315 residue, we purified five Rad51 mutants, Y315D, Y315E, Y315R, Y315A and Y315F, in which the Tyr315 residue was replaced by Asp, Glu, Arg, Ala and Phe, respectively. Biochemical studies of these Rad51 mutants revealed that the Y315D and Y315E mutants are defective in homologous pairing due to their impaired ssDNA binding, but their dsDNA binding remained unaffected. The Y315D, Y315E and Y315R mutants are defective in dsDNA unwinding, which depends on Rad51-filament formation, suggesting that these mutants are defective in filament formation on dsDNA. Therefore, the Rad51-Tyr315 residue plays important roles in ssDNA binding and filament formation.","['Takizawa, Yoshimasa', 'Kinebuchi, Takashi', 'Kagawa, Wataru', 'Yokoyama, Shigeyuki', 'Shibata, Takehiko', 'Kurumizaka, Hitoshi']","['Takizawa Y', 'Kinebuchi T', 'Kagawa W', 'Yokoyama S', 'Shibata T', 'Kurumizaka H']","['Graduate School of Integrated Science, Yokohama City University, 1-7-29 Suehiro-cho, Tsurumi, Yokohama 230-0045, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Genes Cells,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,9607379,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RAD51 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rad51 Recombinase)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/genetics/metabolism', 'Base Pairing', 'DNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA Helicases/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rad51 Recombinase', 'Tyrosine/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",2004/08/28 05:00,2004/10/19 09:00,['2004/08/28 05:00'],"['2004/08/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Cells. 2004 Sep;9(9):781-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2443.2004.00772.x.,"['10.1111/j.1365-2443.2004.00772.x [doi]', 'GTC772 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FC is a common practice, but is far from being validated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Morphological analysis and FC immunophenotyping were performed on 421 samples. T-cell lymphomas, Hodgkin's disease, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and hairy cell leukaemia were not included in the study. Clonality was assessed by the standard kappa/lambda/CD19 test. Aberrant immunophenotypes present in the B-cell subpopulation were also investigated. A double-step procedure was employed in all cases to increase the sensitivity of the FC procedure. Of 380 evaluable samples, 188 corresponded to follicular lymphoma (FL), 58 to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 57 to mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), seven to Burkitt's lymphoma and the remaining 70 samples to other low-grade lymphomas. Morphological marrow infiltration was found in 148 cases, and flow immunophenotyping identified 138 cases with BM involvement. A concordance between the two methods was detected in 298 cases (79%). There was a discordance in 82 cases (21%): morphology positive/FC negative in 46 cases and morphology negative/FC positive in 36 (61% of all cases with discordance were from FL). There was no difference in outcome when patients with discordances were compared with patients without discordances. CONCLUSIONS: Most samples showed concordance between morphological and FC results. FC identified BM involvement in the absence of morphological infiltration. Morphology/FC discordance seems to have no influence on the outcome of FL patients.","['Perea, G', 'Altes, A', 'Bellido, M', 'Aventin, A', 'Bordes, R', 'Ayats, R', 'Remacha, A F', 'Espinosa, I', 'Briones, J', 'Sierra, J', 'Nomdedeu, J F']","['Perea G', 'Altes A', 'Bellido M', 'Aventin A', 'Bordes R', 'Ayats R', 'Remacha AF', 'Espinosa I', 'Briones J', 'Sierra J', 'Nomdedeu JF']","['Department of Haematology, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/immunology/*pathology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology/*pathology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis']",2004/08/28 05:00,2005/01/14 09:00,['2004/08/28 05:00'],"['2004/08/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/14 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Histopathology. 2004 Sep;45(3):268-74. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.2004.01937.x.,"['10.1111/j.1365-2559.2004.01937.x [doi]', 'HIS1937 [pii]']",,,,,,['Copyright 2004 Blackwell Publishing Limited'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One crossreacting area on the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 and its homologue in cherry (Prunus avium) Pru av 1 has already been identified. This is the so-called 'P-loop' region, which encompasses amino acid residues around position 45 and is found on the two virtually identical tertiary protein structures. We tried to determine an additional IgE cross-reacting patch on Pru av 1 and Bet v 1. The putative IgE-binding region on Pru av 1 was localized with a mAb (monoclonal antibody) that was generated against Bet v 1, and cross-reacts with several Bet v 1 homologues in food and inhibits the binding of patients' IgE to Pru av 1. mAb reactivity pattern was analysed and amino acid positions 28 and 108 of Pru av 1 were selected and mutated by site-directed mutagenesis. The Pru av 1 mutants were produced as recombinant proteins and characterized for their folding, mAb- and IgE-binding capacity and allergenic potency with a cellular assay using the humanized rat basophilic leukaemia cell line RBL-25/30. Amino acid position 28 is involved in a second major IgE-binding region on Pru av 1 and probably on Bet v 1. The identification of this second major IgE-binding region is an essential prerequisite to understand the phenomenon of cross-reactivity and its clinical consequences, and to produce hypoallergenic proteins for an improved immunotherapy of type I allergy.","['Wiche, Regina', 'Gubesch, Michaela', 'Konig, Herbert', 'Fotisch, Kay', 'Hoffmann, Andreas', 'Wangorsch, Andrea', 'Scheurer, Stephan', 'Vieths, Stefan']","['Wiche R', 'Gubesch M', 'Konig H', 'Fotisch K', 'Hoffmann A', 'Wangorsch A', 'Scheurer S', 'Vieths S']","['Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Paul-Ehrlich-Strasse 51-59, 63225 Langen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Plant)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Pru av 1 allergen, Prunus avium)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Allergens/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Plant', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Cross Reactions/*immunology', 'Epitopes/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Food Hypersensitivity/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/*immunology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Pollen/*immunology', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Prunus/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance']",2004/08/28 05:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2004/08/28 05:00'],"['2004/08/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2005 Jan 1;385(Pt 1):319-27. doi: 10.1042/BJ20040842.,"['10.1042/BJ20040842 [doi]', 'BJ20040842 [pii]']",,,,PMC1134700,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients were selected for I-FISH follow-up compared to CC. All samples were also classified into 4 groups according to the percentage of residual Ph chromosome-positive metaphases analyzed in CC. I-FISH was performed using the LSI bcr/abl dual ES color probe (Vysis). RESULTS: A high correlation was observed between the frequency of Ph chromosome-positive cells, assessed by CC and I-FISH (p<0.001). A high correlation was found between CC and I-FISH for 12 patients, but not for the remaining 7. Applying the same classification for I-FISH did not show a good relationship between the two techniques (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Dual color I-FISH is a reliable method to monitor the size of the Ph chromosome-positive clone in bone marrow of treated CML patients.

It has been shown to selectively kill cancer cells in vitro and retard the growth of implanted fibrosarcoma tumors in rats. In the present research, we investigated its mechanism of cytotoxicity to cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Molt-4 cells, in complete RPMI-1640 medium, were first incubated with 12 microM of human holotransferrin at 37 degrees C in a humid atmosphere of 5% CO2 for one hour. This enhanced the iron supply to the cells. The cells were then pelleted and transferred to a complete RPMI-1640 containing 200 microM of an analog dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and incubation was started (0 h). In addition, some culture samples were treated with holotransferrin alone and some (controls) were assayed without neither holotransferrin nor DHA treatment. Cells were counted and DNA diffusion assay was used to evaluate apoptosis and necrosis in each sample at 0 h and at 1, 2, 4 and 8 h of incubation. RESULTS: DHA treatment significantly decreased cell counts and increased the proportion of apoptosis in cancer cells compared to controls (chi2=4.5, df=1, p<0.035). Addition of holotransferrin significantly further decreased cell counts (chi2=4.5, df=1, p<0.035) and increased apoptosis (chi2=4.5, df=1, p<0.035). No necrotic cells were observed.

Alemtuzumab (CAMPATH-1H; anti-CD52) is currently approved for the treatment of patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The authors investigated the possibility that CD52 may be shed from cells and, once soluble, may bind to injected alemtuzumab, forming immune complexes. METHODS: The authors used Western blot analysis, immunoprecipitation, and enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay to investigate the presence of soluble CD52 (sCD52) in the plasma specimens of 117 patients with CLL. They also used in vitro mixing experiments to examine the ability of sCD52 to compete with cells and sequester therapeutic alemtuzumab. RESULTS: The authors detected high levels of sCD52 in the plasma specimens of patients with CLL. sCD52 can compete with cells in vitro for binding to alemtuzumab, and can form complexes in patients receiving alemtuzumab. Plasma levels of sCD52 were found to be correlated (r)with Rai stage (P = 0.0001), beta-2-microglobulin (beta-2M) levels (P = 0.00002), soluble CD23 levels (r = 0.42, P < 0.001), and immunoglobulin mutation status (P = 0.003). In the multivariate analysis adjusted for beta-2M level, patients with sCD52 levels > 2336 nM/L had a nearly 4-fold increase in risk of death. Higher levels of plasma alemtuzumab were achieved when levels of sCD52 were lower. CONCLUSIONS: These data not only demonstrated that sCD52 was detectable and useful in the staging and monitoring of patients with CLL, but also showed that sCD52 formed immune complexes with alemtuzumab and may influence the efficacy and toxicity of alemtuzumab therapy.","['Albitar, Maher', 'Do, Kim-Anh', 'Johnson, Marcella M', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Jilani, Iman', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Keating, Michael']","['Albitar M', 'Do KA', 'Johnson MM', 'Giles FJ', 'Jilani I', ""O'Brien S"", 'Cortes J', 'Thomas D', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Kipps TJ', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Keating M']","['Department of Hematopathology, Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA 92690-6130, USA. maher.x.albitar@questdiagnostics.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*therapeutic use', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, CD/*blood/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*blood/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/*blood/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', '*Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Prognosis', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/metabolism']",2004/08/27 05:00,2004/09/29 05:00,['2004/08/27 05:00'],"['2004/08/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/29 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/27 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2004 Sep 1;101(5):999-1008. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20477.,['10.1002/cncr.20477 [doi]'],,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['Copyright 2004 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, the authors sought to assess the value of FLT3/ITD mutation status as a prognostic genetic marker for patients with MDS. METHODS: FLT3/ITD mutation status was evaluated by performing DNA polymerase chain reaction assays on 198 bone marrow samples obtained from patients with MDS at initial diagnosis. All aberrant products were sequenced, and GeneScan analysis was performed to measure FLT3/ITD mutant levels. RESULTS: Five patients (2.5%)--2 of the 99 patients who had refractory anemia with excess blasts and 3 of the 51 patients who had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia--had FLT3/ITD mutations. FLT3/ITD was not observed in any of the 48 patients who had refractory anemia (with or without ringed sideroblasts). There was no significant difference in clinicohematologic characteristics, cytogenetic characteristics, or International Prognostic Scoring System score between the FLT3/ITD-positive group and the FLT3/ITD-negative group. Four of the 5 patients carrying the FLT3/ITD mutation experienced progression of disease to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), compared with 70 of the 193 patients who did not have FLT3/ITD (P = 0.066). In addition, progression to AML was more rapid in patients with FLT3/ITD-positive disease than in patients with FLT3/ITD-negative disease (mean +/- standard error, 3.0 +/- 0.5 months vs. 62.8 +/- 5.6 months; P < 0.0001). Patients with FLT3/ITD-positive disease also had significantly shorter survival compared with patients who had FLT3/ITD-negative disease (mean +/- standard error, 5.2 +/- 1.4 months vs. 33.7 +/- 3.1 months; P < 0.0001). On multivariate analysis, FLT3/ITD was identified as an independent predictor of reduced time to development of AML (P = 0.0001) and reduced overall survival (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrate that FLT3/ITD is associated with a high risk of transformation to AML, rapid progression of AML, and poor survival in patients with MDS.","['Shih, Lee-Yung', 'Lin, Tung-Liang', 'Wang, Po-Nan', 'Wu, Jin-Hou', 'Dunn, Po', 'Kuo, Ming-Chung', 'Huang, Chein-Fuang']","['Shih LY', 'Lin TL', 'Wang PN', 'Wu JH', 'Dunn P', 'Kuo MC', 'Huang CF']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. sly7012@adm.cgmh.org.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2004/08/27 05:00,2004/09/29 05:00,['2004/08/27 05:00'],"['2004/08/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/29 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/27 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2004 Sep 1;101(5):989-98. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20440.,['10.1002/cncr.20440 [doi]'],,,,,,['Copyright 2004 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: WT1 transcript levels and colony growth in bone marrow (BM) samples from 23 patients with CML that was later identified as being responsive to imatinib and from 13 patients with CML that was later identified as not being responsive to imatinib were evaluated after incubation of these samples with imatinib at a concentration of 1 microM for 18 hours. In addition, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) analysis of WT1 expression was performed during follow-up, and the results were analyzed for associations with cytogenetic response and with BCR/ABL transcript levels as determined using RQ-PCR analysis. RESULTS: Before treatment, it was found that WT1 expression was elevated in BM samples obtained from all patients with CML. WT1 expression and colony growth were reduced significantly after an 18-hour incubation with imatinib in samples obtained from patients who were later identified as responders to treatment, but not in samples obtained from patients who did not experience responses to treatment. Inhibition of WT1 expression in vitro was associated with inhibition of imatinib-induced BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity, a finding that also has been made in studies involving certain Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive and Ph-negative cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of WT1 transcript levels after a short period of in vitro exposure of pretherapy BM samples to imatinib was correlated with inhibition of colony growth and may represent the basis for an easy test that is capable of predicting the sensitivity of CML to treatment with imatinib for individual patients.","['Cilloni, Daniela', 'Messa, Francesca', 'Gottardi, Enrico', 'Fava, Milena', 'Arruga, Francesca', 'Defilippi, Ilaria', 'Carturan, Sonia', 'Messa, Emanuela', 'Morotti, Alessandro', 'Giugliano, Emilia', 'Rege-Cambrin, Giovanna', 'Alberti, Daniele', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Saglio, Giuseppe']","['Cilloni D', 'Messa F', 'Gottardi E', 'Fava M', 'Arruga F', 'Defilippi I', 'Carturan S', 'Messa E', 'Morotti A', 'Giugliano E', 'Rege-Cambrin G', 'Alberti D', 'Baccarani M', 'Saglio G']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Italy. daniela.cilloni@unito.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection', 'WT1 Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism']",2004/08/27 05:00,2004/09/29 05:00,['2004/08/27 05:00'],"['2004/08/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/29 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/27 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2004 Sep 1;101(5):979-88. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20457.,['10.1002/cncr.20457 [doi]'],,,,,,['Copyright 2004 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ovarian ablation could be accomplished either via radiotherapy (RT) (20 Gray [Gy]/10 fractions to a modified pelvic volume), surgical oophorectomy, or goserelin/leuprolide injections as per patient/physician choice. In the current study, we report the efficacy of pelvic RT with this dose-fractionation scheme in the induction of ovarian ablation. METHODS: Twenty-two of 174 patients (13%) who were randomized to treatment with tamoxifen and ovarian ablation received RT for ovarian ablation. RT quality assurance was performed. Of the 22 patients, 19 were treated per protocol, 1 patient had a minor violation (20 elapsed days for 10 RT fractions), and 2 patients had major violations (1 patient who was treated with RT as per protocol but who was treated at a non-Intergroup center, and 1 patient who was treated at a dose of 15 Gy/5 fractions). RESULTS: No acute Grade 3 or 4 (according to the Common Toxicity Criteria of the National Cancer Institute) toxicities were reported during RT. Of the 22 patients receiving RT, evaluable follow-up data were available for 20 patients. Based on postmenopausal levels of estradiol or follicle-stimulating hormone at varying intervals after the completion of RT, 15 of 20 patients (75%) achieved successful ovarian ablation with RT. At a median follow-up of 54 months (range, 21-66 months), no Grade 3 or 4 complications from RT were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Ovarian ablation by RT as performed in the current trial (given at a dose of 20 Gy in 10 fractions to a modified pelvic treatment volume) was found to be effective for ovarian ablation in the majority of patients, but may take some months to be complete. Consequently, patients should be evaluated to ascertain that ablation has been accomplished.","['Hughes, Lorie L', 'Gray, Robert J', 'Solin, Lawrence J', 'Robert, Nicholas J', 'Martino, Silvana', 'Tripathy, Debu', 'Ingle, James N', 'Wood, William C']","['Hughes LL', 'Gray RJ', 'Solin LJ', 'Robert NJ', 'Martino S', 'Tripathy D', 'Ingle JN', 'Wood WC']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, WellStar Kennestone Hospital, Marietta, GA 30060, USA.

On the basis of doxorubicin's demonstrated clinical efficacy against hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma (HRPCA), the authors conducted a prospective, randomized Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the feasibility, toxicity, and therapeutic efficacy associated with the pegylated form of this agent. METHODS: Forty-eight patients with symptomatic HRPCA were randomized to receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin at either 25 mg/m2 every 2 weeks for 12 cycles (Group A) or 50 mg/m2 every 4 weeks for 6 cycles (Group B). Thirty-eight of these 48 patients (79%) presented with severe pain (corresponding to a pain score of 7.5 on a visual analog scale [VAS] ranging from 0 to 10) due to osseous metastases. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed by serial evaluation of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentrations and by serial measurement of pain levels (using a VAS ranging from 0 to 10). Toxicity data were obtained using the National Cancer Institute of Canada/Cancer and Leukemia Group B criteria and the 30-item European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire. RESULTS: The median patient age was 68.9 years (range, 58-79 years), and the mean follow-up duration was 42 months. The mean pretreatment PSA level was 660.4 ng/mL (mean, 8-6340 ng/mL); an objective decrease in PSA levels (i.e., a decrease of > 50%) was observed in 8 of 31 patients (25.8%) in Group B, whereas no other patient in either group experienced such a decrease. The mean time to disease progression was 6.5 months, and the mean survival duration was 13.4 months. Patients in Group B had a significantly higher rate of response with respect to pain (52.6% vs. 28.6%; P = 0.04), and the mean 1-year survival rate also was significantly higher in Group B (42% vs. 15%; P = 0.02). Severe side effects were observed, with 24 patients (50%) experiencing World Health Organization Grade 3/4 toxicity. Toxicity types differed significantly between Group A and Group B; palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia developed in 60% of patients in the former group (P < 0.0005), whereas tachycardia was more common in the latter group (39% of patients; P < 0.0005). No dose-limiting cardiotoxicities or hematotoxicities were documented. CONCLUSIONS: Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin yielded a noteworthy objective palliative response rate and a mean survival of 13 months for patients with symptomatic HRPCA.

Fludarabine, the most widely used purine analog, exhibits a particularly high level of activity against small lymphocytic lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Numerous studies have investigated the efficacy of fludarabine as a single agent or in combination with other cytostatic compounds in the treatment of FL and MCL. Hematologic toxicity is the most commonly observed adverse event in patients treated with fludarabine, but serious infectious complications are relatively rare. Fludarabine monotherapy has proven to be particularly effective in the treatment of FL; however, complete responses (CRs) are observed in only approximately 20-40% of all cases. In contrast, combinations containing fludarabine and anthracyclines or alkylating agents have yielded superior response rates and longer periods of progression-free survival (PFS), and the addition of the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab appears to yield even better results. In a randomized trial, an immunochemotherapy regimen consisting of a fludarabine-containing combination and rituximab resulted in superior remission and survival rates compared with the fludarabine-containing combination alone. In summary, fludarabine has proven to be a safe and effective agent in the treatment of indolent lymphoma. In particular, combinations containing fludarabine, anthracyclines and/or alkylating agents, and rituximab have yielded remarkable CR and PFS rates.

Paired samples obtained from patients with AML at both stages of diagnosis and first relapse were analyzed. Twenty-four patients with relapsed AML survived for 6 to 81 months (median 24 months) from diagnosis. In one patient, no point mutation of the p51 gene was detected, but loss of the p51 gene expression was observed at both stages. Point mutations of the p53 gene were positive at both stages (+/+) in two patients and negative at diagnosis and positive at relapse (-/+) in two patients. Tandem duplication of the FLT3 gene was detected in five patients at both stages (+/+). N-ras gene mutations at both stages (+/+) were detected in three patients. Mutant p53 at relapse was associated with short survival in patients with relapsed AML (P<0.014). Our findings show that p53 mutations were, at least in part, associated with the mechanism of relapse in AML, while new p51, FLT3 and N-ras gene alterations did not occur at relapse.

In aggressive disease, the CLL cells usually express an unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region gene (IgV(H)) and the 70-kD zeta-associated protein (ZAP-70), whereas in indolent disease, the CLL cells usually express mutated IgV(H) but lack expression of ZAP-70. METHODS: We evaluated the CLL B cells from 307 patients with CLL for ZAP-70 and mutations in the rearranged IgV(H) gene. We then investigated the association between the results and the time from diagnosis to initial therapy. RESULTS: We found that ZAP-70 was expressed above a defined threshold level in 117 of the 164 patients with an unmutated IgV(H) gene (71 percent), but in only 24 of the 143 patients with a mutated IgV(H) gene (17 percent, P<0.001). Among the patients with ZAP-70-positive CLL cells, the median time from diagnosis to initial therapy in those who had an unmutated IgV(H) gene (2.8 years) was not significantly different from the median time in those who had a mutated IgV(H) gene (4.2 years, P=0.07). However, the median time from diagnosis to initial treatment in each of these groups was significantly shorter than the time in patients with ZAP-70-negative CLL cells who had either mutated or unmutated IgV(H) genes (P<0.001). The median time from diagnosis to initial therapy among patients who did not have ZAP-70 was 11.0 years in those with a mutated IgV(H) gene and 7.1 years in those with an unmutated IgV(H) gene (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although the presence of an unmutated IgV(H) gene is strongly associated with the expression of ZAP-70, ZAP-70 is a stronger predictor of the need for treatment in B-cell CLL.","['Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Huynh, Lang', 'Toy, Tracy L', 'Chen, Liguang', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Gribben, John G', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Flinn, Ian W', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Byrd, John C', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Greaves, Andrew', 'Weiss, Arthur', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Rassenti LZ', 'Huynh L', 'Toy TL', 'Chen L', 'Keating MJ', 'Gribben JG', 'Neuberg DS', 'Flinn IW', 'Rai KR', 'Byrd JC', 'Kay NE', 'Greaves A', 'Weiss A', 'Kipps TJ']","['Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research Consortium, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Disease Progression', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/*metabolism/therapy', '*Mutation', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase']",2004/08/27 05:00,2004/09/01 05:00,['2004/08/27 05:00'],"['2004/08/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/27 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2004 Aug 26;351(9):893-901. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa040857.,"['10.1056/NEJMoa040857 [doi]', '351/9/893 [pii]']",,['P01-CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['Copyright 2004 Massachusetts Medical Society'],,,['N Engl J Med. 2004 Aug 26;351(9):856-7.

The FTI tipifarnib (ZARNESTRA, R115777) has recently demonstrated clinical responses in adults with refractory and relapsed acute leukemias. This study was conducted to identify genetic markers and pathways that are regulated by tipifarnib in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Tipifarnib-mediated gene expression changes in 3 AML cell lines and bone marrow samples from two patients with AML were analyzed on a cDNA microarray containing approximately 7000 human genes. Pathways associated with these expression changes were identified using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool. RESULTS: The expression analysis identified a common set of genes that were regulated by tipifarnib in three leukemic cell lines and in leukemic blast cells isolated from two patients who had been treated with tipifarnib. Association of modulated genes with biological functional groups identified several pathways affected by tipifarnib including cell signaling, cytoskeletal organization, immunity, and apoptosis. Gene expression changes were verified in a subset of genes using real time RT-PCR. Additionally, regulation of apoptotic genes was found to correlate with increased Annexin V staining in the THP-1 cell line but not in the HL-60 cell line. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic networks derived from these studies illuminate some of the biological pathways affected by FTI treatment while providing a proof of principle for identifying candidate genes that might be used as surrogate biomarkers of drug activity.","['Raponi, Mitch', 'Belly, Robert T', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Lancet, Jeffrey E', 'Atkins, David', 'Wang, Yixin']","['Raponi M', 'Belly RT', 'Karp JE', 'Lancet JE', 'Atkins D', 'Wang Y']","['Veridex, LLC, Johnson and Johnson Company, San Diego, CA 9212, USA. mraponi1@vrxus.jnj.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Quinolones)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'MAT637500A (tipifarnib)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Farnesyltranstransferase', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Quinolones/*pharmacology']",2004/08/27 05:00,2005/04/06 09:00,['2004/08/27 05:00'],"['2004/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/27 05:00 [entrez]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2004 Aug 25;4:56. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-4-56.,"['10.1186/1471-2407-4-56 [doi]', '1471-2407-4-56 [pii]']",20040825,,,PMC516036,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematological investigations confirmed a diagn of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with no demonstrable CNS involvement. Genetic analysis using microsatellite markers and specimens obtained by laser capture microdissection of the CNS tumor and normal brain tissue, showed that both the glial and epithelial components of the brain tumor had identical losses of 2/2 informative markers on chromosome 17p13 and 5/5 informative markers on chromosome 10q22-26. The glial and epithelial components also shared an identical 2 base pair deletion in the TP53 gene at codon 209, exon 6, introducing a stop codon at codon 214. No losses at any of the above loci and no TP53 mutation were detected in the leukemic cells.

Defining phenotypic differences is a first step in understanding associated differences in function. Additionally, a better understanding of T cell heterogeneity may aid in clinical diagnoses. MATERIAL/METHODS: To further elucidate phenotypic differences of T cell subsets, and begin to determine what information relative antigen density contributes to immunology, we analyzed normal human peripheral blood T cells for a variety of immunophenotypic (CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD45RA, CD45RO, TCR alpha beta) and light scatter characteristics using 6 color flow cytometry. T-cell leukemia specimens were also analyzed. RESULTS: Our data show that statistically significant immunophenotypic differences exist between subsets of human CD4 and CD8 T cells. Normal T cells express different levels of relative antigen density for some antigens compared to malignant T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences are seen in relative antigen density for several cell surface markers between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Neither donor source nor flow cytometric calibration account for these differences. The data are applied to specimens from patients with T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia to show how antigen density can be used clinically in aiding to diagnose disease.

These death-responsive cells show prolonged TNF stimulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, but no NF-kappaB transcriptional activity as a consequence of receptor-interacting protein degradation by caspases. Conversely, cells of a proliferative phenotype display antiapoptotic NF-kappaB responses that antagonize c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase stress kinase effects. These proliferative effects of TNF are apparently due to enhanced basal expression of the caspase-8/FLICE-inhibitory protein FLIP. Manipulation of the NF-kappaB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signals switches leukemia cells from a proliferative to an apoptotic phenotype; consequently, these highly proliferative cells die rapidly. In addition, sodium salicylate mimics the death phenotype signals and causes selective destruction of leukemia cells. These findings reveal the signaling mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of human leukemia cell life/death switching. Additionally, through knowledge of the signals that control TNF life/death switching, we have identified several therapeutic targets for selectively killing these cells.","['Tucker, Steven J', 'Rae, Colin', 'Littlejohn, Alison F', 'Paul, Andrew', 'MacEwan, David J']","['Tucker SJ', 'Rae C', 'Littlejohn AF', 'Paul A', 'MacEwan DJ']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Salicylates)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/*physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/physiology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Salicylates/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/physiology']",2004/08/26 05:00,2004/11/17 09:00,['2004/08/26 05:00'],"['2004/08/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/26 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Aug 31;101(35):12940-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0400949101.

Here we demonstrate a previously undescribed role for phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) in regulation of murine ES cell self-renewal. Treatment with the reversible PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, or more specific inhibition of class I(A) PI3K via regulated expression of dominant negative Deltap85, led to a reduction in the ability of LIF to maintain self-renewal, with cells concomitantly adopting a differentiated morphology. Inhibition of PI3Ks reduced basal and LIF-stimulated phosphorylation of PKB/Akt, GSK3alpha/beta, and S6 proteins. Importantly, LY294002 and Deltap85 expression had no effect on LIF-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr(705), but did augment LIF-induced phosphorylation of ERKs in both short and long term incubations. Subsequently, we demonstrate that inhibition of MAP-Erk kinases (MEKs) reverses the effects of PI3K inhibition on self-renewal in a time- and dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the elevated ERK activity observed upon PI3K inhibition contributes to the functional response we observe. Surprisingly, upon long term inhibition of PI3Ks we observed a reduction in phosphorylation of beta-catenin, the target of GSK-3 action in the canonical Wnt pathway, although no consistent alterations in cytosolic levels of beta-catenin were observed, indicating this pathway is not playing a major role downstream of PI3Ks. Our studies support a role for PI3Ks in regulation of self-renewal and increase our understanding of the molecular signaling components involved in regulation of stem cell fate.","['Paling, Nicholas R D', 'Wheadon, Helen', 'Bone, Heather K', 'Welham, Melanie J']","['Paling NR', 'Wheadon H', 'Bone HK', 'Welham MJ']","['Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath BA2 7AY, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', '*Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'beta Catenin']",2004/08/26 05:00,2005/01/22 09:00,['2004/08/26 05:00'],"['2004/08/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/26 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Nov 12;279(46):48063-70. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M406467200.

The cellular mechanisms involved in this phenomenon have been studied for several years, and some factors have been identified. Various strategies to overcome resistance have been suggested, but none has yet shown efficacy in vivo. We developed a gemcitabine-resistant cell line (L1210 10K) from the murine leukemic L1210 strain (L1210 wt) by continuous exposure to increasing concentrations of gemcitabine. L1210 10K is highly resistant to gemcitabine (14,833-fold), 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C; 2,100-fold), troxacitabine (>200-fold), and cladribine (160-fold) and slightly resistant to trimidox (7.22-fold), but does not display cross-resistance to fludarabine or nonnucleoside anticancer drugs. Deoxycytidine kinase mRNA was not detected by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR in L1210 10K cells, whereas expression of thymidine kinase 1 and ribonucleotide reductase subunit R2 gene was moderately reduced. L1210 10K cells also demonstrated in vivo resistance to nucleoside analogues: gemcitabine- or ara-C-treated mice carrying L1210 10K had significantly shorter survival than gemcitabine- or ara-C-treated mice carrying L1210 wt (P < 0.05). UA911, a mononucleotide prodrug (pronucleotide) of ara-C was found to significantly sensitize L1210 10K cells in vitro. These results suggest that reduced deoxycytidine kinase expression is a mechanism of resistance to gemcitabine that is relevant in vivo and can be circumvented by a prodrug approach.","['Jordheim, Lars Petter', 'Cros, Emeline', 'Gouy, Marie-Helene', 'Galmarini, Carlos M', 'Peyrottes, Suzanne', 'Mackey, John', 'Perigaud, Christian', 'Dumontet, Charles']","['Jordheim LP', 'Cros E', 'Gouy MH', 'Galmarini CM', 'Peyrottes S', 'Mackey J', 'Perigaud C', 'Dumontet C']","['INSERM U590, Laboratoire de Cytologie Analytique, Faculte de Medecine Rockefeller, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon I, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Primers', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors']",2004/08/26 05:00,2005/02/18 09:00,['2004/08/26 05:00'],"['2004/08/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/26 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Aug 15;10(16):5614-21. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0506.,"['10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0506 [doi]', '10/16/5614 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we extend our adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma study to other subtypes of T- and NK-cell lymphoma, to clarify whether a characteristic chemokine receptor expression pattern is obtained for each of the subtypes defined by the WHO classification. CXCR3 and CCR4 were rarely expressed in three well-defined subtypes, precursor T-lymphoblastic lymphoma, anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. A CXCR3-dominant expression pattern was observed in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, while a CCR4-dominant expression pattern was observed in mycosis fungoides in transformation and in anaplastic lymphoma kinase-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma. CXCR3 and CCR4 were heterogeneously expressed in peripheral T-cell lymphomas, unspecified (PTCLU). We next focused on PTCLU and analyzed the clinical significance of the chemokine receptors and their association with FoxP3, a hallmark of immunoregulatory T (Treg) cells. Multivariate analysis showed that CCR4 expression was an independent and significant unfavorable prognostic factor (P < 0.001). A significant correlation was found between mRNA expression of CCR4 and FoxP3, suggesting a possible association of CCR4-positive tumors with Treg cells and thereby with an immunocompromised state. Chemokine receptors may be useful not only for further characterization of the T- and NK-cell lymphomas but also in predicting clinical outcomes for patients. We suggest that a specific therapy targeting the CCR4 molecule may be developed as an alternative treatment for patients with CCR4-positive tumors.","['Ishida, Takashi', 'Inagaki, Hiroshi', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Takatsuka, Yoshifusa', 'Komatsu, Hirokazu', 'Iida, Shinsuke', 'Takeuchi, Genji', 'Eimoto, Tadaaki', 'Nakamura, Shigeo', 'Ueda, Ryuzo']","['Ishida T', 'Inagaki H', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Takatsuka Y', 'Komatsu H', 'Iida S', 'Takeuchi G', 'Eimoto T', 'Nakamura S', 'Ueda R']","['Department of Internal Medicine & Molecular Science, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (CCR3 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR3 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Receptors, CCR3)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR3)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Receptors, CCR3', 'Receptors, CXCR3', 'Receptors, Chemokine/analysis/*genetics']",2004/08/26 05:00,2005/02/18 09:00,['2004/08/26 05:00'],"['2004/08/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/26 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Aug 15;10(16):5494-500. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0371.,"['10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0371 [doi]', '10/16/5494 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They often arise prenatally as early events or initiating events and are complemented by secondary postnatal genetic events of which deletion of the non-rearranged, second TEL allele is the most common. This consistent sequence of molecular pathogenesis facilitates an analysis of the clonal origins of relapse in this leukemia, which has some unusual clinical features. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We compared the boundaries, by microsatellite mapping, of TEL deletions at relapse versus diagnosis in 15 informative patients. Moreover, we compared the relatedness of diagnostic and relapse clones using immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes rearrangements and clonotypic TEL-AML1 genomic fusion. RESULTS: Five patients retained the apparent same size TEL deletion, seven had larger deletions, and three had smaller deletions at relapse. In all of the cases evaluated, the clonal relatedness of diagnostic and relapse cells was confirmed by the retention of clonotypic TEL-AML1 genomic sequence and/or at least one identical immunoreceptor gene rearrangement. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide further evidence that TEL deletions are secondary to TEL-AML1 fusions in ALL. They are compatible with the novel idea that in at least some cases of childhood ALL, remission occurs with persistence of a preleukemic ""fetal"" clone, and subsequent relapse reflects the emergence of a new subclone from this reservoir after an independent ""second hit,"" i.e., independent TEL deletion. To our knowledge, the study is the most extensive and comprehensive analysis of the relationship between diagnostic and relapse clones in childhood ALL presented thus far.","['Zuna, Jan', 'Ford, Anthony M', 'Peham, Martina', 'Patel, Naina', 'Saha, Vaskar', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'Kochling, Joachim', 'Panzer-Grumayer, Renate', 'Trka, Jan', 'Greaves, Mel']","['Zuna J', 'Ford AM', 'Peham M', 'Patel N', 'Saha V', 'Eckert C', 'Kochling J', 'Panzer-Grumayer R', 'Trka J', 'Greaves M']","['Leukemia Research Fund Centre for Cell and Molecular Biology, Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom. jan.zuna@lfmotol.cuni.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Child', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Recurrence', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2004/08/26 05:00,2005/02/18 09:00,['2004/08/26 05:00'],"['2004/08/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/26 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Aug 15;10(16):5355-60. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0584.,"['10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0584 [doi]', '10/16/5355 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polyethylene glycol-conjugated asparaginase (PEG-ASNase) has significant pharmacological advantages over native Escherichia coli asparaginase. We investigated the pharmacokinetics of PEG-ASNase, presence of antibodies to PEG-ASNase, and concentrations of asparagine in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in combination chemotherapy for relapsed pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty-eight pediatric patients with relapsed medullary (n = 16) and extramedullary (n = 11) acute lymphoblastic leukemia were enrolled at three pediatric institutions and had at least two serum and CSF samples obtained for analysis. Patients received induction therapy (including PEG-ASNase 2500 IU/m2 intramuscularly weekly on days 2, 9, 16, and 23) and intensification therapy (including PEG-ASNase 2500 IU/m2 intramuscularly once on day 7). Serum samples were obtained weekly during induction and intensification. CSF samples were obtained during therapeutic lumbar punctures during induction and intensification. RESULTS: Weekly PEG-ASNase therapy resulted in PEG-ASNase activity of >0.1 IU/ml in 91-100% of patients throughout induction. During intensification, PEG-ASNase on day 7 resulted in PEG-ASNase activity >0.1 IU/ml in 94% and 80% of patients on days 14 and 21, respectively. Serum and CSF asparagine depletion was observed and maintained during induction and intensification in the majority of samples. PEG-ASNase antibody was observed in only 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive PEG-ASNase therapy in the treatment of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia reliably results in high-level serum PEG-ASNase activity, and asparagine depletion in serum and CSF is usually achieved.

At the same time, it provides a straightforward and statistically stringent way to determine the significance level for each gene and allows for the flexible control of the false-detection rate and familywise error rate in the multiple testing situation of a microarray experiment. We use the RP technique on three biological data sets and show that in each case it performs more reliably and consistently than the non-parametric t-test variant implemented in Tusher et al.'s significance analysis of microarrays (SAM). We also show that the RP results are reliable in highly noisy data. An analysis of the physiological function of the identified genes indicates that the RP approach is powerful for identifying biologically relevant expression changes. In addition, using RP can lead to a sharp reduction in the number of replicate experiments needed to obtain reproducible results.","['Breitling, Rainer', 'Armengaud, Patrick', 'Amtmann, Anna', 'Herzyk, Pawel']","['Breitling R', 'Armengaud P', 'Amtmann A', 'Herzyk P']","['Plant Science Group, Institute of Biomedical and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, UK. r.breitling@bio.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Lipoproteins, HDL)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Arabidopsis/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Genes/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lipoproteins, HDL/deficiency', 'Mice', 'Models, Animal', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Potassium/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research Design']",2004/08/26 05:00,2004/10/09 09:00,['2004/08/26 05:00'],"['2004/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2004/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2004/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/26 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2004 Aug 27;573(1-3):83-92. doi: 10.1016/j.febslet.2004.07.055.,"['10.1016/j.febslet.2004.07.055 [doi]', 'S0014579304009354 [pii]']",,['P17237/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,['FEBS Lett. 2010 Mar 5;584(5):941-4.

METHODS: The utility of the BLV LTR/promoter (BLVp) for use in mammalian expression vectors was investigated through direct comparison to the CMV promoter (CMVp). Promoter activity was measured using luciferase assays of cell lines from different tissues and species stably transduced with BLVp or CMVp driven luciferase vectors including D17, FLK, BL3.1 and primary bovine B cells. Cells were also modified through the addition of BLV Tax expression vectors and/or BLV infection as well as treatment with trichostatin A (TSA). RESULTS: Results indicate the BLV promoter, while having low basal activity compared to the CMV promoter, can be induced to high-levels of activity similar to the CMV promoter in all cells tested. Tax or BLV infection specifically enhanced BLVp activity with no effect on CMVp activity. In contrast, the non-specific activator, TSA, enhanced both BLVp and CMVp activity. CONCLUSION: Based on these data, we conclude the BLV promoter could be very useful for transgene expression in mammalian expression vectors.","['Harms, Jerome S', 'Eakle, Kurt A', 'Kuo, Lillian S', 'Bremel, Robert D', 'Splitter, Gary A']","['Harms JS', 'Eakle KA', 'Kuo LS', 'Bremel RD', 'Splitter GA']","['Department of Animal Health and Biomedical Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53706-1581, USA. harms@svm.vetmed.wisc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Genet Vaccines Ther,Genetic vaccines and therapy,101178414,,,,2004/08/26 05:00,2004/08/26 05:01,['2004/08/26 05:00'],"['2004/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/26 05:01 [medline]', '2004/08/26 05:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Genet Vaccines Ther. 2004 Aug 24;2(1):11. doi: 10.1186/1479-0556-2-11.,"['10.1186/1479-0556-2-11 [doi]', '1479-0556-2-11 [pii]']",20040824,['R44 CA088752/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC516020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this purpose, we carried out molecular analysis of the SOCS-1 gene in human acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and human haematopoietic cell lines. Sequencing alterations in the coding region were found in two of 90 primary AML samples and one of 17 cell lines. Hypermethylation of the SOCS-1 gene was also observed in 72% of primary cases and 52% of cell lines and aberrant methylation strongly correlated with reduced expression. Transfection of SOCS-1 into Jurkat cells harbouring the mutation and methylation suppressed cell growth at a low serum concentration. These findings indicate that SOCS-1 is frequently silenced in haematopoietic malignancies, mainly as a result of hypermethylation, and suggest that SOCS-1 may be able to function as a tumour suppressor.","['Watanabe, Dai', 'Ezoe, Sachiko', 'Fujimoto, Minoru', 'Kimura, Akihiro', 'Saito, Yoshiyuki', 'Nagai, Hisaki', 'Tachibana, Isao', 'Matsumura, Itaru', 'Tanaka, Toshio', 'Kanegane, Hirokazu', 'Miyawaki, Toshio', 'Emi, Mitsuru', 'Kanakura, Yuzuru', 'Kawase, Ichiro', 'Naka, Tetsuji', 'Kishimoto, Tadamitsu']","['Watanabe D', 'Ezoe S', 'Fujimoto M', 'Kimura A', 'Saito Y', 'Nagai H', 'Tachibana I', 'Matsumura I', 'Tanaka T', 'Kanegane H', 'Miyawaki T', 'Emi M', 'Kanakura Y', 'Kawase I', 'Naka T', 'Kishimoto T']","['Laboratory of Immune Regulation, Osaka University Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences, 1-3 Yamada-oka, Suita City, Osaka 565-0871, Japan. dai@imed3.med.osaka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Silencing', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins']",2004/08/26 05:00,2004/11/02 09:00,['2004/08/26 05:00'],"['2004/08/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/26 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Sep;126(5):726-35. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05107.x.,"['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05107.x [doi]', 'BJH5107 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,['Br J Haematol. 2004 Dec;127(5):609-11.

In murine models, freshly isolated or ex vivo expanded CD4(+)CD25(high) regulatory T cells (Treg) are able to ameliorate GVHD while maintaining graft-versus-leukaemia reactions. However, in the human setting, prospective studies of this population and its interaction with activated non-regulatory CD134(+) (OX40) lymphocytes during post-transplant follow-up are lacking. In this study, we prospectively quantified CD4(+)CD25(high) and activated CD134(+) lymphocytes in 119 peripheral blood samples from 35 consecutive patients who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Fifty-five samples obtained less than 100 d after allogeneic BMT, were not statistically different regarding CD4(+)CD25(high) Treg or CD134(+) lymphocytes compared with those obtained from patients with (n = 35) or without (n = 20) acute GVHD. Chronic GVHD was associated with a small, but not statistically significant, increase in the number of Treg (9.9 vs. 6.7 x 10(6)/L). However, the CD134/CD25(high) ratio was significantly higher during chronic GVHD (cGHVD) when compared with either patients without cGVHD (67.7 +/- 40.3 vs. 4.0 +/- 0.9, P < 0.01) or cGVHD after treatment (67.7 +/- 40.3 vs. 3.7 +/- 0.8, P < 0.01). Our findings suggest that the suppressive activity of CD4(+)CD25(high) Treg could be abrogated in vivo during cGVHD by CD134 expression in a much higher number of activated donor T lymphocytes. In addition to CD4(+)CD25(high)ex vivo expansion protocols, OX40 blocking might be crucial to optimize the use of Treg to prevent GVHD.","['Sanchez, Joaquin', 'Casano, Javier', 'Alvarez, Miguel A', 'Roman-Gomez, Jose', 'Martin, Carmen', 'Martinez, Francisco', 'Gomez, Pedro', 'Serrano, Josefina', 'Herrera, Concepcion', 'Torres, Antonio']","['Sanchez J', 'Casano J', 'Alvarez MA', 'Roman-Gomez J', 'Martin C', 'Martinez F', 'Gomez P', 'Serrano J', 'Herrera C', 'Torres A']","['Haematology Department and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University Hospital Reina Sofia, 14004 Cordoba, Spain. joaquin.sanchez@cheerful.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, OX40)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNFRSF4 protein, human)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*immunology', 'Receptors, OX40', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*immunology', 'Regression Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation Immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2004/08/26 05:00,2004/11/02 09:00,['2004/08/26 05:00'],"['2004/08/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/26 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Sep;126(5):697-703. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05108.x.,"['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05108.x [doi]', 'BJH5108 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, it seems important to evaluate Akt phosphorylation in AML blasts. This work aimed to establish whether it was possible to detect Akt phosphorylation on Ser 473 of AML blasts by means of flow cytometry. High levels of Akt activity and phosphorylation were detected in 13 of 15 cases of AML. Flow cytometric analysis revealed similar patterns of Ser 473 expression as was observed with Akt kinase activity and Western blot analysis of Thr 308 and Ser 473 phosphorylation. Double immunostaining enabled the simultaneous flow cytometric detection of an AML-associated antigen (CD33) and Ser 473 phosphorylated Akt in leukaemic blast populations.

PRV-1 and NB1 are alleles of the polymorphic gene CD177, which belongs to the Ly-6/uPAR superfamily, and their coding regions differ at only four nucleotides. We studied neutrophil CD177 mRNA levels in normal subjects and in 235 patients with Ph-negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMD), including PV, essential thrombocythaemia and myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia. Additional disease states were investigated for comparison. Highly variable neutrophil CD177 mRNA levels were observed in normal individuals. Neutrophils isolated from the bone marrow, or from peripheral blood following granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration showed markedly higher CD177 expression than circulating granulocytes on steady state. Increased neutrophil CD177 mRNA levels were detected in all CMD. Elevated values were also found in reactive conditions and in disorders such as chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. In the differential diagnosis between PV and secondary erythrocytosis, the assay sensitivity was 68% while its specificity was 60%.

We have previously reported that processive DNA synthesis of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MMLV RT) is severely compromised by substitution of an Ala for the fingers domain residue Arg 116. In order to further investigate the role of Arg 116 in interactions of MMLV RT with nucleic acids, we have determined the crystal structure of the R116A N-terminal fragment and characterized the binding of two self-complementary DNA duplexes [d(CATGCATG)2 and d(CGCGCGCG)2] to both the wild-type and R116A fragments by isothermal titration calorimetry. The resultant thermodynamic profiles extrapolated to 25 degrees C reveal that binding of the wild-type N-terminal fragment to both DNA duplexes is enthalpy-driven and characterized by an unfavorable entropy. Although the temperature dependence of the respective protein-DNA binding enthalpies is markedly different reflecting distinct heat capacity changes, the binding free energies are nearly identical and relatively invariant to temperature (DeltaG approximately -6.0 kcal x mol(-1)). In contrast to the wild-type fragment, the R116A fragment exhibits no measurable affinity for either DNA duplex, yet its crystal structure reveals no significant changes when compared to the wild-type structures. We suggest that hydrogen-bonding interactions involving the fingers domain residue Arg 116 are critical for DNA binding as well as processive DNA synthesis by MMLV RT.","['Crowther, Robert L', 'Remeta, David P', 'Minetti, Conceicao A S A', 'Das, Debanu', 'Montano, Sherwin P', 'Georgiadis, Millie M']","['Crowther RL', 'Remeta DP', 'Minetti CA', 'Das D', 'Montano SP', 'Georgiadis MM']","['Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proteins,Proteins,8700181,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Binding Sites', 'Calorimetry', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Crystallography', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Models, Molecular', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'Mutation', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Thermodynamics']",2004/08/25 05:00,2005/01/27 09:00,['2004/08/25 05:00'],"['2004/08/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proteins. 2004 Oct 1;57(1):15-26. doi: 10.1002/prot.20224.,['10.1002/prot.20224 [doi]'],,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism by which TNFalpha acts at the cellular level is not totally understood. Although apoptotic cell killing appears to be the most common cellular effect of TNFalpha, other studies suggest that this cytokine may elicit other cellular responses such as prolonged growth inhibition. In this context, we have investigated whether TNFalpha may induce senescence in hematopoietic cells, which display intrinsic defect in the apoptotic machinery. The present study described that, in the leukemic KG1 cells, TNFalpha induced no apoptosis but a senescence state characterized by prolonged growth arrest, increased beta-galactosidase activity, p21WAF-1 induction, decreased telomerase activity, telomeric disturbances (shortening, losses, fusions), and additional chromosomal aberrations. Telomerase inhibition correlated with reduced levels of hTERT transcripts. GM-CSF prevented TNFalpha effects and allowed leukemic cells to recover growth capacity. Finally, our study shows for the first time that, at least in some hematopoietic cells, TNFalpha may induce senescence with important functional consequences, including sustained growth inhibition and genetic instability, and that this cellular response is efficiently regulated by hematopoietic growth factors.","['Beyne-Rauzy, Odile', 'Recher, Christian', 'Dastugue, Nicole', 'Demur, Cecile', 'Pottier, Geraldine', 'Laurent, Guy', 'Sabatier, Laure', 'Mansat-De Mas, Veronique']","['Beyne-Rauzy O', 'Recher C', 'Dastugue N', 'Demur C', 'Pottier G', 'Laurent G', 'Sabatier L', 'Mansat-De Mas V']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U563, Centre de Physiopathologie de Toulouse Purpan, Place du Docteur Baylac, 31059, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cellular Senescence', '*Chromosomal Instability', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Telomerase/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*physiology']",2004/08/25 05:00,2004/11/04 09:00,['2004/08/25 05:00'],"['2004/08/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Sep 30;23(45):7507-16. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208024.,"['10.1038/sj.onc.1208024 [doi]', '1208024 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conversely, in these cells, TRAIL-induced cell death is magnified by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment, independently of telomerase activity on telomeres. Of note, this response is subordinated neither to maturation nor to telomere shortening.

The myeloid transcription factor CEBPA is crucial for normal granulopoiesis. Here, we found that conditional expression of AME suppresses CEBPA protein by 90.8% and DNA-binding activity by 93.9%. In contrast, CEBPA mRNA levels remained unchanged. In addition, we detected no differences in CEBPA mRNA levels in leukemic blasts of patients carrying the AME translocation (n = 8) compared to acute myeloid leukemia patients with a normal karyotype (n = 9). CEBPA protein and binding activity, however, were reduced significantly (100% and 92.1%, respectively) in AME patient samples. Furthermore, we observed that calreticulin (CRT), a putative inhibitor of CEBPA translation, was strongly activated after induction of AME in the cell-line system (14.8-fold) and in AME patient samples (12.2-fold). Moreover, inhibition of CRT by small interfering RNA powerfully restored CEBPA levels. These results identify CEBPA as a key target of the leukemic fusion protein AME and suggest that modulation of CEBPA by CRT may represent a mechanism involved in the differentiation block in AME leukemias.","['Helbling, Daniel', 'Mueller, Beatrice U', 'Timchenko, Nikolai A', 'Hagemeijer, Anne', 'Jotterand, Martine', 'Meyer-Monard, Sandrine', 'Lister, Andrew', 'Rowley, Janet D', 'Huegli, Barbara', 'Fey, Martin F', 'Pabst, Thomas']","['Helbling D', 'Mueller BU', 'Timchenko NA', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Jotterand M', 'Meyer-Monard S', 'Lister A', 'Rowley JD', 'Huegli B', 'Fey MF', 'Pabst T']","['Institute of Medical Oncology, University Hospital, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (AML1-MDS1-EVI1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/genetics/*physiology', 'Calreticulin/*physiology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'U937 Cells']",2004/08/25 05:00,2004/10/01 05:00,['2004/08/25 05:00'],"['2004/08/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Sep 7;101(36):13312-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0404731101.

We hypothesized that OPN alters expression of its CD44 receptor to promote neoplastic cell migration. METHODS: RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with OPN (0-10 nM) for 0-12 hours to determine the time- and concentration-dependence of CD44 protein and mRNA expression. In selected instances, a competitive ligand for the alphavbeta3-integrin, GRGDSP (50 nM), or an inhibitor of protein synthesis, anisomycin (10 microg/ml), was added. Cell adhesion to hyaluronan was assayed with the crystal violet assay. RESULTS: OPN upregulates plasma membrane total CD44 protein in a concentration-(ANOVA P = 0.001) and time-dependent (ANOVA P = 0.001) fashion. CD44v6 is not altered. Cell adhesion to hyaluronate increases in parallel with CD44 expression. Steady state mRNA levels for CD44 are not altered by OPN. 5 nM OPN increases CD44 protein half-life from 105 +/- 11 minutes to 278 +/- 15 minutes. (P < 0.03) Blockade of either alphavbeta3-integrin ablates the OPN-dependent increase in CD44. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that OPN increases plasma membrane CD44 expression and cell adhesion by binding to its alphavbeta3-integrin receptor. We conclude that OPN may promote tumor metastatic behavior by CD44 expression.","['Marroquin, Carlos E', 'Downey, Laura', 'Guo, Hongtao', 'Kuo, Paul C']","['Marroquin CE', 'Downey L', 'Guo H', 'Kuo PC']","['Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, 110 Bell Bldg., Box 3522, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Spp1 protein, mouse)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)', '6C74YM2NGI (Anisomycin)', '91037-75-1 (glycyl-arginyl-glycyl-aspartyl-seryl-proline)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anisomycin/pharmacology', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Osteopontin', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Sialoglycoproteins/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2004/08/25 05:00,2005/02/12 09:00,['2004/08/25 05:00'],"['2004/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2004/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/12 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 2004 Aug 15;95(1):109-12. doi: 10.1016/j.imlet.2004.06.001.,"['10.1016/j.imlet.2004.06.001 [doi]', 'S0165247804001476 [pii]']",,"['AI44629/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM65113/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rituximab targets the CD20 antigen and demonstrates varied single-agent activity that is highly dependent upon the dosing schedule and treatment status of the patient. More importantly, when rituximab is combined with fludarabine or fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, a high frequency of CR and prolonged progression-free survival are observed without an appreciable increase in significant toxicity. Alemtuzumab targets the more ubiquitously expressed CD52 antigen and is therefore associated with a higher frequency of toxicity, particularly immunosuppression, but has appreciable activity in fludarabine refractory CLL. Additionally, alemtuzumab is effective against CLL clones that have p53 mutations or deletions.

V-gene usage, VDJ structure, and gene expression differences in the two subgroups allow insights into differential pathogenic mechanisms and provide further prognostic information (V3-21 usage, ZAP-70 expression).

A live-attenuated varicella vaccine is recommended for routine childhood immunisation in some countries. In healthy children, the vaccine is efficacious and safe but because immunocompromised individuals may be unable to limit replication of live-attenuated vaccine viruses, the varicella vaccine is not recommended for them and there are few exceptions. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this paper is to review the published studies addressing the use of the varicella vaccine in people with cell-mediated immunodeficiency disorders. METHODS: A computerised search on the PubMed database was used to collect the relevant papers published up to March 2003. RESULTS: The varicella vaccine has been extensively studied in susceptible children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in remission, but studies involving individuals with other immunodeficiency disorders are scarce. Some of the current recommendations are based on very few and small studies with short follow-up. Immunocompromised individuals should be given the varicella vaccine only with complete knowledge of their clinical and immunological conditions and after considering the risks of natural infection and vaccination.","['Sartori, Ana Marli Christovam']",['Sartori AM'],"['Clinic of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases, Hospital das Clinicas, University of Sao Paulo School of Medicine, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil. amsartori@sti.com.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Canada,Int J Infect Dis,International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,9610933,['0 (Chickenpox Vaccine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Chickenpox/*prevention & control', '*Chickenpox Vaccine/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Herpes Zoster/*prevention & control', 'Herpesvirus 3, Human/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant']",2004/08/25 05:00,2004/10/29 09:00,['2004/08/25 05:00'],"['2003/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2003/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Infect Dis. 2004 Sep;8(5):259-70. doi: 10.1016/j.ijid.2003.09.006.,"['10.1016/j.ijid.2003.09.006 [doi]', 'S1201971204000566 [pii]']",,,113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TEL/AML1 consists of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) dimerization domain from TEL and almost the entire of AML1, but loses the ETS DNA-binding domain from TEL. Dominant-negative effects of TEL/AML1 over wild-type-AML1 are believed to trigger the development of this type of leukemia. However, it could also be possible that TEL/AML1 affects wild-type-TEL's molecular and tumor suppressive functions through the HLH domain. To test this possibility, we first confirmed that TEL/AML1 associates with wild-type-TEL. TEL/AML1 neither bound to the ETS-binding consensus site nor repressed transcription through it. Regardless, this prevented wild-type-TEL-induced transcriptional repression. Moreover, TEL/AML1 concomitantly inhibited wild-type-TEL-induced growth suppression and wild-type-AML1-mediated transforming activity in NIH3T3 cells. All these data indicate that TEL/AML1 exerts dominant-interfering effects on both AML1 and TEL, and that expression of TEL/AML1 could result in inactivation of TEL's tumor suppressive functions in t(12;21)-carrying leukemia.","['Gunji, Hisako', 'Waga, Kazuo', 'Nakamura, Fumihiko', 'Maki, Kazuhiro', 'Sasaki, Ko', 'Nakamura, Yuichi', 'Mitani, Kinuko']","['Gunji H', 'Waga K', 'Nakamura F', 'Maki K', 'Sasaki K', 'Nakamura Y', 'Mitani K']","['Department of Hematology, Dokkyo University School of Medicine, Tochigi 321-0293, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Epistasis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2004/08/25 05:00,2004/10/28 09:00,['2004/08/25 05:00'],"['2004/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2004 Sep 17;322(2):623-30. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.07.169.,"['10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.07.169 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(04)01684-5 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of a set of miRNAs is known to be regulated developmentally and spatially, and is involved in differentiation or cell proliferation in several organisms. However, the expression profiles of human miRNAs during cell differentiation remain largely unknown. In an effort to expand our knowledge of human miRNAs, we investigated miRNAs during 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced differentiation of human leukemia cells (HL-60) into monocyte/macrophage-like cells. Several hundred RNAs ranging from 18 to 26 nucleotides were isolated from HL-60 cells with or without TPA-induction, and subsequently characterized by sequencing, database searching, and expression profiling. By removing non-miRNA sequences, we found three novel and 38 known miRNAs expressed in HL-60 cells. These miRNAs could be further classified into subsets of miRNAs that responded differently following TPA induction, either being up-regulated or down-regulated, suggesting the importance of regulated gene expression via miRNAs in the differentiation of HL-60 cells.","['Kasashima, Katsumi', 'Nakamura, Yoshikazu', 'Kozu, Tomoko']","['Kasashima K', 'Nakamura Y', 'Kozu T']","['Research Institute for Clinical Oncology, Saitama Cancer Center, Ina, Saitama 362-0806, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics/physiology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2004/08/25 05:00,2004/10/28 09:00,['2004/08/25 05:00'],"['2004/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2004 Sep 17;322(2):403-10. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.07.130.,"['10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.07.130 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(04)01642-0 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using death rates of a nearby community as reference rates, the standardized mortality ratio from all cancers between 1987 and 1999 was slightly increased for both males (1.2, 95% confidence interval 1.1-1.4) and females (1.1, 95% confidence interval 1.0-1.3). This was mainly due to a higher mortality from stomach, liver, lung, prostate and bladder cancer in males and from stomach, pancreas, breast and ovarian cancer and lymphocytic leukemia in females. We also noted excess mortality from melanoma in both males and females. Overall, our findings were consistent with an association between trihalomethane exposure and increased cancer risk at some sites. However, the point estimates were statistically imprecise, due to the limited number of deaths for some site-specific cancers.

This progression is frequently preceded or accompanied by recurring secondary chromosomal abnormalities (SCA) that are believed to play a role in the transformation and may also serve as valuable prognostic indicators. Failure to note such abnormalities may lead to an inappropriate clinical evaluation. We observed CML patients with AP or BP who did not show SCA by routine cytogenetic analysis. To determine the presence or absence of specific SCA in those cases, we applied fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to four CML cases with pseudodiploid cytogenetics [t(9;22)(q34;11.2) as the sole abnormality] by conventional karyotyping. Bone marrow biopsies from two AP and two BP of CML patients with pseudodiploid karyotypes by conventional cytogenetics were examined by FISH for trisomy 8 and i(17q).

Conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA) showed a normal karyotype in 45 cases and an abnormal karyotype in 56 cases; in the remaining cases, CCA either failed to yield sufficient metaphase cells (19/26) or was not done (7/26). Abnormal CGH profiles were identified in 39 patients (30.7%). DNA copy number losses (61%) were high compared to gains (39%), whereas partial chromosome changes (76%) were more common than whole chromosomes changes (24%). Recurrent losses were detected on chromosomes 7, 5q (comprising bands 5q15 to 5q33), 7q (7q32 approximately q36), 16q (16q13 approximately q21), and 17p, and gains were detected on chromosomes 8, 22, and 3q (comprising bands 3q26.1 approximately q27). Furthermore, distinct amplifications were identified in chromosome regions 21q, 13q12 approximately q13, and 13q21.1. No cryptic recurrent chromosomal imbalances were identified by CGH in cases with normal karyotypes. The concordance between CGH results and CCA was 72.5%. In the remaining cases, CGH gave additional information compared to CCA (20%) and partially failed to identify the alterations previously detected by CCA (7.5%). The majority of discrepancies arose from the limitations of the CGH technique, such as insensitivity to detect unbalanced chromosomal changes when occurring in a low proportion of cells. CGH increased the detection of unbalanced chromosomal alterations and allowed precise defining of partial or uncharacterized cytogenetical abnormalities. Application of the CGH technique is thus a useful complementary diagnostic tool for CCA in de novo AML cases with abnormal karyotypes or with unsuccessful cytogenetics.","['Casas, Silvia', 'Aventin, Anna', 'Fuentes, Francisca', 'Vallespi, Teresa', 'Granada, Isabel', 'Carrio, Anna', 'Angel Martinez-Climent, Jose', 'Sole, Francesc', 'Teixido, Montserrat', 'Bernues, Marta', 'Duarte, Jose', 'Maria Hernandez, Jesus', 'Brunet, Salut', 'Dolors Coll, Maria', 'Sierra, Jorge']","['Casas S', 'Aventin A', 'Fuentes F', 'Vallespi T', 'Granada I', 'Carrio A', 'Angel Martinez-Climent J', 'Sole F', 'Teixido M', 'Bernues M', 'Duarte J', 'Maria Hernandez J', 'Brunet S', 'Dolors Coll M', 'Sierra J']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Sant Pau-Autonomous University of Barcelona, Avda.

Lack of consensus among hypotheses of osteoglossomorph relationships advanced during the past 30 years may be due in part to the difficulty of identifying shared derived characters among the morphologically differentiated extant families of this group. In this study, we present a novel phylogenetic hypothesis for this group, based on the analysis of more than 4000 characters from five molecular markers (the mitochondrial cytochrome b, 12S and 16S rRNA genes, and the nuclear genes RAG2 and MLL). Our taxonomic sampling includes one representative of each extant non-mormyrid osteoglossomorph genus, one representative for the monophyletic family Mormyridae, and four outgroup taxa within the basal Teleostei. Maximum parsimony analysis of combined and equally weighted characters from the five molecular markers and Bayesian analysis provide a single, well-supported, hypothesis of osteoglossomorph interrelationships and show the group to be monophyletic. The tree topology is the following: (Hiodon alosoides, (Pantodon buchholzi, (((Osteoglossum bicirrhosum, Scleropages sp.), (Arapaima gigas, Heterotis niloticus)), ((Gymnarchus niloticus, Ivindomyrus opdenboschi), ((Notopterus notopterus, Chitala ornata), (Xenomystus nigri, Papyrocranus afer)))))). We compare our results with previously published phylogenetic hypotheses based on morpho-anatomical data. Additionally, we explore the consequences of the long terminal branch length for the taxon Pantodon buchholzi in our phylogenetic reconstruction and we use the obtained phylogenetic tree to reconstruct the evolutionary history of electroreception in the Notopteroidei.","['Lavoue, Sebastien', 'Sullivan, John P']","['Lavoue S', 'Sullivan JP']","['Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, W263 Seeley G.

The addition of heptadepsin prior to LPS stimulation decreased HL-60 cell-HUVEC adhesion without showing any cytotoxicity. It also inhibited the cellular adhesion induced by lipid A, the active component of LPS, but it did not inhibit TNF-alpha or IL-1beta-induced cell adhesion. The result of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis revealed that heptadepsin interacted with lipid A directly. Thus, heptadepsin, a novel naturally occurring cyclic heptadepsipeptide, was shown to inactivate LPS by direct interaction with LPS.","['Ohno, Osamu', 'Ikeda, Yoko', 'Sawa, Ryuichi', 'Igarashi, Masayuki', 'Kinoshita, Naoko', 'Suzuki, Yoshikazu', 'Miyake, Kensuke', 'Umezawa, Kazuo']","['Ohno O', 'Ikeda Y', 'Sawa R', 'Igarashi M', 'Kinoshita N', 'Suzuki Y', 'Miyake K', 'Umezawa K']","['Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Technology, Keio University, 3-14-1 Hiyoshi, Kohoku-ku, Yokohama 223-0061, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Chem Biol,Chemistry & biology,9500160,"['0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Tlr4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '0 (heptadepsin, Paenibacillus)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Depsipeptides/chemistry/*isolation & purification/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4']",2004/08/25 05:00,2005/02/16 09:00,['2004/08/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/01 00:00 [revised]', '2004/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chem Biol. 2004 Aug;11(8):1059-70. doi: 10.1016/j.chembiol.2004.05.016.,"['10.1016/j.chembiol.2004.05.016 [doi]', 'S1074552104001851 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Culture tests were negative in both cases. In both patients no hypereosinophilia was found. CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous presence of the two pathologies in these patients can only give rise to hypothesis. In the first case it could be attributed to interleukin (IL)-5, which causes both eosinophilic hyperproduction and blast differentiation. In the second case the hypersecretion of intercellular adhesion molecule type 1 (ICAM-1) in Ofuji's disease could be attributed to a modified transcriptional gene belonging to the class of immunoglobulin codifying genes located on the altered chromosomes in a certain percentage of leukaemic patients.","['Patrizi, A', 'Chieregato, C', 'Visani, G', 'Morrone, P', 'Patrone, P']","['Patrizi A', 'Chieregato C', 'Visani G', 'Morrone P', 'Patrone P']","['Clinic of Dermatology, University of Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,9216037,,IM,"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Folliculitis/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Forehead', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2004/08/25 05:00,2005/01/08 09:00,['2004/08/25 05:00'],"['2004/08/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol. 2004 Sep;18(5):596-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1468-3083.2004.00982.x.,"['10.1111/j.1468-3083.2004.00982.x [doi]', 'JDV982 [pii]']",,,,,,['Copyright 2004 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: All patients had advanced disease, receiving 2-CdA as a second or third line chemotherapy. Skin lesions were severe and chemotherapy had to be discontinued. Histological examination of skin biopsies showed an eosinophil-rich infiltrate with flame figures, similar to what is observed in Wells' syndrome (eosinophilic cellulitis). Corticosteroids were effective to control the eruptions. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous adverse reactions associated with 2-CdA have seldom been observed in the treatment of HCL. However, as this purine analogue has been used in more advanced cases these may be more frequent and severe. The pathophysiology of these lesions is unclear, but it is probably related to drug-induced change in T-cell imbalance in severely immunosuppressed patients.","['Rossini, M S', 'de Souza, E M', 'Cintra, M L', 'Pagnano, K B', 'Chiari, A C', 'Lorand-Metze, I']","['Rossini MS', 'de Souza EM', 'Cintra ML', 'Pagnano KB', 'Chiari AC', 'Lorand-Metze I']","['Hematology-Hemotherapy Center, State University of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,9216037,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Drug Eruptions/*diagnosis/etiology/pathology', 'Exanthema/chemically induced/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged']",2004/08/25 05:00,2005/01/08 09:00,['2004/08/25 05:00'],"['2004/08/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol. 2004 Sep;18(5):538-42. doi: 10.1111/j.1468-3083.2004.00969.x.,"['10.1111/j.1468-3083.2004.00969.x [doi]', 'JDV969 [pii]']",,,,,,['Copyright 2004 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of CML increases with age; median age at diagnosis is 67 years. Long-term data on the economic burden associated with CML among the elderly are sparse. To fill this void, our study uses population-based data to evaluate longer-term treatment patterns, outcomes and costs among elderly Medicare beneficiaries following their diagnosis of CML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort analysis used linked data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute and Medicare claims. Study cohorts included 567 patients aged > or = 65 years newly diagnosed with CML between 1991 and 1993 in a SEER registry and followed for 5 years or until death, whichever occurred first. In addition, 567 control patients without CML matched 1 : 1 by age and sex (average age 78 years, 52% male) were included. The costs of care were based on total Medicare payments (in constant 1998 dollars). Groups were generally similar in terms of nonmatched variables. RESULTS: Five years following diagnosis, 13% of CML patients were still alive versus 68% of the control patients (median survival: 14 months vs > 60 months, respectively). The average total Medicare payments were USD35,785 for CML patients versus USD21,161 for control subjects (monthly payments: USD1688 vs USD428, respectively; p < 0.001). Approximately 25% of CML patients underwent Medicare-covered cancer treatment (11% outpatient chemotherapy, 6% inpatient chemotherapy and 8% outpatient interferon-alpha therapy). Younger patients and those diagnosed in the later years were most likely to be treated. Costs for treated patients were higher, and they lived longer. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest low treatment rates, and substantial excess mortality and costs associated with CML among the elderly. The recent introduction of imatinib has dramatically changed the treatment of CML, which is likely to cause important changes to the economic burden of CML. Our results can be used as a baseline for evaluating the impact of such new therapies as data from clinical trials become available. Further work is needed to characterise this disease and the complex factors that influence treatment decisions and associated health outcomes in elderly patients.","['Menzin, Joseph', 'Lang, Kathleen', 'Earle, Craig C', 'Glendenning, Alastair']","['Menzin J', 'Lang K', 'Earle CC', 'Glendenning A']","['Boston Health Economics, Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts, USA. jmenzin@bhei.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",New Zealand,Drugs Aging,Drugs & aging,9102074,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Utilization', 'Female', '*Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*economics/*therapy', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/08/25 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/08/25 05:00'],"['2004/08/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drugs Aging. 2004;21(11):737-46. doi: 10.2165/00002512-200421110-00004.,"['21114 [pii]', '10.2165/00002512-200421110-00004 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chimeric receptors composed of the single-chain variable domain of murine antibodies and human signaling molecules are a promising tool to redirect the specificity of autologous or allogeneic immune cells. The success of this approach depends on the identification of target molecules expressed preferentially on cancer cells. Moreover, appropriate primary and secondary stimuli must be delivered to generate vigorous and durable immune responses. Since cancer cells often lack ligands for key co-stimulatory molecules, the addition of molecules such as CD28 or 4-1BB to the chimeric receptors can significantly improve their function. Studies in vitro and in animal models indicate that immune cells expressing chimeric receptors can have remarkable anti-cancer activity, while experimental and clinical data indicate that long-term persistence of adoptively transferred cells is feasible. Therefore, testing of this approach in clinical trials is warranted. We here review the principles and methodologies for designing chimeric receptors and delivering them into immune cells, as well as some of the potential complications associated with this form of cell therapy.","['Imai, C', 'Campana, D']","['Imai C', 'Campana D']","['Departments of Hematology-Oncology, University of Tennessee College of Medicine, Memphis, TN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Italy,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,8809253,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TNFRSF9 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD19/biosynthesis', 'CD28 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Ligands', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/chemistry', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/chemistry', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9']",2004/08/25 05:00,2005/01/14 09:00,['2004/08/25 05:00'],"['2004/08/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/14 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents. 2004 Jan-Mar;18(1):62-71.,,,"['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA58297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",109,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lineage of origin is not known, and a plasmacytoid dendritic cell derivation has been proposed. CD4/CD56 HN generally is diagnosed by using tumor skin biopsy, with the most important differential diagnosis being myelomonocytic leukemia cutis. We evaluated the expression of 2 plasmacytoid dendritic cell antigens, T-cell leukemia 1 (TCL1) and cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA), in 29 cases of CD4/CD56 HN and 18 cases of myelomonocytic leukemia cutis. TCL1 and CLA were expressed in 26 (90%) of 29 CD4/CD56 HN cases vs TCL1 expression in 3 (17%) and CLA expression in 14 (78%) of 18 leukemia cutis cases. Furthermore, CLA antiserum displays a peculiar small-dot staining pattern in CD4/CD56 HN. These results suggest that TCL1 and CLA are good markers for CD4/CD56 HN tumor cells and add support for a plasmacytoid dendritic cell origin. The high skin tropism of CD4/CD56 HN might be related to the skin-homing property of CLA.","['Petrella, Tony', 'Meijer, Chris J L M', 'Dalac, Sophie', 'Willemze, Rein', 'Maynadie, Marc', 'Machet, Laurent', 'Casasnovas, Olivier', 'Vergier, Beatrice', 'Teitell, Michael A']","['Petrella T', 'Meijer CJ', 'Dalac S', 'Willemze R', 'Maynadie M', 'Machet L', 'Casasnovas O', 'Vergier B', 'Teitell MA']","['Centre de Pathologie, Department of Pathology, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire du Bocage, Dijon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (CTAGE1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'CD4 Antigens/immunology/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'CD56 Antigen/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Lineage/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Killer Cells, Natural/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*diagnosis/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis/metabolism']",2004/08/25 05:00,2004/09/24 05:00,['2004/08/25 05:00'],"['2004/08/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2004 Aug;122(2):307-13. doi: 10.1309/0QPP-AVTU-PCV9-UCLV.,['10.1309/0QPP-AVTU-PCV9-UCLV [doi]'],,"['R01CA107300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA90571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resolution of conventional cytogenetics (CC) in detecting 11q23 rearrangement is limited when the translocative partner has a telomeric location; furthermore, CC can barely discriminate between true 11q23+/MLL+ and rearrangements clustering within the 11q22 to approximately 25 region without MLL involvement (MLL-). We characterized a series of 378 consecutive patients with adult acute leukemia by using CC, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and multiplex karyotyping (M-FISH) analysis. Our aim was to define the frequency of cryptic MLL+ cases and the frequency of MLL+ within 11q22 to approximately 25+ cases. As expected, FISH was more sensitive than CC in detecting MLL+ cases, but rather unexpectedly, 9 (45%) of 20 patients with 11q22 to approximately 25+ were MLL-. A better characterization of 11q22 to approximately 25+/MLL- leukemias is relevant for the identification of new, recurrent translocations.

Recent evidence indicates that T-bet also is expressed in B lymphocytes and might participate in immunoglobulin class switching. We examined T-bet expression in 116 cases of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders by immunostaining and found that T-bet was expressed consistently in precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma (14/14 cases) in contrast with precursor T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma, which is consistently T-bet- (13 cases), as previously reported. T-bet is expressed in memory B cell-derived neoplasms (chronic lymphocytic leukemia, marginal zone lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia; 35/42 cases) but not in cases of mantle cell, follicular, and large cell lymphoma (43 cases). Expression of T-bet in precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma was confirmed by Western blot analysis. The expression of T-bet in a significant subset of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders but not in the vast majority of reactive B cells suggests it might have a role in the oncogenesis of T-bet+ B-cell neoplasms.

Its efficacy and toxicity are concentration-dependent and are related to the fractions of different arsenic species and the degree of methylation. In this study, arsenic trioxide was given parenterally to rabbits as a single dose or as a daily dose (0.2, 0.6, and 1.5 mg/kg) for 30 days. The blood and organ concentrations of the arsenic species, including As(III), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), and monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), were studied on day 1 (single-dose study), day 30 (multiple dosing study), and day 60 (reversibility study). As(III) was the major detectable arsenic species in the blood. The pharmacokinetic parameters (total clearance, area under the curve, etc.) for As(III) indicated a limit for the capacity to eliminate As(III) at the dose of 1.5 mg/kg, and were quite the same after a single dose or chronic multiple dosing. In tissues, DMA was found to be the major metabolite and the concentrations of DMA, As(III), and MMA in general increased with the dose, with the increase most significant at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg. However, normalized tissue distribution of As(III) in the kidney on day 1, but not on day 30, was nonlinear. Along with decreased levels of As(III) and increased levels of DMA, an inducible capacity for methylating As(III) to DMA after chronic dosing in kidney was suggested. The tissue concentration of DMA was highest in lung and liver, and the normalized tissue distributions in liver on day 30 were nonlinear, suggesting a limit in eliminating DMA after a chronic high load of As(III). Tissue concentrations of As(III), DMA, and MMA in bladder increased dramatically after chronic dosing. However, after washout for 30 days, As(III), DMA, and MMA were all undetectable in bladder and liver. However, As(III) in hair and low levels of DMA in lung, kidney, heart and hair were still detected. In conclusion, in rabbits we found a similar pharmacological profile after a single dose or chronic multiple dosing of parenteral arsenic trioxide, with a limiting metabolizing capacity at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg. Tissue accumulation of arsenic species, mainly DMA, and its reversibility after washout were tissue-selective. The potential for late toxicities of arsenic trioxide in organs with a significant tendency for arsenic accumulation with low reversibility should be closely monitored.","['Lin, Chun-Jung', 'Wu, Mei-Hwan', 'Hsueh, Yu-Mei', 'Sun, Selma Siu-Man', 'Cheng, Ann-Lii']","['Lin CJ', 'Wu MH', 'Hsueh YM', 'Sun SS', 'Cheng AL']","['Graduate Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and School of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Oxides)', 'AJ2HL7EU8K (Cacodylic Acid)', 'J37VJ5709S (monomethylarsonic acid)', 'N5509X556J (arsenite)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Arsenites/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cacodylic Acid/*pharmacokinetics', 'Oxides/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Rabbits', 'Tissue Distribution']",2004/08/24 05:00,2005/02/03 09:00,['2004/08/24 05:00'],"['2004/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/24 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2005 Feb;55(2):170-8. doi: 10.1007/s00280-004-0872-4.

Molecular analysis did not detect any EVI1/CDK6 chimeric transcript generated by t(3;7)(q26;q21), but did indicate overexpression of EVI1, which occurs frequently in progression to myeloid BC in CML. Three cases of myeloid/NK cell precursor BC in CML have been reported, but this case is the first to present with Ph and EVI1 abnormality.

The acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients were either refractory to standard induction regimens (8), were in first or second relapse (13), or received therapy as first-line treatment [21 patients, 16 were above 60 years of age and 5 had post-myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) AML]. The acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients were treated for relapsed (7) or refractory disease (10). Three patients had chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the blastic phase. FLAD was well tolerated by most patients. Ten major infectious complications were recorded while no signs of cardiac toxicity were observed. Five patients (8%) died before day 28 with hypocellular marrow, mainly of infection or hemorrhage, and response could not be evaluated. Complete response rate was 62% and 69% among AML patients treated at diagnosis or for relapsed disease, respectively, and 59% among the ALL patients. Furthermore, FLAD managed to overcome the negative impact of poor prognosis karyotype in ALL patients, since five of the seven patients with t(9;22) or complex karyotype achieved complete remission (CR). Nine patients underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Among the AML patients who were treated at diagnosis or for relapse, the median duration of CR was 7 months (range: 2-18) and 8 months (range: 2-26), respectively. Median survival among these patients was 8 (range: 1-40) and 12 (range: 1-30) months, respectively. Similar values were found in ALL patients.

Risks of relapse were lower in patients who relapsed after 6 months from first transplantation and in complete remission prior to second transplantation. Risks of relapse were higher after reduced-intensity conditioning regimens.

Assessment of intracellular cytokine levels identified T cells that produce interferon-gamma in response to the HY peptide during the presence of HY tetramer-positive T cells.

The study shows that the device can detect frequent (AF4, AF6, AF10, ELL or ENL) as well as rare partner genes (AF17, MSF). The identified fusion transcripts can then be used as molecular phenotypic markers of disease for the precise evaluation of minimal residual disease by RQ-PCR.

Some of the largest variations are geographical and are attributable to environmental factors, whereas variation mainly on ethnic lines seems likely to be a marker of genetic predisposition. A wide range of familial and genetic syndromes is associated with an increased risk of childhood cancer. Virtually all the excess risk of cancer among first-degree relatives of children with cancer can be accounted for by known hereditary syndromes. Studies of weak predisposition and gene-environment interaction have so far shown limited consistency. There are very few established environmental or exogenous risk factors and most of these are infective agents.

Studies have demonstrated that exposure to moderate-to-high levels can cause most forms of cancer, leukaemia and cancers of the breast, lung and thyroid being particularly sensitive to induction by radiation, especially at young ages at exposure. Predominant among these studies is the Life Span Study of the cohort of survivors of the atomic bombings of Japan in 1945, but substantial evidence is derived from groups exposed for medical reasons, occupationally or environmentally. Notable among these other groups are underground hard rock miners who inhaled radioactive radon gas and its decay products, large numbers of patients irradiated therapeutically and workers who received high doses in the nuclear weapons programme of the former USSR. The degree of carcinogenic risk arising from low levels of exposure is more contentious, but the available evidence points to an increased risk that is approximately proportional to the dose received. Epidemiological investigations of nonionizing radiation have established ultraviolet radiation as a cause of skin cancer. However, the evidence for a carcinogenic effect of other forms of nonionizing radiation, such as those associated with mobile telephones or electricity transmission lines, is not convincing, although the possibility of a link between childhood leukaemia and extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields cannot be dismissed entirely.","['Wakeford, Richard']",['Wakeford R'],"['BNFL, 1100 Daresbury Park, Daresbury, Warrington WA4 4BG, UK.

In all cases, the neoplasm is a rare response to the relevant infection, which is usually present in persistent form, and requiring specific cofactors for malignancy to develop. In some cases, epidemiological evidence of infectivity preceded and promoted identification of the specific infection involved and even the discovery of the microbe itself, as in Burkitt's lymphoma and cervix cancer. In other cases, the discovery of the agent came first as in stomach and nasopharynx cancers, and epidemiology has been concerned mainly with confirming the relationship, measuring the size of the risk and identifying cofactors. Infection-linked cancers include some of the commonest malignancies in certain large world regions, amounting to over 20% of all cancer in the developing countries. In addition to these cancers are others such as childhood leukaemia that show features indicative of an infective basis though no underlying agent has been identified. Advances in this field invite speculation about possible future discoveries and how these might be promoted. However, in that majority of cancers that are unrelated to sexual behaviour, there will be nothing even at the population level to suggest an infective basis because what is transmitted from one individual to another is not the neoplasm itself, but the underlying, often silent, infection to which the malignancy is an uncommon response. The increasing prevalence of immune impairment in human populations, as a result of the use of immunosuppressive drugs with organ transplants and the spread of HIV infection, has produced marked effects on cancer incidence in the affected groups including increases, of skin cancers, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma and to a lesser extent of many other cancers, in some cases at least due to the release from immunological control of incipient infection-based malignancies.","['Kinlen, Leo']",['Kinlen L'],"['Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Gibson Building, Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford OX2 6HE, UK. leo.kinlen@dphpc.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,IM,"['Humans', '*Immune System Diseases/complications/epidemiology', 'Infections/complications/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*etiology/immunology', 'Risk']",2004/08/24 05:00,2004/09/16 05:00,['2004/08/24 05:00'],"['2004/08/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/24 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Aug 23;23(38):6341-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207898.,"['10.1038/sj.onc.1207898 [doi]', '1207898 [pii]']",,,81,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SCF and H2O2 increase Vmax for glucose transport; this enhancement is due to a higher content in GLUT1 in plasma membranes, possibly through a translocation from intracellular stores. Inhibitors of tyrosine kinases or phospholipase C (PLC) remove glucose transport enhancement and prevent translocation. The inhibitory effect of STI-571 suggests a role for c-kit tyrosine kinase on glucose transport activation not only by SCF, but also by H2O2. On the other hand, neither protein kinase C nor phosphoinositide-3-kinase appear to be involved in the acute activation of glucose transport. Our data suggest that i) in M07e cells, SCF and exogenous H2O2 elicit a short-term activation of glucose transport through a translocation of GLUT1 from intracellular stores to plasma membranes; ii) both stimuli could share at least some signaling pathways leading to glucose uptake activation, involving protein tyrosine kinases and PLC iii) H2O2 could act increasing the level of tyrosine phosphorylation through the inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases and mimicking the regulation role of endogenous ROS.","['Maraldi, Tullia', 'Fiorentini, Diana', 'Prata, Cecilia', 'Landi, Laura', 'Hakim, Gabriele']","['Maraldi T', 'Fiorentini D', 'Prata C', 'Landi L', 'Hakim G']","['Dipartimento di Biochimica G.

In this study, we demonstrate that extracellular DES produces a dose-dependent and reversible inhibition of CRAC currents in RBL cells (IC(50), approximately 0.5 microM), whereas intracellular DES (25 microM) has no effect. Extracellular DES (up to 30 microM) inhibited only CRAC but did not affect a whole-cell monovalent cation current mediated by TRPM7 channels. DES effectively inhibited TG-induced capacitative Ca(2+) influx in a dose-dependent manner with an IC(50) values of approximately 0.1 microM in RBL cells, <0.1 microM in SMC, and approximately 1 microM in human platelets. It is noteworthy that trans-stilbene, a close structural analog of DES that lacks hydroxyl and ethyl groups, had no effect on CRAC current and on store-operated Ca(2+) influx.

To help clarify this role, we investigated the effects of ceramide on IL-2, a central NF-kappaB target. We found that ceramide inhibited protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated activation of NF-kappaB. Ceramide was found to significantly reduce the kinase activity of PKCtheta as well as PKCalpha, the critical PKC isozymes involved in TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation. This was followed by strong inhibition of IL-2 production in both Jurkat T leukemia and primary T cells. Exogenous sphingomyelinase, which generates ceramide at the cell membrane, also inhibited IL-2 production. As expected, the repression of NF-kappaB activation by ceramide led to the reduction of transcription of the IL-2 gene in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of IL-2 production by ceramide was partially overcome when NF-kappaB nuclear translocation was reconstituted with activation of a PKC-independent pathway by TNF-alpha or when PKCtheta was overexpressed. Importantly, neither the conversion of ceramide to complex glycosphingolipids, which are known to have immunosuppressive effects, nor its hydrolysis to sphingosine, a known inhibitor of PKC, was necessary for its inhibitory activity. These results indicate that ceramide plays a negative regulatory role in the activation of NF-kappaB and its targets as a result of inhibition of PKC.","['Abboushi, Nour', 'El-Hed, Aimee', 'El-Assaad, Wissal', 'Kozhaya, Lina', 'El-Sabban, Marwan E', 'Bazarbachi, Ali', 'Badreddine, Rami', 'Bielawska, Alicja', 'Usta, Julnar', 'Dbaibo, Ghassan S']","['Abboushi N', 'El-Hed A', 'El-Assaad W', 'Kozhaya L', 'El-Sabban ME', 'Bazarbachi A', 'Badreddine R', 'Bielawska A', 'Usta J', 'Dbaibo GS']","['Department of Biochemistry, American University of Beirut, Faculty of Medicine, Lebanon.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCQ protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-theta)']",IM,"['Ceramides/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha', 'Protein Kinase C-theta', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', '*Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'fas Receptor']",2004/08/24 05:00,2004/09/24 05:00,['2004/08/24 05:00'],"['2004/08/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/24 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2004 Sep 1;173(5):3193-200. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.173.5.3193.,"['173/5/3193 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.173.5.3193 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because activation of NF-kappaB has been closely linked with inflammatory diseases affected by guggulsterone, we postulated that it must modulate NF-kappaB activation. In the present study, we tested this hypothesis by investigating the effect of this steroid on the activation of NF-kappaB induced by inflammatory agents and carcinogens. Guggulsterone suppressed DNA binding of NF-kappaB induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), phorbol ester, okadaic acid, cigarette smoke condensate, hydrogen peroxide, and interleukin-1. NF-kappaB activation was not cell type-specific, because both epithelial and leukemia cells were inhibited. Guggulsterone also suppressed constitutive NF-kappaB activation expressed in most tumor cells. Through inhibition of IkappaB kinase activation, this steroid blocked IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation, thus suppressing p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene transcription induced by TNF, TNFR1, TRADD, TRAF2, NIK, and IKK was also blocked by guggulsterone but without affecting p65-mediated gene transcription. In addition, guggulsterone decreased the expression of gene products involved in anti-apoptosis (IAP1, xIAP, Bfl-1/A1, Bcl-2, cFLIP, and survivin), proliferation (cyclin D1 and c-Myc), and metastasis (MMP-9, COX-2, and VEGF); this correlated with enhancement of apoptosis induced by TNF and chemotherapeutic agents. Overall, our results indicate that guggulsterone suppresses NF-kappaB and NF-kappaB-regulated gene products, which may explain its anti-inflammatory activities.","['Shishodia, Shishir', 'Aggarwal, Bharat B']","['Shishodia S', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Pregnenediones)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', 'A4PW148END (pregna-4,17-diene-3,16-dione)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/*metabolism', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Models, Chemical', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Okadaic Acid/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Pregnenediones/*pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Temperature', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2004/08/24 05:00,2004/12/29 09:00,['2004/08/24 05:00'],"['2004/08/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/24 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Nov 5;279(45):47148-58. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M408093200.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that the NurRE-signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) composite element of the POMC promoter was the predominant target of the LIF-CRH synergy. Whereas NurRE or STAT sites alone conferred synergy, the maximal response was found with the NurRE-STAT reporter, suggesting that direct DNA binding of both transcription factors is required for an optimal synergy. During LIF-CRH stimulation, Nur77 and activated STAT1-3 were bound to the composite element, and the binding of each factor was abolished by appropriate mutations. CREB was also detected in this complex in a stimulation-dependent and DNA binding-independent manner. Nur77 and STAT1-3 bound to the NurRE-STAT site were each sufficient for CREB recruitment. Recombinant CREB directly interacted with recombinant Nur77 or STAT1-3. Moreover, CREB-Nur77 interaction was increased by CREB phosphorylation at Ser-133 and the dominant-negative mutant CREB-M1 efficiently inhibited the synergistic LIF-CRH response. This synergism was also inhibited after transfection of CREB-small interfering RNA. We conclude that both CREB phosphorylation at Ser-133 and level of CREB expression are crucial in LIF-CRH synergism where CREB, without direct DNA binding, could improve the stability of Nur77 and STAT1-3 binding to POMC promoter and facilitate the recruitment of coactivators.

The cytochrome P450 (P450)-derived catechol and quinone metabolites of etoposide may be important in the damage to the MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) gene and other genes resulting in leukemia-associated chromosomal translocations. Kinetic analysis of catechol formation by recombinant P450s was determined using liquid chromatography/selected reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry. CYP3A4 was found to play a major role in etoposide metabolism (K(m) = 77.7 +/- 27.8 microM; V(max) = 314 +/- 84 pmol of catechol/min/nmol of P450). However, CYP3A5 (K(m) = 13. 9 +/- 3.1 microM; V(max) = 19.4 +/- 0.4 pmol of catechol/min/nmol of P450) may be involved in etoposide metabolism at therapeutic concentrations of free drug. Other P450s do not appear to be involved in etoposide catechol formation. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis revealed significantly increased CYP3A4 mRNA and protein levels in hepatocytes treated with 10 microM rifampicin compared with untreated cells, but only modest effects of rifampicin on CYP3A5 induction. Etoposide (40, 5, 1, and 0.25 microM) caused a slight increase in CYP3A4 mRNA in three of five batches of hepatocytes but did not result in proportionately increased CYP3A4 protein levels.

GILZ (glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper), being one of them, is strongly up-regulated in the thymus. To elucidate its function we generated transgenic mice overexpressing it specifically in the T-cell lineage and characterized its influence on thymus function. In young adult transgenic mice CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocyte number was significantly decreased and ex vivo thymocyte apoptosis was increased. Apoptotic pathway analysis detected reduced antiapoptotic B-cell leukemia XL (Bcl-xL) expression and increased activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3. Time-course experiments showed that in wild-type (WT) thymocytes GILZ up-regulation was followed by sequential Bcl-xL decreased expression and activation of caspase-8 and of caspase-3. Moreover, GILZ delivered inside WT thymocytes by a fusion protein with the transactivator of transcription (TAT) peptide decreased Bcl-xL and promoted their apoptosis. In aged mice perturbation of thymic subset numbers was amplified over time, as demonstrated by a further decrease in CD4(+)CD8(+) cells and increases in CD4(+)CD8(-), CD4(-)CD8(-), and CD8(+)CD4(-) cell counts. These results support the hypothesis that GILZ participates in the regulation of thymocyte apoptosis by glucocorticoids.","['Delfino, Domenico Vittorio', 'Agostini, Massimiliano', 'Spinicelli, Stefania', 'Vito, Pasquale', 'Riccardi, Carlo']","['Delfino DV', 'Agostini M', 'Spinicelli S', 'Vito P', 'Riccardi C']","['Section of Pharmacology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Via del Giochetto, 06122 Perugia, Italy. midelfin@unipg.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Dsip1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TSC22D3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp8 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'CD2 Antigens/genetics', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'DNA Replication', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology', 'Transcription Factors/*immunology']",2004/08/21 05:00,2005/03/25 09:00,['2004/08/21 05:00'],"['2004/08/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/21 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Dec 15;104(13):4134-41. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-03-0920.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized by a translocation, t(15;17), that produces a PML/RARalpha fusion oncoprotein, whose abnormal transcriptional function is successfully targeted by pharmacologic levels of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). Mutations in the ligand-binding domain of PML/RARalpha that confer resistance to ATRA have been studied by expression in nonhematopoietic cells, such as Cos-1. Here, we show that ATRA binding and transcriptional activation by the same PML/RARalpha mutant differ markedly between nonhematopoietic and leukemic cell lines. Differential expression of the corepressor isoform silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptors beta (SMRTbeta) correlates with increased ligand binding and transcription by the mutant PML/RARalpha. Transient and stable overexpression of SMRTbeta in hematopoietic cells that only express SMRTalpha increased ATRA binding, ligand-induced transcription, and ATRA-induced cell differentiation. This effect may not be limited to abnormal nuclear receptors, because overexpression of SMRTbeta increased ATRA-induced binding and transcriptional activation of wild-type receptors PML/RARalpha and RARalpha. Our results suggest a novel role for the SMRTbeta isoform whereby its cell-specific expression may influence the binding and transcriptional capacities of nuclear receptors, thus providing new evidence of distinct functions of corepressor isoforms and adding complexity to transcriptional regulation.","['Cote, Sylvie', 'McNamara, Suzan', 'Brambilla, Daria', 'Bianchini, Andrea', 'Rizzo, Giovanni', 'del Rincon, Sonia Victoria', 'Grignani, Francesco', 'Nervi, Clara', 'Miller, Wilson H Jr']","['Cote S', 'McNamara S', 'Brambilla D', 'Bianchini A', 'Rizzo G', 'del Rincon SV', 'Grignani F', 'Nervi C', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer B.

The growing incidence of antimicrobial resistance is an inevitable consequence of the widespread use of antibiotics in medical settings. The aim of this study was to clarify the trends and antimicrobial resistance among pathogens causing bloodstream infections in febrile neutropenic adults with hematological malignancies. METHODS: The characteristics of pathogens causing bloodstream infection isolated from patients with febrile neutropenia who were treated at National Taiwan University Hospital from 1996 to 2001 were reviewed. A total of 1174 pathogens were isolated from 3093 admissions to a hematological ward during this period. Among them, 738 isolates were recovered from patients with febrile neutropenia. RESULTS: The majority (93%) of these neutropenic febrile patients had underlying acute leukemia or lymphoma. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 57% of isolated pathogens, followed by Gram-positive bacteria (32%), fungi (7%), and anaerobes (3%). In decreasing frequency, Escherichia coli (13%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12%), Enterobacter cloacae (7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (5%) were the predominant Gram-negative bacteria, while coagulase-negative staphylococci (13%), viridans group streptococci (4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (4%) were the major Gram-positive pathogens. Two-thirds (20/30) of S. aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. No vancomycin-resistant enterococci were isolated. Resistance to cefotaxime was found in 63% of E. cloacae, 13% of K. pneumoniae and 10% of E. coli. Overall, 33% of E. coli and 13% of K. pneumoniae were resistant to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the microbiological spectrum of microorganisms causing bloodstream infections in neutropenic febrile patients with hematological malignancies at National Taiwan University Hospital is different from western countries in that Gram-negative bacteria remain the predominant pathogens. Antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens is high and E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates with resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin are increasing.","['Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Hsueh, Po-Ren', 'Yao, Ming', 'Huang, Shang-Yi', 'Chen, Yee-Chun', 'Chen, Yao-Chang', 'Shen, Ming-Ching', 'Wang, Chiu-Hwa', 'Tsai, Woei', 'Chang, Shan-Chwen', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang', 'Luh, Kwen-Tay']","['Chen CY', 'Tang JL', 'Hsueh PR', 'Yao M', 'Huang SY', 'Chen YC', 'Chen YC', 'Shen MC', 'Wang CH', 'Tsai W', 'Chang SC', 'Tien HF', 'Luh KT']","['Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Singapore,J Formos Med Assoc,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,9214933,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bacteremia/*drug therapy/*microbiology', '*Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Fever/*microbiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Taiwan']",2004/08/20 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/08/20 05:00'],"['2004/08/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/20 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Formos Med Assoc. 2004 Jul;103(7):526-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ALL1-AF4 junction was detected by qualitative RT-PCR in 18 patients and by Q-RT-PCR in 17 patients (one patient harboured the rare e10-e6 ALL1-AF4 junction, which falls outside of the primer and probe location designed for the Q-RT-PCR). In three of the 12 patients negative to qualitative RT-PCR after induction therapy, a small number of ALL1-AF4 copies was detected by Q-RT-PCR. Thus nine patients were negative and eight positive. Seven of the eight positive patients suffered a relapse, including two of the three patients positive to Q-RT-PCR yet negative to qualitative RT-PCR. Moreover, we found two (5%) discordant results among the 39 follow-up tests of the nine patients who converted to a negative qualitative-quantitative PCR status.

We found at least one hypermethylated gene in 80.4% of the primary patient samples, while 33.9% harbored two or more hypermethylated genes. For the first time, we show that p73 may be hypermethylated in MM and thus be involved in the pathogenesis of plasma cell disorders. Hypermethylation of p16 at diagnosis was associated with a poorer prognosis. In patients with plasma cell leukemia, we found frequent simultaneous hypermethylation of p16, E-cadherin and DAP kinase. We conclude that aberrant methylation of tumor suppressor genes is a common event in malignant plasma cell disorders and that there is a correlation between methylation patterns and clinical characteristics in MM patients.","['Galm, O', 'Wilop, S', 'Reichelt, J', 'Jost, E', 'Gehbauer, G', 'Herman, J G', 'Osieka, R']","['Galm O', 'Wilop S', 'Reichelt J', 'Jost E', 'Gehbauer G', 'Herman JG', 'Osieka R']","['Medizinische Klinik IV, Universitaetsklinikum Aachen, 52074 Aachen, Germany. oliver.galm@post.rwth-aachen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/08/20 05:00,2004/11/02 09:00,['2004/08/20 05:00'],"['2004/08/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/20 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Oct;18(10):1687-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403434.,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2403434 [doi]', '2403434 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cutaneous side effects with this treatment are common but lichenoid drug eruption is exceptional. We report the first case with profuse cutaneous lichen. CASE REPORT: A 52 year-old woman presented with a 5-year history of chronic myeloid leukemia. The different chemotherapies had failed (persisting polyadenopathies and splenomegalia). She was treated with imatinib (400 mg/day). Two months after the beginning of this treatment a disseminated cutaneous eruption appeared on the trunk, legs, arms and face without mucosal involvement and composed of dark purple, prurigenous, papules suggestive of lichen planus. The cutaneous biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of lichen planus. Suspension of the drug led to the complete regression of the eruption, without any other local treatment, within 2 months. Reintroduction of the drug led to the recurrence of the lesions. DISCUSSION: Cutaneous reactions to imatinib are common and occur in 11 to 67 p. 100 of patients depending on the series. More severe cutaneous reactions have been described: exfoliating dermatites, generalized pustulosis, epidermal necrolysis. The aspect of profuse lichenoid eruption of the skin and the correlation with cutaneous lesions clinically and histologically evocative of lichen planus has not been described other than an isolated buccal involvement in a 72 year-old woman. In our patient, study of the imputability criteria is in favor of imatinib's responsibility.","['Roux, C', 'Boisseau-Garsaud, A-M', 'Saint-Cyr, I', 'Helenon, R', 'Quist, D', 'Delaunay, C']","['Roux C', 'Boisseau-Garsaud AM', 'Saint-Cyr I', 'Helenon R', 'Quist D', 'Delaunay C']","['Service de Dermatologie et Venereologie, CHU La Meynard, Hopital Pierre Zobda Quitman, Fort-de-France, Martinique.']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Eruptions/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Lichenoid Eruptions/*chemically induced', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects']",2004/08/20 05:00,2004/11/02 09:00,['2004/08/20 05:00'],"['2004/08/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/20 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 2004 Jun-Jul;131(6-7 Pt 1):571-3. doi: 10.1016/s0151-9638(04)93669-1.,"['MDOI-AD-6-7-2004-131-6-7-0151-9638-101019-ART7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0151-9638(04)93669-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,Toxidermie lichenoide a l'imatinib (Glivec).,,,,,,,

METHODS: A hospital based multicentre case control study, stratified on centre, age, and sex, with 280 leukaemia cases and 285 controls was carried out. Data were collected by a standardised interview of the mothers. RESULTS: No clear association was seen between maternal occupational exposure to hydrocarbons during pregnancy and leukaemia, or between residential traffic density and leukaemia. There was an association between dwellings neighbouring a petrol station or a repair garage during childhood and the risk of childhood leukaemia (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.5 to 10.3), with a duration trend. The association, which appeared particularly strong for acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (OR 7.7, 95% CI 1.7 to 34.3), was not altered by adjustment for potential confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: Results showed an association between acute childhood leukaemia and dwellings neighbouring auto repair garages and petrol stations, which are benzene emitting sources. These findings could be due to chance, although the strength of the association and the duration trend are arguments for a causal association.","['Steffen, C', 'Auclerc, M F', 'Auvrignon, A', 'Baruchel, A', 'Kebaili, K', 'Lambilliotte, A', 'Leverger, G', 'Sommelet, D', 'Vilmer, E', 'Hemon, D', 'Clavel, J']","['Steffen C', 'Auclerc MF', 'Auvrignon A', 'Baruchel A', 'Kebaili K', 'Lambilliotte A', 'Leverger G', 'Sommelet D', 'Vilmer E', 'Hemon D', 'Clavel J']","['French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, INSERM U170, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,"['0 (Hydrocarbons)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Benzene/toxicity', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons/*toxicity', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Residence Characteristics']",2004/08/20 05:00,2004/10/23 09:00,['2004/08/20 05:00'],"['2004/08/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/20 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2004 Sep;61(9):773-8. doi: 10.1136/oem.2003.010868.,"['10.1136/oem.2003.010868 [doi]', '61/9/773 [pii]']",,,,PMC1763669,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We employed a HL60 cell clone (HL60AR) with a constitutively active PI3K/Akt survival pathway, as well as U937 and K562 cells. In addition, we used parental (PT) HL60 cells overexpressing a constitutively active Akt. Selective pharmacological inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt axis (LY294002, wortmannin) were employed to influence the sensitivity to As2O3. While HL60PT cells were sensitive to 2.5 microM As2O3 and died of apoptosis, HL60AR cells were resistant up to 5 microM As2O3. Treatment with either LY294002 or wortmannin lowered resistance of HL60AR cells to As2O3. Also in U937 and K562 cells, inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt axis caused a decrease in As2O3 resistance. Overexpression of constitutively active Akt in HL60PT cells caused the induction of resistance to 2.5 microM As2O3. Conversely, forced expression of a dominant negative Akt in HL60AR cells resulted in a decrease in As2O3 resistance. Moreover, HL60 cell resistance to 2.5 microM As2O3 could be significantly reduced by incubation with SN50, a peptide inhibitor selective for the NF-kappaB transcription factor. Taken together our findings suggest that a constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is increasingly detected in some types of acute myeloid leukemia, may contribute to As2O3 resistance, most likely through NF-kappaB activation. Selective pharmacological inhibitors of this survival pathway, as well as of NF-kappaB, might be usefully employed in the future to reverse resistance to this treatment.","['Tabellini, Giovanna', 'Cappellini, Alessandra', 'Tazzari, Pier Luigi', 'Fala, Federica', 'Billi, Anna Maria', 'Manzoli, Lucia', 'Cocco, Lucio', 'Martelli, Alberto M']","['Tabellini G', 'Cappellini A', 'Tazzari PL', 'Fala F', 'Billi AM', 'Manzoli L', 'Cocco L', 'Martelli AM']","[""Dipartimento di Scienze Anatomiche Umane e Fisiopatologia dell'Apparato Locomotore, Sezione di Anatomia, Cell Signalling Laboratory, Universita di Bologna, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (SN50 peptide)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/genetics/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/pharmacology', 'Wortmannin']",2004/08/19 05:00,2005/02/19 09:00,['2004/08/19 05:00'],"['2004/08/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/19 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2005 Feb;202(2):623-34. doi: 10.1002/jcp.20153.,['10.1002/jcp.20153 [doi]'],,,,,,"['2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CHXhigh (10-100 microg/ml)-induced apoptosis can spontaneously subside after 4-6 h or can be inhibited by short-term preincubation with CHXlow (2.5 microg/ml). Unlike typical multidrug resistance, SDR is not caused by reduced drug accumulation or altered protein expression, and may be associated with a non-P-glycoprotein mechanism. To uncover this underlying mechanism, we focused on U937 cell aggregation promoted by CHX, because cell adhesion has been suggested to influence cell survival and prevent apoptosis. EDTA, or anti-CD18 monoclonal antibody, but not EGTA, acetylsalicylic acid or RGDS tetrapeptide, abrogated this homotypic aggregation and greatly increased CHX-induced apoptosis in a time-dependent manner, while fibrinogen and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 exerted opposite effects. These results establish that beta2-integrin engagement is a key mediator of SDR, although it may be non-exclusive. This finding supplements the classical basis of chemoresistance and may provide another opportunity for improved leukemia therapy.","['Wu, R-C', 'Wang, Z', 'Liu, M-J', 'Chen, D-F', 'Yue, X-S']","['Wu RC', 'Wang Z', 'Liu MJ', 'Chen DF', 'Yue XS']","['Department of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Cell Mol Life Sci,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,"['0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CD18 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cycloheximide/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2004/08/19 05:00,2004/10/16 09:00,['2004/08/19 05:00'],"['2004/08/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/19 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Life Sci. 2004 Aug;61(16):2071-82. doi: 10.1007/s00018-004-4165-1.,['10.1007/s00018-004-4165-1 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in previous studies of erythroblast crisis CML, the percentage of erythroid series in the bone marrow is seldom mentioned and the direct relationship of the erythroblasts and the Philadelphia chromosome has never been established. We report a well-documented case of acute erythroid leukemia transformed from CML.

To date, two types of cannabinoid receptors have been identified: the CB1 receptor, abundantly expressed in the brain, and the CB2 receptor, expressed in various lymphoid tissues such as the spleen. The CB1 receptor has been assumed to play an important role in the regulation of synaptic transmission, whereas the physiological roles of the CB2 receptor remain obscure. In this study, we examined whether the CB2 receptor is present in human eosinophils and found that the CB2 receptor is expressed in human peripheral blood eosinophils. In contrast, human neutrophils do not contain a significant amount of the CB2 receptor. We then examined the effect of 2-AG on the motility of eosinophils. We found that 2-AG induces the migration of human eosinophilic leukemia EoL-1 cells. The migration evoked by 2-AG was abolished in the presence of SR144528, a CB2 receptor antagonist, or by pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin, suggesting that the CB2 receptor and Gi/o are involved in the 2-AG-induced migration. The migration of EoL-1 cells induced by 2-AG was suggested to be a result of chemotaxis. In contrast to 2-AG, neither anandamide nor free arachidonic acid elicited the migration. Finally, we examined the effect of 2-AG on human peripheral blood eosinophils and neutrophils and found that 2-AG induces migration of eosinophils but not neutrophils. These results suggest that the CB2 receptor and its endogenous ligand 2-AG may be closely involved in allergic inflammation accompanied by the infiltration of eosinophils.","['Oka, Saori', 'Ikeda, Shinobu', 'Kishimoto, Seishi', 'Gokoh, Maiko', 'Yanagimoto, Shin', 'Waku, Keizo', 'Sugiura, Takayuki']","['Oka S', 'Ikeda S', 'Kishimoto S', 'Gokoh M', 'Yanagimoto S', 'Waku K', 'Sugiura T']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Teikyo University, Sagamiko, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Camphanes)', '0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (Glycerides)', '0 (Polyunsaturated Alkamides)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2)', '0 (SR 144528)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '8D239QDW64 (glyceryl 2-arachidonate)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go)', 'UR5G69TJKH (anandamide)']",IM,"['Arachidonic Acid/pharmacology', 'Arachidonic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Camphanes/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/*drug effects/physiology', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Eosinophils/*drug effects/physiology', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go/drug effects/metabolism', 'Glycerides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome', 'Hypersensitivity/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/physiology', 'Pertussis Toxin/pharmacology', 'Polyunsaturated Alkamides', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism']",2004/08/19 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/08/19 05:00'],"['2004/08/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/19 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2004 Nov;76(5):1002-9. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0404252.

Patients with monosomy 7 and trisomy 8 have distinctly different clinical courses, responses to therapy, and survival probabilities. To determine disease-specific molecular characteristics, we analyzed the gene expression pattern in purified CD34 hematopoietic progenitor cells obtained from MDS patients with monosomy 7 and trisomy 8 using Affymetrix GeneChips. Two methods were employed: standard hybridization and a small-sample RNA amplification protocol for the limited amounts of RNA available from individual cases; results were comparable between these 2 techniques. Microarray data were confirmed by gene amplification and flow cytometry using individual patient samples. Genes related to hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation and blood cell function were dysregulated in CD34 cells of both monosomy 7 and trisomy 8 MDS. In trisomy 8, up-regulated genes were primarily involved in immune and inflammatory responses, and down-regulated genes have been implicated in apoptosis inhibition. CD34 cells in monosomy 7 showed up-regulation of genes inducing leukemia transformation and tumorigenesis and apoptosis and down-regulation of genes controlling cell growth and differentiation.

Not all patients achieve cytogenetic response. Some patients even lose the initial cytogenetic response. In this study, we investigated the active cellular transport of imatinib to gain a better understanding of the possible mechanisms of imatinib resistance. We used the leukemic cell line CCRFCEM and its drug-resistant subline VBL(100) to measure the uptake of carbon 14 ((14)C)-labeled imatinib. Imatinib uptake was temperature dependent, indicative of an active uptake process. Additionally, incubations with transport inhibitors showed that verapamil, amantadine, and procainamide, inhibitors of the human organic cation transporter 1 (hOCT1), significantly decreased imatinib uptake into CEM cells, whereas the inhibition of hOCT2 or hOCT3 had no effect, indicating that influx into the cells is an active process likely to be mediated by hOCT1. Studies using transfected MDCK cell lines revealed an active efflux component attributable to MDR1 (ABCB1). Both hOCT1 and MDR1 were expressed in CML primary cells and cell lines. The results indicate that active transport processes mediate the influx and efflux of imatinib. Differential expression of influx (hOCT1) and efflux (MDR1) transporters may be a critical determinant of intracellular drug levels and, hence, resistance to imatinib.","['Thomas, Julia', 'Wang, Lihui', 'Clark, Richard E', 'Pirmohamed, Munir']","['Thomas J', 'Wang L', 'Clark RE', 'Pirmohamed M']","['Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, The University of Liverpool, Ashton Street, Liverpool, L69 3GE, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Organic Cation Transporter 1)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/physiology', 'Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Biological Transport, Active/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Polarity', 'Dogs', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Kinetics', 'Organic Cation Transporter 1/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacokinetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacokinetics', 'Temperature']",2004/08/19 05:00,2004/12/31 09:00,['2004/08/19 05:00'],"['2004/08/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/31 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/19 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Dec 1;104(12):3739-45. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-12-4276.

MDS and aplastic anemia are sometimes grouped as bone marrow failure disorders because patients present with similar peripheral blood pictures. The bone marrow in MDS is generally hypercellular, due to ineffective hematopoiesis, in contrast to the hypocellular bone marrow of aplastic anemia. MDS is more common in the elderly, differing from aplastic anemia that affects all ages. The characteristics of each of the subgroups of the MDS using the World Health Organization (WHO) classification are described. Cytogenetic analysis provides a useful part of disease diagnosis in this new classification system. There is no successful treatment for MDS other than hematopoietic stem cell transplantation which is usually recommended for patients under age 50. A prognostic scoring system has been developed to help predict the severity of disease and guide treatment. Approximately 10% to 40% of MDS cases terminate in acute leukemia.

An autoimmune T-cell reaction likely causes the stem cell depletion, but the precise mechanism, as well as the eliciting and target antigens, is unknown. Symptoms vary from severe life-threatening cytopenias to moderate or non-severe disease that does not require transfusion support. The peripheral blood typically exhibits pancytopenia, reticulocytopenia, and normocytic or macrocytic erythrocytes. The bone marrow is hypocellular and may exhibit dysplasia of the erythrocyte precursors. First line treatment for severe AA consists of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in young patients with HLA identical siblings, while immunosuppression therapy is used for older patients and for those of any age who lack a HLA matched donor.

We compared retroviral vectors derived from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), avian sarcoma-leukosis virus (ASLV), and murine leukemia virus (MLV). Effects of gene activity on integration targeting were assessed by transcriptional profiling of infected cells. Integration by HIV vectors, analyzed in two primary cell types and several cell lines, strongly favored active genes. An analysis of the effects of tissue-specific transcription showed that it resulted in tissue-specific integration targeting by HIV, though the effect was quantitatively modest. Chromosomal regions rich in expressed genes were favored for HIV integration, but these regions were found to be interleaved with unfavorable regions at CpG islands. MLV vectors showed a strong bias in favor of integration near transcription start sites, as reported previously. ASLV vectors showed only a weak preference for active genes and no preference for transcription start regions.

Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) seems to be extremely effective in this role in pretreated patients. The authors used a molecular semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to assess the ability of alemtuzumab to induce PCR negativity in eight patients pretreated with fludarabine. IgH rearrangement was coamplified with a housekeeping gene and fluorescent PCR products were analyzed on a DNA automatic sequencer. Each patient was evaluated at diagnosis, after fludarabine, and after Campath-1H. The median interval between the last therapy course with fludarabine and the start of Campath-1H was 14 weeks. Patients received subcutaneous doses up to 10 mg, three times a week, for 12 weeks, with a median dose of 190 mg. After six cycles with fludarabine, only one patient (12.5%) achieved molecular remission, and in three other patients IgH levels decreased by 0.5 to 1 log. At the beginning of Campath-1H administration, all patients were PCR positive, including the one previously found to be negative. At the end of treatment, five patients achieved molecular remission (62.5%), four of them within 1 month after the end of therapy. Seventy-two percent of responses, with 43% of complete responses, were documented on bone marrow smears. A significant reduction of lymph node and spleen diameters was noted in 50% and 33% of patients, respectively. Four patients showed grade 2 skin reaction at the site of the subcutaneous injection and grade 1 or 2 fever. Two patients developed neutropenia (grade 2 and 3) and two hemolytic episodes. Three patients showed cytomegalovirus and one herpes zoster and Epstein-Barr virus reactivation. These results show that Campath-1H represents an efficacious in vivo purging tool with a safe profile.","['Galimberti, Sara', 'Cervetti, Giulia', 'Cecconi, Nadia', 'Fazzi, Rita', 'Pacini, Simone', 'Guerrini, Francesca', 'Manetti, Chiara', 'Caracciolo, Francesco', 'Petrini, Mario']","['Galimberti S', 'Cervetti G', 'Cecconi N', 'Fazzi R', 'Pacini S', 'Guerrini F', 'Manetti C', 'Caracciolo F', 'Petrini M']","['Department of Oncology, Transplant and Advances in Medicine, Section of Hematology, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2004/08/18 05:00,2005/02/03 09:00,['2004/08/18 05:00'],"['2004/08/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunother. 2004 Sep-Oct;27(5):389-93. doi: 10.1097/00002371-200409000-00007.,"['00002371-200409000-00007 [pii]', '10.1097/00002371-200409000-00007 [doi]']",,,,,,['Copyright 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review summarizes the most recent developments in the management of Burkitt lymphoma and leukemia in adults. RECENT FINDINGS: Current regimens have largely been derived from pediatric protocols. High complete remission rates are typically achieved, but relapse remains a problem. Recent trials have validated or built upon findings from older studies. SUMMARY: The adoption of aggressive, multiagent, short-course therapy has markedly improved outcomes, but relapse rates remain relatively high in poorer-risk cohorts. New approaches are particularly needed in older patients to improve survival rates while minimizing toxicities.","['Kasamon, Yvette L', 'Swinnen, Lode J']","['Kasamon YL', 'Swinnen LJ']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, Maryland 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications', 'Adult', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/etiology']",2004/08/18 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/08/18 05:00'],"['2004/08/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2004 Sep;16(5):429-35. doi: 10.1097/00001622-200409000-00003.,"['00001622-200409000-00003 [pii]', '10.1097/00001622-200409000-00003 [doi]']",,,46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Freshly isolated cells derived from patients with advanced, chemo-refractory myeloma as well as human myeloma cell lines, ARP-1, RPMI-8226 and H929 were exposed to the organic arsenical melarsoprol and to the inorganic compound AT. Both agents potently induced apoptosis in myeloma cells. Exposure to 1-5 microM AT or melarsoprol for 6 hours suppressed NF-kappa B DNA binding and enhanced of c-Jun kinase (JNK) activity. Arsenic also activated caspase-3 resulting in the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and Fas/TNF alpha related receptor interacting protein (RIP). In contrast to reported observations in acute promyelocytic leukemia, myeloma cell apoptosis was not associated with either the downregulation of Bcl-2 protein or with alterations in the expression of other Bcl-2 family members, Bax, Bak, Bag, and Bcl-xl. This study first shows that arsenic induces apoptotic signaling in MM through the cleavage of TNF alpha related receptor interacting protein (RIP). RIP is a key downstream protein in FasL/ TNF alpha /TRAIL induced apoptosis and a major antiapoptotic adaptor of pathways through NF-kappa B and JNK. RIP has not been previously characterized in myeloma. This study supports the hypothesis that arsenicals share common mediators (RIP, NF-kappa B, PARP, caspase-3) with death receptor induced apoptosis. These studies provide an important insight into the molecular mechanism of AT induced apoptosis and can be used in the development of adjuvant therapy for MM, presently an incurable disease.","['Bajenova, O', 'Tang, B', 'Pearse, R', 'Feinman, R', 'Childs, B H', 'Michaeli, J']","['Bajenova O', 'Tang B', 'Pearse R', 'Feinman R', 'Childs BH', 'Michaeli J']","['The Myeloma Service, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA. baj@bu.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)', 'ZF3786Q2E8 (Melarsoprol)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Arsenic/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Melarsoprol/pharmacology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism']",2004/08/18 05:00,2005/04/13 09:00,['2004/08/18 05:00'],"['2004/08/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 2004 Sep;9(5):561-71. doi: 10.1023/B:APPT.0000038030.47068.49.,"['10.1023/B:APPT.0000038030.47068.49 [doi]', '5276979 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We note that the loss of CD45 expression in the lymphoblastic leukemia cell line HPB-ALL (HPB45.0) leads to an inhibition of nuclear apoptosis. Our hypothesis is that the absence of CD45 disturbs protein function regulated by a proto-oncogene of the Src family playing a significant role in nuclear apoptosis. In this work we explore the importance of a chloride efflux on DNA fragmentation. The role of tyrosine kinase in the function and regulation of the chloride channels was determined. Our results showed a disturbance of ionic homeostasis in CD45 deficient lymphocytes (CD45-) in contrast to normal lymphocytes (CD45+). The phosphorylation levels of the chloride channels are considerably inhibited in CD45-, while the expression levels of these channels are similar in the two types of cells. A hypertonic medium inhibits DNA fragmentation in CD45+ while a hypotonic medium increases DNA fragmentation in CD45-. Thus CD45 plays a significant role in nuclear apoptosis by the regulation of the chloride channels responsible for ionic homeostasis of the cell essential for the DFF40 activation.","['Dupere-Minier, G', 'Hamelin, C', 'Desharnais, P', 'Bernier, J']","['Dupere-Minier G', 'Hamelin C', 'Desharnais P', 'Bernier J']","['INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier, Pointe-Claire, Quebec H9R 1G6, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Chloride Channels)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics/physiology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Cell Size', 'Chloride Channels/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/genetics/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas']",2004/08/18 05:00,2005/04/13 09:00,['2004/08/18 05:00'],"['2004/08/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 2004 Sep;9(5):543-51. doi: 10.1023/B:APPT.0000038031.84705.84.,"['10.1023/B:APPT.0000038031.84705.84 [doi]', '5276980 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like rheumatoid arthritis, its severity increases after menopause, and estrogen deficiency has been implicated. We have reported that estrogen receptor-alpha and -beta-knockout mice develop autoimmune nephritis and myeloid leukemia, respectively, but neither develops SS. One model of estrogen deficiency in rodents is the aromatase-knockout (ArKO) mouse. In these animals, there is elevated B lymphopoiesis in bone marrow. We now report that ArKO mice develop severe autoimmune exocrinopathy resembling SS. By 1 year of age, there is B cell hyperplasia in the bone marrow, spleen, and blood of ArKO mice and spontaneous autoimmune manifestations such as proteinuria and severe leukocyte infiltration in the salivary glands and kidney. Also, as is typically found in human SS, there were proteolytic fragments of alpha-fodrin in the salivary glands and anti-alpha-fodrin antibodies in the serum of both female and male ArKO mice. When mice were raised on a phytoestrogen-free diet, there was a mild but significant incidence of infiltration of B lymphocytes in WT mice and severe destructive autoimmune lesions in ArKO mice. In age-matched WT mice fed a diet containing normal levels of phytoestrogen, there were no autoimmune lesions. These results reveal that estrogen deficiency results in a lymphoproliferative autoimmune disease resembling SS and suggest that estrogen might have clinical value in the prevention or treatment of this disease.","['Shim, Gil-Jin', 'Warner, Margaret', 'Kim, Hyun-Jin', 'Andersson, Sandra', 'Liu, Lining', 'Ekman, Jenny', 'Imamov, Otabek', 'Jones, Margaret E', 'Simpson, Evan R', 'Gustafsson, Jan-Ake']","['Shim GJ', 'Warner M', 'Kim HJ', 'Andersson S', 'Liu L', 'Ekman J', 'Imamov O', 'Jones ME', 'Simpson ER', 'Gustafsson JA']","['Department of Biosciences, Karolinska Institute, Novum Research Park, S-141 57 Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Estrogens)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Aromatase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aromatase/genetics/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism/pathology', 'Estrogens/*deficiency', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phenotype', 'Proteinuria', ""Sjogren's Syndrome/*immunology/metabolism/pathology"", 'Spleen/metabolism/pathology']",2004/08/18 05:00,2004/10/19 09:00,['2004/08/18 05:00'],"['2004/08/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Aug 24;101(34):12628-33. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0405099101.

Previously, we demonstrated that the HLH domain of the class II basic HLH (bHLH) protein SCL/Tal-1 is critical for hematopoietic specification. We have now identified residues in this domain that are essential for restoring hematopoietic development to SCL-/- embryonic stem cells and sufficient to convert a muscle-specific HLH domain to one able to rescue hematopoiesis. Most of these critical residues are distributed in the loop of SCL, with one in helix 2. This is in contrast to the case for MyoD, the prototype of class II bHLH proteins, where the loop seems to serve mainly as a linker between the two helices. Among the identified residues, some promote heterodimerization with the bHLH partners of SCL (E12/E47), while others, unimportant for this property, are still crucial for the biological function of SCL. Importantly, the residue in helix 2 specifically promotes interaction with a known partner of SCL, the LIM-only protein LMO2, a finding that strengthens genetic evidence that these proteins interact. Our data highlight the functional complexity of bHLH proteins, provide mechanistic insight into SCL function, and strongly support the existence of an active SCL/LMO2-containing multiprotein complex in early hematopoietic cells.","['Schlaeger, Thorsten M', 'Schuh, Anna', 'Flitter, Simon', 'Fisher, Andreas', 'Mikkola, Hanna', 'Orkin, Stuart H', 'Vyas, Paresh', 'Porcher, Catherine']","['Schlaeger TM', 'Schuh A', 'Flitter S', 'Fisher A', 'Mikkola H', 'Orkin SH', 'Vyas P', 'Porcher C']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital and Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics/physiology', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Metalloproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Mutation', 'Phenylalanine/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Stem Cells/*physiology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",2004/08/18 05:00,2004/10/02 05:00,['2004/08/18 05:00'],"['2004/08/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/02 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2004 Sep;24(17):7491-502. doi: 10.1128/MCB.24.17.7491-7502.2004.,"['10.1128/MCB.24.17.7491-7502.2004 [doi]', '24/17/7491 [pii]']",,,,PMC506978,,['Copyright 2004 American Society for Microbiology'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although limited examples of marked constraint in the primary structure of the H and L chain V regions exist, the possibility that this level of restriction is a general principle in this disease has not been accepted. This report describes five sets of patients, mostly with unmutated or minimally mutated IgV genes, with strikingly similar B cell antigen receptors (BCRs) arising from the use of common H and L chain V region gene segments that share CDR3 structural features such as length, amino acid composition, and unique amino acid residues at recombination junctions. Thus, a much more striking degree of structural restriction of the entire BCR and a much higher frequency of receptor sharing exists among patients than appreciated previously. The data imply that either a significant fraction of B-CLL cells was selected by a limited set of antigenic epitopes at some point in their development and/or that they derive from a distinct B cell subpopulation with limited Ig V region diversity. These shared, stereotyped Ig molecules may be valuable probes for antigen identification and important targets for cross-reactive idiotypic therapy.","['Messmer, Bradley T', 'Albesiano, Emilia', 'Efremov, Dimitar G', 'Ghiotto, Fabio', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Kolitz, Jonathan', 'Foa, Robin', 'Damle, Rajendra N', 'Fais, Franco', 'Messmer, Davorka', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Ferrarini, Manlio', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas']","['Messmer BT', 'Albesiano E', 'Efremov DG', 'Ghiotto F', 'Allen SL', 'Kolitz J', 'Foa R', 'Damle RN', 'Fais F', 'Messmer D', 'Rai KR', 'Ferrarini M', 'Chiorazzi N']","['North Shore-LIJ Research Institute, 350 Community Dr., Manhasset, NY 11030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Databases, Genetic', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",2004/08/18 05:00,2004/10/22 09:00,['2004/08/18 05:00'],"['2004/08/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2004 Aug 16;200(4):519-25. doi: 10.1084/jem.20040544.,"['10.1084/jem.20040544 [doi]', 'jem.20040544 [pii]']",,"['R01 CA087956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR018535/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA081554/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 87956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 81554/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2211936,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the tumor-killing action mediated by these antibodies on an ATL model in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (SCID/NOD) wild-type mice that lack effective T and natural killer (NK) cells and in SCID/NOD Fc receptor common gamma chain knockout (FcRgamma-/-) mice.

HAT, MAT, and 7G7/B6 were given to the leukemia-bearing mice at a dose of 100 microg weekly for 4 weeks. The three antibodies inhibited the leukemia growth significantly in SCID/NOD wild-type mice, as monitored by serum levels of human beta2-microglobulin (P < 0.01), and prolonged survival of the leukemia-bearing SCID/NOD wild-type mice (P < 0.01) as compared with the control group. However, none of the antibodies manifested efficacy on the leukemia growth and survival of the SCID/NOD FcRgamma-/- mice bearing MET-1 leukemia. In a pharmacokinetics study, the blood concentrations of the radiolabeled antibodies decreased with time similarly in SCID/NOD wild-type and SCID/NOD FcRgamma-/- mice. Although NK cells may play a role in humans, in this murine model FcRgamma receptors on non-NK cells, such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes or monocytes, are required for the tumor-killing action of the antibodies directed toward CD25.","['Zhang, Meili', 'Zhang, Zhuo', 'Garmestani, Kayhan', 'Goldman, Carolyn K', 'Ravetch, Jeffrey V', 'Brechbiel, Martin W', 'Carrasquillo, Jorge A', 'Waldmann, Thomas A']","['Zhang M', 'Zhang Z', 'Garmestani K', 'Goldman CK', 'Ravetch JV', 'Brechbiel MW', 'Carrasquillo JA', 'Waldmann TA']","['Metabolism Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-1374, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'CUJ2MVI71Y (Daclizumab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Daclizumab', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology/pharmacology', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Receptors, IgG/*immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*immunology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2004/08/18 05:00,2004/10/02 05:00,['2004/08/18 05:00'],"['2004/08/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/02 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Aug 15;64(16):5825-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1088.,"['10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1088 [doi]', '64/16/5825 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One recurring chromosomal aberration in uterine leiomyomata is rearrangement of 10q22. Chromosome 10 breakpoints were mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization to intervals ranging from 8.9 to 72.1 kb within the third intron of MORF (monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein-related factor or MYST4) in four uterine leiomyomata tested. Additional Southern hybridization experiments confirmed that the breakpoint lies within the third intron and narrowed the interval to 2.1 kb in one uterine leiomyomata. MORF is a member of the MYST family of histone acetyltransferase and previously has been found rearranged in some types of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This is the first instance in which disruption of a histone acetyltransferase has been reported in another tumor type. The breakpoints in uterine leiomyomata would fall in the NH2-terminal portion of the protein between a conserved domain found in histones H1 and H5 and the PHD zinc fingers, the CH2CH zinc finger, or the CoA binding site, which is distinct from the breakpoints reported in AML. Mapping of the 17q21 breakpoint by fluorescence in situ hybridization within a specific region in three tumors revealed several positional candidates including GCN5L2, a gene with histone acetyltransferase activity similar to those fused to MORF in AML. Of note, two of three uterine leiomyomata were of the cellular subtype. Involvement of MORF in four uterine leiomyomata with chromosomal rearrangements involving 10q22 and 17q21 suggests a role for this histone acetyltransferase and altered chromatin regulation in uterine mesenchymal neoplasia.","['Moore, Steven D P', 'Herrick, Steven R', 'Ince, Tan A', 'Kleinman, Michael S', 'Dal Cin, Paola', 'Morton, Cynthia C', 'Quade, Bradley J']","['Moore SD', 'Herrick SR', 'Ince TA', 'Kleinman MS', 'Dal Cin P', 'Morton CC', 'Quade BJ']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6B protein, human)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/*genetics', 'Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*genetics', 'Female', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leiomyoma/*enzymology/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Uterine Neoplasms/*enzymology/*genetics']",2004/08/18 05:00,2004/10/02 05:00,['2004/08/18 05:00'],"['2004/08/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/02 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Aug 15;64(16):5570-7. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0050.,"['10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0050 [doi]', '64/16/5570 [pii]']",,"['CA78895/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA 92013/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MHC class II antigen presentation requires the release of class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP) from the antigen-binding site. In antigen-presenting cells, human leukocyte antigen DM (HLA-DM; abbreviated DM in this article) catalyzes CLIP dissociation. In B cells, HLA-DO (DO) down-modulates DM function. Cell surface CLIP:HLA-DR (DR) ratio correlates to DO:DM ratio and the efficacy of antigen presentation. We examined 111 blood and bone marrow samples of patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) for the expression of CLIP, DR, DM, and DO by flow cytometry. Patients with DR+/CLIP- blasts had a significant longer disease-free survival than patients with DR+/CLIP+ blasts. DO, until now believed to be restricted to lymphoid cells, could be demonstrated at protein level as well as by reverse transcription-PCR. DO:DM ratio correlated to CLIP:DR ratio, suggesting that, unlike in other antigen-presenting cells of the nonlymphoid cell type, both DO and DM mediate regulation of CLIP expression in AML blasts.

DESIGN: Retrospective assessment of clinical histories, postoperative notes, and surgical photographs. SETTING: Tertiary-care institution (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn). PATIENTS: Twenty-four patients with CLL who underwent Mohs surgery for 33 BCCs and 66 controls matched for sex, age, and surgical year who underwent Mohs surgery for BCC of the head and neck from May 1988 through September 1998. RESULTS: Among the 24 patients with CLL who underwent Mohs surgery for 33 BCCs, there were 4 recurrences. The cumulative incidence of recurrence on a per-tumor basis was 3% at 1 year, 12% at 3 years, and 22% at 5 years. Basal cell carcinoma was 14 times more likely to recur in patients with CLL than in controls (P =.02). Overall, there were no significant differences between patients with CLL and controls in preoperative tumor size (median, 1.6 cm vs 1.4 cm; P =.18) and proportion of aggressive histologic subtypes of BCC (58% vs 41%; P =.12). CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence rates of BCC are significantly higher after Mohs surgery in patients with CLL. Overall, patients with CLL do not appear to have significantly larger BCCs or more aggressive histologic subtypes of BCC. In patients with CLL, close surveillance is warranted for recurrence of BCC and a decreased threshold is indicated for subsequent biopsies.","['Mehrany, Khosrow', 'Weenig, Roger H', 'Pittelkow, Mark R', 'Roenigk, Randall K', 'Otley, Clark C']","['Mehrany K', 'Weenig RH', 'Pittelkow MR', 'Roenigk RK', 'Otley CC']","['Department of Dermatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Dermatol,Archives of dermatology,0372433,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Basal Cell/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology/surgery', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Head', 'Humans', 'Incidence', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Male', 'Medical Records', 'Middle Aged', 'Minnesota/epidemiology', 'Mohs Surgery', 'Neck', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology/surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology/surgery']",2004/08/18 05:00,2004/09/11 05:00,['2004/08/18 05:00'],"['2004/08/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/11 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Dermatol. 2004 Aug;140(8):985-8. doi: 10.1001/archderm.140.8.985.,"['10.1001/archderm.140.8.985 [doi]', '140/8/985 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukaemia is the commonest form of cancer in children accounting for around a third of all childhood cancer, with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) being the most prevalent. Biologically specific subtypes of ALL and acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML), the other major morphological type of childhood leukaemia, are characterised by chromosomal changes. Whilst over 200 genes have been associated with chromosomal translocations, to date, only MLL, TEL, and AML1 have been linked with childhood leukaemia. Interestingly, there is increasing evidence to support the theory that gene rearrangements such as these may originate in utero. As with many other human diseases, both genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the aetiology of the disease. Although much has been documented with regard to diet, smoking, alcohol consumption and recreational and prescription drug use during pregnancy, there is no consistent evidence to support a link with any of these factors and childhood leukaemia. However, findings from studies investigating prenatal and early life exposures are often based on small numbers of cases as both the type of cancer and exposure are rare. Furthermore, accurate information relating to past exposures can be difficult to obtain and is often reliant on self-reporting. To further our understanding of the aetiology of childhood leukaemia and lymphoma, there are areas which clearly warrant investigation. These include collection of parental dietary folate data combined with genetic analysis of the folate related genes, in utero exposure to DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors, and the possible effects of assisted reproduction technology on disease susceptibility.","['Lightfoot, Tracy J', 'Roman, Eve']","['Lightfoot TJ', 'Roman E']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Epidemiology and Genetics Unit, Department of Health Sciences, University of York, YO10 5DD, UK.

Infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in parts of Africa and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) increase the risk of Burkitt's lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma, respectively. Other risk factors have not been conclusively identified. A review of the data on international variation in incidence, recent changes in incidence, and risk factors suggests that many childhood cancers are likely to have nongenetic causes. The pattern of international variation and associations with surrogates of infection suggest an infectious etiology for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, although no agent has been identified. The biologic plausibility is strong that maternal consumption of food containing DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors may increase the risk of acute myeloid leukemia, although the data are limited now. For brain tumors, cured meats, polyomaviruses, and farm exposures may have etiologic roles. Changes in the incidence and characteristics of children with hepatoblastoma as well as risk factor studies suggest a role for an exposure of very low birth weight babies. High birth weight, tea or coffee consumption, and certain paternal occupations have shown some consistency in their association with Wilms' tumor. For most of the other cancers, very few epidemiologic studies have been conducted, so it is not surprising that nongenetic risk factors have not been detected. The most important difference between the cancers for which there are good etiologic clues and those for which there are not may be the number of relevant studies.","['Bunin, Greta R']",['Bunin GR'],"[""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA. bunin@email.chop.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",2004/08/18 05:00,2004/09/21 05:00,['2004/08/18 05:00'],"['2003/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2003/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2004 Sep 1;199(2):91-103. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2003.12.028.,"['10.1016/j.taap.2003.12.028 [doi]', 'S0041008X04001322 [pii]']",,,132,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism for LAA-induced cytoreduction remains to be elucidated. LAA at concentrations of 0.25-1.0 mM induced a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of proliferation in three AML cell lines and also in leukemic cells from peripheral blood specimens obtained from three patients with AML. In contrast, ovarian cancer cell lines were only minimally affected. Flow cytometric analysis showed that LAA at concentrations of 0.25-1.0 mM could significantly induce apoptosis in the AML cell lines. LAA induced oxidation of glutathione to oxidized form (GSSG) and subsequent H(2)O(2) accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner, in parallel to induction of apoptosis. The direct role of H(2)O(2) in the induction of apoptosis in AML cells was clearly demonstrated by the finding that catalase could completely abrogate LAA-induced apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis in LAA-treated AML cells involved a dose-dependent increase of Bax protein, release of cytochrome C from mitochondria to cytosol, activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3, and cleavage of poly[ADP-ribose]polymerase. In conclusion, LAA can induce apoptosis in AML cells, and this is clearly due to H(2)O(2) which accumulates intracellularly as a result of oxidation of reduced glutathione by LAA.","['Park, Seyeon', 'Han, Seong-Su', 'Park, Chan H', 'Hahm, Eun-Ryeong', 'Lee, Sook J', 'Park, Hye K', 'Lee, Se-Hoon', 'Kim, Won S', 'Jung, Chul Won', 'Park, Keunchil', 'Riordan, Hugh D', 'Kimler, Bruce F', 'Kim, Kihyun', 'Lee, Je-Ho']","['Park S', 'Han SS', 'Park CH', 'Hahm ER', 'Lee SJ', 'Park HK', 'Lee SH', 'Kim WS', 'Jung CW', 'Park K', 'Riordan HD', 'Kimler BF', 'Kim K', 'Lee JH']","['Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul 135-710, Republic of Korea. seypark21@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,"['9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Ascorbic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/08/18 05:00,2005/01/26 09:00,['2004/08/18 05:00'],"['2004/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2004/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2004/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2004 Nov;36(11):2180-95. doi: 10.1016/j.biocel.2004.04.005.,"['10.1016/j.biocel.2004.04.005 [doi]', 'S1357272504001591 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These epigenetic changes--in particular, aberrant promoter hypermethylation that is associated with inappropriate gene silencing--affect virtually every step in tumor progression. Intriguingly, methylation patterns are severely altered in tumors, with an overall hypomethylation of the genome and hypermethylation of islands of CpGs clusters within specific DNA regions. Though overexpression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) has been proposed to be a mechanism for aberrant genome methylation, it does not explain the specific regional hypermethylation in cancer cells. We have analyzed the role of chromatin modifying activities in cell transformation using acute promyelocytic leukemia as a model system. This disease is caused by expression of the PML-RARalpha fusion protein, thus offering the opportunity of studying the mechanisms of leukemogenesis through molecular investigation of the activity of the directly transforming protein. Recent evidence suggests that PML-RARalpha as well as other leukemia-associated fusion proteins induce changes in the chromatin structure. Specifically, aberrant recruitment of different chromatin modifying enzymes to specific promoters induces DNA hypermethylation and heterochromatin formation, which consequentially leads to the transcriptional silencing of that genes. Importantly, these epigenetic modifications were found to contribute to the leukemogenic potential of PML-RARalpha. These observations suggest that epigenetic alterations could actively contribute to the development of APL and other hyperproliferative diseases.","['Villa, R', 'De Santis, F', 'Gutierrez, A', 'Minucci, S', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Di Croce, L']","['Villa R', 'De Santis F', 'Gutierrez A', 'Minucci S', 'Pelicci PG', 'Di Croce L']","['Center for Genomic Regulation, Passeig Maritim 37-49, 08003 Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Animals', '*DNA Methylation', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism']",2004/08/18 05:00,2004/09/28 05:00,['2004/08/18 05:00'],"['2004/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/28 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2004 Sep 15;68(6):1247-54. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2004.05.041.,"['10.1016/j.bcp.2004.05.041 [doi]', 'S0006295204003831 [pii]']",,,62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results demonstrate the ability of selected chemopreventive agents to decrease GSTP1-1 gene expression mechanisms and could thus contribute to reduce the incidence of glutathione related drug resistance in human leukemia.","['Duvoix, Annelyse', 'Delhalle, Sylvie', 'Blasius, Romain', 'Schnekenburger, Michael', 'Morceau, Franck', 'Fougere, Marjorie', 'Henry, Estelle', 'Galteau, Marie-Madeleine', 'Dicato, Mario', 'Diederich, Marc']","['Duvoix A', 'Delhalle S', 'Blasius R', 'Schnekenburger M', 'Morceau F', 'Fougere M', 'Henry E', 'Galteau MM', 'Dicato M', 'Diederich M']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg, 9, rue Edward Steichen, L-2540 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Chemoprevention', 'Drug Interactions', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2004/08/18 05:00,2004/09/28 05:00,['2004/08/18 05:00'],"['2004/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/28 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2004 Sep 15;68(6):1101-11. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2004.05.032.,"['10.1016/j.bcp.2004.05.032 [doi]', 'S0006295204003661 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eupatilin (5,7-dihydroxy-3',4',6-trimethoxyflavone), one of the pharmacologically active ingredients derived from A. asiatica, was shown to induce apoptosis in human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells [Mutat Res 496 (2001) 191]. In the present study, we examined the cytostatic effects of eupatilin in H-ras-transformed human breast epithelial (MCF10A-ras) cells. Eupatilin inhibited the growth of MCF10A-ras cells in a concentration-dependent and time-related manner. To explore whether the anti-proliferative effects of eupatilin could be mediated through modulation of the cell cycle in MCF10A-ras, DNA contents were analyzed by the flow cytometry. Eupatilin inhibited the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin B1, Cdk2 and Cdc2 that are key regulators of the cell cycle. In addition, eupatilin treatment led to elevated expression of p53 and p27Kip1 that act as Cdk inhibitors. It has been known that the Ras-signaling pathway plays integral roles in the induction of cyclin D1. Eupatilin inhibited the activation of ERK1/2 as well as expression of Raf-1 and Ras in MCF10A-ras cells. Thus, the inhibitory effect of eupatilin on cyclin D1 expression appears to be mediated by targeting the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascades. Eupatilin did not change activation of Akt, an important component of cell-survival pathways. In conclusion, the anti-proliferative effect of eupatilin in MCF10A-ras cells is associated with its blockade of cell cycle progression which appears to be attributable in part to inhibition of ERK1/2 activation.","['Kim, Do-Hee', 'Na, Hye-Kyung', 'Oh, Tae Young', 'Kim, Won-Bae', 'Surh, Young-Joon']","['Kim DH', 'Na HK', 'Oh TY', 'Kim WB', 'Surh YJ']","['Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Shinlim-dong, Kwanak-ku, 151-742, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Flavones)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '4D58O05490 (eupatilin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'S2V45N7G3B (flavone)']",IM,"['Artemisia/*chemistry', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cyclin D1/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Flavones', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Genes, ras/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mammary Glands, Human/cytology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/metabolism', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2004/08/18 05:00,2004/09/28 05:00,['2004/08/18 05:00'],"['2004/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2004/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/28 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2004 Sep 15;68(6):1081-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2004.04.027.,"['10.1016/j.bcp.2004.04.027 [doi]', 'S0006295204003648 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The studied population consisted of 38 subjects (17 female and 21 male) measured at the age of 13.9 +/- 3.8 years (5.7 +/- 2.9 years after completion of the therapy, 11.0 +/- 14.4 years after diagnosis) and 2 years earlier; compared with 1402 controls (628 female and 774 male). Patients and controls did not differ significantly in regard to age, height or weight. Skeletal status was assessed by quantitative ultrasound (US) measurements at the hand phalanges using the DBM Sonic 1200, which measures amplitude-dependent speed-of-sound, Ad-SoS (m/s). rms CV% was 0.43%. Mean baseline Ad-SoS value in patients was 1990 +/- 76 m/s and, at second measurement, 2045 +/- 86 m/s (p < 0.000001). In 31 patients, Ad-SoS increased and, in one patient, decreased more than the value of the least significant change. In controls, mean Ad-SoS values were 1973 +/- 64 m/s (baseline) and 2016 +/- 86 m/s (follow-up) and did not differ significantly vs. baseline values in patients. At second measurement, Ad-SoS in controls was significantly lower than in patients (p < 0.05). In five patients with low baseline Ad-SoS values, bone mineral density (BMD) at the spine using DPX-L was estimated; baseline mean BMD was 0.95 +/- 0.11 g/cm2, Z-score was 1.25 +/- 0.97 and, at second measurement, 1.16 +/- 0.07 g/cm2, Z-score was 0.23 +/- 0.43. A significant increase in BMD (p < 0.01) and Z-score (p < 0.05) was noted. In patients, Ad-SoS correlated significantly with age, period after completion of the therapy, body size and Tanner stages (r ranged from 0.43 to 0.83, p ranged from 0.0001 to 0.05).

METHODS: Using RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay, CYP3A5 mRNA protein and activities in leukemia cell lines were detected. Daunorubicin (DNR) sensitivity profiles of leukemia cell lines were obtained with MTT assay. Cell cycle characteristics and apoptosis induced by DNR were observed with flow cytometry (FCM) analysis. RESULTS: K562, U937, HL-60, NB4 and Jurkat cells were chosen as experimental cell line panels. It was found that CYP3A5 mRNA were measured only in K562 and U937 cells. CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 were not detectable in each cell line. The five leukemia cell lines presented sensitivity to DNR (IC(50), mg/L) in an order as follows: NB4 (0.068 +/- 0.036) > Jurkat (0.076 +/- 0.013) > HL-60 (0.092 +/- 0.016) > K562 (0.148 +/- 0.041) > U937 (0.150 +/- 0.035). Interestingly, K562 and U937 cells (cell lines with CYP3A5 gene transcription) were more resistant to DNR as compared with the other three cell lines in a statistically significant way (P < 0.01). Furthermore, expression and activities of CYP3A5 gene and cell cycle characteristics were observed in K562 and NB4 cells, which represented cell lines with or without CYP3A5 gene transcription respectively. In comparison with NB4 cells, K562 cells expressed CYP3A5 protein and showed a statistically significant higher CYP3A5 activity (3.075 +/- 0.036) x 10(-3) versus (1.635 +/- 0.196) x 10(-3), P < 0.05. FCM analysis showed that S phase cell proportions were similar in K562 and NB4 cells. Incubation with DNR (1 mg/L) for 6 hours induced a remarkable apoptosis peak in NB4 cells, while such peak not occur in K562 cells (apoptosis cell percentage 18.4% and 0.8% respectively).

Arthritis induced by CII in env-pX rats was more severe and persisted longer than CIA in WKAH rats.

A severe but transient arthritis was induced by CII in WKAH rats reconstituted by env-pX BMC (w/tB/CII rats). On the other hand, in env-pX rats reconstituted by WKAH BMC, arthritis persisted longer than in w/tB/CII rats, although the degree was less at an early phase after CII immunization. These findings suggest that articular tissues rather than the BMCs carrying the env-pX transgene play a role in the prolongation of arthritis in env-pX rats, although BMCs carrying the transgene are associated with the severity of arthritis.

One of the BALB/c ES cell lines, when injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, produced high rates of chimerism as assessed by coat color, and the male chimera produced germ-line offspring when mated with BALB/c females. These results indicate that ES cells from inbred strains can be isolated using commercially available reagents and that the establishment of BALB/c ES cell lines may require different culture conditions to the 129 or C57BL/6 strains.","['Baharvand, Hossein', 'Matthaei, Klaus Ingo']","['Baharvand H', 'Matthaei KI']","['Department for Biology of Stem Cells and Department of Embryology, Royan Institute, P.O.

Such discharges may be either single-event or repetitive (e.g., 60 Hz). Some studies have indicated that ESDs may be a causative factor for health effects in electric utility workers. Moreover, a hypothesis has recently been forwarded imperceptible contact currents in the human body may be responsible for health effects, most notably childhood leukemia. Numerical modeling indicates that the electric fields in human tissue resulting from typical contact currents are much greater than those induced from typical exposures to electric and magnetic fields at power line frequencies. Numerical modeling is used here to compute representative spark-discharge dosimetry in a realistic human adult model. The frequency-domain scalar potential finite difference method is applied in conjunction with the Fourier transform to assess electric fields in selected regions and tissues of interest in the body.

However, in T cells transformed by the human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), p100 processing is very active, resulting in high level expression of p52. Because overproduction of p52 is associated with lymphoid hyperplasia and transformation, deregulation of p100 processing may be part of the oncogenic mechanism of HTLV-I. We demonstrated previously that HTLV-I Tax oncoprotein is a potent inducer of p100 processing through specific targeting of IKKalpha via IKKgamma to p100 to trigger p100 phosphorylation and ubiquitination. In this study, we further show that Tax-mediated recruitment of IKKalpha to p100 requires serines 866 and 870 of p100, shown to be essential for inducible processing of p100. Upon interaction with p100, activated IKKalpha phosphorylates both N- and C-terminal serines of p100 (serines 99, 108, 115, 123 and 872), serving as a critical step in Tax-induced p100 processing. Using a genetic approach, we find that beta-transducin repeat-containing protein, a component of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, previously shown to be required for physiological p100 processing mediated by nuclear factor-kappaB-inducing kinase, is only partially involved in Tax-induced processing of p100. These results indicate that both beta-transducin repeat-containing protein-dependent and -independent mechanisms contribute to Tax-deregulated p100 processing, further suggesting the involvement of different mechanisms in cellular and viral pathways of p100 processing.","['Qu, Zhaoxia', 'Qing, Guoliang', 'Rabson, Arnold', 'Xiao, Gutian']","['Qu Z', 'Qing G', 'Rabson A', 'Xiao G']","['Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p52 Subunit)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (SKP Cullin F-Box Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Models, Biological', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B p52 Subunit', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'SKP Cullin F-Box Protein Ligases/metabolism', 'Serine/chemistry', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/metabolism']",2004/08/18 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/08/18 05:00'],"['2004/08/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Oct 22;279(43):44563-72. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M403689200.

A review of retroviral pathogenesis and its relevance to retroviral vector-mediated gene delivery.,9,"Retroviral vector-mediated gene transfer has been central to the development of gene therapy. Retroviruses have several distinct advantages over other vectors, especially when permanent gene transfer is the preferred outcome. The most important advantage that retroviral vectors offer is their ability to transform their single stranded RNA genome into a double stranded DNA molecule that stably integrates into the target cell genome. This means that retroviral vectors can be used to permanently modify the host cell nuclear genome. Recently, retroviral vector-mediated gene transfer, as well as the broader gene therapy field, has been re-invigorated with the development of a new class of retroviral vectors which are derived from lentiviruses. These have the unique ability amongst retroviruses of being able to infect non-cycling cells. Vectors derived from lentiviruses have provided a quantum leap in technology and seemingly offer the means to achieve significant levels of gene transfer in vivo.The ability of retroviruses to integrate into the host cell chromosome also raises the possibility of insertional mutagenesis and oncogene activation. Both these phenomena are well known in the interactions of certain types of wild-type retroviruses with their hosts. However, until recently they had not been observed in replication defective retroviral vector-mediated gene transfer, either in animal models or in clinical trials. This has meant the potential disadvantages of retroviral mediated gene therapy have, until recently, been seen as largely, if not entirely, hypothetical. The recent clinical trial of gammac mediated gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) has proven the potential of retroviral mediated gene transfer for the treatment of inherited metabolic disease. However, it has also illustrated the potential dangers involved, with 2 out of 10 patients developing T cell leukemia as a consequence of the treatment. A considered review of retroviral induced pathogenesis suggests these events were qualitatively, if not quantitatively, predictable. In addition, it is clear that the probability of such events can be greatly reduced by relatively simple vector modifications, such as the use of self-inactivating vectors and vectors derived from non-oncogenic retroviruses. However, these approaches remain to be fully developed and validated. This review also suggests that, in all likelihood, there are no other major retroviral pathogenetic mechanisms that are of general relevance to replication defective retroviral vectors. These are important conclusions as they suggest that, by careful design and engineering of retroviral vectors, we can continue to use this gene transfer technology with confidence.","['Anson, Donald S']",['Anson DS'],"[""Department of Genetic Medicine, Women's and Children's Hospital, 4th Floor Rogerson Building, 72 King William Road, North Adelaide, South Australia, 5006, Australia. donald.anson@adelaide.edu.au""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Genet Vaccines Ther,Genetic vaccines and therapy,101178414,,,,2004/08/18 05:00,2004/08/18 05:01,['2004/08/18 05:00'],"['2004/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/18 05:01 [medline]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Genet Vaccines Ther. 2004 Aug 13;2(1):9. doi: 10.1186/1479-0556-2-9.,"['10.1186/1479-0556-2-9 [doi]', '1479-0556-2-9 [pii]']",20040813,,,PMC515179,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The viral Tax protein is considered to play a central role in the process leading to ATL. Tax modulates the expression of many viral and cellular genes through the CREB/ATF-, SRF- and NF-kappaB-associated pathways. In addition, Tax employs the CBP/p300 and p/CAF co-activators for implementing the full transcriptional activation competence of each of these pathways. Tax also affects the function of various other regulatory proteins by direct protein-protein interaction. Through these activities Tax sets the infected T-cells into continuous uncontrolled replication and destabilizes their genome by interfering with the function of telomerase and topoisomerase-I and by inhibiting DNA repair. Furthermore, Tax prevents cell cycle arrest and apoptosis that would otherwise be induced by the unrepaired DNA damage and enables, thereby, accumulation of mutations that can contribute to the leukemogenic process. Together, these capacities render Tax highly oncogenic as reflected by its ability to transform rodent fibroblasts and primary human T-cells and to induce tumors in transgenic mice. In this article we discuss these effects of Tax and their apparent contribution to the HTLV-1 associated leukemogenic process. Notably, however, shortly after infection the virus enters into a latent state, in which viral gene expression is low in most of the HTLV-1 carriers' infected T-cells and so is the level of Tax protein, although rare infected cells may still display high viral RNA. This low Tax level is evidently insufficient for exerting its multiple oncogenic effects. Therefore, we propose that the latent virus must be activated, at least temporarily, in order to elevate Tax to its effective level and that during this transient activation state the infected cells may acquire some oncogenic mutations which can enable them to further progress towards ATL even if the activated virus is re-suppressed after a while. We conclude this review by outlining an hypothetical flow of events from the initial virus infection up to the ultimate ATL development and comment on the risk factors leading to ATL development in some people and to TSP/HAM in others.","['Azran, Inbal', 'Schavinsky-Khrapunsky, Yana', 'Aboud, Mordechai']","['Azran I', 'Schavinsky-Khrapunsky Y', 'Aboud M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Cancer Research Center, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben Gurion University of The Negev, Beer Sheva 84105, Israel. azron@bgumail.bgu.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology', 'CREB-Binding Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Genome, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/*virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/immunology/virology']",2004/08/18 05:00,2006/08/01 09:00,['2004/08/18 05:00'],"['2004/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2004 Aug 13;1:20. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-1-20.,"['10.1186/1742-4690-1-20 [doi]', '1742-4690-1-20 [pii]']",20040813,,252,PMC514576,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The Registry of Cancer in Children, started in 1996 in the IMSS-MC, is an on-going, prospective register. The data from 1996 through 2001 were analyzed and the different types of cancer were grouped according to the International Classification for Cancer in Children (ICCC). From this analysis, the general and specific frequencies by age and by sex were obtained for the different groups of neoplasms. Also, the frequency of the stage of the disease that had been diagnosed in cases of children with solid tumors was obtained. RESULTS: A total of 1,702 new cases of children with cancer were registered, with the male/female ratio at 1.1/1. Leukemias had the highest frequency with 784 cases (46.1%) and, of these, acute lymphoblastic leukemias were the most prevalent with 614 cases (78.3%). Thereafter, in descending order of frequency, were tumors of the central nervous system (CNST) with 197 cases (11.6%), lymphomas with 194 cases (11.4%), germinal cell tumors with 110 cases (6.5%), and bone tumors with 97 cases (5.7%). The highest frequency of cancer was found in the group of one to four year-olds that had 627 cases (36.8%). In all the age groups, leukemias were the most frequent. In the present work, the frequency of Hodgkin's disease (~4%) was found to be lower than that (~10%) in previous studies and the frequency of tumors of the sympathetic nervous system was low (2.3%). Of those cases of solid tumors for which the stage of the disease had been determined, 66.9% were diagnosed as being Stage III or IV. CONCLUSIONS: The principal cancers in the children treated in the IMSS-MC were leukemias, CNST, and lymphomas, consistent with those reported by developed countries. A 2.5-fold reduction in the frequency of Hodgkin's disease was found. Of the children, the stage of whose disease had been determined, two thirds were diagnosed as having advanced stages of the disease.","['Juarez-Ocana, Servando', 'Gonzalez-Miranda, Guadalupe', 'Mejia-Arangure, Juan Manuel', 'Rendon-Macias, Mario Enrique', 'Martinez-Garcia, Maria del Carmen', 'Fajardo-Gutierrez, Arturo']","['Juarez-Ocana S', 'Gonzalez-Miranda G', 'Mejia-Arangure JM', 'Rendon-Macias ME', 'Martinez-Garcia Mdel C', 'Fajardo-Gutierrez A']","['Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Epidemiologia Clinica, Hospital de Pediatria, Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico. rocla04182000@yahoo.com.mx']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Bone Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Germinoma/epidemiology', 'Hospitals/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms/*classification/*epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Registries', 'Sex Distribution']",2004/08/18 05:00,2004/11/13 09:00,['2004/08/18 05:00'],"['2004/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [entrez]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2004 Aug 13;4:50. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-4-50.,"['10.1186/1471-2407-4-50 [doi]', '1471-2407-4-50 [pii]']",20040813,,,PMC514610,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) the frequency of hMLH1 and MGMT promoter methylation is not yet fully elucidated. To determine the methylation status and expression of hMLH1 and MGMT, we investigated 22 AML cases by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). To exclude unspecific PCR amplifications DNA sequencing was performed. hMLH1 promoter methylation was detectable in 4 of 20 AML cases. However, DNA sequencing could only confirm a methylated hMLH1 promoter in one case. mRNA expression was absent in one case and reduced in another. However, these cases did not display aberrant promoter methylation. In contrast, MGMT promoter methylation was not detectable in the investigated AML patient samples. Accordingly, MGMT mRNA expression was found to be normal in all but one case. Aberrant promoter methylation of hMLH1 was detectable only in a small number of AML cases. Additionally, in two cases the promoter methylation detected by MS-PCR could not be confirmed by sequencing, clearly indicating the importance of controlling MS-PCR results by the more specific sequence analysis. Surprisingly, hMLH1 promoter methylation was not associated with gene silencing, suggesting monoallelic methylation or promoter methylation only in a small subpopulation of malignant cells. The reduced mRNA expression in additional samples may indicate an involvement of hMLH1 in the malignant transformation in a small subset of cases. In contrast, MGMT does not seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of AML.","['Lenz, Georg', 'Hutter, Grit', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Dreyling, Martin']","['Lenz G', 'Hutter G', 'Hiddemann W', 'Dreyling M']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Grosshadern Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich, Germany. georg.lenz@med3.med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (MLH1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutL Protein Homolog 1)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Pair Mismatch', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'MutL Protein Homolog 1', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",2004/08/17 10:00,2004/11/04 09:00,['2004/08/17 10:00'],"['2004/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2004/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2004 Oct;83(10):628-33. doi: 10.1007/s00277-004-0925-0.

However, their mechanisms of action are not fully understood. Therefore, we investigated the mechanisms of lymphoma and CLL cell killing by two anti-CD20 antibodies (rituximab, B1) and by alemtuzumab. All antibodies induced complement-independent cell death in B-lymphoid cell lines Raji, Ramos, and Mec-1. The efficiency of cell killing was increased by the addition of human complement in Raji but not Ramos cells. Both alemtuzumab and rituximab also killed freshly isolated CLL cells, with a much stronger response for alemtuzumab (from eight of eight patients) compared to rituximab (from two of six patients). Cell morphology and Western blot analyses revealed that the antibody-induced cell death lacked some typical features of apoptosis such as chromatin condensation or poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Taken together, the results suggest that the tumor killing activity of these MoAbs is not only mediated by complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CDC) or antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC), but also by a nonclassic, caspase-independent apoptotic pathway.","['Stanglmaier, Michael', 'Reis, Simone', 'Hallek, Michael']","['Stanglmaier M', 'Reis S', 'Hallek M']","['Clinical Cooperation Group for Gene Therapy, GSF--National Institute of Health and Environment, Marchioninistr. 25, 81377, Munich, Germany. m.stanglmaier@gmx.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Caspases/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Rituximab', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology']",2004/08/17 10:00,2004/11/04 09:00,['2004/08/17 10:00'],"['2003/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2004/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2004 Oct;83(10):634-45. doi: 10.1007/s00277-004-0917-0.

An example is provided by chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, most of which carry a translocation involving the ABL gene on chromosome 9 and the BCR gene on chromosome 22. The hypothesis of a causal relationship between CML and the chimeric protein product of the BCR-ABL translocation has recently received strong support. In this framework, a mechanistic model and Monte-Carlo code simulating radiation-induced chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes will be presented. The current version of the model can predict dose-response curves for the main aberration types following acute irradiation with gamma rays and light ions of different energies. The model is based on the assumption that only clustered DNA lesions can lead to aberrations and that only lesion free ends in neighbouring chromosome territories can join and form exchanges. Such lesions are distributed within the cell nucleus according to the radiation track structure, i.e. randomly for low-LET radiation and along straight lines for high-LET light ions. Interphase chromosome territories are explicitly simulated and background aberrations are taken into account. Very good agreement was found with experimental data taken from the literature that provided a further validation of the model. As an application, yields of BCR-ABL translocations were calculated. Preliminary results led to a CML induction dose-response that is approximately quadratic below 0.1 Gy and essentially linear at higher doses up to 1 Gy. The numerical values obtained for the probability of CML induction are consistent with values obtained by other groups with different approaches.","['Ballarini, Francesca', 'Ottolenghi, Andrea']","['Ballarini F', 'Ottolenghi A']","['Universita degli Studi di Pavia, Dipartimento di Fisica Nucleare e Teorica, INFN-Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, via Bassi 6, 27100, Pavia, Italy. francesca.ballarini@mi.infn.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*radiation effects', 'Chromosomes/*genetics/*radiation effects', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*etiology/*genetics', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiometry/*methods', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Risk Factors']",2004/08/17 10:00,2005/03/16 09:00,['2004/08/17 10:00'],"['2004/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2004 Sep;43(3):165-71. doi: 10.1007/s00411-004-0246-7.

Primary chondrocyte cultures were obtained from human knee osteoarthritis cartilages. First passage chondrocytes were treated with TNF-alpha and various potentiators, and cell death was measured with MTT assay. C-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) activation was investigated with the solid phase kinase assay. Expression of apoptosis-related molecule was assayed with Western blot. Chondrocytes were resistant to TNF-alpha-induced cell death. In contrast, pretreatment with actinomycin D, the phosphatase inhibitor vanadate or MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) inhibitor Ro318220 invariably led to chondrocyte death. While TNF-alpha alone stimulated a single, brief JNK activity, a second JNK peak was observed when the cells were pretreated with actinomycin D. When the cells were pretreated with vanadate or Ro318220, TNF-alpha-induced JNK activation was greatly prolonged, which was associated with the induction of cell death. The expression of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 decreased significantly in conditions of cell death. In conclusions, our data suggest that chondrocyte death induced by TNF-alpha is associated with sustained JNK activation. This effect may be due to downregulation of TNF-alpha induced phosphatase that inactivates JNK and of Bcl-2 family proteins.","['Yoon, Ho Sung', 'Kim, Hyun Ah']","['Yoon HS', 'Kim HA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Anyang, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),J Korean Med Sci,Journal of Korean medical science,8703518,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Death/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chondrocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",2004/08/17 10:00,2005/08/05 09:00,['2004/08/17 10:00'],"['2004/08/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Korean Med Sci. 2004 Aug;19(4):567-73. doi: 10.3346/jkms.2004.19.4.567.,"['200408567 [pii]', '10.3346/jkms.2004.19.4.567 [doi]']",,,,PMC2816892,,['Copyright The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To facilitate its pharmacological characterization, we screened a compound library and identified a substituted quinazolinone (Quin-C1, 4-butoxy-N-[2-(4-methoxy-phenyl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl]-benzamide) as a ligand for FPRL1. Quin-C1 induces chemotaxis and secretion of beta-glucuronidase in peripheral blood neutrophils with a potency of approximately 1/1000 of that of the peptide agonist WKYMVm. In studies using transfected rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cell lines expressing either formyl peptide receptor or FPRL1, Quin-C1 induced enzyme release from RBL-FPRL1 but not RBL-FPR cells. Likewise, Quin-C1 selectively stimulates calcium mobilization in RBL-FPRL1 cells, a response that was markedly inhibited by pertussis toxin. Quin-C1 also stimulates phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 and induces internalization of an FPRL1 fused to green fluorescent protein. In degranulation assays, both the FPRL1-selective peptide agonist MMK1 and Quin-C1 exhibited lower efficacy and potency than WKYMVm, with EC(50) values of 7.17 x 10(-8) M and 1.88 x 10(-6) M, respectively, compared with the EC(50) value for WKYMVm (2.29 x 10(-8) M).

Human leukemia cell line ML-1 was exposed for 1 h to melphalan or its monofunctional derivative monohydroxymelphalan. Levels of DNA adducts, measured by specific immunoassay, were linearly related to the concentration of alkylating agent. Monohydroxymelphalan formed twice as many adducts as did equal concentrations of melphalan. After the removal of the alkylating agent, adduct levels were maintained or increased slightly up to 8 h and then decreased by 27 to 44% by 24 h. Alkaline elution analyses confirmed the absence of detectable DNA interstrand cross-links in cells exposed to monohydroxymelphalan. DNA single-strand breaks were detected after monohydroxymelphalan but not after melphalan. Levels of p53 were quantified by sensitive fluorogenic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at intervals up to 24 h after exposure of cells to various concentrations of melphalan and monohydroxymelphalan. The level of initially formed DNA adducts needed to cause elevation of p53 from a baseline level of 0.5 ng/mg total protein to 2 ng/mg was 5- to 8-fold higher for monohydroxymelphalan than melphalan. The concentrations of melphalan and monohydroxymelphalan (+/-S.D.) causing 50% growth inhibition were 1.2 +/- 0.4 and 28.1 +/- 1.6 microg/ml, respectively, a 23-fold difference. The adduct levels induced by these exposures were 9.3 and 420 nmol/g DNA for melphalan and monohydroxymelphalan, respectively, a 45-fold difference, which is considerably greater than the difference in efficacy at elevating p53.","['Gould, Katherine A', 'Nixon, Cally', 'Tilby, Michael J']","['Gould KA', 'Nixon C', 'Tilby MJ']","[""Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Paul O'Gorman Building, Medical School, University of Newcastle, Framlington Place, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4HH, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'ESL4D945VL (monohydroxymelphalan)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Adducts/*metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Melphalan/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",2004/08/17 10:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/08/17 10:00'],"['2004/08/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2004 Nov;66(5):1301-9. doi: 10.1124/mol.104.000596.

Each lentiviral integrase localized to cell nuclei in close association with chromatin while the murine oncoretroviral integrase was cytoplasmic. Fusions of pyruvate kinase to the lentiviral integrases did not reveal transferable nuclear localization signals. The intracellular trafficking of each was determined instead by the transcriptional coactivator LEDGF/p75, which was required for nuclear localization. Stable small interfering RNA expression eliminated detectable LEDGF/p75 expression and caused dramatic, stable redistribution of each lentiviral integrase from nucleus to cytoplasm while the distribution of MoMLV integrase was unaffected. In addition, endogenous LEDGF/p75 coimmunoprecipitated specifically with each lentiviral integrase. In vitro integration assays with preintegration complexes (PICs) showed that endogenous LEDGF/p75 is a component of functional HIV-1 and FIV PICs. However, HIV-1 and FIV infection and replication in LEDGF/p75-deficient cells was equivalent to that in control cells, whether cells were dividing or growth arrested. Two-long terminal repeat circle accumulation in nondividing cell nuclei was also equivalent to that of LEDGF/p75 wild-type cells. Virions produced in LEDGF/p75-deficient cells had normal infectivity. We conclude that LEDGF/p75 fully accounts for cellular trafficking of diverse lentiviral, but not oncoretroviral, integrases and is the main lentiviral integrase-to-chromatin tethering factor. While lentiviral PIC nuclear import is unaffected by LEDGF/p75 knockdown, this protein is a component of functional lentiviral PICs.

This is concordant with its localization adjacent to promyelocytic leukemia oncogenic domains (PODs) immediately after infection. In a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified the tegument protein ppUL35 as an interacting partner of ppUL82. The interaction could be confirmed in transfected and infected cells. The domain responsible for interaction was narrowed down to amino acids 447 to 516 within ppUL35, thus allowing both forms of ppUL35 to interact with ppUL82. Immunofluorescence experiments showed a relocalization of ppUL35 from a diffuse nuclear pattern when expressed alone to PODs when expressed together with ppUL82. In accordance with this observation and the role of ppUL82 as a transactivator, we observed a cooperative activation of the HCMV major immediate-early enhancer but not of heterologous viral enhancer elements. These results suggest an important role for this interaction in the stimulation of viral immediate-early gene expression and viral infection.","['Schierling, Karina', 'Stamminger, Thomas', 'Mertens, Thomas', 'Winkler, Michael']","['Schierling K', 'Stamminger T', 'Mertens T', 'Winkler M']","['Abteilung Virologie, Universitatsklinikum Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (immediate-early proteins, cytomegalovirus)']",IM,"['Antigens, Viral/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cytomegalovirus/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*genetics', 'Fibroblasts', 'Genes, Viral/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*genetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2004/08/17 10:00,2004/09/17 05:00,['2004/08/17 10:00'],"['2004/08/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Sep;78(17):9512-23. doi: 10.1128/JVI.78.17.9512-9523.2004.,"['10.1128/JVI.78.17.9512-9523.2004 [doi]', '78/17/9512 [pii]']",,,,PMC506970,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interferon increases the size and number of PML nuclear bodies and stimulates transcription of several genes encoding PML nuclear body proteins. Moreover, some PML nuclear body proteins colocalize at sites of viral DNA synthesis and transcription. In this study, the relationship between lytic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) replication and Sp110b, a PML nuclear body protein, was investigated. Sp110b is shown to physically and functionally interact with the EBV protein SM. SM is expressed early in the EBV replicative cycle and posttranscriptionally increases the level of target EBV lytic transcripts. SM bound to Sp110b via two distinct sites in Sp110b in an RNA-independent manner. SM also specifically induced expression of Sp110b during lytic EBV replication and in several cell types. Exogenous expression of Sp110b synergistically enhanced SM-mediated accumulation of intronless and lytic viral transcripts. This synergistic effect was shown to be promoter independent, posttranscriptional, and the result of increased stabilization of target transcripts. Finally, inhibiting Sp110b expression decreased accumulation of an SM-responsive lytic EBV transcript in EBV-infected cells. These findings imply that SM induces Sp110b expression, binds to Sp110b, and utilizes the recruited Sp110b protein to increase the stability of lytic EBV transcripts, indicating that Sp110b is a component of the cellular machinery that EBV utilizes to enhance lytic EBV replication.","['Nicewonger, John', 'Suck, Garnet', 'Bloch, Donald', 'Swaminathan, Sankar']","['Nicewonger J', 'Suck G', 'Bloch D', 'Swaminathan S']","['Shands Cancer Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32610-0232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (SM protein, Human herpesvirus 4)', '0 (Sp110 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/metabolism/virology', 'Cell Line', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism/virology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Half-Life', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', '*RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/*metabolism', 'Stomach', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism', 'Virus Activation/*genetics', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",2004/08/17 10:00,2004/09/17 05:00,['2004/08/17 10:00'],"['2004/08/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Sep;78(17):9412-22. doi: 10.1128/JVI.78.17.9412-9422.2004.,"['10.1128/JVI.78.17.9412-9422.2004 [doi]', '78/17/9412 [pii]']",,"['CA811333/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK051179/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC506926,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that two adjacent amino acid mutations (G212R and I213T), located in a previously functionally uncharacterized segment of the surface subunit, are responsible for the restricted tropism of the SL3-2 wild-type envelope. By selection from a two-codon library, several hydrophobic amino acids at these positions were found to enable the SL3-2 envelope to infect human TE 671 cells. In particular, an M212/V213 mutant had a titer at least 6 orders of magnitude higher than that of the wild-type envelope for human TE 671 cells and infected human, mink, and murine cells with equal efficiencies. Notably, these two amino acids are not found at homologous positions in known murine leukemia virus isolates.

Partial deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of S dramatically increased infectivity of pseudotypes, with titers only two- to threefold lower than those of pseudotypes generated in parallel with the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein. S-pseudotyped MLV particles were used to analyze viral tropism. MLV(SARS) pseudotypes and wild-type SARS CoV displayed similar cell types and tissue and host restrictions, indicating that the expression of a functional receptor is the major restraint in permissiveness to SARS CoV infection.

The Tgat cDNA encoded a protein product consisting of the Rho-guanosine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain of a multifunctional protein, TRIO, and a unique C-terminal 15-amino acid sequence, which were derived from the exons 38-46 of the Trio gene and a novel exon located downstream of its last exon (exon 58), respectively. A Tgat mutant cDNA lacking the C-terminal coding region preserved Rho-GEF activity but lost the transforming potential, indicating an indispensable role of the unique sequence. On the other hand, treatment of Tgat-transformed NIH3T3 cells with Y-27632, a pharmacological inhibitor of Rho-associated kinase, abrogated their transforming phenotypes, suggesting the coinvolvement of Rho-GEF activity. Thus, alternative RNA splicing, resulting in the fusion protein with the Rho-GEF domain and the unique 15 amino acids, is the mechanism generating the novel oncogene, Tgat.","['Yoshizuka, Naoto', 'Moriuchi, Ryozo', 'Mori, Tsuyoshi', 'Yamada, Kenji', 'Hasegawa, Sumitaka', 'Maeda, Takahiro', 'Shimada, Takako', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Kamihira, Shimeru', 'Tomonaga, Masao', 'Katamine, Shigeru']","['Yoshizuka N', 'Moriuchi R', 'Mori T', 'Yamada K', 'Hasegawa S', 'Maeda T', 'Shimada T', 'Yamada Y', 'Kamihira S', 'Tomonaga M', 'Katamine S']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology & Immunology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-12-4 Sakamoto, 852-8523, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TRIO protein, human)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/genetics', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology', 'Oncogenes', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",2004/08/17 10:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/08/17 10:00'],"['2004/08/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Oct 15;279(42):43998-4004. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M406082200.

In this study, we have identified the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) as a novel retinoid-responsive gene using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based cDNA subtraction method. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induced a biphasic expression of CHOP mRNA in the NB4 and HL60 AML cell lines. Levels of CHOP expression increased within 1 hour of exposure to ATRA. ATRA expression became nearly absent between 6 and 24 hours, and a second phase of induction occurred after 48 hours. Retinoid-dependent regulation of CHOP expression was also observed in normal human neutrophils but not in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In addition, retinoid-dependent regulation of CHOP expression was not observed in retinoid-nonresponsive cell lines HL60R and NB4-R2. CHOP expression was regulated at the transcriptional level and was independent of new protein synthesis. CHOP heterodimerized with C/EBPepsilon and negatively regulated the myeloid-specific gene lactoferrin. Furthermore, CHOP transcriptionally inhibited C/EBPalpha- and C/EBPepsilon-dependent induction of secondary granule gene expression.

BCR-ABL-induced acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia was also eradicated by DLI in major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched chimeras.

When MHC-matched B10.D2 (H-2(d)) mice were the allogeneic donors, CML-like disease was more resistant to DLI.

In this study we investigated whether 7-OHMTX itself can provoke anti-folate resistance that may further disrupt MTX efficacy. For this purpose, we developed resistance to 7-OHMTX as well as MTX in 2 human leukemia cell lines (CCRF-CEM and MOLT-4) by stepwise exposure to increasing concentrations of 7-OHMTX and MTX. Consequently, both leukemia cell lines displayed marked levels of resistance to 7-OHMTX (> 10-fold) and MTX (> 75-fold). The underlying mechanism of resistance in the MTX-exposed cells was a marked decrease (> 10-fold) in reduced folate carrier (RFC)-mediated cellular uptake of MTX. This was associated with transcriptional silencing of the RFC gene in MTX-resistant CCRF-CEM cells. In contrast, the molecular basis for the resistance to 7-OHMTX was due solely to a marked decreased (> 95%) in folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) activity, which conferred more than 100-fold MTX resistance upon a short-term exposure to this drug. This is the first demonstration that 7-OHMTX can provoke distinct modalities of antifolate resistance compared with the parent drug MTX. The implications of this finding for MTX efficacy and strategies to circumvent MTX resistance are discussed.","['Fotoohi, Kambiz', 'Jansen, Gerrit', 'Assaraf, Yehuda G', 'Rothem, Lilah', 'Stark, Michal', 'Kathmann, Ietje', 'Gregorczyk, Jacek', 'Peters, Godefridus J', 'Albertioni, Freidoun']","['Fotoohi K', 'Jansen G', 'Assaraf YG', 'Rothem L', 'Stark M', 'Kathmann I', 'Gregorczyk J', 'Peters GJ', 'Albertioni F']","['Department of Oncology and Pathology, Cancer Center Karolinska (CCK), Karolinska University Hospital, 171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', 'X019Z9S1DL (7-hydroxymethotrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Glutamine/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology']",2004/08/17 10:00,2005/03/25 09:00,['2004/08/17 10:00'],"['2004/08/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Dec 15;104(13):4194-201. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-04-1493.

In this report, we investigate the potential role of PLSCR1 in leukemic cell differentiation. We show that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an effective differentiation-inducing agent of acute promyelocytic leukemic (APL) cells, can elevate PLSCR1 expression in ATRA-sensitive APL cells NB4 and HL60, but not in maturation-resistant NB4-LR1 cells. ATRA- and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced monocytic differentiation is accompanied by increased PLSCR1 expression, whereas only a slight or no elevation of PLSCR1 expression is observed in U937 cells differentiated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), sodium butyrate, or vitamin D3. Cell differentiation with ATRA and PMA, but not with vitamin D3 or DMSO, results in phosphorylation of protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta), and the PKCdelta-specific inhibitor rottlerin nearly eliminates the ATRA- and PMA-induced expression of PLSCR1, while ectopic expression of a constitutively active form of PKCdelta directly increases PLSCR1 expression. Finally, decreasing PLSCR1 expression with small interfering RNA inhibits ATRA/PMA-induced differentiation. Taken together, these results suggest that as a protein induced upon PKCdelta activation, PLSCR1 is required for ATRA- and PMA-triggered leukemic cell differentiation.","['Zhao, Ke-Wen', 'Li, Xi', 'Zhao, Qian', 'Huang, Ying', 'Li, Dong', 'Peng, Zhen-Gang', 'Shen, Wu-Zhong', 'Zhao, Ji', 'Zhou, Quansheng', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Sims, Peter J', 'Wiedmer, Therese', 'Chen, Guo-Qiang']","['Zhao KW', 'Li X', 'Zhao Q', 'Huang Y', 'Li D', 'Peng ZG', 'Shen WZ', 'Zhao J', 'Zhou Q', 'Chen Z', 'Sims PJ', 'Wiedmer T', 'Chen GQ']","['Health Science Center, Shanghai Second Medical University, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences and Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phospholipid Transfer Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCD protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phospholipid Transfer Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-delta', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2004/08/17 10:00,2004/12/31 09:00,['2004/08/17 10:00'],"['2004/08/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/31 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Dec 1;104(12):3731-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-04-1630.

Blood arsenic concentration was measured and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was simultaneously performed before treatment and after remission in the induction group, and before and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 courses after the treatment in the maintenance therapy group. QT interval on each ECG was measured and corrected by the Bazett formula. RESULTS: Oral administration of As4S4 could lead to the prolongation of QTc both in remission induction and maintenance therapy groups. QTc prolongation was related to the doses of As4S4 and blood arsenic levels. QTc prolongation and its variation range were increased with accumulative doses of As4S4 and the blood arsenic levels. In ten courses maintenance therapy patients, the average abnormal rate of QTc was 37.7%. Blood arsenic concentration was increased slowly with courses, but the variation had no statistical difference (P > 0.05).

METHODS: 193 newly diagnosed APL patients received CCA in our hospital, 32 cases of whom were carried out FISH analysis, and some of the patients received reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection. RESULTS: 132 of 193 (68.4%) cases were identified to have t(15;17) (q22;q12) by CCA. The selected 32 patients were divided into three groups according to CAA results: group 1 included 14 cases with typical t(15;17), group 2 included 13 cases without t(15;17), and group 3 included five cases with complex karyotype involving chromosomes 15 and 17. As expected, all cases in group 1 were detected PML/RAR alpha fusion by FISH. In group 2, all patients presented the same molecular abnormality by FISH in spite of absence of t(15;17), and in group 3, FISH not only detected PML/RAR alpha fusion but also identified the fusion signals located on chromosomes, other than chromosome 15q. CONCLUSION: All the APL with typical clinical characteristics can be detected PML/RAR alpha fusion by FISH or RT-PCR regardless of classical t(15;17). FISH is more sensitive for molecularly diagnosis of APL, and can identify the precise location of the fusion signals in complex karyotype. It is necessary in clinically APL patients with no or atypical chromosomal abnormalities to perform FISH analysis.","['Li, Cheng-Wen', 'Liu, Shi-He', 'Bo, Li-Jin', 'Qin, Shuang', 'Liu, Xu-Ping', 'Dai, Yun', 'Wang, Jian-Xiang']","['Li CW', 'Liu SH', 'Bo LJ', 'Qin S', 'Liu XP', 'Dai Y', 'Wang JX']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2004/08/17 10:00,2009/05/08 09:00,['2004/08/17 10:00'],"['2004/08/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2004 Jun;25(6):346-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: K562 cells were cultured in gradually increased concentrations of imatinib over a period of several months to generate their resistance line. MTT assay, RT-PCR, Western blotting, and FISH were used to study the possible molecular mechanisms of the resistance. RESULTS: A resistant cell line, K562/G01, was established with 15.2 +/- 3.0-fold resistant to imatinib as compared with that of the parental sensitive cell line. The resistant cell line also had the cross-resistance to a broad spectrum of other anticancer agents excepting for DOX. There was no difference between the two cell lines in terms of the cell morphology, proliferation doubling time, and fraction distribution of cell cycle. K562/G01 cells showed increased levels of BCR/ABL, mdr1 mRNA and their coding proteins and the increased tyrosine kinase activity. No point mutation in the BCR/ABL ATP-binding site was detected while the copies of BCR/ABL fusion gene were increased in K562/G01 cells.

METHODS: Thirty patients with CGL in accelerated phase were orally administered with imatinib 400 or 600 mg daily for 7 approximately 9 months. RESULTS: Hematological responses occurred in 28 of 30 patients (93.3%) in the treatment: 14 (46.7%) had a complete hematological response, 10 (33.3%) had a marrow response, and 4 (13.3%) returned to chronic phase. Bone pain and splenomegaly disappeared soon after the administration of imatinib. Eight patients relapsed 30 approximately 172 days after hematological responses. Six of them received imatinib with daily dose increment to 800 mg. Four of these 6 patients had no response and 2 returned to chronic phase again. The risk factors for relapse were blasts > or = 15% in bone marrow or in peripheral blood, extramedullary leukemia involvement, hemoglobin < 100 g/L before the administration of imatinib, and lack of a complete hematological response after the treatment.

A range of cytogenetic and molecular genetic abnormalities has been recognized, including both those seen in other myeloid malignancies (such as trisomy 8, monosomy 7, and 20q-) and those that are particularly linked to eosinophil differentiation (such as rearrangements of PDGFRB, FGFR1, and PDGFRA, the latter with formation of a FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene). The discovery of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene has led to the recognition that many patients who would previously have been regarded as having idiopathic hypereosinophilia actually have chronic eosinophilic leukemia.

The present study demonstrates that, in the two acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell lines NB4 and KG1, exhibiting distinct responsiveness to retinoic acids (RAs), IEX-1 expression is rapidly (30-60 min) induced by all-trans- or cis-RA and independently of other signal transduction mediators, such as TNFalpha, NF-kappaB or MAP kinases. In NB4 cells (expressing PML-RARalpha), this increase is transient and completely reversible, along with a cell cycle arrest, ongoing differentiation and lower sensitivity to anti-cancer-drug-induced apoptosis. In contrast, the RA-induced IEX-1 expression in KG1 cells (expressing PLZF-RARalpha) persists over days, along with continued cell cycle progression and increased apoptotic sensitivity. Furthermore, two functional RA-response elements in the IEX-1 promoter were identified by gel shift and luciferase reporter gene assays. IEX-1 might be a rather unique transcriptional target of the two X-RARalpha fusion receptors exhibiting distinct responsiveness to RAs. Following a different time course of direct transcriptional induction by PML-RARalpha and PLZF-RARalpha in NB4 and KG1 cells, respectively, IEX-1 expression may be involved in the modified actions of these receptors and the distinct phenotypes of APL cells.","['Arlt, A', 'Minkenberg, J', 'Kocs, B', 'Grossmann, M', 'Kruse, M-L', 'Folsch, U R', 'Schafer, H']","['Arlt A', 'Minkenberg J', 'Kocs B', 'Grossmann M', 'Kruse ML', 'Folsch UR', 'Schafer H']","['Division of Molecular Gastroenterology & Hepatology, 1st Department of Medicine, Christian-Albrechts-University, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (IER3 protein, human)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein, human)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/08/13 05:00,2004/11/02 09:00,['2004/08/13 05:00'],"['2004/08/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/13 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Oct;18(10):1646-55. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403481.,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2403481 [doi]', '2403481 [pii]']",,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2006 Sep;20(9):1651'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Autonomous production of IL-1beta by AML blasts is linked with a proliferative response, although its role in survival and hence apoptosis-resistance has not been examined in this disease. Cells that secreted more than 19.7 pg/ml IL-1beta were significantly more resistant to spontaneous apoptosis in 48-h culture than those that produced less than 19.7 pg/ml IL-1beta (P=0.008). Exogenous rhIL-1beta significantly enhanced 48-h survival in 25/29 blast cell samples (P=0.0001). IL-1 receptor ligation is known to activate at least three survival pathways: those mediated by PI-3 kinase, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) and ceramidase. In apoptosis-sensitive AML blasts with a strong survival response to rhIL-1beta, inhibitors of all three pathways down-modulated an IL-1beta-mediated increase in blast survival, but only the inhibition of all three pathways totally eliminated viable blasts. In apoptosis-resistant and apoptosis-sensitive primary AML samples, the three inhibitors all increased apoptosis in vitro after 48 h. Exogenous rhIL-1beta induced the hyperphosphorylation of Bcl-2. It also increased the activation of NF-kappaB in 5/15 blast samples. IL-1beta-mediated survival pathways may be a factor in apoptosis-resistance in primary AML blasts, and may therefore contribute to chemoresistance.","['Turzanski, J', 'Grundy, M', 'Russell, N H', 'Pallis, M']","['Turzanski J', 'Grundy M', 'Russell NH', 'Pallis M']","['Division of Haematology, University of Nottingham and Nottingham City Hospital, Nottingham, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.23 (Ceramidases)']",IM,"['Amidohydrolases/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Ceramidases', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/08/13 05:00,2004/11/02 09:00,['2004/08/13 05:00'],"['2004/08/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/13 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Oct;18(10):1662-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403457.,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2403457 [doi]', '2403457 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In normal mouse hematopoietic stem cells, the process of self-renewal involves the beta-catenin-signaling pathway. We investigated whether leukemic stem cells in CML also use the beta-catenin pathway for self-renewal. METHODS: We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate hematopoietic stem cells, common myeloid progenitors, granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors from marrow during several phases of CML and from normal marrow. BCR-ABL, beta-catenin, and LEF-1 transcripts were compared by means of a quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay in normal and CML hematopoietic stem cells and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors. Confocal fluorescence microscopy and a lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor reporter assay were used to detect nuclear beta-catenin in these cells. In vitro replating assays were used to identify self-renewing cells as candidate leukemic stem cells, and the dependence of self-renewal on beta-catenin activation was tested by lentiviral transduction of hematopoietic progenitors with axin, an inhibitor of the beta-catenin pathway. RESULTS: The granulocyte-macrophage progenitor pool from patients with CML in blast crisis and imatinib-resistant CML was expanded, expressed BCR-ABL, and had elevated levels of nuclear beta-catenin as compared with the levels in progenitors from normal marrow. Unlike normal granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, CML granulocyte-macrophage progenitors formed self-renewing, replatable myeloid colonies, and in vitro self-renewal capacity was reduced by enforced expression of axin.

A family history of CRC increases an individual's risk of developing CRC. Family history has been suggested to have a greater impact on proximal than distal tumours. AIM: We estimated the familial risk of CRC and other cancers, and examined how risk varies according to localisation of the tumour in the colorectal tract. SUBJECTS: We recorded all cases of CRC diagnosed between 1993 and 1998 in the region served by the Calvados Cancer Registry. A trained interviewer asked all participants about their family history of cancer. STATISTICAL METHODS: Familial risk was estimated from a cohort analysis of the relatives of the CRC cases. The expected numbers of cancers were calculated from Calvados incidence rates. Familial relative risks were calculated using standardised incidence ratios. RESULTS: Our findings showed that colon cancer had a stronger familial/genetic component (relative risk (RR) 1.47) than rectal cancer (RR 0.98). The familial/genetic component appeared stronger for proximal colon cancer than for distal colon cancer only among women (RR 2.24 v RR 1.45). CRC appeared to be positively associated with leukaemia (RR 1.77), stomach cancer (RR 1.32), and testicular cancer (RR 3.13), and negatively associated with urinary bladder cancer (RR 0.57) within families. The cancer spectrum associated with CRC among younger participants included prostate (RR 1.93), uterus (RR 2.49), and thyroid (RR 3.85) cancers. CONCLUSION: If our results are confirmed, follow up guidelines for patients with a family history of CRC should depend on the sex and tumour site of affected relatives to avoid needless invasive screening.","['Andrieu, N', 'Launoy, G', 'Guillois, R', 'Ory-Paoletti, C', 'Gignoux, M']","['Andrieu N', 'Launoy G', 'Guillois R', 'Ory-Paoletti C', 'Gignoux M']","[""Inserm Emi 00-06/Service de Biostatistiques, Institut Curie, 26 rue d'Ulm, 75248 Paris Cedex, France. nadine.andrieu@curie.net""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gut,Gut,2985108R,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Colonic Neoplasms/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology/genetics/pathology', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Rectal Neoplasms/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Sex Factors']",2004/08/13 05:00,2004/10/05 09:00,['2004/08/13 05:00'],"['2004/08/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/13 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gut. 2004 Sep;53(9):1322-8. doi: 10.1136/gut.2003.036376.,"['10.1136/gut.2003.036376 [doi]', '53/9/1322 [pii]']",,,,PMC1774179,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beginning with the observation that imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) could elicit rapid and complete hematologic remissions in a proportion of patients with HES, a reverse bedside-to-bench translational research effort led to the discovery of FIP1L1-PDGFRA, a novel fusion gene on chromosome 4q12 whose product is an imatinib-sensitive protein tyrosine kinase. FIP1L1-PDGFRA is the first description of a gain-of-function fusion gene derived from an interstitial chromosomal deletion rather than a reciprocal translocation. Empiric use of imatinib in HES and CEL provides a dramatic example of how the development of targeted therapeutics can provide tremendous insight into the molecular etiology of what appear to be a diverse and otherwise indecipherable collection of diseases. In this review, we discuss the role of imatinib in HES/CEL and other malignancies characterized by constitutively activated tyrosine kinases, and examine molecular features of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion.","['Coutre, Steven', 'Gotlib, Jason']","['Coutre S', 'Gotlib J']","['Division of Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305-5821, USA. coutre@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Corrected and Republished Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Semin Cancer Biol,Seminars in cancer biology,9010218,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Chronic Disease', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*drug therapy', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2004/08/13 05:00,2005/01/12 09:00,['2004/08/13 05:00'],"['2004/08/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/12 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/13 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Cancer Biol. 2004 Aug;14(4):307-15. doi: 10.1016/j.semcancer.2004.03.002.,['10.1016/j.semcancer.2004.03.002 [doi]'],,,78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Semin Cancer Biol. 2004 Feb;14(1):23-31.

The authors studied the incidence of testicular failure in a large series of male patients who underwent SCT using either TBI and a testicular irradiation boost or chemotherapy alone. METHODS: One hundred thirty-one boys with either acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) were treated with SCT with either TBI with testicular boost (n = 94 patients), TBI without testicular boost (n = 1 patient), or chemotherapy alone (n = 36 patients) between 1991 and 1999. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 26.5 months (range, 0.6-99.5 months) from the date of bone marrow infusion. Two patients in the study had a primary testicular failure after TBI with testicular boost followed by an umbilical cord blood transplantation. The first patient had ALL, did not engraft, and was rescued with autologous cells. He developed disease in the testicle 15 months afterward and subsequently died. The second patient had Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL and developed a testicular recurrence 26 months after SCT. He was treated with orchiectomy, further testicular irradiation, and chemotherapy and remained in complete remission > 3 year after his failure. The incidence of testicular failure in boys who received TBI and testicular irradiation who survived > or = 1 year was 4.2%. There were no primary testicular failures reported in boys who received chemotherapy alone. CONCLUSIONS: Boys with AML or ALL had a low incidence of primary testicular failure when they were treated with TBI plus a testicular boost or with chemotherapy alone.","['Quaranta, Brian P', 'Halperin, Edward C', 'Kurtzberg, Joanne', 'Clough, Robert', 'Martin, Paul L']","['Quaranta BP', 'Halperin EC', 'Kurtzberg J', 'Clough R', 'Martin PL']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA. quaranta@radonc.duke.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/*radiotherapy/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*radiotherapy/therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2004/08/12 05:00,2004/08/25 05:00,['2004/08/12 05:00'],"['2004/08/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/12 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2004 Aug 15;101(4):845-50. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20413.,['10.1002/cncr.20413 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to evaluate psychosocial predictors of long-term survival and disease recurrence after patients underwent allogeneic HSCT for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 114 adults were admitted for allogeneic HSCT to the Brigham and Women's Hospital between July, 1997 and January, 2002. The median follow-up was 882 days, and serial measures were taken for mood and substance use 6 months and 12 months posttransplantation. RESULTS: With a 93% participation rate by all potentially eligible patients and with < 3% of patients loss to follow-up, univariate predictors of long-term survival and recurrence were identified. Cox proportional hazards regression models for survival and recurrence were developed. Depressive symptoms, as measured by the most recent Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), increased the risk of death by 7% for each point increase in the BDI score (P = 0.006). Fourteen of 17 patients who developed recurrent disease were cigarette smokers with an average of 22.3 pack-years. For each pack-year of cigarette smoking, the risk of recurrence increased by 1.7% (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study assessed the role of psychosocial variables prospectively among a clinically homogeneous but representative cohort of patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT. Although additional confirmatory studies are pending, it appears that depressive symptoms posttransplantation and cigarette smoking prior to transplantation affect outcomes adversely and may represent opportunities to improve the morbidity and mortality associated with HSCT for patients with CML.","['Chang, Grace', 'Orav, E John', 'McNamara, Tay', 'Tong, Mei-Yee', 'Antin, Joseph H']","['Chang G', 'Orav EJ', 'McNamara T', 'Tong MY', 'Antin JH']","[""Department of Psychiatry, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. gchang@partners.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', '*Depression', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*psychology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', '*Smoking', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/08/12 05:00,2004/08/25 05:00,['2004/08/12 05:00'],"['2004/08/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/12 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2004 Aug 15;101(4):782-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20431.,['10.1002/cncr.20431 [doi]'],,['K24AA00289/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['Copyright 2004 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maytanprine at concentrations of 0.03 nM or more (up to 1 nM) attenuated cell growth with decreasing cell viability and increased the population of shrunken cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Complete inhibition of growth by maytanprine was observed at concentrations of 0.3 nM or more. The compound at 0.03 nM markedly decreased the population at G0G1 phase in the cell cycle, but only slightly decreased that in the G2M phase, suggesting the possibility that it inhibits or delays cell division, and increased the population of cells with hypodiploidal DNA (apoptotic cells). The potency of maytanprine in inhibiting cell growth was greater than that of maytansine, although the inhibitory action of maytanprine was similar to that of maytansine. The results suggest that maytanprine exerts a potent inhibitory action on the growth of human leukemia K562 cells.

However, the gene, which contributes mainly to the leukemogenesis has not yet been identified. Expecting any predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia, we performed a radiation leukemogenensis experiment with Pax6(Sey3H), one of the small eye mutants carrying a congenital hemizygosity of the chromosome 2 middle region. A deletion mapping of Pax6(Sey3H) with 50 STS markers indicated that the deleted segment extended between the 106.00 and 111.47 Mb site from the centromere with a length of 5.47 Mb. In the deleted segment, 6 known and 17 novel genes were located. Pax6(Sey3H) mutants that crossed back into C3H/He did not develop myeloid leukemia spontaneously, but they did when exposed to gamma-rays. The final incidence of myeloid leukemia in mutants (25.8%) was as high as that in normal sibs (21.4%).

To search for a potential tumor suppressor gene in that region, we have delineated the deletions in a panel of these tumors. A commonly deleted region of 2 megabase pairs (Mbp) includes the gene encoding the PU.1 transcription factor, a powerful inducer of granulocytic/monocytic differentiation. Significantly, in 87% of these tumors the remaining PU.1 allele exhibited point mutations in the PU.1 DNA binding domain. Surprisingly, 86% of these mutations altered a single CpG, implicating deamination of deoxycytidine, a common mutational mechanism, as the origin of this lesion. The ""hot spot"" resides in the codon for a contact residue essential for DNA binding by PU.1. In keeping with a tumor suppressor role for PU.1, enforced expression of wild-type PU.1 in the promyelocytic leukemia cells inhibited their clonogenic growth, induced monocytic differentiation, and elicited apoptosis. The mutant PU.1 found in tumors retained only minimal growth suppressive function. The results suggest that PU.1 normally suppresses development of myeloid leukemia by promoting differentiation and that the combination of gene deletion and a point mutation that impairs its ability to bind DNA is particularly leukemogenic.","['Cook, Wendy D', 'McCaw, Benjamin J', 'Herring, Christopher', 'John, Deborah L', 'Foote, Simon J', 'Nutt, Stephen L', 'Adams, Jerry M']","['Cook WD', 'McCaw BJ', 'Herring C', 'John DL', 'Foote SJ', 'Nutt SL', 'Adams JM']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia. wendy.cook@med.monash.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'DNA/metabolism', '*Gene Deletion', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Point Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/chemistry/*genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/physiology']",2004/08/12 05:00,2004/12/31 09:00,['2004/08/12 05:00'],"['2004/08/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/31 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/12 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Dec 1;104(12):3437-44. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-06-2234.

Although the SHM mechanism is largely unknown, it was shown to require the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) gene. AID mRNA is expressed in GC B cells and GC-derived lymphomas, but the pattern of expression of the AID protein is not known. Using 2 specific antibodies, here we show that the AID protein can be detected in GC centroblasts and their transformed counterpart (Burkitt lymphoma) but not in pre-GC B cells and post-GC neoplasms, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma. DLBCLs displayed variable levels of AID expression, which did not correlate with IgV ongoing hypermutation, ASHM, or disease subtype. Finally, both in normal and malignant B cells the AID protein appeared predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. These results indicate that the AID protein is specifically expressed in normal and transformed GC B cells; nonetheless, its predominantly cytoplasmic localization suggests that additional mechanisms may regulate its function and may be altered during lymphomagenesis.","['Pasqualucci, Laura', 'Guglielmino, Roberta', 'Houldsworth, Jane', 'Mohr, Jessica', 'Aoufouchi, Said', 'Polakiewicz, Roberto', 'Chaganti, R S K', 'Dalla-Favera, Riccardo']","['Pasqualucci L', 'Guglielmino R', 'Houldsworth J', 'Mohr J', 'Aoufouchi S', 'Polakiewicz R', 'Chaganti RS', 'Dalla-Favera R']","['Institute for Cancer Genetics, Department of Pathology, Columbia University, 1150 St Nicholas Ave, New York, NY 10032, USA. lp171@columbia.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Antibody Specificity', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/physiopathology', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'Cytoplasm/enzymology', 'Cytosine Deaminase/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*physiopathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*physiopathology', 'Mutation', 'Palatine Tonsil/cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/08/12 05:00,2004/12/24 09:00,['2004/08/12 05:00'],"['2004/08/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/12 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Nov 15;104(10):3318-25. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-04-1558.

To clarify the mechanism of anti-tumor effects by 4-HC, we investigated DNA damage in a human leukemia cell line, HL-60, and its H(2)O(2)-resistant clone HP100. Apoptosis DNA ladder formation was detected in HL-60 cells treated with 4-HC, whereas it was not observed in HP100 cells. 4-HC significantly increased 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) formation, a marker of oxidative DNA damage, in HL-60 cells. On the other hand, CP did not significantly induce 8-oxodG formation and apoptosis in HL-60 cells under the same conditions as did 4-HC. Using (32)P-labeled DNA fragments from the human p53 tumor suppressor gene, 4-HC was found to cause Cu(II)-mediated oxidative DNA damage, but CP did not. Catalase inhibited 4-HC-induced DNA damage, including 8-oxodG formation, suggesting the involvement of H(2)O(2). The generation of H(2)O(2) during 4-HC degradation was ascertained by procedures using scopoletin and potassium iodide. We conclude that, in addition to DNA cross-linking, oxidative DNA damage through H(2)O(2) generation may participate in the anti-tumor effects of 4-HC.","['Murata, Mariko', 'Suzuki, Toshinari', 'Midorikawa, Kaoru', 'Oikawa, Shinji', 'Kawanishi, Shosuke']","['Murata M', 'Suzuki T', 'Midorikawa K', 'Oikawa S', 'Kawanishi S']","['Department of Environmental and Molecular Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', ""88847-89-6 (8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine)"", '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",IM,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"", 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cattle', 'Copper/chemistry', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/pharmacology', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'DNA/chemistry/genetics', '*DNA Damage', 'Deoxyguanosine/*analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Edetic Acid/chemistry', 'Free Radicals', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*chemistry', 'Models, Chemical', 'NAD/chemistry', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2004/08/12 05:00,2005/02/19 09:00,['2004/08/12 05:00'],"['2003/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/06 00:00 [revised]', '2004/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/12 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2004 Sep 15;37(6):793-802. doi: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2004.05.009.,"['10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2004.05.009 [doi]', 'S0891584904004137 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were induced with either all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or chemotherapy. Plasma levels of fibrinopeptide A (FPA), fibrin d-dimer, thrombin antithrombin (TAT) complex, prothrombin fragment 1.2 (F1.2), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator-inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) were measured before and after therapy, as was the cellular expression of the genes for tissue factor (TF) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). The mean plasma levels of fibrin d-dimer, F1.2, TAT and FPA were markedly elevated prior to therapy and declined during the first 30 days of treatment with either ATRA or chemotherapy, but more rapidly and to a greater extent in patients treated with ATRA. ATRA treatment was associated with a significant decrease in TF gene expression in bone marrow cells during the first 30 days of treatment, whereas IL-1 beta gene expression, which decreased in the cells of six patients treated with either chemotherapy or ATRA, actually increased in the remaining six patients treated with either chemotherapy or ATRA. In patients with APL, treatment with either chemotherapy or ATRA rapidly ameliorates the coagulopathy, as indicated by an abrupt decline in markers of clotting activation. An increase in cytokine gene expression (e.g. IL-1 beta) may provide an explanation for the persistent hypercoagulability observed in some patients with APL, regardless of therapeutic approach. Our data confirms and extends earlier observations by others that ATRA is more effective than chemotherapy alone in rapidly reducing the procoagulant burden of APL tumor cells. However, our data also suggests that cytokine expression in some patients may be accelerated by either chemotherapy or ATRA. The implications of this observation for understanding the retinoic acid syndrome will require further studies.","['Tallman, M S', 'Lefebvre, P', 'Baine, R M', 'Shoji, M', 'Cohen, I', 'Green, D', 'Kwaan, H C', 'Paietta, E', 'Rickles, F R']","['Tallman MS', 'Lefebvre P', 'Baine RM', 'Shoji M', 'Cohen I', 'Green D', 'Kwaan HC', 'Paietta E', 'Rickles FR']","['Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Robert H.

The effects of Z-100 on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) are investigated in this paper. In MDMs, Z-100 markedly suppressed the replication of not only macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) HIV-1 strain (HIV-1JR-CSF), but also HIV-1 pseudotypes that possessed amphotropic Moloney murine leukemia virus or vesicular stomatitis virus G envelopes. Z-100 was found to inhibit HIV-1 expression, even when added 24 h after infection. In addition, it substantially inhibited the expression of the pNL43lucDeltaenv vector (in which the env gene is defective and the nef gene is replaced with the firefly luciferase gene) when this vector was transfected directly into MDMs. These findings suggest that Z-100 inhibits virus replication, mainly at HIV-1 transcription. However, Z-100 also downregulated expression of the cell surface receptors CD4 and CCR5 in MDMs, suggesting some inhibitory effect on HIV-1 entry. Further experiments revealed that Z-100 induced IFN-beta production in these cells, resulting in induction of the 16-kDa CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) beta transcription factor that represses HIV-1 long terminal repeat transcription. These effects were alleviated by SB 203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), indicating that the p38 MAPK signalling pathway was involved in Z-100-induced repression of HIV-1 replication in MDMs. These findings suggest that Z-100 might be a useful immunomodulator for control of HIV-1 infection.","['Emori, Yutaka', 'Ikeda, Tamako', 'Ohashi, Takashi', 'Masuda, Takao', 'Kurimoto, Tadashi', 'Takei, Mineo', 'Kannagi, Mari']","['Emori Y', 'Ikeda T', 'Ohashi T', 'Masuda T', 'Kurimoto T', 'Takei M', 'Kannagi M']","['Central Research Laboratories, Zeria Pharmaceutical Co.

The PML/RAR alpha translocation in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is an example where the resultant fusion protein recruits histone deacetylase complexes to target genes resulting in their inappropriate transcriptional repression. All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) acts as a ligand that relieves this repression and produces an epigenetic transcriptional reprogramming of the cancer cell. CpG island microarrays were used to analyze the DNA methylation and histone acetylation state of the human APL cell line NB4 before and after differentiation with ATRA as well as normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Over 70 CpG islands within 1 kb of transcription start of a known gene are aberrantly methylated in NB4 cells compared with PBMC; however, no changes in cytosine methylation were detected following ATRA-induced differentiation. With respect to histone H4 acetylation, over 100 single-copy CpG islands within 1 kb of transcription start of a known human gene became hyperacetylated following ATRA-induced differentiation. One CpG island was aberrantly methylated in NB4 cells, but became hyperacetylated and was induced following ATRA treatment and was associated with the HoxA1 gene, suggesting it may be a target gene of ATRA in APL. In addition to single-copy sequences, a selective increase in acetylation was detected in satellite DNA when compared with other high-copy sequences, such as Alu or rDNA. In summary, ATRA stimulates complex epigenomic changes during leukemic cell differentiation, and monitoring these changes may help to identify new targets of epigenetic dysfunction.","['Nouzova, M', 'Holtan, N', 'Oshiro, M M', 'Isett, R B', 'Munoz-Rodriguez, J L', 'List, A F', 'Narro, M L', 'Miller, S J', 'Merchant, N C', 'Futscher, B W']","['Nouzova M', 'Holtan N', 'Oshiro MM', 'Isett RB', 'Munoz-Rodriguez JL', 'List AF', 'Narro ML', 'Miller SJ', 'Merchant NC', 'Futscher BW']","['Arizona Cancer Center, 1515 N.

In human subjects, overexpression of annexin 2 in acute promyelocytic leukemia leads to a bleeding diathesis reflective of excessive cell surface annexin 2-dependent generation of plasmin (Menell, J. S., Cesarman, G. M., Jacovina, A. T., McLaughlin, M. A., Lev, E. A., and Hajjar, K. A. (1999) N. Engl. J. Med. 340, 994-1004). In addition, mice completely deficient in annexin 2 display fibrin accumulation within blood vessels and impaired clearance of injury-induced thrombi (Ling Q., Jacovina, A.T., Deora, A.B., Febbraio, M., Simantov, R., Silverstein, R. L., Hempstead, B. L., Mark, W., and Hajjar, K. A. (2004) J. Clin. Investig. 113, 38-48). Here, we show that endothelial cell annexin 2, a protein that lacks a typical signal peptide, translocates from the cytoplasm to the extracytoplasmic plasma membrane in response to brief temperature stress both in vitro and in vivo in the absence of cell death or cell lysis. This regulated response is independent of new protein or mRNA synthesis and does not require the classical endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi pathway. Temperature stress-induced annexin 2 translocation is dependent on both expression of protein p11 (S100A10) and tyrosine phosphorylation of annexin 2 because annexin 2 release is completely eliminated on depletion of p11, inactivation of tyrosine kinase, or mutation of tyrosine 23. Translocation of annexin 2 to the cell surface dramatically increases tissue plasminogen activator-dependent plasminogen activation potential and may represent a novel stress-induced protein secretion pathway.","['Deora, Arunkumar B', 'Kreitzer, Geri', 'Jacovina, Andrew T', 'Hajjar, Katherine A']","['Deora AB', 'Kreitzer G', 'Jacovina AT', 'Hajjar KA']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ANXA2 protein, human)', '0 (Annexin A2)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (S100 Proteins)', '0 (S100 calcium binding protein A10)']",IM,"['Annexin A2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Transport', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'S100 Proteins/*metabolism', 'Thermodynamics', 'Umbilical Veins']",2004/08/11 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/08/11 05:00'],"['2004/08/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/11 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Oct 15;279(42):43411-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M408078200.

Following 6 days in culture, four of five cell lines demonstrated dendrite-like morphology, upregulation of CCR7, CD54, CD80 and CD86, uptake of extracellular proteins and activation of T cells, and similar results were obtained with blasts from three t(9;22) ALL patients. The dendritic-like cells appeared to be composed of populations resembling both immature and mature dendritic cells (DCs), distinguished by CD80 expression. CD80-CD86+ cells were classified as immature DCs, demonstrating high endocytic capability and inducing minimal allogeneic T cell proliferation, while CD80+CD86+ cells were classified as mature DCs, exhibiting negligible endocytic capability and inducing robust allogeneic T cell proliferation. These mature dendritic-like cells induced autologous cytotoxic T cell responses against the unmodified blasts in a patient who achieved prolonged remission.

TL is expressed in mouse small intestinal epithelial cells and is known to interact with CD8alphaalpha homodimers, which are expressed by intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), some other T cell subsets and some non-T cells such as a subset of dendritic cells. We show here that TL is abundantly expressed on the basolateral surface of mouse small intestinal epithelial cells and that expression is abrogated in beta2m-/- mice but unaffected in TCR-/- mice or CD8alpha chain-/- mice. We demonstrate that the interaction between TL and CD8alphaalpha is not necessary for IEL survival in vitro or in vivo and does not modulate IEL trafficking in vivo. TL co-stimulation of alpha-CD3 antibody-activated IELs resulted in modestly enhanced production of IFN-gamma in one subset of IELs. The lack of effect on IEL survival and trafficking and the modest effect on IFN-gamma production suggest that the functional consequences of TL interaction with CD8alphaalpha as well as the more general biological role of TL in mucosal immunity remains to be discovered.","['Pardigon, Nathalie', 'Darche, Sylvie', 'Kelsall, Brian', 'Bennink, Jack R', 'Yewdell, Jonathan W']","['Pardigon N', 'Darche S', 'Kelsall B', 'Bennink JR', 'Yewdell JW']","['Laboratory of Viral Diseases, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA. npardigon@niaid.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD8 Antigens/physiology', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Survival', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-15/physiology', 'Intestinal Mucosa/immunology', 'Intestine, Small/*immunology', 'Liver/immunology', 'Lung/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/physiology']",2004/08/11 05:00,2005/02/04 09:00,['2004/08/11 05:00'],"['2004/08/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/11 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 2004 Sep;16(9):1305-13. doi: 10.1093/intimm/dxh133.

To investigate the biological function of Yaf9p, this protein was used to search for interacting proteins in a two-hybrid system.

Yaf9p and Swc4p associate through C-terminal domains, and both proteins coprecipitate in vitro in pull-down experiments and in vivo by immunoprecipitation. In living cells, Swc4p is present in a megadalton protein complex that shows a fractionation behavior in gel filtration similar to that of Esa1p, the histone acetyltransferase of the NuA4 complex. Recruitment of Yaf9p to DNA leads to promoter-specific transcriptional activation that can be inhibited by dominant negative Swc4p lacking the Yaf9p binding domain. Interference with Swc4p function also increases sensitivity to the microtubule toxin benomyl, a trait that corresponds to the known phenotype of a yaf9(-) knockout strain.

As Tax can enhance the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor NF-kB and cAMP-responsive element binding protein/activating transcription factor-1 (CREB/ATF-1), we investigated the relevance of these routes in the anti-apoptotic effects of Tax. Results showed that a Tax mutant retaining CREB/ATF-1 transactivating activity protects murine fibroblasts from serum-depletion-induced apoptosis, while two CREB/ATF-1-defective mutants did not. Treatment with forskolin, an activator of CREB, significantly attenuated cytochrome c release and Bax translocation in response of serum deprivation. In analogy to forskolin treatment, Tax expression results in sustained phosphorylation of CREB at Ser(133) during serum starvation. Considered together, these results underscore a primary role of CREB transcriptional activation in preventing apoptosis triggered by growth factor withdrawal, and suggest that Tax might in part function by affecting the phosphorylation state of CREB.","['Trevisan, Roberta', 'Daprai, Laura', 'Acquasaliente, Lidia', 'Ciminale, Vincenzo', 'Chieco-Bianchi, Luigi', 'Saggioro, Daniela']","['Trevisan R', 'Daprai L', 'Acquasaliente L', 'Ciminale V', 'Chieco-Bianchi L', 'Saggioro D']","['Oncology Section, Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences, University of Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Atf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 1', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Blood Proteins/deficiency', 'Cell Line', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fibroblasts/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Transport/drug effects/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/*physiology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2004/08/11 05:00,2004/10/02 05:00,['2004/08/11 05:00'],"['2003/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/31 00:00 [revised]', '2004/08/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/02 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/11 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2004 Sep 10;299(1):57-67. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.05.024.,"['10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.05.024 [doi]', 'S0014482704002800 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data from eight multicenter trials (four Phase II and four randomized Phase III studies) conducted by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B were combined. Eligible patients had progressive prostate cancer after androgen deprivation therapy (with documented castration levels of testosterone), an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2, and adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function. The proportional hazards model was used to assess the prognostic importance of race, adjusting for important factors. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Of the 1183 patients, 15% were blacks, 45% of patients had a Gleason sum of 8 or greater, and the median age was 71 years. Of the 1183 patients, 35% had measurable disease and 89% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1. Blacks were younger, had a shorter interval between diagnosis and study entry, and had greater prostate-specific antigen levels, lower hemoglobin levels, and a lower likelihood of prior prostatectomy than whites. The median survival was 15 months (95% confidence interval 12 to 18) for blacks compared with 14 months (95% confidence interval 13 to 15) for whites. In a multivariate analysis, adjusting for age, performance status, presence of visceral disease, hemoglobin, Gleason sum, prostate-specific antigen level, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, and years since diagnosis, the hazard ratio was 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.71 to 1.02, P = 0.08) for blacks compared with whites.

In the presence of bovine serum albumin, mGM-CSF did not increase the percentage of oocytes that developed to the blastocyst stage and at day 7 did not increase cell numbers of embryos. Addition of 2 ng/ml GM-CSF to protein-free culture medium significantly increased the compaction and blastocoel formation of 1- to 2-cell parthenotes developing in vitro. However, total cell numbers were not increased when they were cultured in the presence of GM-CSF. Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction revealed that mGM-CSF enhances mRNA expression of the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, but does not influence interleukin-6 or sodium/glucose co-transporter protein gene expression in blastocyst stage parthenotes.

Coincidental autoimmune disease in patients transplanted for conventional indications.,223-32,"The practice of stem cell transplantation for severe autoimmune diseases refractory to conventional therapy originated from two landmark discoveries: the excellent results of animal experiments, and serendipitous observations in human coincidental diseases. The latter include patients with an often long-standing autoimmune disease who have developed a haematological condition (aplasia, leukaemia, lymphoma) requiring stem cell transplantation (from marrow as well as from blood). Allogeneic and autologous transplants have been performed. The initial information deriving from both procedures is their feasibility, even more convincing since the patients were affected by two simultaneous severe diseases. The information derived from autologous transplants has, however, now been superseded by the considerable and increasing number of those transplants performed for primary autoimmune diseases. On the other hand, allogeneic stem cell transplantation for very severe autoimmune diseases is being cautiously explored in current protocols. Allogeneic transplants in coincidental disease have also suggested a graft-versus-autoimmunity effect, which may become relevant in conjunction with non-myeloablative, less toxic condition regimens.","['Marmont, Alberto M']",['Marmont AM'],"[""Division of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Centre, S Martino's Hospital, Largo Rosanna Benzi 10, 16132 Genoa, Italy. marmont.alberto@hsanmartino.it""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

In this study, HA induction of apoptosis was studied using cultured human premyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Treatment at a range of HA concentrations (50-400 microg/ml) resulted in dose-and time-dependent sequences of events marked by apoptosis, as demonstrated through by apoptotic features such as loss of cell viability, chromatin condensation, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. This HA-induced apoptosis in the HL-60 cells was mainly associated with the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Furthermore, apoptosis in the HL-60 cells was accompanied by the activation of caspase-3 and the specific proteolytic cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a major component in the apoptotic cell death mechanism. Although the HA-induced apoptosis was associated with Bax protein levels, negligible Bcl-2 reduction was observed. Analysis of the data reported herein reveals that HA exerts antiproliferative action and growth inhibition on HL-60 cells through induction of apoptosis, which may have anticancer properties potentially useful for the development of new drug products.","['Yang, Hsin-Ling', 'Hseu, You-Cheng', 'Hseu, Yi-Ting', 'Lu, Fung-Jou', 'Lin, Elong', 'Lai, Jim-Shoung']","['Yang HL', 'Hseu YC', 'Hseu YT', 'Lu FJ', 'Lin E', 'Lai JS']","['Institute of Nutrition, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Humic Substances)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Humic Substances', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2004/08/11 05:00,2004/09/17 05:00,['2004/08/11 05:00'],"['2003/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2004/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/11 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2004 Aug 27;75(15):1817-31. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2004.02.033.,"['10.1016/j.lfs.2004.02.033 [doi]', 'S0024320504004874 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NALM-6, which had a high expression level of p53, a tumor suppressor gene, was most susceptible to Ara-C. U937 and HL-60, with p53-null human leukemia cell lines were little affected by Ara-C. There was not always a correlation between susceptibility and the uptake of Ara-C. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was increased in all leukemia cells. Pifithrin-alpha, a chemical inhibitor of wild-type p53, ameliorated the cytotoxicity of Ara-C in NALM-6 and MOLT-4, but not Jurkat, U937 or HL-60.

This study was to analyze the immunophenotype of 135 samples, including lymph nodes, blood, bone marrow, and cerebrospinal fluid samples, from 121 patients with suspected lymphoid malignancies, to evaluate its role in diagnosis. METHODS: All samples were tested by routine morphological, pathological, and immunohistochemical methods, and analyzed by FCM in suspended single cells, to compare the accuracy of different diagnostic methods. RESULTS: (1) Three of 23 lymph nodes, which failed to be diagnosed by routine methods, were determined by flow cytometric immunophenotype analysis. (2) According to new WHO classification, 96 of 97 blood or bone marrow aspiration samples were diagnosed by flow cytometric immunophenotype analysis, while 88 of 97 samples were diagnosed by routine immunohistochemical method. (3) Multiple parameter immunophenotype analysis in cerebrospinal fluid samples by FCM improved the diagnostic accuracy of leukemia or lymphoma involvement of central nervous system.

CK2 activity has been shown to be markedly elevated in solid tumors and leukemia cells. Its alpha or alpha' gene is a protooncogene. CK2 is attracting increasing attention as a potential target for anti-neoplastic. This study was to search specific CK2 inhibitors in tumor cells through observation of the inhibitory effects of baicalein on recombinant human protein kinase CK2 holoenzyme and its kinetics in vitro. METHODS: Recombinant human protein kinase CK2 alpha' and beta subunits were cloned and expressed by gene engineering, and purified to homogeneous. These 2 subunits were mixed at equal molar ratio to reconstitute CK2 holoenzyme. The CK2 activity was evaluated by detecting radioactivity of 32P of [gamma-32P]ATP which was incorporated into the substrate in various conditions. RESULTS: Baicalein was shown to strongly inhibit the holoenzyme activity of CK2 with IC50 of 2.54 micromol/L. Kinetic studies of baicalein on CK2 showed that baicalein acted as an inhibitor of noncompetitive with ATP(KI=7.73 micromol/L) and mixed types with casein(KI=3.07 micromol/L). CONCLUSION: Baicalein is an effective inhibitor of protein kinase CK2 in vitro.","['Lin, Xiao-Cong', 'Liu, Xin-Guang', 'Chen, Xiao-Wen', 'Chen, Wei-Zhu', 'Liang, Nian-Ci']","['Lin XC', 'Liu XG', 'Chen XW', 'Chen WZ', 'Liang NC']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Guangdong Medical College, Zhanjiang, Guangdong, 524023, PR China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Holoenzymes)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '49QAH60606 (baicalein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)']",IM,"['Casein Kinase II/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flavanones/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Holoenzymes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Plants, Medicinal/chemistry', 'Recombinant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Scutellaria baicalensis/chemistry']",2004/08/11 05:00,2005/01/26 09:00,['2004/08/11 05:00'],"['2004/08/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/11 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2004 Aug;23(8):874-8.,['1000467X2004080874 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined the effects of histamine, diphenhydramine, and cimetidine (H1 and H2 histamine receptor antagonists, respectively) on the in vitro proliferation of two human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines, namely CCRF-CEM and Jurkat. Exogenous histamine did not alter the proliferation or viability of these cells. In contrast, diphenhydramine induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner in both cell lines, whereas cimetidine failed to induce significant effects at similar concentrations. Diphenhydramine-induced apoptosis was evaluated in terms of morphology, flow cytometry, and the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol. The latter was partially mitigated by Bcl-2 overexpression. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, diphenhydramine inhibited cell proliferation without inducing apoptosis. Our findings indicate that endogenous histamine may be an important factor for the survival of CCRF-CEM, Jurkat, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and point to the potential application of H1 receptor antagonists as cytotoxic agents for the specific treatment of certain types of leukemia.","['Jangi, Shawkat-Muhialdin', 'Asumendi, Aintzane', 'Arlucea, Jon', 'Nieto, Naiara', 'Perez-Yarza, Gorka', 'Morales, Maria C', 'de la Fuente-Pinedo, Maria', 'Boyano, Maria D']","['Jangi SM', 'Asumendi A', 'Arlucea J', 'Nieto N', 'Perez-Yarza G', 'Morales MC', 'de la Fuente-Pinedo M', 'Boyano MD']","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of the Basque Country, Leioa, Vizcaya, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Histamine H1 Antagonists)', '8GTS82S83M (Diphenhydramine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Diphenhydramine/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Histamine H1 Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/08/11 05:00,2005/01/05 09:00,['2004/08/11 05:00'],"['2004/08/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/11 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncol Res. 2004;14(7-8):363-72. doi: 10.3727/0965040041292369.,['10.3727/0965040041292369 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coculture of nonleukemic stromal cells and AML blasts separated by a semipermeable membrane decreased proliferation of the fibroblast line HFL1, and the inhibition was maintained when HFL1 and AML cells were cultured in direct contact. A similar inhibitory effect was observed for osteoblastic sarcoma cell lines (Cal72, SJSA-1) and normal osteoblasts. GM-CSF was released by both nonleukemic cells and a subset of AML blast populations, and increased levels of GM-CSF were detected in AML cocultures with fibroblasts and osteoblastic sarcoma cells when testing AML cell populations with constitutive GM-CSF release. Furthermore, constitutive IL-1beta secretion by AML blasts was detected only for a subset of patients, whereas relatively high levels of IL-1RA were observed for all patients; coculture of AML blasts with HFL1 fibroblasts and osteoblastic sarcoma cells increased IL-1beta levels for patients with constitutive IL-1beta secretion, whereas IL-1RA levels were slightly decreased but still generally higher than IL-1beta levels (tested only for HFL1 fibroblasts). The bidirectional crosstalk between AML blasts and stromal cells with increased release of AML growth factors may be important in leukemogenesis, whereas the decreased stromal cell proliferation combined with the persistent release of IL-1RA may in addition inhibit remaining normal hematopoiesis and thereby contribute to bone marrow failure in AML.","['Glenjen, Nils', 'Ersvaer, Elisabeth', 'Ryningen, Anita', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Glenjen N', 'Ersvaer E', 'Ryningen A', 'Bruserud O']","['Section for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital and University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. nils.idar.glenjen@helse-bergen.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Cell Communication', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/*physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteoblasts/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1/*physiology', 'Stromal Cells', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/08/10 05:00,2004/09/15 05:00,['2004/08/10 05:00'],"['2004/08/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/15 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2004 Oct 10;111(6):858-67. doi: 10.1002/ijc.20353.,['10.1002/ijc.20353 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Conventional cytogenetics(CC) and interphase FISH using chromosome 8 centromere specific probe were simultaneously carried out to detect the abnormal numbers of chromosome 8 in eight acute myeloid leukemia cases with CC unveiled abnormal numbers of chromosome 8, ten chronic myeloid leukemia cases in accelerated phase or blast crisis, and three normal individuals. RESULTS: Nine cases that displayed trisomy 8 by means of CC were confirmed by FISH. Among them, Case 5 only displayed diploidy 8, trisomy 8 and tetrasomy 8 by CC, at the same time, FISH confirmed the presence of trisomy 8 and tetrasomy 8 and also revealed a low percentage of a pentasomy 8 clone. Case 3 and Case 17 had each only one cell with trisomy 8 by means of CC, and this could not determine whether they had the trisomy 8 clone, yet FISH confirmed the existence of trisomy 8 clone. Case 9 did not display trisomy 8 by CC, but FISH revealed the existence of trisomy 8 clone. In the other cases, the percentages of trisomy 8 cells determined by FISH were close to or significantly lower than those by CC, but for Case 16 where the percentage of trisomy 8 cells by FISH was significantly higher than that by CC. CONCLUSION: Interphase FISH is a useful method for the detection of abnormal numbers of chromosome 8, especially in the patients with normal or unsure karyotype or with less and bad metaphases.

A human chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (Mab) rituximab (Rituxan in USA; Mabthera in Europe) was approved for the treatment of refractory or relapsed low-grade or follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in 1997 (1-3). Rituximab has efficacy in other refractory CD20+ NHLs, hairy cell leukemia, plasma cell dyscrasias, posttransplant lymphoproliferative syndrome, autoimmune phenomena such as refractory hemo lytic anemias, and immune thrombocytopenias (4-8). Its combination with standard chemotherapy protocols for NHL has been investigated thoroughly owing to its synergistic effect when combined with chemotherapeutic agents (3). Coiffier et al. recently published a randomized trial showing a statistically significant survival benefit of rituximab-CHOP combination over CHOP alone in elderly patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma (9,10). In addition to these widening beneficial therapeutic effects, rituximab has well-known side effects, encountered especially during its first infusion, such as chills, fever, allergic reactions, cardiopulmonary syndrome, and tumor lysis syndrome.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is a clinically effective cytodifferentiating agent. To understand the mechanism underlying ATRA-induced cytodifferentiation, we did a kinetic analysis of the role of ATRA in inhibiting telomerase in HL60 cells. Our studies indicate that telomerase inhibition by ATRA occurred relatively early after treatment of HL60 cells due to a rapid decrease in hTERT gene expression. More importantly, however, we found through monitoring the expression of CD11b, a marker for granulocytic differentiation of HL60 cells, that down-regulation of telomerase preceded the differentiation of HL60 cells. These observations suggest that the hTERT gene may be a primary target of ATRA regulation of cellular differentiation and the antileukemia activity of ATRA may be mediated by its ability to induce the differentiation of the promyelocytic leukemia cells through down-regulation of the hTERT gene.","['Liu, Liang', 'Berletch, Joel B', 'Green, Jessica G', 'Pate, Mitchell S', 'Andrews, Lucy G', 'Tollefsbol, Trygve O']","['Liu L', 'Berletch JB', 'Green JG', 'Pate MS', 'Andrews LG', 'Tollefsbol TO']","['Department of Biology, University of Alabama-Birmingham, 175 Campbell Hall, 1300 University Boulevard, Birmingham, AL 35294-1170, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Retinoids)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['CD11b Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Retinoids/*metabolism', 'Telomerase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Telomere/ultrastructure', 'Time Factors']",2004/08/10 05:00,2005/01/14 09:00,['2004/08/10 05:00'],"['2004/08/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/14 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2004 Aug;3(8):1003-9.,['3/8/1003 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that this proapoptotic kinase is also involved in Fanconi anemia (FA), a disease characterized by bone marrow (BM) failure and leukemia. We have used a BM extract to show that three FA proteins, FANCA, FANCC, and FANCG, functionally interact with the PKR kinase, which in turn regulates translational control. By using a combined immunoprecipitation and reconstituted kinase assay, in which an active PKR kinase complex was captured from a normal cell extract, we demonstrated functional interactions between the FA proteins and the PKR kinase. In primary human BM cells, mutations in the FANCA, FANCC, and FANCG genes markedly increase the amount of PKR bound to FANCC, and this PKR accumulation is correlated with elevated PKR activation and hypersensitivity of BM progenitor cells to growth repression mediated by the inhibitory cytokines interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Specific inhibition of PKR by 2-aminopurine in these FA BM cells attenuates PKR activation and apoptosis induction. In lymphoblasts derived from an FA-C patient, overexpression of a dominant negative mutant PKR (PKRK296R) suppressed PKR activation and apoptosis induced by interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Furthermore, by using genetically matched wild-type and PKR-null cells, we demonstrated that forced expression of a patient-derived FA-C mutant (FANCCL554P) augmented double-stranded RNA-induced PKR activation and cell death. Thus, inappropriate activation of PKR as a consequence of certain FA mutations might play a role in bone marrow failure that frequently occurred in FA.","['Zhang, Xiaoling', 'Li, June', 'Sejas, Daniel P', 'Rathbun, Keaney R', 'Bagby, Grover C', 'Pang, Qishen']","['Zhang X', 'Li J', 'Sejas DP', 'Rathbun KR', 'Bagby GC', 'Pang Q']","[""Division of Experimental Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Ohio 45229, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FANCC protein, human)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/pathology/physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fanconi Anemia/*genetics', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reference Values', 'Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'eIF-2 Kinase/genetics/*metabolism']",2004/08/10 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/08/10 05:00'],"['2004/08/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Oct 15;279(42):43910-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M403884200.

Understanding the structure and dynamics of lipid domains could be a key to many crucial membrane-associated processes in cells. However, one shortcoming in the field is the lack of routinely applicable techniques to measure raft association without perturbation by detergents. We show that both in cell and in domain-exhibiting model membranes, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) can easily distinguish a raft marker (cholera toxin B subunit bound to ganglioside (GM1) and a nonraft marker (dialkylcarbocyanine dye diI)) by their decidedly different diffusional mobilities. In contrast, these markers exhibit only slightly different mobilities in a homogeneous artificial membrane. Performing cholesterol depletion with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, which disrupts raft organization, we find an analogous effect of reduced mobility for the nonraft marker in domain-exhibiting artificial membranes and in cell membranes. In contrast, cholesterol depletion has differential effects on the raft marker, cholera toxin B subunit-GM1, rendering it more mobile in artificial domain-exhibiting membranes but leaving it immobile in cell membranes, where cytoskeleton disruption is required to achieve higher mobility. Thus, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy promises to be a valuable tool to elucidate lipid raft associations in native cells and to gain deeper insight into the correspondence between model and natural membranes.","['Bacia, Kirsten', 'Scherfeld, Dag', 'Kahya, Nicoletta', 'Schwille, Petra']","['Bacia K', 'Scherfeld D', 'Kahya N', 'Schwille P']","['Dresden University of Technology, Department of Biophysics, c/o Max-Planck-Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, 01307 Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,"['0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Lipid Bilayers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membranes, Artificial)', '0 (beta-Cyclodextrins)', '0 (methyl-beta-cyclodextrin)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cholera Toxin/metabolism', 'Gangliosides/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kidney/drug effects/embryology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Lipid Bilayers/*metabolism', 'Liposomes/*chemistry', 'Membrane Microdomains/chemistry/drug effects/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Membranes, Artificial', 'Rats', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence/*methods', 'beta-Cyclodextrins/chemistry/pharmacology']",2004/08/10 05:00,2005/02/18 09:00,['2004/08/10 05:00'],"['2004/08/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 2004 Aug;87(2):1034-43. doi: 10.1529/biophysj.104.040519.,"['10.1529/biophysj.104.040519 [doi]', 'S0006-3495(04)73585-7 [pii]']",,,,PMC1304444,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of RUNX1-CBFA2T1 in leukaemic cell proliferation is less clear. We examined the consequences of siRNA-mediated RUNX1-CBFA2T1 depletion regarding proliferation and clonogenicity of t(8;21)-positive cell lines. METHODS: The t(8;21)-positive cell line Kasumi-1 was electroporated with RUNX1-CBFA2T1 or control siRNAs followed by analysis of proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle distribution, apoptosis and senescence. RESULTS: Electroporation of Kasumi-1 cells with RUNX1-CBFA2T1 siRNAs, but not with control siRNAs, resulted in RUNX1-CBFA2T1 suppression which lasted for at least 5 days. A single electroporation with RUNX1-CBFA2T1 siRNA severely diminished the clonogenicity of Kasumi-1 cells. Prolonged RUNX1-CBFA2T1 depletion inhibited proliferation in suspension culture and G1-S transition during the cell cycle, diminished the number of apoptotic cells, but induced cellular senescence. The addition of haematopoetic growth factors could not rescue RUNX1-CBFA2T1-depleted cells from senescence, and could only partially restore their clonogenicity. CONCLUSIONS: RUNX1-CBFA2T1 supports the proliferation and expansion of t(8;21)-positive leukaemic cells by preventing cellular senescence. These findings suggest a central role of RUNX1-CBFA2T1 in the maintenance of the leukaemia. Therefore, RUNX1-CBFA2T1 is a promising and leukaemia-specific target for molecularly defined therapeutic approaches.","['Martinez, Natalia', 'Drescher, Bettina', 'Riehle, Heidemarie', 'Cullmann, Claire', 'Vornlocher, Hans-Peter', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Heil, Gerhard', 'Nordheim, Alfred', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Heidenreich, Olaf']","['Martinez N', 'Drescher B', 'Riehle H', 'Cullmann C', 'Vornlocher HP', 'Ganser A', 'Heil G', 'Nordheim A', 'Krauter J', 'Heidenreich O']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Institute for Cell Biology, Faculty of Biology, University of Tubingen, Germany. natalia.martinez@uni-tuebingen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cellular Senescence/*genetics', 'Clone Cells', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/08/10 05:00,2004/11/13 09:00,['2004/08/10 05:00'],"['2004/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/10 05:00 [entrez]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2004 Aug 6;4:44. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-4-44.,"['10.1186/1471-2407-4-44 [doi]', '1471-2407-4-44 [pii]']",20040806,,,PMC512292,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown by expressing GPVI in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells that GPVI mediates adhesion to type I collagen under static conditions. However, the ability of GPVI to secure adhesion to collagen type I under flow has not been measured. We studied the interaction of GPVI and type I collagen under hydrodynamic flow using RBL-2H3 cells transfected with the GPVI receptor. We found that GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cells adhere to collagen under flow, significantly more so than non-GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cells. Inhibition of GPVI by the 11A12 anti-GPVI antibody significantly blocks adhesion to collagen, indicating that GPVI specifically interacts with collagen. Probing the role of signaling in GPVI binding to collagen, we used mutants of GPVI and observed that signal transduction did not inhibit adhesion. To test the correlation between receptor expression and adhesion, we tested three GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cell lines (A, B, and C) with different levels of receptor expression. At a single shear rate, the level of adhesion increases monotonically with surface expression. The results, using this model cell line, indicate that GPVI is capable of mediating adhesion to collagen under shear, in a density-dependent fashion that is independent of GPVI signaling.","['Sarratt, Kendra L', 'Chen, Hong', 'Kahn, Mark L', 'Hammer, Daniel A']","['Sarratt KL', 'Chen H', 'Kahn ML', 'Hammer DA']","['Department of Bioengineering, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Biomed Eng,Annals of biomedical engineering,0361512,"['0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (platelet membrane glycoprotein VI)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Flow Velocity', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Collagen Type I/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', '*Mechanotransduction, Cellular', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Stress, Mechanical']",2004/08/10 05:00,2005/01/12 09:00,['2004/08/10 05:00'],"['2004/08/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/12 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Biomed Eng. 2004 Jul;32(7):970-6. doi: 10.1023/b:abme.0000032459.29696.65.,['10.1023/b:abme.0000032459.29696.65 [doi]'],,"['5-P01-HL-62550-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL67311-01A1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Until then a rational, target-aimed design of drugs was not possible, because the molecular basis of disease was largely unexplored. The progress in basic science has revealed that many diseases are caused by the malfunction of proteins. These proteins are targets for drugs, which should bind to the protein and inhibit its function. Knowledge of the three dimensional structure of the target protein is helpful to find binding pockets for the drug on the molecular surface. The strategy of this knowledge-based or structure-based drug-design is explained with the help of several examples for recently approved drugs, antivirals against influenza and AIDS, and a drug against a rare cancer, chronic myeloic leukemia.","['Veit, Michael']",['Veit M'],"['Institut fur Immunologie und Molekularbiologie, Fachbereich Veterinarmedizin der Freien Universitat Berlin. mveit@city.vetmed.fu-berlin.de']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Berl Munch Tierarztl Wochenschr,Berliner und Munchener tierarztliche Wochenschrift,0003163,['0 (Veterinary Drugs)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Drug Design', 'Protein Conformation', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', '*Veterinary Drugs']",2004/08/10 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/08/10 05:00'],"['2004/08/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/10 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Berl Munch Tierarztl Wochenschr. 2004 Jul-Aug;117(7-8):276-87.,,,,25,,,,,,,,,,Neue Strategien zur Entwicklung von Arzneimitteln.,"['PDB/1A30', 'PDB/1AIK', 'PDB/1F8B', 'PDB/1HTM', 'PDB/1IEP', 'PDB/2VIU']",,,,,,

Various angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietins (Angs), are thought to be associated with leukemia cell growth. In this study, we examined if the Angs-Tie2 autocrine pathway works in primary AML cells or not by using soluble Tie2-Fc, which inhibits Angs from binding to Tie2 receptor. After 48 h of culture with Tie2-Fc, nine AML cells from 19 examined samples were not influenced by Tie2-Fc (group A), while AML cells from remaining 10 patients demonstrated remarkable reduction of cell number by Tie2-Fc treatment (group B). Tie2 receptor, upon binding to Angs, are known to activate phosphatidyl-inositol 3 kinase (PI3 kinase). Then, we examined the effect of LY294002, a potent PI3 kinase inhibitor, on primary AML cells. Cell number reduction effect by the treatment of LY294002 was much more prominent in cells of group B than of group A. In addition, extent of cell number reduction by Tie2-Fc and LY294002 was quite well correlated. These observations demonstrated that cells from a part of AML were dependent on autocrine Angs-Tie2 pathway. This notion was further supported by the study of two AML cell lines, KG-1 and HL-60: the growth of KG-1 was suppressed by Tie2-Fc, and also by anti-Tie2 antibody, which inhibits receptor-ligand interaction, while that of HL-60 was not suppressed by Tie2-Fc or anti-Tie2 antibody.

The number of chromosomes were subsequently counted by metaphase spread. Moreover, to explore whether mutational inactivation of the p53 gene or inactivation of the P53 protein caused by mdm2 gene overexpression, occurred in the feline lymphoma cell lines, mutational analysis of the feline p53 gene was carried out. The expression of feline mdm2 mRNA was evaluated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Centrosome amplification and chromosomal instability was observed in three out of the five feline lymphoma cell lines. Of these three feline lymphoma cell lines, one had aberrations in the P53 amino-acid sequence, whereas the others had none. There was no significant difference in the expression of mdm2 mRNA between peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from a normal cat and that of the five feline lymphoma cell lines. These findings indicate that centrosome amplification also occurs in cat tumors and is strongly correlated with chromosomal instability, suggesting that the immunostaining of centrosomes could be an alternative method for the examination of the chromosomal instability. Furthermore, this study suggests the presence of unknown mechanism that leads to the centrosome amplification in feline lymphomas.","['Miki, Ryuta', 'Okuda, Masaru', 'Oikawa, Tatsuo', 'Watanabe, Malaika', 'Ma, Zhiyong', 'Matsumoto, Koutaro', 'Iwata, Hiroyuki', 'Inokuma, Hisashi']","['Miki R', 'Okuda M', 'Oikawa T', 'Watanabe M', 'Ma Z', 'Matsumoto K', 'Iwata H', 'Inokuma H']","['Laboratory of Veterinary Internal Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, Yamaguchi University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,J Vet Med Sci,The Journal of veterinary medical science,9105360,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/*genetics', 'Cats', 'Centrosome/*physiology', 'Chromosomal Instability/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect/veterinary', 'Gene Amplification/*genetics', 'Genes, p53', 'Immunohistochemistry/veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*veterinary', 'Metaphase/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/veterinary', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2004/08/07 05:00,2004/09/10 05:00,['2004/08/07 05:00'],"['2004/08/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/07 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Vet Med Sci. 2004 Jul;66(7):797-805. doi: 10.1292/jvms.66.797.,"['JST.JSTAGE/jvms/66.797 [pii]', '10.1292/jvms.66.797 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B cell-deficient mice were poorly protected by vaccination, but adoptive transfer experiments showed that the T cells from B cell-deficient mice were primed as well as those from wild-type mice. Furthermore, passive transfer of virus-neutralizing antibodies completely compensated for B cell deficiency. The presence of virus-neutralizing antibodies at the time of infection was crucial for vaccine efficacy. Interestingly, virus-neutralizing antibodies worked synergistically with vaccine-primed T cells to provide a level of protection many orders of magnitude greater than either antibodies or immune T cells alone.

However, the clinical significance of Skp2 in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) remains unknown. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We examined the clinical and biological significance of Skp2 expression in AML and evaluated the relationship between Skp2 and p27Kip1 expression and phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) phosphorylation. RESULTS: Western blot analysis showed that high Skp2 expression was observed in 57 (57.6%) cases and significantly correlated with unfavorable cytogenetics (P = 0.035) but not with age, white blood cell count, serum lactic dehydrogenase level, and the French-American-British subtype. An inverse correlation was not observed between Skp2 and p27Kip1 expression. However, p27Kip1 protein was preferentially localized to cytoplasm in the high-Skp2-expression group. The cytoplasmic to nuclear ratio of p27Kip1 expression was significantly correlated with the levels of Skp2 expression (P < 0.001). The frequency of PTEN phosphorylation was significantly higher in the high-Skp2-expression group compared with the low- Skp2-expression group (P = 0.035). The Skp2 overexpression was significantly associated with shorter disease-free survival and overall survival (P = 0.0386 and P = 0.0369, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that Skp2 expression was an independent prognostic factor both in the disease-free survival and overall survival. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that Skp2 expression is an independent marker for a poor prognosis in AML. The presence of a positive correlation between Skp2 and phosphorylated PTEN suggests that an aberration in the PTEN/Skp2 signaling pathway might be operating in AML.","['Min, Yoo Hong', 'Cheong, June-Won', 'Lee, Mark Hong', 'Kim, Ji Yeon', 'Lee, Seung Tae', 'Hahn, Jee Sook', 'Ko, Yun Woong']","['Min YH', 'Cheong JW', 'Lee MH', 'Kim JY', 'Lee ST', 'Hahn JS', 'Ko YW']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Female', 'G1 Phase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prognosis', 'S Phase', 'S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2004/08/07 05:00,2005/03/08 09:00,['2004/08/07 05:00'],"['2004/08/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/07 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Aug 1;10(15):5123-30. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0136.,"['10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0136 [doi]', '10/15/5123 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Noncoding exon and promoter usage was analyzed in RNAs from 27 childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) specimens by real-time PCR and/or 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5' RACE) assay. By real-time PCR, total hRFC transcripts in ALL spanned a 289-fold range. Over 90% of hRFC transcripts were transcribed with A1, A2, and B 5' untranslated regions (UTRs). Analysis of 5' RACE clones showed that the A1 + A2 5'UTRs contained A1 sequence alone or a fusion of A1 and A2, implying the existence of a single, alternatively spliced 1021-bp A1/A2 noncoding region. High frequency sequence polymorphisms (AGG deletion, C/T transition) identified in the A1/A2 region by 5'RACE were confirmed in normal DNAs. By reporter assays in HepG2 hepatoma and Jurkat leukemia cells, A1/A2 promoter activity was localized to a 134-bp minimal region. Translation from an upstream AUG in the A1/A2 noncoding region in-frame with the normal translation start resulted in synthesis of a larger ( approximately 7 kDa) hRFC protein with transport properties altered from those for wild-type hRFC. Although there was no effect on transcript or protein stabilities, in vitro translation from A1/A2 transcripts was decreased compared with those with the B 5'UTR. Our results document the importance of the hRFC A1/A2 upstream region in childhood ALL and an intricate transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of hRFC-A1/A2 mRNAs. Furthermore, they suggest that use of the A1/A2 5'UTR may confer a transport phenotype distinct from the other 5'UTRs due to altered translation efficiency and transport properties.","['Flatley, Robin M', 'Payton, Scott G', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Matherly, Larry H']","['Flatley RM', 'Payton SG', 'Taub JW', 'Matherly LH']","['Experimental and Clinical Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions"", 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Exons', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2004/08/07 05:00,2005/03/08 09:00,['2004/08/07 05:00'],"['2004/08/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/07 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Aug 1;10(15):5111-22. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0116.,"['10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0116 [doi]', '10/15/5111 [pii]']",,"['CA53535/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA76641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Oct 15;11(20):7586'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent reports indicate that imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) can induce remissions in these patients as well. Less is known about the extent and durability of these responses. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We studied 15 patients treated with imatinib for recurrent CML after SCT, 10 patients with stable phase CML (SP-CML), 1 with accelerated phase (AP-CML), and 4 with blast phase (BP-CML). The dose of imatinib was 600 mg (n = 10) or 400 mg (n = 5) daily. Patients were followed for hematological, cytogenetic, and molecular response. A susbset of responders was followed for changes in donor-derived hematopoietic chimerism. RESULTS: Of the 10 patients with SP-CML, all achieved a hematological response. Within 3 months, five of these patients had achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCR). By six months, 9 of 10 patients had achieved CCR. The BCR-ABL transcript could not be detected by reverse transcription-PCR in 7 of these 9 patients. Patients who achieved CCR showed evidence of conversion to complete donor chimerism. No patient developed graft-versus-host disease. With a median follow up of 25 months, all patients are alive and 9 of 10 patients remain in CCR. Only one of the 5 patients with AP/BP-CML achieved a complete cytogenetic response. CONCLUSIONS: We find that imatinib is well tolerated in patients with SP-CML who relapse after SCT. Responses were rapid, durable, and associated with conversion to full donor chimerism without graft-versus-host disease. Imantinib was far less effective in patients who relapsed with AP/BP-CML. Imatinib should be evaluated as either an alternative or as an adjunct to donor lymphocyte infusions for patients with SP-CML who relapse after SCT.","['DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Hochberg, Ephraim P', 'Alyea, Edwin P', 'Longtine, Janina', 'Lee, Stephanie', 'Galinsky, Ilene', 'Parekkedon, Ben', 'Ritz, Jerome', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Soiffer, Robert J']","['DeAngelo DJ', 'Hochberg EP', 'Alyea EP', 'Longtine J', 'Lee S', 'Galinsky I', 'Parekkedon B', 'Ritz J', 'Antin JH', 'Stone RM', 'Soiffer RJ']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Adult Oncology, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/08/07 05:00,2005/03/08 09:00,['2004/08/07 05:00'],"['2004/08/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/07 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Aug 1;10(15):5065-71. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-03-0580.,"['10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-03-0580 [doi]', '10/15/5065 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LAQ824, a cinnamyl hydroxamate histone deacetylase inhibitor, is known to induce acetylation and inhibition of heat shock protein 90. Here, we determined the effects of LAQ824 and/or PKC412 (a FLT-3 kinase inhibitor) on the levels of mutant FLT-3 and its downstream signaling, as well as growth arrest and cell-death of cultured and primary human AML cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The effect of LAQ824 and/or PKC412 treatment was determined on the levels of FLT-3 and phosphorylated (p)-FLT-3, on downstream pro-growth and pro-survival effectors, e.g., p-STAT5, p-AKT, and p-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, and on the cell cycle status and apoptosis in the cultured MV4-11 and primary AML cells with mutant FLT-3. RESULTS: Treatment with LAQ824 promoted proteasomal degradation and attenuation of the levels of FLT-3 and p-FLT-3, associated with cell cycle G(1)-phase accumulation and apoptosis of MV4-11 cells. This was accompanied by attenuation of p-STAT5, p-AKT, and p-ERK1/2 levels. STAT-5 DNA-binding activity and the levels of c-Myc and oncostatin M were also down-regulated. Cotreatment with LAQ824 and PKC412 synergistically induced apoptosis of MV4-11 cells and induced more apoptosis of the primary AML cells expressing mutant FLT-3. This was also associated with more attenuation of p-FLT-3, p-AKT, p-ERK1/2, and p-STAT5. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of LAQ824 and PKC412 is highly active against human AML cells with mutant FLT-3, which merits in vivo studies of the combination against human AML.","['Bali, Purva', 'George, Prince', 'Cohen, Pamela', 'Tao, Jianguo', 'Guo, Fei', 'Sigua, Celia', 'Vishvanath, Anasuya', 'Scuto, Anna', 'Annavarapu, Srinivas', 'Fiskus, Warren', 'Moscinski, Lynn', 'Atadja, Peter', 'Bhalla, Kapil']","['Bali P', 'George P', 'Cohen P', 'Tao J', 'Guo F', 'Sigua C', 'Vishvanath A', 'Scuto A', 'Annavarapu S', 'Fiskus W', 'Moscinski L', 'Atadja P', 'Bhalla K']","['Department of Interdisciplinary Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida 33612, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (LAQ824)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Exons', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Milk Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2004/08/07 05:00,2005/03/08 09:00,['2004/08/07 05:00'],"['2004/08/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/07 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Aug 1;10(15):4991-7. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0210.,"['10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0210 [doi]', '10/15/4991 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression profiling has demonstrated to be a useful tool for molecular classification of tumors.

RESULTS: We found significant differences between the peripheral and lymphoblastic T-cell lymphomas, which include a deregulation of nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathway. We also identify differentially expressed genes between peripheral T-cell lymphoma tumors and normal T lymphocytes or reactive lymph nodes, which could represent candidate tumor markers of these lymphomas. Additionally, a close relationship between genes associated to survival and those that differentiate among the stages of disease and responses to therapy was found.

The remission induction rate was 91.0%, and the 3-year overall survival and event-free survival (EFS) rates, with 95% confidence intervals, were 58.2% (43.5%-72.9%) and 43.6% (28.5%-58.7%), respectively. Univariate analysis of EFS by presenting features indicated a poorer outcome in patients younger than 6 months of age with high white blood cell counts (>/= 100 x 10(9)/L; EFS rate, 9.4% versus 55.1% for all others, P = .0036) and in those with central nervous system invasion (EFS rate, 10.0% versus 56.9% for all others, P = .0073). The 3-year posttransplantation EFS rate for the 29 patients who underwent HSCT in first remission was 64.4% (46.4%-82.4%). In this subgroup, only the timing of HSCT (first remission versus others) was a significant risk factor by multivariate analysis (P < .0001). These results suggest that early introduction of HSCT, possibly with a less toxic conditioning regimen, may improve the prognosis for infants with MLL(+) ALL.

Recent studies have shown that a high level of minimal residual disease (MRD) at the end of induction is associated with an increased risk of relapse. We have developed and validated a real-time PCR method (RQ-PCR) to quantify MRD. We monitored 57 patients using IgH and TCR (Vdelta2Ddelta3) genes rearrangements as PCR targets. RQ-PCR was performed with a primer and a TaqMan probe designed to consensus sequences in VH segments in combination with one allele specific oligonucleotide primer complementary to the junctionnal region. A sensitivity of 10(-4) was reached for 72% of the IgH alleles (n = 50) and for 54,5% of the Vdelta2Ddelta3 alleles (n = 22). We compared the results with those obtained by competitive PCR in 53 patients: no discordance between the two methods was observed. Seventeen patients were found positive (32%) and 27 negative (51%) with both techniques and 9 children (17%) were positive only with TaqMan technology. RQ-PCR is more sensitive and more specific than competitive PCR.

The HIV Vif protein is able to protect both viruses from this innate restriction to infection. Here, we demonstrate that a number of other APOBEC family members from both humans and rodents can mediate anti-HIV effects, through cytidine deamination. Three of these, rat APOBEC1, mouse APOBEC3, and human APOBEC3B, are able to inhibit HIV infectivity even in the presence of Vif. Like APOBEC3G, human APOBEC3F preferentially restricts vif-deficient virus. Indeed, the mutation spectra and expression profile found for APOBEC3F indicate that this enzyme, together with APOBEC3G, accounts for the G to A hypermutation of proviruses described in HIV-infected individuals. Surprisingly, although MLV infectivity is acutely reduced by APOBEC3G, no other family member tested here had this effect. It is especially interesting that although both rodent APOBECs markedly diminish wild-type HIV infectivity, MLV is resistant to these proteins.

PBRs are expressed in human pancreatic islets, and cytokine-induced damage is accompanied by changes in their properties. We hypothesized that PBRs can have a role in human islet physiopathology, and evaluated the effects of prolonged exposure to two specific PBR ligands, PK11195 and Ro5-4864 on the function and survival of isolated human islets. DESIGN: Isolated human islets were prepared from the pancreas of 25 multiorgan cadaveric donors and incubated for 12 h in the presence of PK11195 or Ro5-4864. Insulin secretion studies and apoptosis experiments were then performed, together with assessment of intracellular pathways involved in islet cell function and survival. METHODS: Islets were prepared by enzymatic digestion and density gradient purification. Insulin secretion was assessed by the batch incubation method, and glucose oxidation was evaluated by the use of D-[U-(14)C]glucose. Apoptosis was studied using the TUNEL technique, ELISA methods, and electron microscopy evaluation. PCR experiments were performed by the use of specific primers. RESULTS: Glucose-stimulated insulin release was significantly lower after exposure to PK11195 than after exposure to Ro5-4864. This was accompanied by reduced glucose oxidation and no major change of insulin or GLUT-1 mRNA expression. Apoptosis was higher in PK11195-exposed islets, and electron microscopy demonstrated the involvement of beta-cells. The apoptotic effects were prevented by bongkrekic acid and low-dose cyclosporin A, which stabilize the mitochondrial membrane, and were associated with no evident change of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) or Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) expression. Caspase inhibition markedly reduced the amount of apoptosis, and the role of these proteases was confirmed by the increased activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged binding to PBRs may cause human beta-cells functional damage and apoptosis, a phenomenon which is prevented by stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane; occurs without changes of iNOS, Bax and Bcl-2 mRNA expression; and involves caspase activation. These results suggest an involvement of PBRs in human pancreatic beta-cell function and survival.","['Marselli, Lorella', 'Trincavelli, Letizia', 'Santangelo, Carmela', 'Lupi, Roberto', 'Del Guerra, Silvia', 'Boggi, Ugo', 'Falleni, Alessandra', 'Gremigni, Vittorio', 'Mosca, Franco', 'Martini, Claudia', 'Dotta, Francesco', 'Di Mario, Umberto', 'Del Prato, Stefano', 'Marchetti, Piero']","['Marselli L', 'Trincavelli L', 'Santangelo C', 'Lupi R', 'Del Guerra S', 'Boggi U', 'Falleni A', 'Gremigni V', 'Mosca F', 'Martini C', 'Dotta F', 'Di Mario U', 'Del Prato S', 'Marchetti P']","['Dipartimento di Endocrinologia e Metabolismo, Sezione Metabolismo, Universita di Pisa, via Paradisa 2, Ospedale Cisanello, 56100 Pisa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Endocrinol,European journal of endocrinology,9423848,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Benzodiazepinones)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2)', '0 (Hypolipidemic Agents)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, GABA-A)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', ""2QW0IK1742 (4'-chlorodiazepam)"", 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'YNF83VN1RL (PK 11195)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzodiazepinones/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2/genetics', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hypolipidemic Agents/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Insulin/genetics', 'Islets of Langerhans/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Isoquinolines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Ligands', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/genetics', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Receptors, GABA-A/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2004/08/07 05:00,2004/09/29 05:00,['2004/08/07 05:00'],"['2004/08/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/29 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/07 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Endocrinol. 2004 Aug;151(2):207-14. doi: 10.1530/eje.0.1510207.,['10.1530/eje.0.1510207 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The IC50 was found to be less than 4 microg/ml, a limit put forward by NCI for classification of the compound as a potential anti-cancer drug. The microscopy examination indicated that at cytocidal concentrations the HeLa and L120 cells died apoptotically. The comparative analysis revealed that berberine belongs to the camptothecin family of drugs characterized by the ability to induce DNA topoisomerase poisoning and hence apoptotic cell death.

However, patients with persisting marrow and/or blood involvement and those who fail peripheral blood hemopoietic progenitor mobilization are excluded from ASCT. For such patients with no available graft to infuse, we developed 15 years ago, before the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapeutic era, the use of the BEAM pretransplant regimen followed only by the administration of three cytokines (erythropoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor). We report here on the long-term follow-up of 33 patients treated with this approach. In all, 33 NHL patients underwent the BEAM (carmustine, VP-16, cytosine-arabinoside, melphalan) followed by the administration of the three cytokines from January 1994-2000. A backup marrow, albeit infiltrated by tumor cells, had been collected earlier and stored in all. A total of 30 patients (91%) recovered normal hematopoiesis. In total, 32 patients (97%) recovered neutrophils (>500/microl) at a median of 19 days and 30 patients (91%) recovered platelets (>20,000/microl) at a median of 26 days. Age, richness of backup graft and blood-hemoglobin level at intensification had an impact on the time for hematopoietic recovery (P=0.014, P=0.014, P=0.048). The median follow-up was 62 months. Five patients died from toxicity related to the procedure. Eight patients relapsed and died. A total of 20 patients (61%) are alive, 16 (49%) in complete remission. A 5-year disease-free survival was 52+/-9%, relapse incidence 35+/-16%, mortality due to the procedure 12+/-12% and overall survival 61+/-10%. The BEAM regimen is not myeloablative. The BEAM+3CK procedure is a feasible therapeutic option that has shown efficacy in poor risk NHL patients who were not eligible for autografting because of persisting marrow/blood tumor contamination, or poor hemopoietic progenitor harvesting. It is unclear today whether some of these patients would have cleared their marrow/peripheral blood with the additional use of anti-CD20 treatment, thereby making the classical approach (BEAM followed by the infusion of a clean autograft) feasible.","['Laporte, J Ph', 'Yeshurun, M', 'Fouillard, L', 'Labopin, M', 'Cailliot, C', 'Lesage, S', 'Isnard, F', 'Najman, A', 'Gorin, N-C']","['Laporte JP', 'Yeshurun M', 'Fouillard L', 'Labopin M', 'Cailliot C', 'Lesage S', 'Isnard F', 'Najman A', 'Gorin NC']","['Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Hopital Saint Antoine, Paris, France. jean-philippe.laporte@sat.ap-hop-paris.fr <jean-philippe.laporte@sat.ap-hop-paris.fr>']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'BEAM regimen']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carmustine/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Erythropoietin/*therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Melphalan/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",2004/08/06 05:00,2004/11/02 09:00,['2004/08/06 05:00'],"['2004/08/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/06 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Oct;18(10):1717-21. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403427.,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2403427 [doi]', '2403427 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of one of these intermediates--Smad3--in the pathogenesis of lymphoid neoplasia is unknown. METHODS: We measured Smad3 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein in leukemia cells obtained at diagnosis from 19 children with acute leukemia, including 10 with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 7 with pre-B-cell ALL, and 2 with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL). All nine exons of the SMAD3 gene (MADH3) were sequenced. Mice in which one or both alleles of Smad3 were inactivated were used to evaluate the role of Smad3 in the response of normal T cells to TGF-beta and in the susceptibility to spontaneous leukemogenesis in mice in which both alleles of the tumor suppressor p27Kip1 were deleted. RESULTS: Smad3 protein was absent in T-cell ALL but present in pre-B-cell ALL and ANLL. No mutations were found in the MADH3 gene in T-cell ALL, and Smad3 mRNA was present in T-cell ALL and normal T cells at similar levels. In mice, the loss of one allele for Smad3 impairs the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta on the proliferation of normal T cells and works in tandem with the homozygous inactivation of p27Kip1 to promote T-cell leukemogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of Smad3 protein is a specific feature of pediatric T-cell ALL. A reduction in Smad3 expression and the loss of p27Kip1 work synergistically to promote T-cell leukemogenesis in mice.","['Wolfraim, Lawrence A', 'Fernandez, Tania M', 'Mamura, Mizuko', 'Fuller, Walter L', 'Kumar, Rajesh', 'Cole, Diane E', 'Byfield, Stacey', 'Felici, Angelina', 'Flanders, Kathleen C', 'Walz, Thomas M', 'Roberts, Anita B', 'Aplan, Peter D', 'Balis, Frank M', 'Letterio, John J']","['Wolfraim LA', 'Fernandez TM', 'Mamura M', 'Fuller WL', 'Kumar R', 'Cole DE', 'Byfield S', 'Felici A', 'Flanders KC', 'Walz TM', 'Roberts AB', 'Aplan PD', 'Balis FM', 'Letterio JJ']","['Laboratory of Cell Regulation and Carcinogenesis, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Cdkn1b protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (SMAD3 protein, human)', '0 (Smad3 Protein)', '0 (Smad3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Child', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Exons', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smad3 Protein', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",2004/08/06 05:00,2004/08/11 05:00,['2004/08/06 05:00'],"['2004/08/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/11 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/06 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2004 Aug 5;351(6):552-9. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa031197.,"['10.1056/NEJMoa031197 [doi]', '351/6/552 [pii]']",,,,,,['Copyright 2004 Massachusetts Medical Society'],,,['N Engl J Med. 2004 Aug 5;351(6):528-30.

However, the cause of treatment failure in the remaining 20 percent of patients is largely unknown. METHODS: We tested leukemia cells from 173 children for sensitivity in vitro to prednisolone, vincristine, asparaginase, and daunorubicin. The cells were then subjected to an assessment of gene expression with the use of 14,500 probe sets to identify differentially expressed genes in drug-sensitive and drug-resistant ALL. Gene-expression patterns that differed according to sensitivity or resistance to the four drugs were compared with treatment outcome in the original 173 patients and an independent cohort of 98 children treated with the same drugs at another institution. RESULTS: We identified sets of differentially expressed genes in B-lineage ALL that were sensitive or resistant to prednisolone (33 genes), vincristine (40 genes), asparaginase (35 genes), or daunorubicin (20 genes). A combined gene-expression score of resistance to the four drugs, as compared with sensitivity to the four, was significantly and independently related to treatment outcome in a multivariate analysis (hazard ratio for relapse, 3.0; P=0.027). Results were confirmed in an independent population of patients treated with the same medications (hazard ratio for relapse, 11.85; P=0.019). Of the 124 genes identified, 121 have not previously been associated with resistance to the four drugs we tested. CONCLUSIONS: Differential expression of a relatively small number of genes is associated with drug resistance and treatment outcome in childhood ALL.","['Holleman, Amy', 'Cheok, Meyling H', 'den Boer, Monique L', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Veerman, Anjo J P', 'Kazemier, Karin M', 'Pei, Deqing', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Janka-Schaub, Gritta E', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Evans, William E']","['Holleman A', 'Cheok MH', 'den Boer ML', 'Yang W', 'Veerman AJ', 'Kazemier KM', 'Pei D', 'Cheng C', 'Pui CH', 'Relling MV', 'Janka-Schaub GE', 'Pieters R', 'Evans WE']","[""Division of Pediatric Oncology-Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogenes', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",2004/08/06 05:00,2004/08/11 05:00,['2004/08/06 05:00'],"['2004/08/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/11 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/06 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2004 Aug 5;351(6):533-42. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa033513.,"['10.1056/NEJMoa033513 [doi]', '351/6/533 [pii]']",,"['P30 CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM61393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM61394/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['Copyright 2004 Massachusetts Medical Society'],,,['N Engl J Med. 2004 Aug 5;351(6):601-3.

In the presence of GM-CSF, TNF-alpha, and/or IL-4, leukemia-derived DC are obtained that display features of immature DC (i-DC). The aim of this study was to determine whether i-DC of leukemic origin could be further differentiated into mature DC (m-DC) and to evaluate the possibility that leukemic m-DC could be effective in vivo as a tumor vaccine. Using CD40L as maturating agent, we show that leukemic i-DC can differentiate into cells that fulfill the phenotypic criteria of m-DC and, compared with normal counterparts, are functionally competent in vitro in terms of: 1) production of cytokines that support T cell activation and proliferation and drive Th1 polarization; 2) generation of autologous CD8(+) CTLs and CD4(+) T cells that are MHC-restricted and leukemia-specific; 3) migration from tissues to lymph nodes; 4) amplification of Ag presentation by monocyte attraction; 5) attraction of naive/resting and activated T cells. Irradiation of leukemic i-DC after CD40L stimulation did not affect their differentiating and functional capacity.

We have found that human MDR1 transfected murine L1210/VMDRC.06 leukemia cells exhibit relatively large amounts of Pgp and high levels of resistance to 6-mercaptopurine [6-MP] and other purine and pyrimidine nucleobase and nucleoside analogs. L1210/VMDRC.06 cells accumulated 6-MP as the nucleotide in vitro at only about one-third of that formed by parental L1210 cells in normal medium; however, under conditions of ATP-depletion, the amount of 6-MP nucleotide formed was essentially the same in both cell lines. The findings support active efflux of 6-MP in L1210 cells, suggesting involvement of Pgp in 6-MP resistance even though it is generally believed that Pgp does not transport such agents. The resistance pattern observed in L1210/VMDRC.06 cells was not duplicated in P388/VMDRC.04 leukemia cells transfected with the same MDR1 cDNA, even though a similar amount of Pgp was present in both cell lines. Immunofluorescent staining of surface membrane Pgp showed that L1210/VMDRC.06 cells contained at least three-fold more surface Pgp than P388/VMDRC.04, implying that P388/VMDRC.04 cells are unable to actively efflux 6-MP and other antimetabolites as effectively as L1210/VMDRC.06, because of significantly lower membrane Pgp. The findings suggest that the exceedingly large concentration of overexpressed Pgp in the surface membrane of L1210/MDRC.06 cells is responsible for resistance to 6-MP and other purine and pyrimidine analogs, even though these agents usually are not considered to be substrates for Pgp.","['Zeng, Hao', 'Lin, Z Ping', 'Sartorelli, Alan C']","['Zeng H', 'Lin ZP', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology and Developmental Therapeutics Program, Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '0 (Pyrimidine Nucleosides)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Purine Nucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidine Nucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Transfection']",2004/08/06 05:00,2004/09/17 05:00,['2004/08/06 05:00'],"['2004/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/06 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2004 Sep 1;68(5):911-21. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2004.06.004.,"['10.1016/j.bcp.2004.06.004 [doi]', 'S0006295204004150 [pii]']",,['HD39997/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, ferutinin-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells, and this event was preceded, in a cyclosporine-A sensitive manner, by a loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim) and by an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species.

Three types of apheresis were performed: leukapheresis, plasma exchange, dextran sulphate cellulose (DSC) low density lipoprotein (LDL)-apheresis. Three different types of continuous flow systems were used. Technical adaptation depending on patients blood volume, body mass index, hematocrit, type of system used, permitted us to perform complete aphereses, obtaining a high degree of tolerance and acceptability of the treatment. The use of plasmapheresis is regarded to be an extreme therapeutic measure in children. However, when the need for such treatment is undebatable, plasmapheresis must be done. A well-trained and experienced team can overcome the technical difficulties in order to complete the procedures without complications.

The present study investigated the influence of cysteine proteinase and proteasome inhibitors on chemokine production in lung epithelial cells and monocytic cells. The lung carcinoma cell lines A549, SK-MES, NCI-H727, virus-transformed bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B, primary lung epithelial cells, and the acute monocytic leukaemia cell lines Mono-Mac-6 and THP-1 were incubated with proteasome (N-acetyl-L-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-norleucinal (ALLN), beta-lactone) or cysteine proteinase inhibitor (L-trans-Epoxysuccinyl-Leu-3-methylbutylamide-ethyl ester) and the influence on chemokine production (interleukin-8: IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, RANTES) was quantified at protein and mRNA levels. Inhibition of proteasome activity by ALLN and beta-lactone resulted in significantly increased IL-8 secretion (5- to 22-fold). Cysteine proteinase inhibitors did not influence chemokine production. The simultaneous rise in IL-8 mRNA was caused by an increased half-life of mRNA and increased RNA synthesis. Moreover, analysis of transcription factor activation revealed induction of activator protein-1 (c-Jun) activity by proteasome inhibition, whereas nuclear factor-kappaB (p50 and p65) was not activated. The significant increase in IL-8 production after proteasome inhibition was also observed in primary lung epithelial cells and in monocytic cells. In addition, the secreted IL-8 was biologically active as shown by the neutrophil chemotaxis assay. In conclusion, it was shown that proteasome inhibitors stimulate interleukin-8 secretion in lung epithelial cells and monocytic cells, thus recruiting neutrophils.","['Gerber, A', 'Heimburg, A', 'Reisenauer, A', 'Wille, A', 'Welte, T', 'Buhling, F']","['Gerber A', 'Heimburg A', 'Reisenauer A', 'Wille A', 'Welte T', 'Buhling F']","['Institute of Immunology, Otto von Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany. annegret.gerber@medizin.uni-magdeburg.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur Respir J,The European respiratory journal,8803460,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Chemokines/*metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism', 'Lung/*cytology', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/physiology', 'Probability', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis/drug effects', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2004/08/06 05:00,2005/03/11 09:00,['2004/08/06 05:00'],"['2004/08/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/06 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur Respir J. 2004 Jul;24(1):40-8. doi: 10.1183/09031936.04.00079203.,['10.1183/09031936.04.00079203 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although these drugs have excellent anticancer effects, a major concern is drug resistance. We have investigated the case of a patient with Philadelphia chromosome-positive and CD20+ acute lymphocytic leukemia who acquired resistance to imatinib and rituximab. Imatinib therapy resulted in prompt cytogenetic remission, but resistance developed shortly thereafter. Sequencing of the kinase domain of the ABL gene and allele-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed a point mutation resulting in an E255V substitution that was present before the therapy. After the patient received mild chemotherapy followed by rituximab administration, hematologic and cytogenetic remission was sustained for 5.5 months. The recurrent leukemic cells after the rituximab therapy showed not only the E255V mutation in the ABL gene but also loss of the CD20 antigen due to impaired transcription of the CD20 gene. The results of 2-color flow cytometry analysis showed that a small population of CD20(-) leukemic cells existed before the imatinib therapy. These results suggest that leukemic subclones carrying a genetic perturbation of the targeted molecules for both imatinib and rituximab were present before the therapies. The preexistence of primary resistant clones suggests the inability of combination therapy with 2 molecularly targeted drugs to overcome drug resistance in leukemia.","['Hato, Takaaki', 'Yamanouchi, Jun', 'Tamura, Tatsushiro', 'Hojo, Norimasa', 'Niiya, Yasunari', 'Kohno, Masashi', 'Bando, Shiro', 'Yakushijin, Yoshihiro', 'Takada, Kiyonori', 'Sakai, Ikuya', 'Yasukawa, Masaki', 'Fujita, Shigeru']","['Hato T', 'Yamanouchi J', 'Tamura T', 'Hojo N', 'Niiya Y', 'Kohno M', 'Bando S', 'Yakushijin Y', 'Takada K', 'Sakai I', 'Yasukawa M', 'Fujita S']","['Division of Blood Transfusion, Ehime University School of Medicine, Shitsukawa, Shigenobu, Onsen-gun, Ehime, Japan. takahato@m.ehime-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Benzamides', 'Clone Cells', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rituximab']",2004/08/06 05:00,2004/09/04 05:00,['2004/08/06 05:00'],"['2004/08/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/06 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2004 Jul;80(1):62-6. doi: 10.1532/ijh97.04033.,['10.1532/ijh97.04033 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we quantitatively determined the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profile for survivin by a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique in 113 patients with leukemias, such as adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia in crisis, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and in 25 cell lines, including 7 ATL cell lines and 15 solid-tumor cell lines. Furthermore, we examined whether the plasma level of survivin protein as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) substituted for mRNA expression by PCR quantification. Gene expression was quantitatively confirmed to be up-regulated in approximately 90% of ATL and acute leukemia cases and in all of the cell lines tested, whereas it was down-regulated in almost all cases of CLL. Furthermore, with respect to the interpretation of the gene expression findings, attention was paid to standardization with a housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), in the real-time PCR quantification, because the variability in GAPDH expression among the different cell types was significant. GAPDH expression was relatively low in ATL cells and high in ALL and AML cells. The rates of increase in the levels of survivin protein in the plasma of ATL patients and in the supernatants from in vitro cultures of solid-tumor cell lines were low compared with rates of increase of the mRNA and protein level in the cells, suggesting that the protein levels in plasma do not always reflect survivin expression in tumor cells.

We analyzed the clinicopathologic findings for 17 patients with T-ALL/LBL diagnosed since 1993 and whose radiologic findings were available. Data on 14 men and 3 women with a median age of 26 years (range, 10-61 years) were analyzed. On the basis of radiologic findings, the cases were divided into thymic type (n = 8) and nonthymic type (n = 9). Patients with the thymic type of T-ALL/LBL had a large mediastinal mass and minimal systemic lymphadenopathy only in the supradiaphragmatic region. Those with the non-thymic type had predominantly systemic lymphadenopathy that included infradiaphragmatic lesions. Expression of CD8 (6/7 versus 0/9) was more frequently found in the thymic type (P < .001), whereas expression of CD56 (0/7 versus 5/9) was more frequent in the nonthymic type (P = .034).

The third group of survivors viewed their quality of life as worse. They found no meaning in their experience and evaluated the situation with bitterness. Thus the core of living through having acute leukemia or highly malignant lymphoma seemed to be to find meaning with it and the profound crisis it meant to them.

To determine a safe and tolerable dose for efficacy studies the acute toxicity following intravenous injection in the tail vein was monitored using a 14-day schedule with up to four doses. The highest tested dose, 25 micromoles/kg, was considered close to this level, with minor effects on body weight gain but significant effects on hematological parameters. Melphalan and J1 appeared equitoxic with no statistically significant differences. Subsequently a mouse hollow fiber model was employed with subcutaneous implantation of fibers containing human tumor cells. Three different human tumor cell lines as well as two samples of primary human tumor cells (ovarian carcinoma and chronic lymphatic leukemia) were used as tumor models. At the dose level tested there was a marked and statistically significant decrease in both T-cell leukemia CCRF-CEM and small cell lung cancer NCI-H69 tumor cell growth and viability in response to J1 as compared with both placebo and melphalan treated groups. In primary ovarian carcinoma cells only J1 treatment resulted in significant tumor regression (net cell kill). In summary the results indicate that, despite an expected short half time in the blood circulation, the promising in vitro data from the previous studies of J1 seems translatable into the in vivo situation. At equal doses of alkylating units J1, compared to melphalan, was more active in the mouse hollow-fiber model, but showed similar general toxicity.","['Gullbo, Joachim', 'Lindhagen, Elin', 'Bashir-Hassan, Saadia', 'Tullberg, Marcus', 'Ehrsson, Hans', 'Lewensohn, Rolf', 'Nygren, Peter', 'De La Torre, Manuel', 'Luthman, Kristina', 'Larsson, Rolf']","['Gullbo J', 'Lindhagen E', 'Bashir-Hassan S', 'Tullberg M', 'Ehrsson H', 'Lewensohn R', 'Nygren P', 'De La Torre M', 'Luthman K', 'Larsson R']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Uppsala University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (L-melphalanyl-p-L-fluorophenylalanine ethyl ester)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dipeptides/*pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melphalan/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Toxicity Tests, Acute']",2004/08/05 05:00,2005/09/08 09:00,['2004/08/05 05:00'],"['2004/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2004 Nov;22(4):411-20. doi: 10.1023/B:DRUG.0000036683.10945.bb.,"['10.1023/B:DRUG.0000036683.10945.bb [doi]', '5273865 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our culture conditions Naph-DNB showed a good inhibiting activity against all cell lines tested, with IC(50)s varying within a narrow micromolar range of concentrations (2.0 +/- 0.2-14.3 +/- 2.3 microM). In particular, murine P388 (leukemia), human Jurkat (leukemia), A2780, PA-1 (ovarian carcinoma) and Saos-2 (osteosarcoma) cells showed the highest sensitivity to the inhibiting potential of Naph-DNB, while human A549 (non small cell lung cancer, NSCLC), MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer), HGC-27 (gastric cancer) and HCT-8 (colon carcinoma) were the least sensitive cell lines. Moreover, the analysis of cytotoxicity of Naph-DNB evaluated by the TB test showed that this compound was able to kill cells with IC(50)s ranging from 1.7 to 39.2 microM. The study of the induction of apoptosis was carried out by 4'-6-diamidine-2'-phenylindole (DAPI) staining of segmented nuclei, western blot of p53 protein and TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) method, while the interaction with DNA was evaluated through the analysis of interstrand cross-link (ISCL) formation. Our data show that in all cell lines tested Naph-DNB was able to form ISCLs, to upregulate p53 oncosuppressor-protein and to induce apoptosis. Moreover, TUNEL analysis also suggested that Naph-DNB, similarly to other anticancer drugs, was able to block cells in the G (0)/ G (1) phase of the cell cycle. In conclusion our data suggest that Naph-DNB may be an effective novel lead molecule for the design of new anticancer compounds.","['Viale, Maurizio', 'Mariggio, Maria A', 'Ottone, Massimo', 'Chiavarina, Barbara', 'Vinella, Angela', 'Prevosto, Claudia', ""Dell'Erba, Carlo"", 'Petrillo, Giovanni', 'Novi, Marino']","['Viale M', 'Mariggio MA', 'Ottone M', 'Chiavarina B', 'Vinella A', 'Prevosto C', ""Dell'Erba C"", 'Petrillo G', 'Novi M']","['Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, S.C. di Farmacologia e Neuroscienze, Lgo R.

CASE SUMMARY: A 53-year-old obese African American woman weighing 136 kg (ideal body weight [IBW] 55 kg) with new-onset chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in leukocytic blast crisis was treated with hydroxyurea 5 g daily. In addition, she received allopurinol 300 mg daily for prevention of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). The following day, allopurinol was discontinued and rasburicase was administered at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg of IBW for a serum uric acid level of 11.9 mg/dL. The patient's serum uric acid level decreased to 1.9 mg/dL 48 hours after a single dose. DISCUSSION: Rasburicase is indicated for the initial management of elevated plasma uric acid levels in patients with hematologic and solid tumor malignancies who are at risk for TLS. This case is unique because the patient received one dose of rasburicase followed by allopurinol rather than 5 daily doses of rasburicase. Additionally, the dose was based on IBW rather than actual body weight. Efficacy of this approach is apparent from the uric acid levels and the lack of hemodialysis requirements. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of rasburicase (based on IBW) followed by allopurinol can effectively prevent TLS based on serum uric acid concentration. This approach resulted in a substantial cost savings.","['Arnold, Tamra M', 'Reuter, Jameson P', 'Delman, Bryna S', 'Shanholtz, Carl B']","['Arnold TM', 'Reuter JP', 'Delman BS', 'Shanholtz CB']","['University of Maryland Medical Center, Baltimore, MD 21201-1595, USA. tarnold@umm.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '08GY9K1EUO (rasburicase)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', '63CZ7GJN5I (Allopurinol)', 'EC 1.7.3.3 (Urate Oxidase)']",IM,"['Allopurinol/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/complications', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Urate Oxidase/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Uric Acid/blood']",2004/08/05 05:00,2004/10/27 09:00,['2004/08/05 05:00'],"['2004/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2004 Sep;38(9):1428-31. doi: 10.1345/aph.1E002.

Here, we show that SHP expression increases during monocytic differentiaton with exposure HL-60 leukemia cells to a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) response element, whose treatment induced the SHP promoter activity dependent on c-Jun expression, which is well known to be involved in the commitment step in the TPA-induced differentiation of HL-60 leukemia cells. We also show that overexpression and activation signaling of c-Jun increase the SHP promoter activity, suggesting that the level of SHP expression is normally limiting for c-Jun-dependent monocytic differentiation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using oligonucleotides derived from the SHP promoter reveal that c-Jun exhibit TPA-induced DNA binding, providing a mechanism for the transcriptional activation of SHP gene expression. It was also found that overexpression of SHP and c-Jun greatly facilitated monocytic differentiation by TPA and surprisingly, that expression of SHP or c-Jun alone was sufficient to make cells differentiate into functionally mature monocytes, but silencing of SHP and c-Jun by RNA interference diminished the TPA-induced monocytic differentiation. Taken together, these works suggest that c-Jun works to activate the expression of SHP genes associated with the cascade regulation of monocytic differentiation.","['Choi, Yoon Ha', 'Park, Min Jung', 'Kim, Kook Whan', 'Lee, Hyung Chul', 'Choi, Young Hyun', 'Cheong, Jaehun']","['Choi YH', 'Park MJ', 'Kim KW', 'Lee HC', 'Choi YH', 'Cheong J']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Pusan National University, Busan, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 2)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/genetics/*metabolism', 'Response Elements/drug effects/genetics', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/genetics']",2004/08/05 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/08/05 05:00'],"['2004/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2004 Nov;76(5):1082-8. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1203658.

However, the way in which beta-HIVS induces apoptosis remains to be clarified. In this study, we performed cDNA array analysis and found that beta-HIVS suppressed the expression of the gene for tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1), which is a member of the heat-shock family of proteins. When human leukemia HL60 cells and human lung cancer DMS114 cells were treated with beta-HIVS, the amount of TRAP1 in mitochondria decreased in a time-dependent manner during apoptosis. A similar reduction in the level of TRAP1 was also observed upon exposure of cells to VP16. Treatment of DMS114 cells with TRAP1-specific siRNA sensitized the cells to beta-HIVS-induced apoptosis. Moreover, the reduction in the level of expression of TRAP1 by TRAP1-specific siRNA enhanced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria when DMS114 cells were treated with either beta-HIVS or VP16. The suppression of the level of TRAP1 by either beta-HIVS or VP16 was blocked by N-acetyl-cysteine, indicating the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the regulation of the expression of TRAP1. These results suggest that suppression of the expression of TRAP1 in mitochondria might play an important role in the induction of apoptosis caused via formation of ROS.","['Masuda, Yutaka', 'Shima, Genryu', 'Aiuchi, Toshihiro', 'Horie, Masayo', 'Hori, Kouichi', 'Nakajo, Shigeo', 'Kajimoto, Sachiko', 'Shibayama-Imazu, Toshiko', 'Nakaya, Kazuyasu']","['Masuda Y', 'Shima G', 'Aiuchi T', 'Horie M', 'Hori K', 'Nakajo S', 'Kajimoto S', 'Shibayama-Imazu T', 'Nakaya K']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Showa University, Tokyo 142-8555, Japan. masuda@pharm.showa-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (TRAP1 protein, human)', '0 (beta-hydroxyisovalerylshikonin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coloring Agents/pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mitochondria/metabolism/pathology', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",2004/08/05 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/08/05 05:00'],"['2004/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Oct 8;279(41):42503-15. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M404256200.

Cross-talk between the cAMP and the retinoic acid signaling pathways.,42026-40,"Inhibition of phosphodiesterase IV by N-(3,5-dichloropyrid-4-yl)-3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxybenzamide (piclamilast) enhances the myeloid differentiation induced by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha), or retinoic acid receptor X agonists in NB4 and other retinoid-sensitive myeloid leukemia cell types. ATRA-resistant NB4.R2 cells are also partially responsive to the action of piclamilast and retinoic acid receptor X agonists. Treatment of NB4 cells with piclamilast or ATRA results in activation of the cAMP signaling pathway and nuclear translocation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. This causes a transitory increase in cAMP-responsive element-binding protein phosphorylation, which is followed by down-modulation of the system. ATRA + piclamilast have no additive effects on the modulation of the cAMP pathway, and the combination has complex effects on cAMP-regulated genes. Piclamilast potentiates the ligand-dependent transactivation and degradation of RARalpha through a cAMP-dependent protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation. Enhanced transactivation is also observed in the case of PML-RARalpha. In NB4 cells, increased transactivation is likely to be at the basis of enhanced myeloid maturation and enhanced expression of many retinoid-dependent genes. Piclamilast and/or ATRA exert major effects on the expression of cEBP and STAT1, two types of transcription factors involved in myeloid maturation. Induction and activation of STAT1 correlates directly with enhanced cytodifferentiation. Finally, ERK and the cAMP target protein, Epac, do not participate in the maturation program activated by ATRA + piclamilast. Initial in vivo studies conducted in severe combined immunodeficiency mice transplanted with NB4 leukemia cells indicate that the enhancing effect of piclamilast on ATRA-induced myeloid maturation translates into a therapeutic benefit.","['Parrella, Edoardo', ""Gianni', Maurizio"", 'Cecconi, Virginia', 'Nigro, Elisa', 'Barzago, Maria Monica', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Rochette-Egly, Cecile', 'Terao, Mineko', 'Garattini, Enrico']","['Parrella E', ""Gianni' M"", 'Cecconi V', 'Nigro E', 'Barzago MM', 'Rambaldi A', 'Rochette-Egly C', 'Terao M', 'Garattini E']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Centro Catullo e Daniela Borgomainerio, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche ""Mario Negri,"" via Eritrea 62, Milano 20157, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', ""EC 3.1.4.17 (3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases)"", 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4)', 'WM58D7C3ZT (piclamilast)']",IM,"[""3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases/*antagonists & inhibitors"", 'Animals', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Retinoids/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Second Messenger Systems/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/drug effects', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/08/05 05:00,2004/11/16 09:00,['2004/08/05 05:00'],"['2004/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Oct 1;279(40):42026-40. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M406530200.

Eighty-seven of 104 patients achieved complete remission (84%). Eighty-six proceeded to consolidation therapy (2 withdrew after the first and second courses). Deaths in remission occurred during consolidation and maintenance therapy in 3 and 4 patients, respectively. One patient showed molecular persistence after consolidation and 5 had a relapse. The 6-year cumulative incidence of relapse, leukemia-free survival, and disease-free survival were 8.5%, 91%, and 79%, respectively. A significantly higher incidence of low-risk patients found among the elderly, as compared to younger patients, may partially account for the low relapse rate observed.

Expression of Tax under the regulation of the human granzyme B promoter in mice results in a lymphoproliferative disorder resembling adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). Tax expression is associated with the production of high levels interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in HTLV-1-infected CD4(+) cells and Tax-transgenic tumors. We examined the role of IFN-gamma in tumorigenesis, by mating Tax-transgenic mice with a gene-specific knockout for IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma(-/-) Tax(+)-transgenic mice show accelerated tumor onset (median, 4 versus 6 months), dissemination (median, 5 versus 7 months), and death (median, 7 versus 10 months), compared with IFN-gamma(+/-) or IFN-gamma(+/+) Tax(+) mice. Pathologic and immunophenotypic characteristics of tumors from all genotypes are indistinguishable, except for enhanced interleukin 2 receptor-beta (IL-2Rbeta) and suppressed intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression on tumors from IFN-gamma(-/-) Tax(+) transgenic mice. IFN-gamma(-/-) tumors demonstrate enhanced CD31 (platelet-endothelial CAM-1 [PECAM-1]) staining compared with those from IFN-gamma(+/-) or IFN-gamma(+/+) Tax(+) mice. Angiogenesis-specific cDNA microarray analysis identified 4 mediators of angiogenic growth differentially expressed in tumors from Tax(+)IFN-gamma(-/-) mice compared with Tax(+)IFN-gamma(+/+) littermates. As confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), loss of IFN-gamma results in down-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) while up-regulating expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tenascin C. These results provide insight into a possible mechanism by which IFN-gamma contributes to host resistance against HTLV-induced tumors through an angiostatic effect.","['Mitra-Kaushik, Shibani', 'Harding, John', 'Hess, Jay', 'Schreiber, Robert', 'Ratner, Lee']","['Mitra-Kaushik S', 'Harding J', 'Hess J', 'Schreiber R', 'Ratner L']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, 660 S Euclid Ave, Box 8069, St Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Age of Onset', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/deficiency/*genetics', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*immunology/mortality/pathology/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism']",2004/08/05 05:00,2004/12/24 09:00,['2004/08/05 05:00'],"['2004/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Nov 15;104(10):3305-11. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-01-0266.

Systemic mastocytosis is a haematopoietic neoplasm that behaves as an indolent myeloproliferative disease in most patients, but can also present as aggressive disease or even as an acute leukaemia. In patients with aggressive disease or mast cell leukaemia, the response to conventional therapy is poor in most cases, and the prognosis is grave. Therefore, a number of attempts have been made to define novel treatment strategies for these patients. One promising approach may be to identify novel targets and to develop targeted drug therapies. In this article, we support the notion that neoplastic mast cells indeed express a number of potential molecular targets including immunoreactive CD antigens, the microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF), and members of the Bcl-2 family. In addition, the tyrosine kinase receptor KIT and downstream signalling pathways have been proposed as targets of a specific pharmacological intervention. A particular challenge is the disease-related D816V-mutated variant of KIT, which is resistant against diverse tyrosine kinase inhibitors including STI571, but may be sensitive to more recently developed targeted compounds. The therapeutic potential of target-specific approaches in malignant mast cell disorders should be evaluated in forthcoming clinical trials in the near future.","['Valent, P', 'Ghannadan, M', 'Akin, C', 'Krauth, M-T', 'Selzer, E', 'Mayerhofer, M', 'Sperr, W R', 'Arock, M', 'Samorapoompichit, P', 'Horny, H-P', 'Metcalfe, D D']","['Valent P', 'Ghannadan M', 'Akin C', 'Krauth MT', 'Selzer E', 'Mayerhofer M', 'Sperr WR', 'Arock M', 'Samorapoompichit P', 'Horny HP', 'Metcalfe DD']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria. peter.valent@meduniwien.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,0245331,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Humans', 'Mast Cells/pathology', 'Mastocytosis/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Stem Cells/pathology']",2004/08/05 05:00,2004/12/18 09:00,['2004/08/05 05:00'],"['2004/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Invest. 2004 Aug;34 Suppl 2:41-52. doi: 10.1111/j.0960-135X.2004.01369.x.,"['10.1111/j.0960-135X.2004.01369.x [doi]', 'ECI1369 [pii]']",,,125,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although AML cells only have a limited potential to undergo differentiation and maturation, each AML clone is organized in a hierarchical manner similar to normal haematopoiesis. Recent data have shown that each AML clone consists of leukaemic stem cells and their progeny, and that AML stem cells differ from more mature cells in several aspects, including survival and target antigen profiles. Most importantly, AML stem cells, but not their progeny, have the capacity to repopulate haematopoietic tissues with leukaemias in NOD/SCID mice. Furthermore, AML stem cells are thought to be responsible for the infinite growth of leukaemias in patients with AML. The phenotypic properties of AML stem cells have also been described. In most cases, these cells are detectable within the CD34+, CD38-, Lin-, CD123+ subpopulation of AML cells. Because of their AML-initiating and -renewing capacity and their unique phenotype, which includes several molecular targets of drug therapy, AML stem cells have recently been proposed as novel important target cell populations in the context of curative therapies. The present article gives an overview of our knowledge about AML stem cells, their phenotype, and their role as a 'therapy-target' in new concepts to treat and to cure patients with AML.","['Sperr, W R', 'Hauswirth, A W', 'Florian, S', 'Ohler, L', 'Geissler, K', 'Valent, P']","['Sperr WR', 'Hauswirth AW', 'Florian S', 'Ohler L', 'Geissler K', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria. wolfgang.r.sperr@univie.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,0245331,,IM,"['Forecasting', 'Gene Targeting/methods', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/*therapy', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Phenotype']",2004/08/05 05:00,2004/12/18 09:00,['2004/08/05 05:00'],"['2004/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Invest. 2004 Aug;34 Suppl 2:31-40. doi: 10.1111/j.0960-135X.2004.01368.x.,"['10.1111/j.0960-135X.2004.01368.x [doi]', 'ECI1368 [pii]']",,,108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent data suggest that angiogenic cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), are up-regulated in CML, and play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. These factors appear to be produced and released in leukaemic cells in patients with CML. In line with this notion, increased serum-levels of angiogenic growth factors are measurable in CML patients.

Molecular genetic studies for EBV-clonality by Southern blot hybridization showed a clonal population of infected cells, implying that this was an EBV induced lesion. The chronology of events suggest that Cladribine, a purine analog which has been previously described to induce long-lasting immunodeficiency, can, in some cases, weaken the host defense mechanism to a level at which an innocuous EBV infection may transform the normal lymphoid cells into an aggressive neoplasm.

In this study, we demonstrated Bryostatin-induced differentiation in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells, characterized by an increase in cell size and a marked up-regulation of CD11c expression. The specific inhibitors of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and protein kinase C pathways, PD98059 and GF 109203X respectively, each completely blocked Bryostatin-induced differentiation of B-CLL cells, suggesting that activation of the ERK pathway plays a direct role in this process in a PKC-dependent manner. Furthermore, Bryostatin reduced both spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis with chlorambucil, fludarabine and 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (2-Cda) in B-CLL cells. This resistance was associated with an early up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 and post-translational phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at serine 70. The anti-apoptotic effects of Bryostatin were abrogated by GF 109203X, and to a lesser extent by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) inhibitor, LY294002. Interestingly, the ERK inhibitor, PD98059 inhibited Mcl-1 expression but had little effect on Bryostatin-induced survival suggesting that the ERK pathway predominantly affects differentiation. Taken together these results present an explanation for Bryostatin-induced B-CLL cell survival in which modulation of the PKC pathway couples differentiation with an increase in antiapoptotic protein expression and calls into question the rationale for its use in the treatment of B-CLL.","['Thomas, Alun', 'Pepper, Chris', 'Hoy, Terry', 'Bentley, Paul']","['Thomas A', 'Pepper C', 'Hoy T', 'Bentley P']","['Department of Haematology, Llandough Hospital, Penlan Road, Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, CF64 2XX, UK. alunt@llanhaem.demon.co.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2004/08/05 05:00,2004/12/31 09:00,['2004/08/05 05:00'],"['2004/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/31 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 May;45(5):997-1008. doi: 10.1080/10428190310001639470.,['10.1080/10428190310001639470 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell growth was inhibited by 50% (IC50) upon 2-day treatment with As2O3 or PAO at 0.54 and 0.06 microM, respectively in NB4 cells (P = 0.025), and 2.80 and 0.08 microM, respectively in NB4/As (P = 0.030). 0.1 microM PAO increased the proportion of hypodiploid cells (50.3%) by a greater degree than the same dose of As2O3 (3.8%) in NB4 cells. In NB4 cells, 0.1 microM PAO reduced the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (20.5% in a PI(negative)-Rhodamine123(low) fraction) by a greater degree than 1 microM As2O3 (7.1%). Western blotting showed that 0.1 microM PAO downregulated the expression of both Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) proteins, whereas I microM As2O3 downregulated only Bcl-2 expression. These results suggest that the cytotoxic effect of PAO on an APL cell line and As2O3-resistant subline is significantly higher than that of As2O3. PAO-induced apoptosis seems to be related to the activation of the mitochondrial pathway and downregulation of both Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L). PAO is a considerable agent for relapsed/refractory APL and for purging APL cells following stem cell transplantation.","['Sahara, Naohi', 'Takeshita, Akihiro', 'Kobayashi, Miki', 'Shigeno, Kazuyuki', 'Nakamura, Satoki', 'Shinjo, Kaori', 'Naito, Kensuke', 'Maekawa, Masato', 'Horii, Toshinobu', 'Ohnishi, Kazunori', 'Kitamura, Kunio', 'Naoe, Tomoki', 'Hayash, Hideharu', 'Ohno, Ryuzo']","['Sahara N', 'Takeshita A', 'Kobayashi M', 'Shigeno K', 'Nakamura S', 'Shinjo K', 'Naito K', 'Maekawa M', 'Horii T', 'Ohnishi K', 'Kitamura K', 'Naoe T', 'Hayash H', 'Ohno R']","['Internal Medicine III, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan. sahara@hama-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0HUR2WY345 (oxophenylarsine)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'bcl-X Protein']",2004/08/05 05:00,2004/12/31 09:00,['2004/08/05 05:00'],"['2004/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/31 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 May;45(5):987-95. doi: 10.1080/10428190310001617222.,['10.1080/10428190310001617222 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism(s) by which 4-HPR mediates its anti-proliferative effects remains unclear. Here, we determined whether 4-HPR induced growth inhibition and gene expression involve retinoid receptors in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells (HL-60). We treated HL-60 and ATRA-resistant HL-60 (HL-60R) cells that express mutated RARalpha and very low levels of RARbeta, RARgamma and RXRalpha with 4-HPR (2 microM) for 3 days. 4-HPR showed significant anti-proliferative effects against both cell types and induced growth inhibition (92.7%) in HL-60 cells. However, at the same dose, 4-HPR induced only 53.4% growth inhibition in HL-60R cells. Growth inhibition by 4-HPR was significantly enhanced in HL-60R cells that were retroviraly transduced to express human RARalpha, RARbeta or RXRalpha (95.6%, 97.1%, and 75.6%, respectively), in comparison to HL-60R cells (P < 0.05), but not in HL-60R cells expressing RARgamma. Although ATRA and 4-HPR induced expression of CYP26, an ATRA-inducible gene encoding a cytochrome P450 enzyme, in HL-60 cells, both retinoids failed to induce CYP26 in HL-60R cells. However, induction of CYP26 mRNA by 4-HPR was restored in HL-60R cells expressing RARalpha and RARgamma, but not RARbeta and RXRalpha. In conclusion, our data suggest that nuclear retinoid receptors are involved in 4-HPR-induced growth inhibition and gene expression, and that 4-HPR can mediate its anti-proliferative effects through retinoid receptor-dependent mechanisms in HL-60 cells.","['Ozpolat, Bulent', 'Tari, Ana M', 'Mehta, Kapil', 'Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel']","['Ozpolat B', 'Tari AM', 'Mehta K', 'Lopez-Berestein G']","['Section of Immunobiology and Drug Carriers, Department of Bioimmunotherapy, The University of Texas M.

In patients with t(8;21) positive AML no consensus exists over the disappearance of the AML1/ETO fusion transcript during the course of disease and most studies reported reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positivity as a common finding after consolidation chemotherapy, autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). In our single center study, we performed RT-PCR monitoring in 14 patients with t(8;21) in CR1 (n = 13) and/or CR2 (n = 4). The median number of bone marrow (BM) and/or peripheral blood (PB) samples per patient was 18 (range, 2-43). In 5 out of 6 cases relapse occurred after persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD) in CR for 4-14 months. The sixth patient relapsed despite molecular remission (MR) in BM and PB for 3 months, molecular relapse preceded hematological relapse for 7 months. Eleven patients with a median follow-up of 7.8 (range, 1.5-15.4) years are in persistent CR and MR after consolidation chemotherapy (n = 7). mainly with repetitive cycles of high-dose Ara-C, autologous (n = 1) or myeloablative allogeneic (n = 3) stem cell transplantation. Molecular remission was attained immediately after alloSCT, but after 6-26 months in CR in patients with consolidation chemotherapy. In 7 patients, MRD was only studied in long-term remission. In conclusion, long-term CR was associated with persistent molecular disease-eradication. In our patients, molecular remission was a prerequisite but not a guarantee for long-term disease-free survival. Hematological relapse never occurred without prior molecular relapse. Due to the slow kinetics of AML1/ETO after consolidation chemotherapy the value of qualitative RT-PCR to predict early relapse is limited. In this situation quantitative RT-PCR might help to define individual relapse risk and to improve as well as facilitate clinical decision-making.","['Mitterbauer, Margit', 'Mitterbauer-Hohendanner, Gerlinde', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Kalhs, Peter', 'Greinix, Hildegard T', 'Fonatsch, Christa', 'Haas, Oskar A', 'Jager, Ulrich', 'Mannhalter, Christine', 'Lechner, Klaus']","['Mitterbauer M', 'Mitterbauer-Hohendanner G', 'Sperr WR', 'Kalhs P', 'Greinix HT', 'Fonatsch C', 'Haas OA', 'Jager U', 'Mannhalter C', 'Lechner K']","['Department of Medicine I, Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University Hospital of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the human Pim-2 (hPim-2) expression is altered in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). We analyzed hPim-2 expression in 48 patients with NHL and CLL by quantitative in-situ hybridization, quantitative RT-PCR and FACS analysis. In-situ hybridization revealed a 5.5 +/- 2.2 times higher expression of hPim-2 in NHL over normal lymphocytes (P < 0.001). Similarly, with quantitative RT-PCR, expression in NHL was 1.5 to 2.6 times higher in involved splenic foci compared to nearby uninvolved regions (n = 3). hPim-2 mRNA was increased 3-folds in B-CLL over normal B-cells (P < 0.006). The increased hPim-2 levels correlated with lymphocyte doubling time (DT), in that mRNA levels were two times greater in patients with rapid DT (P < 0.006). Moreover, a significant correlation was found between hPim-2 expression and the Binet staging system of CLL (P < 0.022). The hPIM-2-protein expression was also upregulated in CLL, as assessed by FACS analysis. Therefore, this report provides direct evidence for a linkage of hPim-2 upregulation to NHL and CLL in man. This relationship between hPim-2 and NHL and CLL raises a number of novel mechanistic options for the genesis and/or progression of some types of human lymphomas.","['Cohen, Amos M', 'Grinblat, Borislava', 'Bessler, Hanna', 'Kristt, Donald', 'Kremer, Alona', 'Schwartz, Ariel', 'Halperin, Marisa', 'Shalom, Sarah', 'Merkel, Drorit', 'Don, Jeremy']","['Cohen AM', 'Grinblat B', 'Bessler H', 'Kristt D', 'Kremer A', 'Schwartz A', 'Halperin M', 'Shalom S', 'Merkel D', 'Don J']","['Hematology Unit, Rabin Medical Center, Golda-Hasharon Campus, Petah-Tikva, and Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel. amosc@clalit.org.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (PIM2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Up-Regulation']",2004/08/05 05:00,2004/12/31 09:00,['2004/08/05 05:00'],"['2004/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/31 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 May;45(5):951-5. doi: 10.1080/10428190310001641251.,['10.1080/10428190310001641251 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty six CD20 antigen positive patients, 15 with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and 11 with low grade non-Hodgin's lymphoma (LG-NHL) were enrolled to the study. Fourteen patients (53.8%) had refractory disease, the other 12 (46.2%) were recurrent after prior chemotherapy. RC regimen consisted of RIT at a dose of 375 mg/m2 in 6 h infusion on day 1 and 2-CdA at a dose of 0.12 mg/kg, in 2 h infusion, given on days 2-6. The RC courses were repeated at 4 week intervals or longer if severe myelosuppression occurred. Seventy eight cycles of RC with median of 3 cycles per patient were administered (range 1-5 cycles). Four patients (15.4%) (95% CI 1.5-29.3%), 1 with B-CLL and 3 with LG-NHL, achieved a complete response (CR). Fourteen patients (53,8%) (95%CI 34.6-72.9%), including 10 with B-CLL and 4 with LG-NHL, had a partial response (PR). Overall response rate (OR) was 69.2% (95%CI 51.4-86.9%) in the whole group, from 63.6% (95% CI 35.2 92.0%) in LG-NHL to 73.3% (95%CI 50.1-95.7%) in B-CLL patients. Twelve of 18 patients with CR/PR are still in remission, with the median follow up 10 (7-28 months). The median failure-free survival (FFS) of responders was 6.5 months. Hypersensitivity to RIT was the major toxicity of RC regimen, and occurred in 9 patients (34.6%), mostly only during the first infusion of RIT. Severe neutropenia (grade III) was seen in 3 patients (11.5%). Anemia and thrombocytopenia associated with RC treatment were observed in 5 (19.2%) and 2 patients (7.7%), respectively. Four episodes (15.4%) of grade III-IV infections were observed. There was no treatment related mortality. During the follow-up six patients (23.1%) died from the disease progression. In conclusion, the combination of RIT and 2-CdA is an effective and well tolerated treatment, even for heavily pre-treated patients, and the results seem to be better than in patients previously treated in our institution with 2-CdA alone. This regimen can be considered as an alternative treatment of CD-20 positive indolent lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Robak, Tadeusz', 'Smolewski, Piotr', 'Urbanska-Rys, Halina', 'Gora-Tybor, Joanna', 'Blonski, Jerzy Z', 'Kasznicki, Marek']","['Robak T', 'Smolewski P', 'Urbanska-Rys H', 'Gora-Tybor J', 'Blonski JZ', 'Kasznicki M']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz and Copernicus Memorial Hospital, 93-513 Lodz, Pabianicka 62, Poland. robaktad@onet.pl']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Opportunistic Infections/chemically induced', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Rituximab', 'Salvage Therapy/methods', 'Survival Analysis']",2004/08/05 05:00,2004/12/31 09:00,['2004/08/05 05:00'],"['2004/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/31 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 May;45(5):937-44. doi: 10.1080/1042819032000159825.,['10.1080/1042819032000159825 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First-degree FH of lymphoma was reported by 43 patients (6%), 1 degree FH of leukemia by 27 patients (4%) and 1 degree FH of both in 4 (1%). There was a nonstatistically significant later age at diagnosis for cases with any family history of lymphoma or leukemia (mean age = 61.3 and 61.7 years, respectively) vs. no family history (59.0 years) (P = 0.58). The male to female ratio for those with a FH of leukemia (ratio = 2.9) was higher compared to those with FH lymphoma (0.95) or no FH (1.1) (P = 0.08). No differences were apparent between 1 degree FH and site of NHL (nodal vs. extranodal) (P = 0.53). Among recently diagnosed cases (since 1995), there was some suggestion of a greater proportion of aggressive tumors for those with any family history (69% and 55%) vs. none (50%) (P = 0.20). We found little evidence of large differences between familial and sporadic NHL with regard to age, gender, site or histologic subtype.","['Vachon, Celine M', 'Habermann, Thomas M', 'Kurtin, Paul J', 'Cerhan, James R']","['Vachon CM', 'Habermann TM', 'Kurtin PJ', 'Cerhan JR']","['Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. vachon@mayo.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Family Health', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors']",2004/08/05 05:00,2004/12/31 09:00,['2004/08/05 05:00'],"['2004/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/31 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 May;45(5):929-35. doi: 10.1080/1042819032000159898.,['10.1080/1042819032000159898 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBER), and T-cell receptor (TCR)-gamma chain gene rearrangement were correlated with clinical findings. A total of 72 cases were identified.

Population-wise the Western Swedish Region and Estonia are very similar; area-wise they are also well comparable. The present report covers only patients diagnosed between the ages of 16-64 years. The number of acute de novo leukaemias in the two regions was quite similar (Western Sweden n = 282 and Estonia n = 237). The age standardized incidence rate regarding total acute de novo leukaemias was slightly lower in Estonia than in Western Sweden (1.49/100,000 inhabitants/year for Estonia and 1.76 for Sweden, respectively), the difference being not statistically significant.

Modern treatment options include novel drugs like purine analogues, monoclonal antibodies and transplantation strategies. Moreover, gene transfer of immunostimulatory molecules is another, but still experimental approach that can be used to potentiate immune responses against leukemic cells. CD40 ligand (CD40L) was shown to be a promising molecule for immunotherapy of B-CLL playing a critical role in immune activation. However, CLL B cells are resistant to transduction with most currently available vector systems. Improving the efficiency and specificity of gene vectors is critical for the success of gene therapy in this area. Using replication defective adenovirus encoding CD40L (Ad-CD40L), immunologic and clinical responses were seen in CLL patients after infusion of autologous Ad-CD40L-CLL cells in a recent phase I trial. Due to the immunogenic nature of adenovirus vectors, alternative vector systems are currently explored. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) was shown to enable efficient transduction of primary B-CLL cells. By use of a library of AAV clones with randomly modified capsids, receptor-targeting mutants with a tropism for CLL cells can be selected. Furthermore, helper-virus free Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-based gene transfer vectors hold promise for development of CLL-targeted vaccines after remaining safety issues will be resolved. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-based vectors, especially HSV amplicons, have favorable features for B-CLL gene transfer including high transduction efficiency, ability to infect postmitotic cells and a large packaging capacity. The challenge for the future will be to transfer these alternative vector systems into clinic and allow the detection of a CLL-specific immune response by use of defined tumor antigens. This will make it possible to establish the potential clinical role of gene therapy for CLL patients.","['Wendtner, C M', 'Kofler, D M', 'Mayr, C', 'Bund, D', 'Hallek, M']","['Wendtner CM', 'Kofler DM', 'Mayr C', 'Bund D', 'Hallek M']","['Medical Clinic III, Klinikum Grosshadern Medical Center, Munchen, German.

The most frequent chromosomal aberrations in B-CLL are deletions on 13q, 11q, and 17p, and trisomy 12, all of which are of prognostic significance. These aberrations can be detected by conventional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), but cytogenetics are hampered by the low mitotic index of B-CLL cells, and FISH depends on genetic information of candidate regions. Microsatellites are unique highly polymorphic and informative genetic markers dispersed in the human genome. They have become the most commonly used markers to trace loss of heterozygosity in tumors. Their detection by PCR is rapid and can be semi-automated with maximal robustness and reproducibility. In this review, we discuss the implications of a recent genome-wide analysis in B-CLL with 400 microsatellite markers. This analysis led to the detection of new aberrant loci in B-CLL which are not visible in the leukemic conventional karyotype. We conclude that microsatellite allelotyping provides a complementary comprehensive view of genetic alterations in B-CLL, and it may identify new loci with candidate genes relevant in the molecular biology of B-CLL.","['Novak, Urban', 'Tobler, Andreas', 'Fey, Martin F']","['Novak U', 'Tobler A', 'Fey MF']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Haematology, University and Inselspital Berne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['*Alleles', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Microsatellite Repeats']",2004/08/05 05:00,2004/12/31 09:00,['2004/08/05 05:00'],"['2004/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/31 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 May;45(5):887-96. doi: 10.1080/1042819032000159843.,['10.1080/1042819032000159843 [doi]'],,,73,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluorescence microscope and spectrofluorometer have been used to detect the fluorescence of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) endogenously produced by ALA. The response of the cells to ALA-PDT was evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2-5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (interval between irradiation and the MTT assay is 24 h) and by flow cytometry (the length of time between irradiation and the flow assay is 30 min).

The results of parameter experiments were obtained: 1 x 10(5)/mL HL60 cell was first incubated with 1 mmol/L ALA in dark for 4 h and the maximum fluorescence of PpIX level appeared; then irradiated with 410 nm (4 mW/cm2) for 14.4 J/cm2 and maximum photodamage to membrane and mitochondrial function of HL60 cell resulted. With the normal granulocytes, such response was not detected.

In contrast to solid tumours there are only a few studies exploring anaemia in haematologic cancers. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] <12 g/dL) in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), multiple myeloma (MM), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and Hodgkin's disease (HD) who were scheduled to receive cyclic chemotherapy. Predictive factors for anaemia development and anaemia treatment were also assessed. METHODS: This prospective chart survey was conducted at 35 oncology centers in Austria. A total of 273 patients were followed through four cycles of nonplatinum chemotherapy, and Hb-levels and anaemia therapy were documented. RESULTS: At baseline, prevalence of anaemia was greatest in patients with MM (77.4%). Prevalence of anaemia increased for all malignancies after cycle 4, with the largest increases noted for patients with NHL (from 35.1% at baseline to 73.7%) and HD (from 21.9% to 54.5%). Cyclic chemotherapy and prior anticancer treatment indicated an increased risk for developing anaemia. Notably, 27.5% of patients with Hb levels <10.5 g/dL remained untreated. Transfusions were most often given to patients with severe anaemia (Hb < 8 g/dL), and erythropoietin most often given to patients with mild or moderate anaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that anaemia prevalence in patients with haematologic malignancies is high and increases with chemotherapy. The current practice of anaemia management in these patients leaves room for improvement.","['Steurer, Michael', 'Wagner, Helga', 'Gastl, Gunther']","['Steurer M', 'Wagner H', 'Gastl G']","['Division of Haematology and Oncology, Innsbruck University Hospital, Innsbruck, Austria. michael.steurer@uibk.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Austria,Wien Klin Wochenschr,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,21620870R,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '49DFR088MY (Platinum)']",IM,"['Anemia/*epidemiology/*therapy', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Austria/epidemiology', 'Causality', 'Drug Utilization/statistics & numerical data', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Patient Care Management/statistics & numerical data', 'Platinum/therapeutic use', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/08/05 05:00,2004/09/14 05:00,['2004/08/05 05:00'],"['2004/08/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/14 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/05 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Wien Klin Wochenschr. 2004 Jun 30;116(11-12):367-72. doi: 10.1007/BF03040915.,['10.1007/BF03040915 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using such gene expression data, several approaches have been proposed to classify tumor sub-types accurately. These classification methods are not robust, and often dependent on a particular training sample for modelling, which raises issues in utilizing these methods to administer proper treatment for a future patient. We propose to construct an optimal, robust prediction model for classifying cancer sub-types using gene expression data. Our model is constructed in a step-wise fashion implementing cross-validated quadratic discriminant analysis. At each step, all identified models are validated by an independent sample of patients to develop a robust model for future data. We apply the proposed methods to two microarray data sets of cancer: the acute leukemia data by Golub et al. and the colon cancer data by Alon et al. We have found that the dimensionality of our optimal prediction models is relatively small for these cases and that our prediction models with one or two gene factors outperforms or has competing performance, especially for independent samples, to other methods based on 50 or more predictive gene factors. The methodology is implemented and developed by the procedures in R and Splus.

It is involved with the formation of ducts during puberty and is required to remove excess epithelial cells after lactation so that the gland can be prepared for future pregnancies. Deregulated apoptosis contributes to malignant progression in the genesis of breast cancer. Since epithelial cell apoptosis in the lactating mammary gland can be synchronised by forced weaning, it has been possible to undertake biochemical analysis of the pathways involved. Together with the targeted overexpression or deletion of candidate genes, these approaches have provided a unique insight into the complex mechanisms of apoptosis regulation in vivo. This review explores what is currently known about the triggers for apoptosis in the normal mammary gland, and how they link with the intrinsic apoptotic machinery.","['Green, K A', 'Streuli, C H']","['Green KA', 'Streuli CH']","['School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, Stopford Building, Oxford Road, M13 9PT, Manchester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Cell Mol Life Sci,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/physiology', 'Interleukin-6/physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/*physiology', 'Mammary Glands, Human/*physiology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/physiology']",2004/08/04 05:00,2004/09/24 05:00,['2004/08/04 05:00'],"['2004/08/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Life Sci. 2004 Aug;61(15):1867-83. doi: 10.1007/s00018-004-3366-y.,['10.1007/s00018-004-3366-y [doi]'],,,121,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cultured microalgae are suggested recently as an alternative cleaner and safer source of the fatty acid. We investigated in this study the function of DHA from the enriched microalga Crypthecodinium cohnii (ADHA) in cell-growth control and its mechanism in human leukemia HL-60 cells. ADHA retarded proliferation of the leukemia cells dose-dependently by 4-93% of the control level, after 72-h incubations with 10-160 micro M of the fatty acid; and the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was estimated as 74 micro M. DNA-flow cytometry study showed that ADHA arrested G0/G1 cells by 12-22% and induced apoptotic cells by 569-906% of their controls, after incubation with the IC50 of ADHA for 24, 48 and 72 h. The modes of cell-cycle arrest and pro-apoptotic actions of ADHA were further elucidated. Gene-array analysis illustrated that ADHA modulated a number of cell-cycle and apoptosis genes to control the cell growth; in particular, the fatty acid up-regulated the transcriptional repressor E2F-6 and pro-apoptotic Bax by 1435 and 4172% respectively, after 24 h of incubation. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR study further showed that ADHA induced elevation of the Bax mRNA transcript time-dependently. In meanwhile, ADHA also induced phosphorylation and thus inactivation of Rb protein in the leukemia cells. All these results suggest that ADHA up-regulates Bax and inactivates Rb protein to induce the cell-growth control and apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells.","['Chiu, Lawrence C M', 'Wong, Elaine Y L', 'Ooi, Vincent E C']","['Chiu LC', 'Wong EY', 'Ooi VE']","['TCM Pharmacology Research Laboratory, Department of Biology, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong SAR, P.R.

Cyclin D1 overexpression was examined by competitive RT-PCR. Then we found these two markers were present independently in a given case. FISH analysis revealed that cyclin D1 over-expression was caused by t(11;14)(q13;q32) or extra copies of B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-1 (BCL-1/CCND1), and unknown mechanism without them. We compared the gene expression between myeloma cells with cyclin D1 overexpression and those without it using cDNA microarray analysis. Analysis of the expression profiles showed that the significantly up-regulated genes included cyclin D1, cell division cycle 37 (CDC37) and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (BCL-2), while the down-regulated genes included cyclin D2 and CD9 antigen (p24) in MM cases with cyclin D1 overexpression. However, hierarchical clustering analysis of the data showed that myeloma cells of MM cases with cyclin D1 overexpression could not be distinguished clearly from those without it.

In this study we designed a novel arsenical compound, As4O6, and compared its ability to induce cell growth inhibition as well as gene expression profiles along with As2O3 in HPV16 infected SiHa cervical cancer cells. Both As2O3 and As4O6 induced apoptosis in SiHa cells, as determined by a DNA ladder formation. As4O6 was more effective in suppressing the growth of SiHa cells in vitro, as compared to As2O3. To further compare gene expression profiles between these two drugs, we used a 384 cDNA microarray system. The gene expression profiles were also classified into the Gene Ontology (GO) to investigate apoptosis-related cellular processes. In the case of As2O3, 41 genes were up- or down-regulated at least 2-fold, as compared to non-treatment, whereas, 65 genes were up- or down-regulated by As4O6 treatment. In particular, 27 genes were commonly regulated by both arsenic compounds. The GO analysis also indicated that down-regulation of cell-regulatory functions, such as cell cycle, protein kinase activity and DNA repair, induces an anti-tumor effect. Taken together, these data support that As4O6 could be more effective than As2O3 in inhibiting the growth of HPV16 infected cervical cancer cells.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Individual patient data-based meta-analysis was performed on 392 adults (median age, 42 years; range, 16 to 60 years) with CBF AML (t(8;21), n = 191; inv(16), n = 201) treated between 1993 and 2002 in prospective German AML treatment trials. RESULTS: RFS was 60% and 58% and OS was 65% and 74% in the t(8;21) and inv(16) groups after 3 years, respectively. For postremission therapy, intention-to-treat analysis revealed no difference between intensive chemotherapy and autologous transplantation in the t(8;21) group and between chemotherapy, autologous, and allogeneic transplantation in the inv(16) group. In the t(8;21) group, significant prognostic variables for longer RFS and OS were lower WBC and higher platelet counts; loss of the Y chromosome in male patients was prognostic for shorter OS. In the inv(16) group, trisomy 22 was a significant prognostic variable for longer RFS. For patients who experienced relapse, second complete remission rate was significantly lower in patients with t(8;21), resulting in a significantly inferior survival duration after relapse compared with patients with inv(16).

However, a blastocyst cloned from a RAS-inducible melanoma nucleus gave rise to ES cells with the potential to differentiate into multiple cell types in vivo including melanocytes, lymphocytes, and fibroblasts. Chimeras produced from these ES cells developed cancer with higher penetrance, shorter latency, and an expanded tumor spectrum when compared with the donor mouse model. These results demonstrate that the secondary changes of a melanoma nucleus are compatible with a broad developmental potential but predispose mice to melanomas and other malignant tumors on reactivation of RAS.

We reported recently that cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)5 and p35Nck5a (p35) are expressed in human leukemia HL60 cells induced to differentiate to monocytes by an exposure to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D(3)), form a complex, and this complex has kinase activity (F. Chen and G. P. Studzinski, Blood 2001;97:3763). This laboratory has also provided evidence that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is active in the early (24-48 h) stages of HL60 cell differentiation induced by 1,25D(3) but declines in the later, terminal phase of this form of differentiation (X. Wang and G. P. Studzinski, J Cell Biochem 2001;80:471). We examine now the hypothesis that Egr1 protein contributes to the up-regulation of p35 gene transcription and, thus, activated Cdk5/p35 kinase phosphorylates and inactivates mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEK1). Our data show that in 1,25D(3)-treated cells, p35 and Egr1 protein levels are elevated in a dose-dependent manner at the onset of the late stage of differentiation. We show also that 1,25D(3) treatment of HL60 cells markedly increases the binding of Egr1 to an element in the p35 gene promoter, whereas transfection of an excess of this Egr1-binding oligonucleotide (""promoter decoy"") reduces p35 gene transcription and cell differentiation. Additionally, Cdk5/p35 phosphorylates MEK1 and inhibits its ability to phosphorylate its downstream target Erk2. These data suggest that in 1,25D(3)-treated HL60 cells, Egr1 up-regulates p35 gene transcription and that Cdk5/p35 kinase inactivates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by phosphorylation of MEK1, and this contributes to terminal differentiation of these cells.","['Chen, Fei', 'Wang, Qing', 'Wang, Xuening', 'Studzinski, George P']","['Chen F', 'Wang Q', 'Wang X', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, New Jersey Medical School, 185 South Orange Avenue, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Calcium Channel Agonists)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (neuronal Cdk5 activator (p25-p35))', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Calcium Channel Agonists/*pharmacology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation']",2004/08/04 05:00,2004/09/10 05:00,['2004/08/04 05:00'],"['2004/08/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Aug 1;64(15):5425-33. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0806.,"['10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0806 [doi]', '64/15/5425 [pii]']",,['R01 CA 44722-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The specific BCR/ABL signaling mechanisms responsible for transformation of primitive human hematopoietic cells are not well defined. Previous studies have suggested that constitutively activated tyrosine kinase activity plays an important role for in abnormal proliferation of CML progenitors but has not clearly defined its role in abnormal adhesion and migration. We established a human progenitor model of CML by ectopic expression of BCR/ABL in normal CD34+ cells using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. CD34+ cells expressing BCR/ABL demonstrated several features characteristic of primary CML progenitors including increased proliferation in committed and primitive progenitor culture, reduced adhesion to fibronectin, and reduced chemotaxis to stroma-derived factor-1alpha. We expressed a kinase-inactive BCR/ABL gene to directly investigate the role of kinase activity in abnormal progenitor function. Abnormalities in proliferation were completely reversed, whereas defects in adhesion and migration were significantly improved but not completely reversed in cells expressing a kinase-inactive BCR/ABL. Furthermore, the BCR/ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate markedly inhibited proliferation of BCR/ABL-expressing progenitors but did not fully correct the adhesion and migration defects. Expression of BCR/ABL genes with deletions of either the COOH-terminal actin binding or proline-rich domains resulted in enhanced adhesion and chemotaxis compared with wild-type BCR/ABL but did not affect progenitor proliferation. We conclude that abnormal kinase activity is essential for abnormal proliferation and survival of CML progenitors but that abnormal adhesion and migration result from both kinase-dependent and -independent mechanisms.","['Ramaraj, Pandurangan', 'Singh, Harjeet', 'Niu, Ning', 'Chu, Su', 'Holtz, Melissa', 'Yee, Jiing Kuan', 'Bhatia, Ravi']","['Ramaraj P', 'Singh H', 'Niu N', 'Chu S', 'Holtz M', 'Yee JK', 'Bhatia R']","['Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Movement', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/metabolism', 'Chemotaxis', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mice', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proline/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology']",2004/08/04 05:00,2004/09/10 05:00,['2004/08/04 05:00'],"['2004/08/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Aug 1;64(15):5322-31. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-3656.,"['10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-3656 [doi]', '64/15/5322 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was shown that Akt or protein kinase B (Akt/PKB)-dependent phosphorylation of p27Kip1 led to the cytoplasmic mislocalization of p27Kip1, suggesting the potential abrogation of its activity. Here, we evaluated the localization of p27Kip1 protein in leukemic blasts in relation to Akt/PKB phosphorylation and clinical outcomes in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Western blot analysis of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions revealed a heterogenous localization pattern of p27Kip1 in AML. Cytoplasmic mislocalization of p27Kip1 was significantly associated with the constitutive serine(473) Akt/PKB phosphorylation in AML cells (P < 0.05). Transfection of U937 cells with an expression construct encoding the constitutively active form of Akt/PKB resulted in a remarkable increase in the levels of cytoplasmic p27Kip1. Whereas the transfection of U937 cells with a construct encoding dominant-negative Akt/PKB resulted in a recovery of nuclear localization of p27Kip1. Both the disease-free survival and overall survival are significantly shorter in AML cases with high cytoplasmic to nuclear ratio of p27Kip1 localization compared with the cases with low cytoplasmic to nuclear ratio (P = 0.0353, P = 0.0023, respectively). Multivariate analysis indicated that the cytoplasmic to nuclear ratio of p27Kip1 localization was an independent prognostic variable for both disease-free survival and overall survival (P = 0.043, P = 0.008, respectively). These findings additionally extend our understanding of the role of p27Kip1 in AML, and buttress the case of p27Kip1 mislocalization as a prognostic indicator and Akt/PKB/p27Kip1 pathway as a ready target for antileukemia therapy.","['Min, Yoo Hong', 'Cheong, June-Won', 'Kim, Ji Yeon', 'Eom, Ju In', 'Lee, Seung Tae', 'Hahn, Jee Sook', 'Ko, Yun Woong', 'Lee, Mark Hong']","['Min YH', 'Cheong JW', 'Kim JY', 'Eom JI', 'Lee ST', 'Hahn JS', 'Ko YW', 'Lee MH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seodaemun-ku Shinchon-dong 134, Seoul 120-752, Korea. minbrmmd@yumc.yonsei.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2004/08/04 05:00,2004/09/10 05:00,['2004/08/04 05:00'],"['2004/08/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Aug 1;64(15):5225-31. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0174.,"['10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0174 [doi]', '64/15/5225 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CsA induced apoptosis in leukemia cell lines sensitive (LBR-) and resistant to vincristine (LBR-V160), and doxorubicin (LBR-D160), while PSC 833 only induced apoptosis in vincristine-resistant cell line (LBR-V160). In this work, we investigated mitochondrial-associated mechanisms during CsA- and PSC 833-induced apoptosis. Mitochondrial function was evaluated by recording changes in its transmembrane potential, cytochrome c release, and caspase activation cascade. Results showed that CsA- and PSC 833-induced apoptosis was associated with mitochondrial depolarization, through potentiometric measurements with JC-1 and DiOC(6) probes. Collapse of mitochondrial potential in these cell lines after CsA treatment was followed by cytochrome c release to the cytosol, reaching an increase of 2.61-fold in LBR-, 1.98-fold in LBR-V160, and 3.01-fold in the case of LBR-D160. However, in the case of PSC 833 treatment, induction of apoptosis in LBR-V160 was associated with mitochondrial depolarization followed by a lower cytochrome c release of 1.15-fold as compared with untreated cells. Caspase 3 activation was clearly observed in LBR-, LBR-V160, and LBR-D160 after CsA treatment, while in LBR-V160, PSC 833 was less effective inducing activation of this caspase.

The expression of CD11b, CD14 and CD15 on treated AML cells was also increased compared to control AML cells. In addition, HI44a was found to induce apoptosis of leukemia cells, as evidenced by an annexin-V assay. The mean percentage of apoptotic cells in HI44a-treated AML cells was significantly increased compared to that in control AML cells. Moreover, the level of c-myc transcript expression on AML cells was found to be obviously decreased in all detected patients.

We investigated the mechanism of formation of jumping translocations in a case of adult common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) positive for the Ph translocation. METHODS: Interphase and metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) was performed using several probe systems. Results were correlated with findings on conventional cytogenetics. Granulocytes, T-cells and leukaemic B-cells in peripheral blood were sorted by immunomagnetic method and the terminal restriction fragment (TRF) length of these cellular populations was determined by Southern blot analysis. RESULTS: Duplicated BCR-ABL fusion signals were found on a dic(14;22)der(22)t(9;22) chromosome. Clonal jumping translocations, existing as evolutionary changes, involved the donor chromosomal segment distal to 1q12 jumping onto the telomere ends of 11q, 15p, 19p and 20p. Telomere length was decreased in the neoplastic B-cell population and contributed to the formation of the dicentric chromosome that showed absence of telomere repeats at fusion ends. Subsequent pericentromeric heterochromatin decondensation of chromosome 1q occurred, and this donor segment was randomly fused to the shortened telomere ends of non-homologous chromosomes. CONCLUSIONS: Both telomere shortening and pericentromeric heterochromatin decondensation contribute to the formation of jumping translocations, which is most probably a multi-stage process.","['Wan, T S K', 'Ma, S K', 'Chow, E Y D', 'Li, Y H', 'Lin, S Y', 'Chan, L C']","['Wan TS', 'Ma SK', 'Chow EY', 'Li YH', 'Lin SY', 'Chan LC']","['Department of Pathology, Division of Haematology, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/biosynthesis', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/*methods', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Telomere/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2004/08/04 05:00,2007/09/14 09:00,['2004/08/04 05:00'],"['2003/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2004 Oct;28(10):1075-9. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2004.01.021.,"['10.1016/j.leukres.2004.01.021 [doi]', 'S0145212604000670 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the prognostic value of soluble CD44 in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) and analysed the source and regulation of CD44 secretion in B-CLL clones in vitro. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Levels of soluble CD44 standard (sCD44s) and of the soluble variant isoform CD44v6 (sCD44v6) were analysed by enzyme linked immuno sorbent assay. Highly purified B-CLL cells (98% CD19 + CD3 - cells) were stimulated in vitro by different combinations of thioredoxin (Trx), Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain 1 (SAC), IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and by anti-CD40 mAbs presented on irradiated CD32L cells. RESULTS: Serum levels of sCD44s and of sCD44v6 are significantly elevated in B-CLL patients (n = 90) in comparison with normal persons (n = 44) (P < 0.001). Elevated levels of sCD44s and sCD44v6 are associated with an advanced disease as reflected by an extended lymph node involvement (P < 0.02), an advanced Binet (P < 0.03) and Rai stage (P < 0.04) and chemotherapy requirement (P < 0.02). High levels of sCD44s are associated with high leukocyte counts (P < 0.04) and increased sCD44v6 is significantly associated with splenomegaly (P < 0.002). In B-CLL sCD44s as well as sCD44v6 is shed from leukaemia cells as shown by in vitro cultures. Stimulation of B-CLL clones results in a proliferation-associated increased secretion of sCD44s (rho = 0.7; P = 0.0001) and of sCD44v6 (rho = 0.5; P = 0.005). B-CLL clones from advanced stage patients are characterised by an increased capacity for proliferation and CD44 production in comparison with early stage patients. CONCLUSIONS: Both sCD44s and sCD44v6 represent a reliable prognostic marker in B-CLL and may be involved in the pathogenesis of B-CLL.","['Eisterer, Wolfgang', 'Bechter, Oliver', 'Soderberg, Ola', 'Nilsson, Kenneth', 'Terol, Maria', 'Greil, Richard', 'Thaler, Josef', 'Herold, Manfred', 'Finke, Lothar', 'Gunthert, Ursula', 'Montserrat, Emilio', 'Stauder, Reinhard']","['Eisterer W', 'Bechter O', 'Soderberg O', 'Nilsson K', 'Terol M', 'Greil R', 'Thaler J', 'Herold M', 'Finke L', 'Gunthert U', 'Montserrat E', 'Stauder R']","['Department of General Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/biosynthesis/blood/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*diagnosis/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/08/04 05:00,2007/09/14 09:00,['2004/08/04 05:00'],"['2003/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2004 Oct;28(10):1043-51. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2004.01.016.,"['10.1016/j.leukres.2004.01.016 [doi]', 'S0145212604000608 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, Notch expression must be precisely regulated as constitutive Notch signaling leads to T cell lymphomas. Recent evidence has provided insights into potential mechanisms of Notch-mediated lymphomagenesis and its relationship to T cell development. The evidence suggests that Notch likely interacts with several important cellular pathways and can cooperate with other oncogenes during lymphomagenesis. In particular, Notch appears to modulate pre-TCR signaling, inhibit the E2A pathway, and in murine leukemia models, frequently cooperates with Myc, E2A-PBX and dominant negative Ikaros dysregulation.

Rapamycin is a macrocyclic lactone that possesses immunosuppressive, antifungal and anti-tumour properties. This molecule is approved as an immunosuppressive agent for preventing rejection in patients receiving organ transplantation. To verify the activity of rapamycin, we employed two experimental cell systems, the human leukaemia K562 cell line and the two-phase liquid culture of human erythroid progenitors isolated from normal donors and patients with beta-thalassaemia. The results suggested that rapamycin, when compared with cytosine arabinoside, mithramycin and cisplatin, is a powerful inducer of erythroid differentiation and gamma-globin mRNA accumulation in human leukaemia K562 cells. In addition, when normal human erythroid precursors were cultured in the presence of rapamycin, gamma-globin mRNA accumulation and fetal haemoglobin (HbF) production increased to levels that were higher than those obtained using hydroxyurea. These effects were not associated with inhibition of cell growth. Furthermore, rapamycin was found to increase HbF content in erythroid precursor cells from four beta-thalassaemia patients. These results could have practical relevance, because pharmacologically mediated regulation of the expression of human gamma-globin genes, leading to increased HbF, is considered a potential therapeutic approach in haematological disorders, including beta-thalassaemia and sickle cell anaemia.","['Mischiati, Carlo', 'Sereni, Alessia', 'Lampronti, Ilaria', 'Bianchi, Nicoletta', 'Borgatti, Monica', 'Prus, Eugenia', 'Fibach, Eitan', 'Gambari, Roberto']","['Mischiati C', 'Sereni A', 'Lampronti I', 'Bianchi N', 'Borgatti M', 'Prus E', 'Fibach E', 'Gambari R']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/metabolism', 'Globins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'beta-Thalassemia/metabolism']",2004/08/04 05:00,2004/09/21 05:00,['2004/08/04 05:00'],"['2004/08/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Aug;126(4):612-21. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05083.x.,"['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05083.x [doi]', 'BJH5083 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 50-60% of AML cases blasts have chromosomal abnormalities, such as inv(16) or t(8,21), which could encode for leukaemia-specific antigenic peptide sequences, possibly presented in the context of self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. As the co-culture of AML blasts with T lymphocytes seldom resulted in T-cell stimulation, we fused AML blasts with autologous DC to enhance this effect. The fusion cells expressed MHC class I and II, CD40, B7-1, B7-2, CD209 and several adhesion molecules. In a mixed lymphocyte hybrid reaction, the fusion cells induced the proliferation of autologous T cells. Moreover, in the special case of fusion cells established from AML blasts with the chromosomal abnormality inv(16), the autologous T lymphocytes could be primed to induce cytotoxicity against up to 70% autologous AML blasts in a effector:target ratio of 20:1. Blocking assays demonstrated that the lysis was chiefly mediated by CD8(+), CCR7(-) T lymphocytes, which could be further expanded in the form of effector memory CD8(+) T cells by repeated co-cultures with the autologous fusion cells.","['Banat, G-Andre', 'Usluoglu, Nurguel', 'Hoeck, Marianne', 'Ihlow, Kerstin', 'Hoppmann, Sabine', 'Pralle, Hans']","['Banat GA', 'Usluoglu N', 'Hoeck M', 'Ihlow K', 'Hoppmann S', 'Pralle H']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Medical Centre University of Giessen, Giessen, Germany. a.banat@innere.med.uni-giessen.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Cell Fusion', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*analysis', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/*analysis']",2004/08/04 05:00,2004/09/21 05:00,['2004/08/04 05:00'],"['2004/08/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Aug;126(4):593-601. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05087.x.,"['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05087.x [doi]', 'BJH5087 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, a new class of Akt inhibitors, referred to as phosphatidylinositol ether lipids (PIAs), have been synthesized. We tested whether two new PIAs could lower the sensitivity threshold to chemotherapeutic drugs of human leukaemia cell lines with an activated PI3-K/Akt network. We used HL60AR (for apoptosis resistant), K562 and U937 cells. The two pharmacological inhibitors, used at 5 micromol/l, down-regulated Akt kinase activity and phosphorylation. Neither of the two chemicals affected the activity of other signalling proteins in the Akt pathway, such as phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 or PTEN. When employed at 5 micromol/l, the Akt inhibitors markedly reduced the resistance of the leukaemic cell lines to etoposide or cytarabine. Remarkably, a 5 micromol/l concentration of the inhibitors did not negatively affect the survival rate of human cord blood CD34(+) cells. Overall, our results indicate that new selective Akt pharmacological inhibitors might be used in the future for overcoming Akt-mediated resistance to therapeutic treatments of acute leukaemia cells.","['Tabellini, Giovanna', 'Tazzari, Pier Luigi', 'Bortul, Roberta', 'Billi, Anna Maria', 'Conte, Roberto', 'Manzoli, Lucia', 'Cocco, Lucio', 'Martelli, Alberto M']","['Tabellini G', 'Tazzari PL', 'Bortul R', 'Billi AM', 'Conte R', 'Manzoli L', 'Cocco L', 'Martelli AM']","[""Dipartimento di Scienze Anatomiche Umane e Fisiopatologia dell'Apparato Locomotore, Sezione di Anatomia, Cell Signaling Laboratory, Universita di Bologna, Bologna, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*pharmacology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phospholipid Ethers/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/08/04 05:00,2004/09/21 05:00,['2004/08/04 05:00'],"['2004/08/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Aug;126(4):574-82. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05073.x.,"['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05073.x [doi]', 'BJH5073 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report two cases of de novo AML with translocations involving the breakpoint 6p22 first detected at relapse. Chromosomes were identified by conventional and molecular cytogenetics. At diagnosis, one patient presented a normal karyotype and the other one a trisomy 11 and a del(7)(q31q36). In the first case, cytogenetic analyses at relapse revealed a t(3;6)(q21;p22). The second patient showed a t(1;6)(q21;p22) at relapse. Detailed characterization of the breakpoints on the short arm of chromosome 6 was performed using array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on a platform specific for chromosome 6. In both cases, array CGH showed a terminal deletion and a small internal duplication of the short arm of chromosome 6. The region 6p22 is involved in several aberrations in tumours. Translocation partners are distributed throughout the human genome. We identified 3q21, a recurrent breakpoint in AML, for the first time as a translocation partner. The fragile site FRA6C, located in 6p22.2, and possibly the genes that reside within it, may play a role in tumorigenesis. The occurrence of translocations involving 6p22 after chemotherapy or radiation therapy suggests that one or more therapeutic agents might play a role in their origin.","['Tchinda, Joelle', 'Dijkhuizen, Trijnie', 'Vlies Pv, Pieter van der', 'Kok, Klaas', 'Horst, Jurgen']","['Tchinda J', 'Dijkhuizen T', 'Vlies Pv Pv', 'Kok K', 'Horst J']","['Institut fur Humangenetik, Universitatsklinikum Munster, Vesaliusweg, Munster, Germany. tchinda@uni-muenster.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Recurrence', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2004/08/04 05:00,2004/09/21 05:00,['2004/08/04 05:00'],"['2004/08/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Aug;126(4):495-500. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05082.x.,"['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05082.x [doi]', 'BJH5082 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It belongs to a new group of monoclonal antibodies with anti-neoplastic effects used in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) either as first-line treatment or in those cases resistant to alkylating drugs. Paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) is a severe mucocutaneus disease mostly associated with B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. Independent of the course of the underlying malignancy, this disease is often resistant to conventional immunosuppressive treatment and may lead to death as a result of infectious complications. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case where an ongoing long-term remission of PNP has been induced by alemtuzumab in a patient with an underlying B-CLL. A 68-yr-old male with a 4-yr history of B-CLL presented with a widespread blistering eruption on the extremities and trunk and a severe stomatitis. The diagnosis of PNP relied on the clinical, histological and direct immunofluorescence findings. Despite intensive treatment strategies with various immunosuppressive drugs and antibiotics, blisters continued to develop and the patient was deteriorating. When treated with alemtuzumab the mucocutaneous lesions healed almost completely within a few weeks and the patients' general condition improved significantly. After 12 wk of treatment with alemtuzumab, the CLL infiltration of the bone marrow previously quantified at 75-80% remitted completely. Twelve months later, the patient was still in remission with only a small residual ulceration on the lip and one on the penis. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this case report we recommend treatment with alemtuzumab to severe cases of PNP in CLL. However, further follow-up of this case is needed in order to assess the long-term effect of alemtuzumab treatment in PNP.","['Hohwy, Thomas', 'Bang, Karen', 'Steiniche, Torben', 'Peterslund, Niels Anker', ""d'Amore, Francesco""]","['Hohwy T', 'Bang K', 'Steiniche T', 'Peterslund NA', ""d'Amore F""]","['Department of Dermatology, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. thomashohwy@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/complications/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/etiology', 'Pemphigus/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Remission Induction/methods']",2004/08/04 05:00,2004/09/17 05:00,['2004/08/04 05:00'],"['2004/08/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2004 Sep;73(3):206-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00280.x.,"['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00280.x [doi]', 'EJH280 [pii]']",,,,,,['Copyright Blackwell Munksgaard 2004.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initial cell-surface IFNAR2 expression at diagnosis assessed by flow cytometry widely distributed but showed overall significantly higher expression in CML patients when compared with normal controls. In 15 fresh patients who subsequently received IFNalpha therapy, IFNAR2 expression at diagnosis was significantly higher in cytogenetic good responders than in poor responders. Down-regulation of IFNAR2 expression during IFNalpha therapy was observed only in good responders but not in poor responders. In addition to protein level, both initial high IFNAR2c mRNA expression level and its down-regulation during IFNalpha therapy, in purified CD34-positive cells, were also observed only in good responders. In contrast to IFNAR2, cell-surface IFNAR1 expression was generally lower than IFNAR2, and correlation between either the pretreatment level or down-regulation of IFNAR1 and clinical response was not evident. With in vitro IFNalpha stimulation, CD34-positive cells showed down-regulations of cell-surface IFNAR2, and IFNAR1 to a lesser extent, in one good-responder patient, but not in one poor-responder patient. Serum soluble interferon receptor (sIFNR) was higher in untreated CML patients than in normal controls, without any correlation with clinical response to IFNalpha. Thus, the pretreatment protein and mRNA expression levels of IFNAR2 and their down-regulations during IFNalpha therapy correlate well with IFNalpha response in CML patients.","['Ito, Kinro', 'Tanaka, Hideo', 'Ito, Takuo', 'Sultana, Tanvira A', 'Kyo, Taiichi', 'Imanaka, Fumio', 'Ohmoto, Yasukazu', 'Kimura, Akiro']","['Ito K', 'Tanaka H', 'Ito T', 'Sultana TA', 'Kyo T', 'Imanaka F', 'Ohmoto Y', 'Kimura A']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Division of Clinical and Experimental Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (IFNAR1 protein, human)', '0 (IFNAR2 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '156986-95-7 (Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Antigens, CD34', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects', 'Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta', 'Receptors, Interferon/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/08/04 05:00,2004/09/17 05:00,['2004/08/04 05:00'],"['2004/08/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2004 Sep;73(3):191-205. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00275.x.,"['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00275.x [doi]', 'EJH275 [pii]']",,,,,,['Copyright Blackwell Munksgard 2004.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the clinical setting, a better understanding of the clinical course of distinct, biologically defined disease subtypes is the basis for a selection of disease-specific therapeutic approaches. As knowledge of deregulated pathways in leukemia increases and accelerates the development of new therapeutics, a detailed and comprehensive diagnostic tool is required. Microarray technology, which quantifies gene expression intensities of thousands of genes in a single analysis, has the potential to become an essential tool for the molecular classification of leukemias. It may, therefore, be used as a routine method for diagnostic purposes in the near future.

Interestingly, circular dichroism reveals that while histone H1 in aqueous solutions appears as a random coil, its binding to liposomes containing PS is associated with a pronounced increase in alpha-helicity and beta-sheet content, estimated at 7% and 24%, respectively. This interaction further results in vesicle aggregation and lipid mixing. Fluorescence microscopy revealed rapid binding of Texas Red-labeled H1 (TR-H1) to giant liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine and PS (SOPC/brain PS, 9/1 molar ratio), followed by lateral segregation and subsequent translocation of the membrane-bound H1 into the giant liposome. The above processes in giant liposomes did depend on the presence of the negatively charged PS. Comparison of the behavior of H1 in giant liposomes to that in cultured leukemic T cells demonstrated very similar patterns. More specifically, fluorescence microscopy revealed binding of TR-H1 to the plasma membrane as lateral segregated microdomains, followed by translocation into the cell. H1 also triggered membrane blebbing and fragmentation of the nuclei of these cells, thus suggesting induction of apoptosis. Our findings indicate that histone H1 and acidic phospholipids form supramolecular aggregates in the plasma membrane of T cells, subsequently resulting in major rearrangements of cellular membranes.

The scarcity of reports linking HIV infection with malignancies in Nigeria necessitated this study. We prospectively screened one hundred patients with various forms of malignancies seen at the University College Hospital Ibadan, Nigeria between October 2001 and June 2002 for HIV infection by the Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method and confirmed with the Western Blot method. RESULTS: Six of the patients were found to be seropositive for HIV antibodies. There were 41 males (41%) and 59 females (59%) with age ranging from 7 months to 80 years and a median of 46 years. The HIV seropositive patients were between 29 and 35 years of age. Two patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and one patient each with carcinoma of the cervix, Kaposi's sarcoma. Hodgkin's lymphoma and carcinoma of the breast were HIV seropositive. All the p values were greater than 0.05. CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence of HIV infection in patients with malignancies in this study was 6%. Despite the HIV/AIDS epidemic, there is yet no significant statistical relationship between HIV infection and malignancies in this environment. Larger, preferably multicenter studies need to be carried out to ascertain the relationship between HIV infection and malignancies in Nigeria.","['Ocheni, S', ""Aken'Ova, Y A""]","['Ocheni S', ""Aken'Ova YA""]","['Department of Haematology, University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. kcjsocheni@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Nigeria,West Afr J Med,West African journal of medicine,8301891,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms/virology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/*complications/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'HIV Seroprevalence', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/virology', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/virology', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms/epidemiology/virology', 'Nigeria/epidemiology', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/virology', 'Sex Distribution', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology']",2004/08/04 05:00,2004/09/11 05:00,['2004/08/04 05:00'],"['2004/08/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/11 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,West Afr J Med. 2004 Apr-Jun;23(2):151-5. doi: 10.4314/wajm.v23i2.28109.,['10.4314/wajm.v23i2.28109 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compare this estimator to the standard parametric maximum likelihood estimator from a proportional odds model for extremely small data sets. A motivating example is from phase I oncology clinical trials, where various non-parametric designs have been proposed that lead to very small data sets, often with ordinal toxicity response data. Our comparison of estimators is performed in conjunction with three of these non-parametric sequential designs for ordinal response data, two from the literature and a new design based on a random walk rule. We also compare with a non-parametric design for binary response trials, by keeping track of ordinal data for estimation purposes, but dichotomizing the data in the design phase. We find that a multidimensional isotonic regression-based estimator far exceeds the others in terms of accuracy and efficiency. A rule by Simon et al. (J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89:1138-1147) yields particularly efficient estimators, more so than the random walk rule, but has higher numbers of dose-limiting toxicity.

The action of these proteases were followed at the ultrastructural level. From our observations 1) no unique morphological feature exists during apoptosis, even in the same cell type; 2) the extent of the morphological modifications are inducer- and dose-dependent; 3) double or triple treatments amplify the morphological modifications with a single inducer, but not the rate of apoptosis; and 4) in the case of double treatment the second inducer has to have a cytoplasmatic target because damage to the cytoplasm occurs before nuclear modifications become visible. These data should facilitate a more objective evaluation of apoptosis in conditions where antiproliferative drugs, like antiblastic or immunosuppressive molecules, are used to monitor the efficiency of treatment.","['Abbro, Luigi', 'Lanubile, Remigio', 'Dini, Luciana']","['Abbro L', 'Lanubile R', 'Dini L']","['Department of Biological and Environmental Science and Technology (Di.S.Te.B.A.), University of Lecce, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Microsc Res Tech,Microscopy research and technique,9203012,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '35MRW7B4AD (3-Iodobenzylguanidine)', '4A6ZS6Q2CL (Puromycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['3-Iodobenzylguanidine/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Oxidants/pharmacology', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Puromycin/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells/ultrastructure']",2004/08/03 05:00,2004/10/07 09:00,['2004/08/03 05:00'],"['2004/08/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Microsc Res Tech. 2004 May 1;64(1):77-85. doi: 10.1002/jemt.20058.,['10.1002/jemt.20058 [doi]'],,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['Microsc Res Tech. 2004 Jul 1;64(4):343'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that recipient antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are required for CD8-dependent GVHD in a mouse model across only minor histocompatibility antigens (minor H antigens). However, these studies did not address the function of donor-derived APCs after GVHD is initiated. Here we show that GVHD develops in recipients of donor major histocompatibility complex class I-deficient (MHC I(-)) bone marrow. Thus, after initial priming, CD8 cells caused GVHD without a further requirement for hematopoietic APCs, indicating that host APCs are necessary and sufficient for GHVD. Nonetheless, GVHD was less severe in recipients of MHC I(-) bone marrow. Therefore, once initiated, GVHD is intensified by donor-derived cells, most probably donor APCs cross-priming alloreactive CD8 cells. Nevertheless, donor APCs were not required for CD8-mediated graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) against a mouse model of chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.

Through DNA binding, WT1 can either enhance or repress transcription depending on the context of the DNA-binding sites or the cell type in which it is expressed. WT1 is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, including leukemia and breast cancer; in these diseases, the expression of WT1 is associated with a poor prognosis. To determine how WT1 affects c-myc expression in the context of breast cancer cells, we have examined the ability of both endogenous and exogenous WT1 proteins in breast cancer cells to bind to the c-myc promoter in vivo. Using c-myc-promoter-driven luciferase constructs, we found that different forms of WT1 could enhance the expression of the reporter. Unlike other studies where WT1 is reported to be a negative regulator of c-myc, we found that both the - and + KTS forms of WT1 could act to enhance c-myc expression, depending on the cell type. The WT1-binding site near the second major transcription start site of the c-myc promoter was confirmed to be involved in upregulation of human c-myc by WT1. Finally, we demonstrated that overexpression of WT1 induced a significant increase in the abundance of endogenous c-myc protein in breast cancer cells, consistent with the upregulation of c-myc transcription following WT1 induction. These observations strongly argue that in the case of breast cancer WT1 is functioning as an oncogene in part by stimulating the expression of c-myc.","['Han, Youqi', 'San-Marina, Serban', 'Liu, Jian', 'Minden, Mark D']","['Han Y', 'San-Marina S', 'Liu J', 'Minden MD']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5G 2M9.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'WT1 Proteins/chemistry/*physiology']",2004/08/03 05:00,2004/10/02 05:00,['2004/08/03 05:00'],"['2004/08/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/02 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Sep 9;23(41):6933-41. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207609.,"['10.1038/sj.onc.1207609 [doi]', '1207609 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our main objective was to ascertain the frequency and severity of iron overload in a group of 59 patients who died after conventional-intensity autologous (n=24) or allogeneic (n=35) haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A second objective was to investigate associations between liver-iron concentration and causes of transplant-related mortality. The median age was 41 years (range, 19-66), 41 were males and 18 females. In total, 26 patients had acute leukaemia or MDS, 10 CML, 17 lymphoma, four myeloma and two aplastic anaemia. The median hepatic iron concentration (HIC) was 138 micromol/g dry weight (7.7 mg/g; range 31-631 micromol/g). In total, 4/32 (12%) patients with HIC <150 micromol/g and 10/27 (37%) with hepatic iron > or =150 micromol/g showed invasive aspergillosis at autopsy (P=0.035). This was significant in multivariate analysis (RR 9.0; 95% CI 1.6-50.3, P=0.012).

The question of whether Napoleon died of, or merely with, arsenic poisoning is illuminated by developments in the treatment of promyelocytic leukaemia. Arsenic trioxide induces remission in many, but treatment can be complicated by QT prolongation, torsades de pointes and sudden death. At clinically relevant concentrations, arsenic blocks both I(Kr) and I(ks) channels and, at the same time, activates I(K-ATP) channels. The balance of these forces is easily disrupted, and QT prolongation is worsened by hypokalaemia. Napoleon was chronically treated with tartar emetic for gastrointestinal symptoms, and the day before he died he was given a huge dose of calomel (mercurous chloride) as a purgative. Both treatments would have caused potassium wastage. In addition, the Emperor was being treated with a decoction containing 'bark'-presumably 'Jesuit's bark'. The quinine in Jesuit's bark is another cause of QT prolongation. It is likely that the immediate cause of the Emperor's death was torsades de pointes, brought on by chronic exposure to arsenic and a medication error.","['Mari, Francesco', 'Bertol, Elisabetta', 'Fineschi, Vittorio', 'Karch, Steven B']","['Mari F', 'Bertol E', 'Fineschi V', 'Karch SB']","['Department of Forensic Toxicology, University of Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Biography', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",England,J R Soc Med,Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine,7802879,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Arsenic Poisoning/*history', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Cause of Death', 'France', 'History, 19th Century', 'Humans', 'Oxides/*poisoning', 'Stomach Neoplasms/drug therapy/*history', 'Torsades de Pointes/*history']",2004/08/03 05:00,2004/09/01 05:00,['2004/08/03 05:00'],"['2004/08/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J R Soc Med. 2004 Aug;97(8):397-9. doi: 10.1258/jrsm.97.8.397.,"['10.1258/jrsm.97.8.397 [doi]', '97/8/397 [pii]']",,,,PMC1079564,,,,,['J R Soc Med. 2004 Oct;97(10):507-8.

Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified hDlg as a cellular binding partner of a viral membrane integral protein, the envelope glycoprotein (Env) of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). HTLV-1 is a human retrovirus that infects CD4+ T lymphocytes and is preferentially transmitted via direct contacts between infected and target cells, through a structure referred to as the virological synapse. Here, we demonstrate that hDlg interacts with a classical PDZ domain-binding motif present at the C-terminus of the cytoplasmic domain of HTLV-1 Env and conserved in the related HTLV-2 virus. We further document that, in HTLV-1 infected primary T cells, hDlg and Env are concentrated in restricted areas of the plasma membrane, enriched in molecules involved in T-cell contacts. The presence of Gag proteins responsible for viral assembly and budding in these areas indicated that they constitute platforms for viral assembly and transmission. Finally, a mutant virus unable to bind hDlg exhibited a decreased ability to trigger Env mediated cell fusion between T lymphocytes. We thus propose that hDlg stabilizes HTLV-1 envelope glycoproteins at the virological synapse formed between infected and target cells, hence assisting the cell-to-cell transmission of the virus.","['Blot, Vincent', 'Delamarre, Lelia', 'Perugi, Fabien', 'Pham, Danielle', 'Benichou, Serge', 'Benarous, Richard', 'Hanada, Toshihiko', 'Chishti, Athar H', 'Dokhelar, Marie-Christine', 'Pique, Claudine']","['Blot V', 'Delamarre L', 'Perugi F', 'Pham D', 'Benichou S', 'Benarous R', 'Hanada T', 'Chishti AH', 'Dokhelar MC', 'Pique C']","['Departement Biologie Cellulaire, CNRS UMR 8104 and INSERM U567, Institut Cochin, 22 rue Mechain, 75014 Paris, France. vblot@cochin.inserm.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DLG1 protein, human)', '0 (Discs Large Homolog 1 Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Discs Large Homolog 1 Protein', 'Gene Products, env/metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/chemistry']",2004/08/03 05:00,2005/04/05 09:00,['2004/08/03 05:00'],"['2004/08/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2004 Aug 1;117(Pt 17):3983-93. doi: 10.1242/jcs.01266.,"['10.1242/jcs.01266 [doi]', '117/17/3983 [pii]']",,['CA 94414/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetics of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory AML. The study population comprised 29 subjects younger than age 18 with AML in first relapse. Dosages of 6, 7.5, and 9 mg/m(2) were administered during the study. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined following each dose for hP67.6, total calicheamicin derivatives, and unconjugated calicheamicin derivatives. hP67.6 pharmacokinetic parameters had a consistent and statistically significant change between the first and second doses. Increases in AUC and decreases in both CL and V(ss) from the first dose to the second dose were consistent with those of the adult population. Changes between dose periods for total calicheamicin derivatives and unconjugated calicheamicin derivatives were consistent with those of hP67.6. Changes in pharmacokinetic parameters between dose periods are attributed to saturation of CD33 binding sites and diminished clearance resulting from a lower peripheral blast burden and antigen. Children receiving 9 mg/m(2) had the following hP67.6 pharmacokinetic parameters: C(max), 3.47+/-1.04 mg/L; AUC, 136 +/- 107 mg x h/L; CL, 0.12 +/- 0.15 L/h/m(2); V(ss), 6.5 +/- 5.5 L; and t(1/2), 64 +/- 44 h after their first dose. Mean pharmacokinetic values are similar to values reported in adults. Individual children demonstrated large intersubject variability, similar to adults. The pharmacokinetics of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in pediatric patients closely follow the profile and variability of adult patients.","['Buckwalter, Mary', 'Dowell, James A', 'Korth-Bradley, Joan', 'Gorovits, Boris', 'Mayer, Philip R']","['Buckwalter M', 'Dowell JA', 'Korth-Bradley J', 'Gorovits B', 'Mayer PR']","['Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Collegeville, Pennsylvania 19426, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,J Clin Pharmacol,Journal of clinical pharmacology,0366372,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Aminoglycosides/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Area Under Curve', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Recurrence', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",2004/08/03 05:00,2005/04/16 09:00,['2004/08/03 05:00'],"['2004/08/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Pharmacol. 2004 Aug;44(8):873-80. doi: 10.1177/0091270004267595.,"['10.1177/0091270004267595 [doi]', '44/8/873 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we have examined in detail the determinants for Tax-mediated transcriptional activation. RESULTS: Whereas previously the LTR enhancer elements were thought to be the sole Tax-targets, herein, we find that the core HTLV-I TATAA motif also provides specific responsiveness not seen with either the SV40 or the E1b TATAA boxes. When enhancer elements which can mediate Tax-responsiveness were compared, the authentic HTLV-I 21-bp repeats were found to be the most effective. Related bZIP factors such as CREB, ATF4, c-Jun and LZIP are often thought to recognize the 21-bp repeats equivalently. However, amongst bZIP factors, we found that CREB, by far, is preferred by Tax for activation. When LTR transcription was reconstituted by substituting either kappaB or serum response elements in place of the 21-bp repeats, Tax activated these surrogate motifs using surfaces which are different from that utilized for CREB interaction. Finally, we employed artificial recruitment of TATA-binding protein to the HTLV-I promoter in ""bypass"" experiments to show for the first time that Tax has transcriptional activity subsequent to the assembly of an initiation complex at the promoter. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal activation of the HTLV-I LTR by Tax specifically requires the core HTLV-I TATAA promoter, CREB and the 21-bp repeats. In addition, we also provide the first evidence for transcriptional activity of Tax after the recruitment of TATA-binding protein to the promoter.","['Ching, Yick-Pang', 'Chun, Abel C S', 'Chin, King-Tung', 'Zhang, Zhi-Qing', 'Jeang, Kuan-Teh', 'Jin, Dong-Yan']","['Ching YP', 'Chun AC', 'Chin KT', 'Zhang ZQ', 'Jeang KT', 'Jin DY']","['Department of Biochemistry, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China. ypching@hkucc.hku.hk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (ALYREF protein, human)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (tumor-associated transplantation antigen)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/genetics', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', '*Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2004/08/03 05:00,2006/08/01 09:00,['2004/08/03 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2004/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/08/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/03 05:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2004 Jul 30;1:18. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-1-18.,"['10.1186/1742-4690-1-18 [doi]', '1742-4690-1-18 [pii]']",20040730,,,PMC509288,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies showed that NALP1 is highly expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In the present study, we report that expression of NALP1 is absent from CD34+ haematopoietic blast cells, and its levels are upregulated upon differentiation of CD34+ cells into granulocytes and to a lesser extent into monocytes. In peripheral blood cells, the highest levels of NALP1 were observed in CD3+ (T-lymphocytes), CD15+ (granulocytes) and CD14+ (monocytes) cell populations. Notably, the expression of NALP1 was significantly increased in the bone marrow blast cell population of some patients with acute leukaemia, but not among tissue samples from thyroid and renal cancer. A search for consensus sites within the NALP1 promoter revealed a sequence for CREB (cAMP-response-element-binding protein) that was required for transcriptional activity. Moreover, treatment of TF1 myeloid leukaemia cells with protein kinase C and protein kinase A activators induced CREB phosphorylation and upregulated the mRNA and protein levels of NALP1. Conversely, ectopic expression of a dominant negative form of CREB in TF1 cells blocked the transcriptional activity of the NALP1 promoter and significantly reduced the expression of NALP1. Thus NALP1 is transcriptionally regulated by CREB in myeloid cells, a mechanism that may contribute to modulate the response of these cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli.","['Sanz, Cristina', 'Calasanz, Maria J', 'Andreu, Enrique', 'Richard, Carlos', 'Prosper, Felipe', 'Fernandez-Luna, Jose L']","['Sanz C', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Andreu E', 'Richard C', 'Prosper F', 'Fernandez-Luna JL']","['Unidad de Genetica Molecular, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, 39008 Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (NLR Proteins)', '0 (NLRP1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/chemistry/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NLR Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology']",2004/08/03 05:00,2005/05/03 09:00,['2004/08/03 05:00'],"['2004/08/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/08/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2004 Dec 1;384(Pt 2):281-6. doi: 10.1042/BJ20040867.,"['10.1042/BJ20040867 [doi]', 'BJ20040867 [pii]']",,,,PMC1134111,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To record the age-specific incidence rate (ASIR) for diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in coloured and white children aged 0 - 12 years in the Western Cape (WC). DESIGN: A retrospective population-based study using the 1991 population census to calculate the mean annual childhood population and the ASIR for ALL in the 0 - 4, 5 - 9 and 10 - 12-year age groups in rural and Cape Town metropolitan areas for the period 1983 - 1999. Odds ratios were calculated using EpiInfo 2000. SETTING: Registry records of the paediatric cancer units at Tygerberg and Red Cross War Memorial Children's hospitals where all children with ALL in the WC were initially treated. SUBJECTS: All white and coloured children aged 0 - 12 years diagnosed as having ALL from 1983 - 1999. OUTCOME MEASURES: The ASIR by age and ethnic group in rural and metropolitan patients in the WC. RESULTS: The estimated annual childhood population in 1991 was 709 151 with 80.4% coloured and 19.6% white children, of whom 60% were resident in the Cape Town metropolitan area and 40% in the rural area of the WC. Of 246 children with ALL diagnosed in the period 1983 - 1999, 144 were male and 102 female. The ASIR in coloured children aged 0 - 4 years was 17.1/10(6) in the rural and 30.5/10(6) in the metropolitan area, compared with 55.7/10(6) and 56.2/10(6) respectively in white children. In the 5 - 9-year age group the ASIR in coloured children was 10.0/10(6) in the rural and 16.6/10(6) in the metropolitan area compared with 27.6/10(6) and 26.7/10(6) respectively in white children. The 10 - 12-year age group had comparable incidence rates in both populations and geographical areas. Only one case occurred within a 20 km radius of the Koeberg nuclear reactor. CONCLUSIONS: White children have an ASIR for ALL comparable to rates of diagnosis in the USA, while only half as many coloured children aged 0 - 9 years were diagnosed in both the rural and metropolitan areas. This contrast may indicate significant underdiagnosis of ALL in coloured children over the period in question. The change in health policy since 1994, which has improved access to primary health care, may improve the rate of diagnosis among coloured and black children.","['Hesseling, P B', 'Hartley, P', 'Zietsman, L', 'van Lill, S', 'Preston-Martin, S', 'Wessels, G']","['Hesseling PB', 'Hartley P', 'Zietsman L', 'van Lill S', 'Preston-Martin S', 'Wessels G']","['Department of Paediatrics, Tygerberg Hospital, University of Stellenbosch, W Cape.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",South Africa,S Afr Med J,South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,0404520,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', '*Blacks', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*ethnology', 'Rural Health', 'South Africa/epidemiology', 'Urban Health', '*Whites']",2004/08/03 05:00,2004/09/02 05:00,['2004/08/03 05:00'],"['2004/08/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/02 05:00 [medline]', '2004/08/03 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,S Afr Med J. 2004 Jul;94(7):533-6.,,,['1F06TW02352/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As no comparable TCRB PCR method pre-existed and only a limited number of samples was tested within the BIOMED-2 study, we initiated this study for further validation of the newly developed TCRB PCR approach by comparing PCR data with previously generated Southern blot (SB) data in a series of 66 immature (ALL) and 36 mature T-cell malignancies.

Discrepancies consisted of either failure to detect SB-detected TCRB rearrangements by PCR (6.5%) or detection of an additional non-SB defined rearrangement (2.5%). In 99% of cases (99/100), at least one clonal TCRB rearrangement was detected by PCR in the SB-positive cases.

To evaluate whether one (or more) of the candidate genes is the actual target of the 12p12-13 deletions, we examined the genomics and the expression status of these genes in ALL patients. Although we found nine DNA variants in these genes, no inactivating mutations were found in the leukemia cells of patients with 12p hemizygous deletions. Expression analysis revealed that most 12p hemizygously deleted samples also carried a t(12;21) translocation, of which none expressed ETV6 from the nontranslocated allele. Furthermore, we observed one case of t(12;21) without deletion of ETV6, in which the expression of this gene was greatly reduced, indicating a different mechanism of inactivation. None of the other genes showed a significant decrease in expression, suggesting that ETV6 is indeed the target of deletions in ALL patients.","['Montpetit, A', 'Larose, J', 'Boily, G', 'Langlois, S', 'Trudel, N', 'Sinnett, D']","['Montpetit A', 'Larose J', 'Boily G', 'Langlois S', 'Trudel N', 'Sinnett D']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Research Center, Sainte-Justine Hospital, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2004/07/31 05:00,2004/09/17 05:00,['2004/07/31 05:00'],"['2004/07/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/31 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Sep;18(9):1499-504. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403441.,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2403441 [doi]', '2403441 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transplantation of histocompatible WT Sca-1(+) cells into C3(-/-) mice resulted in a (i) decrease in day 12 CFU-S, (ii) 5-7-day delay in platelet and leukocyte recovery, and (iii) reduced number of BM CFU-GM progenitors at day 16 after transplantation. Nevertheless, HSPC from C3(-/-) mice engrafted normally into irradiated WT mice, suggesting that there was a defect in the hematopoietic environment of C3(-/-) mice. Since C3(-/-) mice cannot activate/cleave C3, the C3 fragments C3a, C3a(des-Arg), and iC3b were examined for a role in HSPC engraftment. Liquid-phase C3a and C3a(des-Arg) increased CXCR4 incorporation into membrane lipid rafts (thus potentiating HSPC responses to SDF-1 gradients), whereas iC3b was deposited onto irradiated BM cells and functioned to tether CR3(CD11b/CD18)(+)HSPC to damaged stroma. The activity of C3a(des-Arg) suggested that C3aR(+)HSPC also expressed the C5L2 (receptor for C3a and C3a(des-Arg)) and this was confirmed. In conclusion, a novel mechanism for HSC engraftment was identified, which involves complement activation and specific C3 fragments that promote conditioning for transplantation and enhance HSPC engraftment.","['Ratajczak, M Z', 'Reca, R', 'Wysoczynski, M', 'Kucia, M', 'Baran, J T', 'Allendorf, D J', 'Ratajczak, J', 'Ross, G D']","['Ratajczak MZ', 'Reca R', 'Wysoczynski M', 'Kucia M', 'Baran JT', 'Allendorf DJ', 'Ratajczak J', 'Ross GD']","['Stem Cell Biology Program at the James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA. mzrata01@louisville.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Complement C3)', '0 (Ly6a protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (complement C3a receptor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*physiology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Complement Activation', 'Complement C3/genetics/*physiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Microdomains/chemistry/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'Receptors, Complement/genetics/physiology', 'Stromal Cells/cytology', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2004/07/31 05:00,2004/09/17 05:00,['2004/07/31 05:00'],"['2004/07/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/31 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Sep;18(9):1482-90. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403446.,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2403446 [doi]', '2403446 [pii]']",,"['R01 CA86412/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL61796/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Affected patients display an increased bone mass and hematological defects. The osteopetrotic oc/oc mouse displays a bone phenotype similar to the one observed in IMO patients, and the same gene, Tcirg1, is mutated in this model and in the majority of these patients. Therefore, we explored in oc/oc mice the consequences of the perturbed bone microenvironment on hematopoiesis. We show that the myelomonocytic differentiation is increased, leading to an elevated number of OCLs and dendritic cells. B lymphopoiesis is blocked at the pro-B stage in the bone marrow of oc/oc mouse, leading to a low mature B-cell number. T-cell activation is also affected, with a reduction of IFNgamma secretion by splenic CD4(+) T cells. These alterations are associated with a low IL-7 expression in bone marrow. All these data indicate that the lack of bone resorption in oc/oc mice has important consequences in both myelopoiesis and lymphopoiesis, leading to a form of immunodeficiency. The oc/oc mouse is therefore an appropriate model to understand the hematological defects described in IMO patients, and to derive new therapeutic strategies.","['Blin-Wakkach, C', 'Wakkach, A', 'Sexton, P M', 'Rochet, N', 'Carle, G F']","['Blin-Wakkach C', 'Wakkach A', 'Sexton PM', 'Rochet N', 'Carle GF']","['GPM FRE2720, CNRS/UNSA, Faculte de Medecine, av de Valombrose, Nice, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interleukin-7)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', '*Bone Resorption', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Dendritic Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-7/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphopoiesis/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Osteoclasts/metabolism', 'Osteopetrosis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology']",2004/07/31 05:00,2004/09/17 05:00,['2004/07/31 05:00'],"['2004/07/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/31 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Sep;18(9):1505-11. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403449.,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2403449 [doi]', '2403449 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the results on the development of MF during interferon-alpha therapy of CML are controversial. The significance of the interferon dose has not been considered as yet. In total, 627 bone marrow biopsies taken prospectively from 200 patients with CML recruited in two studies using different doses of interferon-alpha +/- low-dose cytosine arabinoside were examined for MF before and during therapy. The results showed that the risk of MF depended significantly on the interferon-alpha dose applied (P<0.000005). MF progressed during low-dose therapy (3 x 5 x 10(6) IU/week), but was prevented from progression when applying high dose (5 x 10(6) IU/m(2)/per day). MF disappeared when high-dose interferon-alpha was combined with low-dose cytosine arabinoside (P<0.000005). The risk of death markedly increased when MF occurred or progressed (P<0.0009), independent of all other prognostic factors evaluated including the cytogenetic response. In conclusion, the effectiveness of interferon-alpha on MF depends on the treatment intensity. MF reverses when combining high-dose interferon-alpha with low-dose cytosine arabinoside, but progresses when applying low-dose interferon-alpha. MF appears to be a significant early indicator of ineffective therapy in CML.","['Buesche, G', 'Freund, M', 'Hehlmann, R', 'Georgii, A', 'Ganser, A', 'Hecker, H', 'Heimpel, H', 'Fonatsch, C', 'Heinze, B', 'Pfirrmann, M', 'Holgado, S', 'Schmeil, A', 'Tobler, A', 'Hasford, J', 'Buhr, T', 'Kreipe, H-H']","['Buesche G', 'Freund M', 'Hehlmann R', 'Georgii A', 'Ganser A', 'Hecker H', 'Heimpel H', 'Fonatsch C', 'Heinze B', 'Pfirrmann M', 'Holgado S', 'Schmeil A', 'Tobler A', 'Hasford J', 'Buhr T', 'Kreipe HH']","['Institut fur Pathologie, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Germany.

We found both in skin lesions and in invaded lymph nodes an expression by tumor cells of CXCR3, CXCR4, and CCR7, and the concomitant expression by cells in the microenvironment of their respective ligands CXCL9, CXCL12, and CCL19. Moreover, flow cytometry phenotype of leukemic PDC (LPDC) revealed an unexpected expression of CCR6. We show that fresh tumor cells are able to migrate in response to CXCR4, CCR2, CCR5, CCR6, and CCR7 ligands, and the ability of CXCR3 ligands to increase the responsiveness to CXCL12. IL-3- or virus-induced activation of LPDC leads to downregulation of CXCR3 and CXCR4, and upregulation of CCR7, associated with the loss of response to CXCL12, and the acquisition of sensitivity to CCL19. Altogether, these results suggest that the preferential accumulation of LPDC in the skin or lymph nodes could be orchestrated by CXCR3, CXCR4, CCR6, and CCR7 ligands, found in nontumoral structures of invaded organs.","['Bendriss-Vermare, N', 'Chaperot, L', ""Peoc'h, M"", 'Vanbervliet, B', 'Jacob, M-C', 'Briere, F', 'Bensa, J-C', 'Caux, C', 'Plumas, J']","['Bendriss-Vermare N', 'Chaperot L', ""Peoc'h M"", 'Vanbervliet B', 'Jacob MC', 'Briere F', 'Bensa JC', 'Caux C', 'Plumas J']","['Schering Plough Laboratory for Immunological Research, Dardilly, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CCL19 protein, human)', '0 (CCR7 protein, human)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCL9 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR3 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL19)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL9)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR3)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Cell Movement', 'Chemokine CCL19', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokine CXCL9', 'Chemokines, CC/metabolism', 'Chemokines, CXC/metabolism', 'Chemotaxis', 'Child', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Lymph Nodes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Plasma Cells/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, CCR7', 'Receptors, CXCR3', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Chemokine/*metabolism', 'Skin Diseases/*metabolism/pathology']",2004/07/31 05:00,2004/09/17 05:00,['2004/07/31 05:00'],"['2004/07/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/31 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Sep;18(9):1491-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403452.,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2403452 [doi]', '2403452 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This study included 154 children with newly diagnosed ALL below the age of 18 years during the period August 1, 1998, to December 31, 2000. All patients were treated according to the NCI, Cairo, Egypt, treatment protocol modified from study XIII for high-risk ALL of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. RESULTS: B-cell precursor phenotype was encountered in 73.4% of patients, T-cell in 26.6%. According to NCI/Rome criteria for risk classification, 58.4% of patients were in the high-risk group (90% of T-lineage compared with 47% of B-lineage ALL, P < 0.001). Nine patients (5.8%) died during induction and 10 patients (6.5%) failed to achieve remission. With a median follow-up of 43 months, the 3-year disease-free survival and its probability at 5 years were 80 +/- 3.6% and 75.3 +/- 4%, respectively; the 3-year event-free survival and its probability at 5 years were 69 +/- 3.8% and 65.2 +/- 4%, respectively. B-cell precursor ALL had 5-year probabilities of disease-free survival and event-free survival of 80.5 +/- 4% and 71.8 +/- 4.5% compared with 60.2 +/- 8.6% and 46.7 +/- 8% for T-cell, respectively (P < 0.01, log-rank test). Prognostic factors that had a statistically significant unfavorable impact on survival by univariate analysis were age 10 years or more, central nervous system involvement, T-lineage phenotype, high-risk group, DNA index less than 1.16, and slow early response to treatment. By multivariate analysis, central nervous system involvement, high-risk group, and slow early response to treatment still had prognostic significance. Risk classification demonstrated prognostic significance for B-lineage but not T-lineage ALL. CONCLUSIONS: This treatment protocol was effective in improving ALL survival among patients at the authors' institute compared with previous trials, although the outcome remains lower than that in more industrialized countries. Prognostic factors defined in this study were similar to those identified by other cooperative groups.","['Hussein, Hany', 'Sidhom, Iman', 'Naga, Sherif Aboul', 'Amin, Manal', 'Ebied, Emad', 'Khairy, Ashraf', 'Kamel, Azza', 'El-Sharkawy, Nahla']","['Hussein H', 'Sidhom I', 'Naga SA', 'Amin M', 'Ebied E', 'Khairy A', 'Kamel A', 'El-Sharkawy N']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Academies and Institutes', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Egypt', 'Federal Government', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/07/31 05:00,2004/09/04 05:00,['2004/07/31 05:00'],"['2004/07/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/31 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2004 Aug;26(8):507-14. doi: 10.1097/01.mph.0000132735.93396.92.,"['00043426-200408000-00009 [pii]', '10.1097/01.mph.0000132735.93396.92 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May 2001 and February 2002, five patients between 4 and 12 years of age, receiving maintenance chemotherapy for ALL, presented with symptoms suggesting B19 infection (pallor, fatigue, petechiae and pancytopenia in four patients; generalized rash in two patients; acute hepatitis in one patient). Qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on peripheral blood was used for diagnosis and follow-up of infection; quantitative PCR was used for viral load measurement. Intravenous nonspecific high-dose immunoglobulin therapy was administered until PCR was negative. RESULTS: Qualitative B19 DNA was found in the peripheral blood of all patients, confirming the infection. Viral load at diagnosis ranged from 10 to 10 particles/mL blood. B19 DNA was detectable in four patients at 45, 21, 40, and 44 weeks, respectively. Chemotherapy was delayed in all patients. No clear benefit of intravenous immunoglobulin was noted. CONCLUSIONS: Infection with B19 is rarely reported in patients with ALL, but it should be suspected when unexplained pancytopenia occurs during chemotherapy. Persistent B19 infection remains a challenge in the management of patients receiving maintenance chemotherapy for ALL, as no specific therapy such as a specific immunoglobulin or vaccine exists. The role of viral load measurement needs to be established in terms of its use in follow-up and evaluation of the therapeutic response.","['Fattet, Sarah', 'Cassinotti, Pascal', 'Popovic, Maja Beck']","['Fattet S', 'Cassinotti P', 'Popovic MB']","['Pediatric Oncology and Hematology Unit, University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland. sarah.fattet@curie.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Erythema Infectiosum/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Parvovirus B19, Human/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/virology']",2004/07/31 05:00,2004/09/04 05:00,['2004/07/31 05:00'],"['2004/07/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/31 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2004 Aug;26(8):497-503. doi: 10.1097/01.mph.0000134463.09543.99.,"['00043426-200408000-00007 [pii]', '10.1097/01.mph.0000134463.09543.99 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify genetic polymorphisms that alter the function of human GGH, we sequenced the GGH exons of genomic DNA from children with ALL, who had a 7.8-fold range of GGH activity in their ALL cells at diagnosis. A single nucleotide polymorphism (452C>T, T127I) was found among patients with low GGH activity, but not found in patients with high GGH activity. Computational modelling indicated that the T127I substitution alters the molecular surface conformation at the catalytic cleft-tail on GGH, which is predicted to alter binding affinity with long chain but not short-chain methotrexate polyglutamates. Enzyme kinetic analysis of heterologously expressed GGH revealed a significantly higher Km (2.7-fold) and lower catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km reduced 67%) of the T127I variant compared to wild-type GGH using long-chain MTXPG5 as substrate, but not a significant change with short-chain MTXPG2.

This approach allowed us to identify significant differences in miRNome expression between CLL samples and normal CD5+ B cells; data were confirmed by Northern blot analyses and real-time RT-PCR. At least two distinct clusters of CLL samples can be identified that were associated with the presence or absence of Zap-70 expression, a predictor of early disease progression. Two miRNA signatures were associated with the presence or absence of mutations in the expressed Ig variableregion genes or with deletions at 13q14, respectively.

It follows that maintenance of optimal organ function depends on the elimination of oxidatively damaged cells and their replacement with new cells. To examine the effects of oxidative stress and apoptosis on the accumulation of oxidized proteins, we exposed acute promyelocytic leukemia cells to arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) in the presence and absence of a general caspase inhibitor (benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone), which is known to inhibit caspase-induced apoptosis. We confirm that treatment of cells with As(2)O(3) induces apoptosis and leads to the accumulation of oxidized proteins. Furthermore, inhibition of caspase activities prevented As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis and led to a substantial increase in accumulation of oxidized proteins. Moreover, inhibition of caspase activity in the absence of As(2)O(3) led to elevated levels of the LMP2 immunoproteasome protein. We also show that caspase inhibition leads to increases in the levels of oxidized proteins obtained by treatments with hydrogen peroxide plus ferrous iron. Collectively, these results suggest the possibility that an age-related loss in capacity to carry out apoptosis might contribute to the observed accumulation of oxidized proteins during aging and in age-related diseases.","['Khan, Mohammed A S', 'Oubrahim, Hammou', 'Stadtman, Earl R']","['Khan MA', 'Oubrahim H', 'Stadtman ER']","['Laboratory of Biochemistry, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-8012, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proteins)', '144416-78-4 (LMP-2 protein)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Aging/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Iron/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Proteins/analysis/*metabolism']",2004/07/31 05:00,2004/09/30 05:00,['2004/07/31 05:00'],"['2004/07/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/31 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Aug 10;101(32):11560-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0404101101.

Rh-specific T(H) cells were also detected in a number of patients with CLL who, although they did not have AIHA, had low levels of anti-RBC antibody in their sera. Fractionation of putative APC populations from the peripheral blood of patients by negative selection showed that CD5+ CLL cells are the most effective cell type in processing and presenting purified Rh protein to autoreactive T(H) cells. This ability was confirmed using positively selected CD5+ CLL cells.

In HCL, there is no phenotypic evidence for subpopulations, and single cells from one previous case contained transcripts for several isotypes. This raises the questions of the differentiation status of the cell of origin and of posttransformation events. We have investigated 9 cases, all expressing multiple immunoglobulin isotypes. Multiple tumor-derived variable-(diversity)-joining-constant mu delta, gamma, alpha (V(D)J-Cmu, delta, gamma, alpha) transcripts were confirmed in single cells of a further case. All cases were negative for germinal center (GC)-associated markers CD27 and CD38. Seven of 9 cases had mutated V(H) genes, with low levels of intraclonal heterogeneity, but 2 of 9 were unmutated, indicative of pre-GC origin. Eight of 9 cases expressed activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a molecule essential for somatic mutation and isotype switch. All cases expressed germ line heavy-chain I exon (I(H))-C(H) transcripts which paralleled surface immunoglobulin (sIg) isotype. Significantly, no circle transcripts indicative of deletional recombination of switched isotypes were detectable in 9 of 9 cases. These data indicate heterogeneity in the cell of origin in terms of mutational status, but reveal common features of AID expression and isotype-switching events occurring prior to deletional recombination. Both mutational and switching events may be influenced by environmental factors at extrafollicular sites.","['Forconi, Francesco', 'Sahota, Surinder S', 'Raspadori, Donatella', 'Ippoliti, Micaela', 'Babbage, Gavin', 'Lauria, Francesco', 'Stevenson, Freda K']","['Forconi F', 'Sahota SS', 'Raspadori D', 'Ippoliti M', 'Babbage G', 'Lauria F', 'Stevenson FK']","['Unita Operativa Complessa Ematologia e Trapianti, Dipartimento di Medicina Clinica e Scienze Immunologiche, Universita di Siena, Italy. forconif@unisi.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin D)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/metabolism', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'Cytosine Deaminase/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/immunology', 'Germinal Center/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin D/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin G/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin M/genetics', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*genetics/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mutation/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/metabolism']",2004/07/31 05:00,2004/12/24 09:00,['2004/07/31 05:00'],"['2004/07/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/31 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Nov 15;104(10):3312-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-03-0950.

By using a comprehensive panel of monoclonal antibodies we identified at least one leukemia-associated aberrant immunophenotype (LAIP) in each patient.

Later, MgcRacGAP was found to play crucial roles in cell division. However, how MgcRacGAP enhanced IL-6-induced differentiation remained elusive. Here we show that MgcRacGAP enhances IL-6-induced differentiation through enhancement of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) activation. MgcRacGAP, Rac, and STAT3 formed a complex in IL-6-stimulated M1 cells, where MgcRacGAP interacted with Rac1 and STAT3 through its cysteine-rich domain and GAP domain. In reporter assays, the wild-type MgcRacGAP enhanced transcriptional activation of STAT3 while a GAP-domain deletion mutant (DeltaGAP) did not significantly enhance it, suggesting that the GAP domain was required for enhancement of STAT3-dependent transcription. Intriguingly, M1 cells expressing DeltaGAP had no effect on the differentiation signal of IL-6, while forced expression of MgcRacGAP rendered M1 cells hyperresponsive to the IL-6-induced differentiation. Moreover, knockdown of MgcRacGAP by RNA interference profoundly suppressed STAT3 activation, implicating MgcRacGAP in the STAT3-dependent transcription. All together, our data not only reveal an important role for MgcRacGAP in STAT3 activation, but also demonstrate that MgcRacGAP regulates IL-6-induced cellular differentiation in which STAT3 plays a pivotal role.","['Tonozuka, Yukio', 'Minoshima, Yukinori', 'Bao, Ying Chun', 'Moon, Yuseok', 'Tsubono, Yohei', 'Hatori, Tomonori', 'Nakajima, Hideaki', 'Nosaka, Tetsuya', 'Kawashima, Toshiyuki', 'Kitamura, Toshio']","['Tonozuka Y', 'Minoshima Y', 'Bao YC', 'Moon Y', 'Tsubono Y', 'Hatori T', 'Nakajima H', 'Nosaka T', 'Kawashima T', 'Kitamura T']","['Division of Cellular Therapy, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (mgcRacGAP)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",2004/07/31 05:00,2004/12/31 09:00,['2004/07/31 05:00'],"['2004/07/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/31 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/31 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Dec 1;104(12):3550-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-03-1066.

In order to evaluate if light propofol anesthesia in the pediatric oncology ward (POW) could improve the management of procedure pain and anxiety, a questionnaire was developed. METHODS: After prolonged EMLA application, 65 propofol anesthetics were performed successfully in 28 children during lumbar puncture and/or bone marrow aspiration in the POW, with short recovery time and without major adverse events. The questionnaire was mailed to the parents of the 28 children who were included in the survey. RESULTS: The return of questionnaire compliance was 89% (25 of 28), 12 females and 13 males, mean age was 7 years (range 2-16). Among those who replied, the diagnoses were acute lymphatic leukemia in 21, lymphoma in two and tumor in the other two. In the questionnaire, all parents/patients reported advantages with anesthesia in the POW compared with the operating room. In the list of stated advantages, 88% marked 'familiar nurses and doctors', 84% 'familiar environment', 80% 'closer to own room', 68% 'the child more calm', 72% 'shorter waiting-time', 60% 'faster recovery', 44% 'shorter fasting-time' and 44% 'parents more calm', as benefits. For future procedures requiring anesthesia to reduce pain, discomfort and/or anxiety, 92% of the parents/patients preferred anesthesia in the POW. CONCLUSIONS: If anesthesia is chosen for invasive procedures, this study suggest that propofol anesthesia in the POW is preferred by parents and children.","['Von Heijne, Margareta', 'Bredlov, Britt', 'Soderhall, Stefan', 'Olsson, Gunnar L']","['Von Heijne M', 'Bredlov B', 'Soderhall S', 'Olsson GL']","[""Paediatric Anaesthesia, Intensive Care and Pain treatment, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Karolinska Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. margareta.vonheijne@ks.se""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",France,Paediatr Anaesth,Paediatric anaesthesia,9206575,"['0 (Anesthetics, Intravenous)', '1N74HM2BS7 (Alfentanil)', 'YI7VU623SF (Propofol)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alfentanil/*therapeutic use', 'Anesthetics, Intravenous/therapeutic use', 'Anxiety/prevention & control', 'Biopsy, Needle/adverse effects/psychology', 'Bone Marrow Examination/adverse effects/psychology', 'Child', 'Child, Hospitalized/psychology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures/*adverse effects/psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Oncology Service, Hospital', 'Pain/etiology/*prevention & control/psychology', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Propofol/*therapeutic use', 'Spinal Puncture/adverse effects/psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Sweden']",2004/07/31 05:00,2004/12/30 09:00,['2004/07/31 05:00'],"['2004/07/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/30 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/31 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Paediatr Anaesth. 2004 Aug;14(8):670-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1460-9592.2004.01279.x.,"['10.1111/j.1460-9592.2004.01279.x [doi]', 'PAN1279 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In patients with CML who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation, imatinib has the capability to induce hematological and even molecular response, and provides a prolonged survival among those in the chronic and accelerated phases. It has been demonstrated that major cytogenic response is a surrogate marker for survival in cases receiving imatinib. It has also been demonstrated that a genome-wide cDNA microarray enables the prediction of sensitivity to imatinib. The acquired resistance in patients who failed to respond to imatinib seemed to be induced by several point mutations in the BCR-ABL gene, which were likely to affect the binding of imatinib with BCR-ABL. Polyclonal cells which harbor distinct mutations in a single patient seemed to be selected in vivo under the selective pressure of imatinib, indicating the rationale of combined treatment with other types of agents.

STI571 (imatinib mesylate) is an example of the successful development of a rationally designed and targeted agent. Its target is the constitutively active tyrosine kinase, BCR-ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Clinical studies with STI571 in CML demonstrated that many patients with advanced stage disease respond initially but then relapse. Drug resistance is associated with the reactivation of BCR-ABL signal transduction. Another targeted protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that was approved for clinical use is ZD1839 (Iressa). ZD1839 is an orally active and selective inhibitor for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase. HER2 is overexpressed in 25-30% of breast cancers and associated with shorter time to relapse and lower survival rate. Specific targeting of these cancers can be accomplished with Herceptin directed against the extracellular domain of the HER2 protein. However, even in the selected group of patients with high levels of HER2, the response to Herceptin is limited in magnitude and duration.

These disorders range from benign polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia to indeterminate monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) to malignant dyscrasias, including multiple myeloma and plasma cell leukemia. Hypergammaglobulinemia and oligoclonal banding had been the most frequently reported disorders in the pre-HAART era. In HIV-infected persons, the incidence of MGUS is reported to be around 2.5%, with an approximate 4.5-fold increased risk of multiple myeloma. Many of these HIV-infected patients had been treated with alkylator-based regimens, and these reports predate the current widespread use of thalidomide-dexamethasone combination treatment in multiple myeloma. Although the optimal therapy for an HIV-infected person might with plasma cell dyscrasia is yet to be defined, in the current era of HAART the otherwise healthy HIV-infected patient might be tested like an HIV-negative person. Consequently, treatment with immunomodulatory agents (eg, thalidomide) and proteasome inhibitors (eg, bortezomib) may also be worth considering. High-dose chemotherapy with an autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant is increasingly being considered as consolidation therapy in the younger non-HIV-infected myeloma patient. In the next few years, it is anticipated that these approaches will be applied more frequently to HIV-infected persons with myeloma.","['Dezube, Bruce J', 'Aboulafia, David M', 'Pantanowitz, Liron']","['Dezube BJ', 'Aboulafia DM', 'Pantanowitz L']","['AIDS Malignancy Research and Treatment Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,AIDS Read,The AIDS reader,9206753,['4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)'],,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/*complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance/*complications/immunology/therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications/immunology/therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Thalidomide/therapeutic use']",2004/07/31 05:00,2004/08/20 05:00,['2004/07/31 05:00'],"['2004/07/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/31 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,"AIDS Read. 2004 Jul;14(7):372-4, 377-9.",,,,49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This unusual case demonstrates the importance of cytogenetic abnormalities found in cases of HPS and the importance of repeated testing when an underlying disease is suspected.","['Goldschmidt, Neta', 'Gural, Alexander', 'Kornberg, Abraham', 'Spectre, Galia', 'Shopen, Andrei', 'Paltiel, Ora']","['Goldschmidt N', 'Gural A', 'Kornberg A', 'Spectre G', 'Shopen A', 'Paltiel O']","['Department of Hematology, Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel. goldschn@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease Progression', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Fever of Unknown Origin/*etiology', 'Histiocytosis, Non-Langerhans-Cell/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancytopenia/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/genetics/pathology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Rituximab', 'Splenomegaly/etiology', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2004/07/30 05:00,2004/09/17 05:00,['2004/07/30 05:00'],"['2004/07/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/30 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2004 Aug;76(4):364-7. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20123.,['10.1002/ajh.20123 [doi]'],,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,['Am J Hematol. 2005 Mar;78(3):246-7.

The ABL gene on chromosome band 9q34 is a proto-oncogene and is the well-known translocation partner of the BCR gene on 22q11 giving rise to t(9;22)(q34;q11), which is the hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia and is the most common chromosomal abnormality in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Amplification of ABL is an exceedingly rare event, with only less than 5 cases reported in the literature. The p16(INK4a) (or CDKN2A) gene on 9p21 is a tumor suppressor gene, and deletion thereof is recently recognized as one of the most common genetic abnormalities in ALL. The authors herein describe an 8-year-old male patient with precursor T-cell ALL harboring both ABL gene amplification and p16(INK4a) gene deletion. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using BCR/ABL probes revealed five or more ABL signals, indicating amplification in 51.5% of interphase nuclei. FISH using p16(INK4a) gene probes showed heterozygous p16(INK4a) deletion in 71.0%. On conventional cytogenetic analysis, however, only 10 metaphases were available, which showed the normal karyotype, 46,XY[10], serving no evidence for the findings on FISH. This is the first report of an ALL case with ABL amplification, and the authors speculate that both ABL proto-oncogene amplification and the p16(INK4a) tumor suppressor gene deletion have been implicated in leukemogenesis in the present case, although whether the ABL amplification truly contributes to the leukemogenesis or merely an epiphenomenon representing underlying genomic instability remains to be determined.","['Kim, Hee-Jin', 'Woo, Hee-Yeon', 'Koo, Hong-Hoe', 'Tak, Eun-Young', 'Kim, Sun-Hee']","['Kim HJ', 'Woo HY', 'Koo HH', 'Tak EY', 'Kim SH']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics/ultrastructure', '*Gene Amplification', '*Gene Deletion', '*Genes, abl', '*Genes, p16', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas']",2004/07/30 05:00,2004/09/17 05:00,['2004/07/30 05:00'],"['2004/07/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/30 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2004 Aug;76(4):360-3. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20117.,['10.1002/ajh.20117 [doi]'],,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this analysis, the outcome of patients entered into two consecutive prospective trials was compared. Inclusion criteria in both arms were identical and consisted of primary AML in adults. Treatment protocol for Cape Town Regimen 4 (CTR-IV) comprised of cytarabine infusion (100 mg/m(2)) and etoposide (100 mg/m(2)), injection daily for 7 days in combination with daunorubicin (45 mg/m(2)) on days 1, 2, and 3. Patients achieving remission were given two further courses of the same chemotherapy and received allogeneic or autologous transplantation. CTR-V was a similar treatment program, except that daunorubicin was escalated on days 1, 2, and 3 to 75 mg/m(2) during induction and to 60 mg/m(2) during a single consolidation. Patients were also offered stem cell transplantation. Between 1990 and 1997, 78 patients (median age 33; range 13-67 years) fulfilled entry criteria and received CTR-IV. From 1998 onwards, 35 patients (median age 36; range 15-66 years) were prospectively enlisted into the CTR-V trial. The patient population in CTR-V had fewer Caucasian individuals (P = 0.02) and had significantly lower presentation hemoglobin (P = 0.0002). Following initiation of induction chemotherapy, 40 patients failed to respond. Among these, 10 patients demised before day 28. Another 30 (25/69 CTR-IV and 5/32 in CTR-V groups; P = 0.01) had leukemia that was resistant to chemotherapy, and all died. Remission was achieved in 59% of patients treated with CTR-IV and 77% of those receiving CTR-V (P = 0.03). CR occurred with a single course in 64% versus 88% (P = 0.02), respectively. There were no differences in the toxicity profile between these two combinations. Disease recurred in 50% and 28% (P = 0.07) of patients. For the 113 individuals, median follow up is 254 (range 19-4,451) and 304 (12-1,702; P = 0.03) days. Survival is 23% and 40%, respectively, favoring patients treated with CTR-V (log rank; P = 0.03). Cox regression analysis showed that treatment group (P < 0.001), FAB type, hemoglobin level, and platelet count were independent factors for response to chemotherapy. Older age and not undergoing myeloablative therapy were the only adverse factors for survival. We conclude that increase in the treatment dose of daunorubicin in patients with AML led to a higher remission rate, particularly with a single course of chemotherapy and had an equivalent toxicity profile. This therapeutic modification is also likely to result in substantial reduction in patient stay in hospital and in the overall expenditure.","['Novitzky, N', 'Thomas, V', 'Abrahams, L', 'du Toit, C', 'McDonald, A']","['Novitzky N', 'Thomas V', 'Abrahams L', 'du Toit C', 'McDonald A']","['The University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre and the Department of Haematology Groote Schuur Hospital, Observatory, Cape Town, South Africa. novitzky@cormack.uct.ac.za']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'CTR III protocol']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/07/30 05:00,2004/09/17 05:00,['2004/07/30 05:00'],"['2004/07/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/30 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2004 Aug;76(4):319-29. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20120.,['10.1002/ajh.20120 [doi]'],,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a phase I/II study to determine whether administration of CD25-specific antibody conjugated to ricin toxin A could reduce the risk of grade III or IV GVHD after marrow transplantation from HLA-matched unrelated donors. All patients received methotrexate and cyclosporine after the transplantation. The immunotoxin was given to 36 patients for 4 consecutive days beginning approximately 36 hours after the marrow infusion was completed. Fourteen (40%) of the 35 patients who could be evaluated developed grade III or IV GVHD. In a contemporaneous population of 121 patients who received marrow from HLA-matched unrelated donors and were given methotrexate and cyclosporine without the immunotoxin, the incidence of grades III and IV GVHD was 24%. Cyclosporine blocked the induction of CD25 expression on alloactivated T cells in vitro but had no detectable effect on CD25 expression by T-regulatory cells. Taken together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that cyclosporine protected alloactivated donor T cells from the effects of the immunotoxin, whereas the CD25+ T-regulatory cells remained susceptible, causing an unexpected exacerbation of acute GVHD.","['Martin, Paul J', 'Pei, Ji', 'Gooley, Ted', 'Anasetti, Claudio', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Deeg, Joachim', 'Hansen, John A', 'Nash, Richard A', 'Petersdorf, Effie W', 'Storb, Rainer', 'Ghetie, Victor', 'Schindler, John', 'Vitetta, Ellen S']","['Martin PJ', 'Pei J', 'Gooley T', 'Anasetti C', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Deeg J', 'Hansen JA', 'Nash RA', 'Petersdorf EW', 'Storb R', 'Ghetie V', 'Schindler J', 'Vitetta ES']","['Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109-1024, USA. pmartin@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (RFT5-SMPT-dgA immunotoxin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Cyclosporine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/etiology/*prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens/analysis/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates', 'Intestines/pathology', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Liver/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Selection', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*immunology/metabolism', 'Ricin/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Skin/pathology', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2004/07/30 05:00,2005/03/16 09:00,['2004/07/30 05:00'],"['2004/07/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/30 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2004 Aug;10(8):552-60. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2004.04.002.,"['10.1016/j.bbmt.2004.04.002 [doi]', 'S1083879104002009 [pii]']",,"['AI33484/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent clinical data suggest that a subset of donor dendritic cells may inhibit the graft-versus-tumor activity of donor T cells. We studied the immunoregulatory activity of donor dendritic cells in allogeneic BMT between major histocompatibility complex-disparate strains of mice. Bone marrow grafts enriched or depleted of CD11b- and CD11b+ dendritic cell subsets by immunomagnetic cell sorting were combined with small numbers of congenic splenic T cells. Recipients of CD11b-depleted bone marrow had significant posttransplantation expansion of donor spleen-derived CD4+ memory T cells compared with recipients of unmanipulated bone marrow. CD11b depletion enhanced the antitumor activity of the splenic donor T cells without producing significant graft-versus-host disease and resulted in long-term survival after a supralethal dose of T-cell leukemia administered after BMT. Expansion of donor spleen-derived T cells was proportional to the number of CD11b- dendritic cells in the bone marrow graft and was associated with increased levels of serum interferon-gamma. Thus, manipulating the content of donor antigen-presenting cells in allogeneic BMT is a novel strategy to activate donor memory T cells and enhance allogeneic graft-versus-leukemia effects with minimal graft-versus-host disease.","['Li, Jian-Ming', 'Waller, Edmund K']","['Li JM', 'Waller EK']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/chemistry/cytology/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Blood Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/cytology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'CD11b Antigen/analysis', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Cell Separation', 'Dendritic Cells/chemistry/cytology/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-gamma/blood/metabolism', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Liver/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/transplantation', 'Transplantation Immunology/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2004/07/30 05:00,2005/03/16 09:00,['2004/07/30 05:00'],"['2004/07/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/30 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2004 Aug;10(8):540-51. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2004.05.007.,"['10.1016/j.bbmt.2004.05.007 [doi]', 'S1083879104002502 [pii]']",,['R01 CA-74364-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, the phenotype of bound cells could be correlated to surface antigen expression, which illustrated the potential of the solid-phase cytometry developed here for the identification of surface markers.","['Ko, In Kap', 'Kato, Koichi', 'Iwata, Hiroo']","['Ko IK', 'Kato K', 'Iwata H']","['Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, 53 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Biomaterials,Biomaterials,8100316,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '0 (Membranes, Artificial)', '0 (NES protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nes protein, rat)', '0 (Nestin)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (Vimentin)', '9004-34-6 (Cellulose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured/immunology', 'Cellulose', 'Corpus Striatum/cytology/embryology/immunology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/analysis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/analysis/immunology', 'Membranes, Artificial', '*Microarray Analysis', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/analysis/immunology', 'Nestin', 'Neurons/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Stem Cells/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tubulin/analysis/immunology', 'Vimentin/analysis/immunology']",2004/07/30 05:00,2005/03/02 09:00,['2004/07/30 05:00'],"['2003/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/30 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biomaterials. 2005 Feb;26(6):687-96. doi: 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.03.014.,"['10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.03.014 [doi]', 'S0142961204002704 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Twelve out of the 13 patients enrolled on study were evaluable (Stage I-IIA, 3 patients; Stage IIB-IV disease, 9 patients). The median number of previous therapies was 7 (range, 3-12). Etanercept induced partial remission in one patient (8%) and minor response in one patient (8%), both of whom had Stage IB disease. Most patients experienced no side effects.

Recent research has established that the disease can originate in utero, and thus maternal diet may be an important risk factor for ALL. METHODS: The Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study is a population-based case-control study of risk factors for childhood leukemia, including maternal diet. Cases (n = 138) and controls (n = 138) were matched on sex, date of birth, mother's race, Hispanicity, and county of residence at birth. Maternal dietary intake in the 12 months prior to pregnancy was obtained by a 76-item food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: Consumption of the vegetables (OR = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.33-0.85; p = 0.008), protein sources (OR = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.18-0.90, p = 0.03), and fruits (OR = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.49-1.04; p = 0.08) food groups were inversely associated with ALL. Among nutrients, consumption of provitamin A carotenoids (OR = 0.65, 95% CI, 0.42-1.01; p = 0.05), and the antioxidant glutathione (OR = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.16-1.10; p = 0.08) were inversely associated with ALL. CONCLUSION: Maternal dietary factors, specifically the consumption of vegetables, fruits, protein sources and related nutrients, may play a role in the etiology of ALL.

The early phase of N-MLV infection is blocked in the cells of several mammalian species, including humans. This block is mediated by a dominant host factor that targets the viral capsid soon after virus entry into the cell has been achieved. A similar block to HIV-1 in rhesus monkey cells is mediated by TRIM5alpha. Here we show that human TRIM5alpha is both necessary and sufficient for the restriction of N-MLV in human cells. Rhesus monkey TRIM5alpha, which potently blocks HIV-1 infection, exhibited only modest inhibition of N-MLV infection. B-MLV was resistant to the antiviral effects of both human and rhesus monkey TRIM5alpha; susceptibility to TRIM5alpha-mediated restriction was conferred by alteration of residue 110 of the B-MLV capsid protein to the amino acid found in the N-MLV capsid. Our results demonstrate that species-specific variation in TRIM5alpha governs its ability to block infection by diverse retroviruses.","['Perron, Michel J', 'Stremlau, Matthew', 'Song, Byeongwoon', 'Ulm, Wes', 'Mulligan, Richard C', 'Sodroski, Joseph']","['Perron MJ', 'Stremlau M', 'Song B', 'Ulm W', 'Mulligan RC', 'Sodroski J']","['Department of Cancer Immunology and AIDS, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Division of AIDS, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antiviral Restriction Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Cyclophilin A)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Restriction Factors', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclophilin A/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HIV/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infection Control', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/drug effects/*physiology', 'Retroviridae/drug effects/physiology', 'Species Specificity', 'Transfection', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2004/07/29 05:00,2004/09/30 05:00,['2004/07/29 05:00'],"['2004/07/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/29 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Aug 10;101(32):11827-32. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0403364101.

Here, we report that classic AIDS developed after an 18-year incubation in an SM (E041) with a natural SIVsm infection. Unlike that described in previous reports of SIV-related disease in SMs, the SIVsm infecting E041 was not first passaged through macaques; moreover, SM E041 was simian T-cell leukemia virus antibody negative. SM E041 was euthanized in 2002 after being diagnosed with severe disseminated B-cell lymphoma. The plasma virus load had been approximately the same for 16 years when a 100-fold increase in virus load occurred in years 17 and 18. Additional findings associated with AIDS were CD4(+)-cell decline, loss of p27 core antibody, and loss of control of SIVsm replication with disseminated giant cell disease. These findings suggest that the time to development of AIDS exceeds the average lifetime of SMs in the wild and that the principal adaptation of SIV to its natural African hosts does not include complete resistance to disease. Instead, AIDS may develop slowly, even in the presence of high virus loads. However, a long-term relatively high virus load, such as that in SM E041, is consistent with AIDS development in less than 18 years in humans and macaques. Therefore, the results also suggest that SMs have a special mechanism for resisting AIDS development.","['Ling, Binhua', 'Apetrei, Cristian', 'Pandrea, Ivona', 'Veazey, Ronald S', 'Lackner, Andrew A', 'Gormus, Bobby', 'Marx, Preston A']","['Ling B', 'Apetrei C', 'Pandrea I', 'Veazey RS', 'Lackner AA', 'Gormus B', 'Marx PA']","['Tulane National Primate Research Center, 18703 Three Rivers Rd., Covington, LA 70433, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Cercocebus atys/*virology', 'Disease Progression', 'Giant Cells/physiology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/physiopathology/virology', 'Male', 'Monkey Diseases/immunology/*physiopathology/virology', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Viral/blood', 'Simian Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology/*physiopathology/virology', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/classification/genetics/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Viral Load']",2004/07/29 05:00,2004/09/04 05:00,['2004/07/29 05:00'],"['2004/07/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/29 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Aug;78(16):8902-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.78.16.8902-8908.2004.,"['10.1128/JVI.78.16.8902-8908.2004 [doi]', '78/16/8902 [pii]']",,"['P51 RR000164/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI044596/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI44596/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC479084,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The H residue of this motif is most critical, with all substitutions we tested being inactive. Interestingly, porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) of all three host-range groups, A, B, and C, lack full PHQ motifs, but most members have an H residue at position 10. H10A PERV mutants are noninfectious but were efficiently transactivated by adding to the assays a PHQ-containing SU or receptor-binding subdomain (RBD) derived from a gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV). A requirement of this transactivation was a functional GALV receptor on the cells. In contrast to this heterologous transactivation, PERV RBDs and SUs were inactive in all tested cells, including porcine ST-IOWA cells. Surprisingly, transactivation by GALV RBD enabled wild-type or H10A mutant PERVs of all three host-range groups to efficiently infect cells from humans and rodents that lack functional PERV receptors and it substantially enhanced infectivities of wild-type PERVs, even for cells with PERV receptors. Thus, PERVs can suboptimally infect cells that contain cognate receptors or they can employ a transactivation pathway to more efficiently infect all cells. This ability to infect cells lacking cognate receptors was previously demonstrated only for nontransmissible variant gammaretroviruses with recombinant and mutant envelope glycoproteins. We conclude that some endogenously inherited mammalian retroviruses also have a receptor-independent means for overcoming host-range and interference barriers, implying a need for caution in xenotransplantation, especially of porcine tissues.","['Lavillette, Dimitri', 'Kabat, David']","['Lavillette D', 'Kabat D']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Oregon Health & Science University, 3181 S.W.

We administered IL-15 to recipients of an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo BMT) to determine its effects on immune reconstitution. Posttransplantation IL-15 administration significantly increased donor-derived CD8+ T (mostly CD122(+)CD44(+)CD8+ T-cells), NK, and NK T-cells at day +28 in young and old recipients of allo BMT. This was associated with enhanced T-cell and NK-cell function. IL-15 stimulated homeostatic proliferation of donor CD8+ T-cells in recipients of carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester-labeled donor T-cell infusions. Posttransplantation IL-15 administration also resulted in a decrease in apoptotic CD8+ T-cells, an increase in Bcl-2-expressing CD8+ T-cells, and an increase in the fraction of Ki67+ proliferative NK and CD8+ T-cells in recipients of allo BMT. IL-15 did not exacerbate graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in recipients of T-cell-depleted BMT but could aggravate GVHD in some cases in recipients of a T-cell-repleted BMT. Finally, we found that IL-15 administration could enhance graft-versus-leukemia activity. In conclusion, IL-15 can be administered safely to recipients of a T-cell-depleted allo BMT to enhance CD8+ T, NK, and NK T-cell reconstitution.","['Alpdogan, Onder', 'Eng, Jeffrey M', 'Muriglan, Stephanie J', 'Willis, Lucy M', 'Hubbard, Vanessa M', 'Tjoe, Kartono H', 'Terwey, Theis H', 'Kochman, Adam', 'van den Brink, Marcel R M']","['Alpdogan O', 'Eng JM', 'Muriglan SJ', 'Willis LM', 'Hubbard VM', 'Tjoe KH', 'Terwey TH', 'Kochman A', 'van den Brink MR']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/metabolism', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Interleukin-15/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Recovery of Function/drug effects/*immunology', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2004/07/29 05:00,2005/02/16 09:00,['2004/07/29 05:00'],"['2004/07/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/29 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jan 15;105(2):865-73. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-09-3344.

A long-term follow-up study was conducted in a cohort of donor and recipient pairs with moderate-to-severe allergic disease in the donor prior to BMT. Assessments of allergen-specific IgE, clinical rhinitis, and asthma were made in the donors prior to BMT and in the recipients with a mean follow-up of 15.5 years after BMT. From an initial cohort of 12 bone marrow transplant recipients who received marrow from allergic donors, 5 long-term survivors were identified. Allergen-specific IgE transferred from donor to recipient following BMT frequently persisted, and a high rate of de novo allergic sensitization was observed between 1 and 14 years after BMT. These events were associated with elevation in total IgE, and development of allergic rhinitis and asthma at long-term follow-up.

Central to solving this problem is the issue of how to extract the most relevant genes from the several thousand genes on a typical microarray. Here, we propose a methodology that can effectively select an informative subset of genes and classify the subtypes (or patients) of disease using the selected genes. We employ a kernel machine, kernel Fisher discriminant analysis (KFDA), for discrimination and use the derivatives of the kernel function to perform gene selection. Using a modified form of KFDA in the minimum squared error (MSE) sense and the gradients of the kernel functions, we construct an effective gene selection criterion. We assess the performance of the proposed methodology by applying it to three gene expression datasets: leukemia dataset, breast cancer dataset and colon cancer dataset. Using a few informative genes, the proposed method accurately and reliably classified cancer subtypes (or patients).

Malignant trichogenic adnexal tumours are extremely rare neoplasms. METHODS AND RESULTS: The patients were between 55 years and 79 years of age. Three of the tumours were located on the arms, two on the face. Three of our patients had a history of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, one patient had a history of colonic adenocarcinoma. The duration of the tumour nodules was reported as between 20 and 40 years before sudden changes occurred. These changes included rapid growth, pain, itching, ulceration and bleeding. Histologically, all tumours were well circumscribed and encapsulated. There was a residual benign tumour component and morphological signs such as bone formation, dystrophic calcification and sclerosis suggesting long duration of the lesions. All patients except for one, who refused further clinical investigation due to her advanced age of 79 years, had an underlying systemic malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: The growth stimulus in these benign adnexal neoplasms resulting in malignant transformation may be attributed to the acquisition of additional genetic events or to immunosuppression due to an underlying neoplastic disease. Therefore, patients with systemic diseases or malignancy should be carefully examined and followed for sudden changes in pre-existing benign cutaneous tumours.","['Liegl, B', 'Leibl, S', 'Okcu, M', 'Beham-Schmid, C', 'Regauer, S']","['Liegl B', 'Leibl S', 'Okcu M', 'Beham-Schmid C', 'Regauer S']","['Institute of Pathology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,,IM,"['Aged', 'Carcinoma/chemistry/pathology/therapy', 'Carcinosarcoma/chemistry/pathology/therapy', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Female', 'Hair Diseases/pathology', 'Hair Follicle/cytology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melanocytes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Adnexal and Skin Appendage/*pathology/therapy', 'Pilomatrixoma/chemistry/pathology/therapy', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology/therapy']",2004/07/29 05:00,2005/01/26 09:00,['2004/07/29 05:00'],"['2004/07/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/29 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Histopathology. 2004 Aug;45(2):162-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.2004.01918.x.,"['10.1111/j.1365-2559.2004.01918.x [doi]', 'HIS1918 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, in clinical trials, imatinib has produced high response rates in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase and blastic crisis. However, episodes of severe cytopenia were also frequently observed, leading to discontinuation of therapy in some cases. Therefore, it is important to examine whether administration of cytokines overcomes the adverse effects of imatinib in in vitro systems. In this study, we examine the effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and erythropoietin (EPO) on TF-1/bcr-abl (which was generated by transduction of a bcr-abl fusion gene into the TF-1 cell line) as a model system for CML with blastic crisis. Imatinib induced apoptosis in TF-1/bcr-abl cells but not in the parental TF-1 cells. However, GM-CSF, a survival factor of the parental TF-1 cells, protected TF-1/bcr-abl cells from imatinib-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Concomitantly, constitutive phosphorylation of Stat5 and FKHRL1 was significantly inhibited by imatinib, and the inhibition was canceled by the addition of GM-CSF, accompanied by upregulation of Bcl-xL and downregulation of p27/Kip1. In addition, although untreated TF-1/bcr-abl cells had lost responsiveness to both GM-CSF and EPO and showed autonomous growth, GM-CSF enhanced phosphorylation of Stat5 and FKHRL1 in these cells. Importantly, imatinib-treated TF-1/bcr-abl cells differentiated into hemoglobin-positive cells in the presence of EPO, as in the case for the parental TF-1 cells. Taken together, imatinib-treated CML cells may differentiate into mature cells in the presence of differentiation-inducing cytokines such as EPO.","['Uchida, Mie', 'Watanabe, Tomoko', 'Kunitama, Masae', 'Mori, Masaki', 'Kikuchi, Satoru', 'Yoshida, Kozue', 'Kirito, Keita', 'Nagai, Tadashi', 'Ozawa, Keiya', 'Komatsu, Norio']","['Uchida M', 'Watanabe T', 'Kunitama M', 'Mori M', 'Kikuchi S', 'Yoshida K', 'Kirito K', 'Nagai T', 'Ozawa K', 'Komatsu N']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Minamikawachi-machi, Kawachi-gun, Tochigi-ken 329-0498, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PDCD5 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2004/07/28 05:00,2005/03/08 09:00,['2004/07/28 05:00'],"['2004/07/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2004;22(4):609-16. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.22-4-609.,"['22/4/609 [pii]', '10.1634/stemcells.22-4-609 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that STAT3 activation is not sufficient to block hES cell differentiation when the cells are grown on mouse feeder cells or when they are treated with conditioned media from feeder cells. Human ES cells differentiate in the presence of members of the IL-6 family of cytokines including leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and IL-6 or in the presence of the designer cytokine hyper-IL-6, which is a complex of soluble interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) and IL-6 with greatly enhanced bioactivity. Human ES cells express LIF, IL-6, and gp130 receptors, as well as the downstream signaling molecules. Stimulation of human and mouse ES cells with gp130 cytokines resulted in a robust phosphorylation of downstream ERK1, ERK2, and Akt kinases, as well as the STAT3 transcription factor. Loss of the pluripotency markers Nanog, Oct-4, and TRA-1-60 was observed in hES cells during gp130-dependent signaling, indicating that signaling through this pathway is insufficient to prevent the onset of differentiation. These data underscore a fundamental difference in requirements of murine versus hES cells. Furthermore, the data demonstrate the existence of an as-yet-unidentified factor in the conditioned media of mouse feeder layer cells that acts to maintain hES cell renewal in a STAT3-independent manner.","['Humphrey, Rohan K', 'Beattie, Gillian M', 'Lopez, Ana D', 'Bucay, Nathan', 'King, Charles C', 'Firpo, Meri T', 'Rose-John, Stefan', 'Hayek, Alberto']","['Humphrey RK', 'Beattie GM', 'Lopez AD', 'Bucay N', 'King CC', 'Firpo MT', 'Rose-John S', 'Hayek A']","['The Islet Research Laboratory, Whittier Institute for Diabetes, Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, 9894 Genesee Ave, University of California San Diego, La Jolla 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Mice', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Species Specificity', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology']",2004/07/28 05:00,2005/03/08 09:00,['2004/07/28 05:00'],"['2004/07/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2004;22(4):522-30. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.22-4-522.,"['22/4/522 [pii]', '10.1634/stemcells.22-4-522 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several reports have suggested an association between GO administration and hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), which has recently been termed sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS). However, the majority of these studies were done in patients who had undergone high-dose therapy with stem cell transplantation or when GO was administered in combination with other cytotoxic chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all patients treated at our institution with single-agent GO, either as initial therapy or in the relapsed and refractory setting. All patients were planned to receive GO 9 mg/m2 in two doses, 14 days apart. We reviewed liver function tests before and after administration and analyzed hepatic injuries in the context of patients' other comorbid conditions. Patients were classified as experiencing liver toxicity if their liver function(s) abnormality lasted for > 7 days, as documented by repeated serum studies. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were analyzed. Response rate (27.2%) and median duration of response (6 months) were comparable to other reports. All patients were assessable for liver toxicity, of which 23 (48%) had elevation of at least one of their liver function tests (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase). Elevations in liver function test(s) were noted at a median of 14 days (range 7-175 days). Eight patients had other comorbid conditions that could explain their liver abnormality, making the incidence of direct GO-induced liver injury 31%. However, only one patient had radiographic and clinical evidence suggesting SOSVOD. CONCLUSIONS: When administered using the recommended dose and schedule, GO has little association with VODSOS if given as a single agent. In this retrospective review, the incidence of GO-related SOSVOD is as low as 2%.","['Nabhan, C', 'Rundhaugen, L', 'Jatoi, M', 'Riley, M B', 'Boehlke, L', 'Peterson, L C', 'Tallman, M S']","['Nabhan C', 'Rundhaugen L', 'Jatoi M', 'Riley MB', 'Boehlke L', 'Peterson LC', 'Tallman MS']","['Oncology Specialists, S.C., Lutheran General Hospital Cancer Care Center, Park Ridge, IL, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aminoglycosides/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Retrospective Studies']",2004/07/28 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/07/28 05:00'],"['2004/07/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2004 Aug;15(8):1231-6. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdh324.,"['10.1093/annonc/mdh324 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(20)31060-7 [pii]']",,,,,,['Copyright 2004 European Society for Medical Oncology'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, most tissues will require a microvascular network to supply oxygen and nutrients. One strategy for creating a microvascular network would be promotion of vasculogenesis in situ by seeding vascular progenitor cells within the biopolymeric construct. To pursue this strategy, we isolated CD34(+)/CD133(+) endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) from human umbilical cord blood and expanded the cells ex vivo as EPC-derived endothelial cells (EC). The EPC lost expression of the stem cell marker CD133 but continued to express the endothelial markers KDR/VEGF-R2, VE-cadherin, CD31, von Willebrand factor, and E-selectin. The cells were also shown to mediate calcium-dependent adhesion of HL-60 cells, a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, providing evidence for a proinflammatory endothelial phenotype. The EPC-derived EC maintained this endothelial phenotype when expanded in roller bottles and subsequently seeded on polyglycolic acid-poly-l-lactic acid (PGA-PLLA) scaffolds, but microvessel formation was not observed. In contrast, EPC-derived EC seeded with human smooth muscle cells formed capillary-like structures throughout the scaffold (76.5 +/- 35 microvessels/mm(2)). These results indicate that 1) EPC-derived EC can be expanded in vitro and seeded on biodegradable scaffolds with preservation of endothelial phenotype and 2) EPC-derived EC seeded with human smooth muscle cells form microvessels on porous PGA-PLLA scaffolds. These properties indicate that EPC may be well suited for creating microvascular networks within tissue-engineered constructs.","['Wu, Xiao', 'Rabkin-Aikawa, Elena', 'Guleserian, Kristine J', 'Perry, Tjorvi E', 'Masuda, Yutaka', 'Sutherland, Fraser W H', 'Schoen, Frederick J', 'Mayer, John E Jr', 'Bischoff, Joyce']","['Wu X', 'Rabkin-Aikawa E', 'Guleserian KJ', 'Perry TE', 'Masuda Y', 'Sutherland FW', 'Schoen FJ', 'Mayer JE Jr', 'Bischoff J']","[""Department of Surgery, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,American journal of physiology.

However, the elimination or control of ALVE gene expression is desirable to improve productivity, to improve resistance to avian leukosis virus (ALV)-induced tumours, and to develop safer live virus vaccines in chick embryos and cultured chick cells. Restriction fragment length polymorphism and polymerase chain reaction methods are used to define the presence of ALVE genes; and the expression of ALVE in chicken plasma or on cells, and the susceptibility of cells to ALVE is determined by flow cytometry using a specific (R2) antibody. ADOL line 0 chickens have been selected to be free of ALVE genes, while being resistant (i.e. lack receptors to ALVE), but susceptible to exogenous ALV (i.e. ALVA, ALVB, ALVC and ALVJ). To develop improved line 0-type chickens, ADOL line 0 was outcrossed to a commercial line that had one ALVE gene and evidence for ALVE resistance. Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) challenge was used to confirm resistance of F1 chickens to ALVE, and susceptibility of F2 breeders to ALVA and ALVB using test chicks produced by matings to line 7(2). Selected F2 breeders were resistant to ALVE, but susceptible to exogenous ALVA, ALVB, ALVC and ALVJ, based on challenge tests of progeny chick cells using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The new line, 0(1), has evidence for improved egg size, productivity, fertility and hatchability. Similar procedures may be used for development of productive ALVE free chicken lines with preferred ALV susceptibility traits.","['Bacon, L D', 'Fulton, J E', 'Kulkarni, G B']","['Bacon LD', 'Fulton JE', 'Kulkarni GB']","['US Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service, Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory, East Lansing, MI 48823, USA. baconld@msu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Avian Pathol,Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,8210638,,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/genetics/*prevention & control/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/classification/*genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Chickens/genetics/*virology', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Eggs', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms']",2004/07/28 05:00,2006/07/11 09:00,['2004/07/28 05:00'],"['2004/07/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Avian Pathol. 2004 Apr;33(2):233-43. doi: 10.1080/0307943042000195731.,"['10.1080/0307943042000195731 [doi]', 'TAFMK5G3JU4RG72G [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So far, there is no proven therapy for this disease. The compound 2-benzoyl-3-phenyl-6,7-dichloro quinoxaline 1,4-dioxide (DCQ) has been shown to exhibit a wide range of antibacterial activities and to induce antiproliferation and apoptosis of human colon cancer cell lines. In the present study, we investigated the in vitro effects of DCQ in HTLV-1 positive (C91-PL and HuT-102) and negative (CEM and Jurkat) malignant T-cells. The results indicate that DCQ induced growth inhibition in all four cell lines examined in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect was mainly due to the induction of apoptosis which was verified by flow cytometry analyses and ELISA-based apoptosis assays. The role of transforming growth factor (TGF) in mediating the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of DCQ in ATL cells was investigated. Interestingly, in three of the four cell lines used, DCQ increased the TGF-beta1 transcript levels and decreased TGF-alpha mRNA, but did not induce changes in TGF-beta2 expression. DCQ treatment also induced an upregulation of p53 and p21 protein levels, key mediators of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2alpha protein level was found to be reduced. These findings indicate that DCQ inhibits the growth of ATL cell lines, at least in part, by inducing apoptosis mediated by the modulation of TGF expression, the upregulation in p53 and p21 proteins and downregulation in Bcl-2alpha expression. The present findings suggest that DCQ merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic agent for this incurable disease.","['Harakeh, Steve', 'Diab-Assef, Mona', 'El-Sabban, Marwan', 'Haddadin, Makhluf', 'Gali-Muhtasib, Hala']","['Harakeh S', 'Diab-Assef M', 'El-Sabban M', 'Haddadin M', 'Gali-Muhtasib H']","['Biology Department, American University of Beirut, Lebanon. sh09@aub.edu.lb']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (2-benzoyl-3-phenyl-6,7-dichloroquinoxaline-1,4-dioxide)', '0 (Quinoxalines)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Quinoxalines/*pharmacology']",2004/07/28 05:00,2004/09/25 05:00,['2004/07/28 05:00'],"['2003/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/07 00:00 [revised]', '2004/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2004 Jul 20;148(3):101-13. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2004.05.002.,"['10.1016/j.cbi.2004.05.002 [doi]', 'S0009279704000493 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Chem Biol Interact. 2018 Jan 5;279:243.

However, specific role of Dbl-GEFs in developmental processes, particularly cell differentiation, remains largely unexplored. Recently, a novel member of the Dbl family, leukemia-associated Rho GEF factor (LARG), has been reported to be a fusion partner with mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) protein in the acute myeloid leukemia, suggesting potential involvement of LARG in regulation of hematopoiesis. In this study, we describe the isolation of the cDNA copy and analysis of genomic structure and expression profile of the mouse orthologue of the human LARG gene. The mouse LARG (mLARG) gene contains 42 exons. The mLARG cDNA is 10,040 bp long and contains a 4631-bp open reading frame (ORF). The predicted mLARG protein shares an overall 89% identity with its human counterpart and contains the same functional domains, namely, Dbl homology (DH), pleckstrin homology (PH), PSD-95, Dlg and ZO-1/2 (PDZ) and regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domains, as well as two putative signals of nuclear localization. The mLARG message is expressed in all tissues studied, with comparably higher expression levels observed in brain, lung, testis, liver and heart. Using amplified cDNA samples from sorted hematopoietic cells, we showed that mLARG is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cell fractions, as well as in immature erythroid cells. These results demonstrate high similarity between mouse and human LARG proteins and genes and provide further support to the hypothesis of the potential involvement of LARG in regulation of early stages of hematopoiesis.","['Zinovyeva, Marina', 'Sveshnikova, Elena', 'Visser, Jan', 'Belyavsky, Alexander']","['Zinovyeva M', 'Sveshnikova E', 'Visser J', 'Belyavsky A']","['Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (Arhgef12 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/chemistry/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes/genetics', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",2004/07/28 05:00,2004/10/19 09:00,['2004/07/28 05:00'],"['2004/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2004/04/02 00:00 [revised]', '2004/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gene. 2004 Aug 4;337:181-8. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2004.05.004.,"['10.1016/j.gene.2004.05.004 [doi]', 'S0378111904002719 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AF467766'],,,,,,

Deficiency of dCK is associated with resistance against this compound both in vitro in cancer cell lines and in clinical practice in acute myeloid leukemia and solid tumors. The human ovarian cancer cell line AG6000 is 100,000-fold resistant against dFdC compared to its parent cell line A2780. This cell line proved to be dCK deficient in enzyme activity assays and by Western blot analysis, but by RT-PCR, a normal and a truncated dCK mRNA was found. Sequencing revealed that exon 3 was deleted from the dCK cDNA, resulting in a 74-aa-long open-reading frame due to the generation of a premature stop codon. No gross genomic alteration was observed at the dCK locus, suggesting the involvement of post-transcription mechanisms. Transient transfection experiments indicated that the truncated dCK transcripts are not translated to protein. To study the functional role of the truncated dCK transcripts, both A2780 cells and AG6000 cells were stably transfected with human and rat dCK.

The aim of this study is to describe implications of LIF on a physiological function of endometrium. METHOD OF STUDY: The role of LIF in the endometrial function is reviewed and summarized from the available literature. RESULTS: LIF plays an important role in a physiological function of endometrium. In human endometrial LIF expression depends on cellular localizations, steroid hormones, menstrual stages and a local cytokine network. Stronger LIF expression exists in an endometrial epithelium during a luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, which coincides with the time of an implantation. The impairments of the endometrial LIF expression may play a significant role in the pathological processes involving implantation and the infertility. CONCLUSIONS: There is a substantial evidence that LIF is a potential regulator of the endometrial function and might be one of the factors that play a key role in human reproduction.","['Kondera-Anasz, Zdzislawa', 'Sikora, Justyna', 'Mielczarek-Palacz, Aleksandra']","['Kondera-Anasz Z', 'Sikora J', 'Mielczarek-Palacz A']","['Department of Immunology and Serology, Silesian Medical Academy in Katowice, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Denmark,Am J Reprod Immunol,"American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y. : 1989)",8912860,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Gonadal Steroid Hormones)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Endometrium/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Menstrual Cycle/metabolism']",2004/07/28 05:00,2005/02/11 09:00,['2004/07/28 05:00'],"['2004/07/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Reprod Immunol. 2004 Aug;52(2):97-105. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0897.2004.00204.x.,"['10.1111/j.1600-0897.2004.00204.x [doi]', 'AJI204 [pii]']",,,98,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, we studied its cytotoxic effect on HL-60 leukemia cells and the underlying mechanisms. We first investigated the effects of HMJ-38 on viability, cell cycle and induction of apoptosis in HL-60 and normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). After 24-hour treatment with HMJ-38, a dose- and time-dependent decrease in the viability of HL-60 cells was observed and the approximate IC50 was 4.48 microM. The cytotoxic effect of HMJ-38 on PBMC was less significant than that on HL-60 cells, either with 24 or 48 hours of treatment. Cell cycle analysis showed that HMJ-38 induced significant G2/M arrest and apoptosis in HL-60 cells. The HMJ-38-induced G2/M arrest occurred before the onset of apoptosis. Within 24 hours of treatment, HMJ-38 influenced the CDK/cyclin B activity by increasing Chk1, Wee1 and p21 and decreasing Cdc25C protein levels. The HMJ-38-induced apoptosis was further confirmed by morphological assessment and DNA fragmentation assay. Induction of apoptosis in HMJ-38-treated HL-60 cells was accompanied by an apparent increase of cytosolic cytochrome c, down-regulation of Bcl-2, up-regulation of Bax and cleavage of pro-caspase-9, -3 and poly(ADP)ribosylpolymerase (PARP). The results of the significant reduction of caspase activities and apoptosis by caspase inhibitors indicated that the HMJ-38-induced apoptosis was mainly mediated by activation of caspases-9 and -3. HMJ-38 also activated ERK in HL-60 cells. Pre-incubating cells with ERK inhibitors (U0126 and PD98059) attenuated the HMJ-38-induced ERK activation and apoptosis. Nevertheless, cells remained arrested in G2/M. These results suggest that HMJ-38 is a potent anticancer drug and it shows a remarkable action on cell cycle before commitment for apoptosis is reached.","['Yang, Jai-Sing', 'Hour, Mann-Jen', 'Kuo, Sheng-Chu', 'Huang, Li-Jiau', 'Lee, Miau-Rong']","['Yang JS', 'Hour MJ', 'Kuo SC', 'Huang LJ', 'Lee MR']","['Graduate Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, School of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan 404, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"[""0 (2-(3'-methoxyphenyl)-6-pyrrolidinyl-4-quinazolinone)"", '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Pyrrolidines/*pharmacology', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'Quinazolinones', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2004/07/28 05:00,2004/09/11 05:00,['2004/07/28 05:00'],"['2004/07/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/11 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/28 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2004 May-Jun;24(3a):1769-78.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of this PDPK in a lethal carcinoma, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, remains to be established. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The stable antisense clones with specific suppression of overexpressed PDPK F(A) of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells (MIA PaCa-2) were first selected and subsequently characterized for the in vitro and in vivo growth studies. RESULTS: The molecular and cellular studies revealed that the antisense clones of MIA PaCa-2 cells with specific suppression of overexpressed PDPK F(A) potentially exhibited cell growth retardation, decreased serum independence, poor clonogenic growth and loss of anchorage-independent growth. The in vivo study further confirmed that the SCID mice injected with the antisense clones with low-level PDPK F(A) did not develop any detectable tumors even after 7-week observation. In sharp contrast, the parental or control-transfected clones developed very large tumors (>5 cm3) under identical conditions.

Mutations of Ptpn11 (also known as Shp2), which encodes the protein-tyrosine phosphatase Shp2, occur in approximately 50% of individuals with Noonan syndrome, but their molecular, cellular and developmental effects, and the relationship between Noonan syndrome and leukemia, are unclear. We generated mice expressing the Noonan syndrome-associated mutant D61G. When homozygous, the D61G mutant is embryonic lethal, whereas heterozygotes have decreased viability. Surviving Ptpn11(D61G/+) embryos ( approximately 50%) have short stature, craniofacial abnormalities similar to those in Noonan syndrome, and myeloproliferative disease. Severely affected Ptpn11(D61G/+) embryos ( approximately 50%) have multiple cardiac defects similar to those in mice lacking the Ras-GAP protein neurofibromin. Their endocardial cushions have increased Erk activation, but Erk hyperactivation is cell and pathway specific. Our results clarify the relationship between Noonan syndrome and leukemia and show that a single Ptpn11 gain-of-function mutation evokes all major features of Noonan syndrome by acting on multiple developmental lineages in a gene dosage-dependent and pathway-selective manner.","['Araki, Toshiyuki', 'Mohi, M Golam', 'Ismat, Fraz A', 'Bronson, Roderick T', 'Williams, Ifor R', 'Kutok, Jeffery L', 'Yang, Wentian', 'Pao, Lily I', 'Gilliland, D Gary', 'Epstein, Jonathan A', 'Neel, Benjamin G']","['Araki T', 'Mohi MG', 'Ismat FA', 'Bronson RT', 'Williams IR', 'Kutok JL', 'Yang W', 'Pao LI', 'Gilliland DG', 'Epstein JA', 'Neel BG']","['Cancer Biology Program, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, NRB1038, 330 Brookline Ave., Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA. taraki@bidmc.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Endocardial Cushion Defects/genetics/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Dosage', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Heart Defects, Congenital/genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Noonan Syndrome/*genetics', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*genetics/metabolism']",2004/07/27 05:00,2004/10/05 09:00,['2004/07/27 05:00'],"['2004/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/27 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2004 Aug;10(8):849-57. doi: 10.1038/nm1084.

In the present work, we show that pretreatment with TNFalpha sensitized the cells to apoptosis induced by antineoplastic agents and ceramide. TNFalpha pretreatment resulted in enhanced cleavage and activity of caspase-3 upon addition of etoposide, epirubicin or ceramide. No caspase-8 activation was detectable, although caspase-8 could be activated in cell-free extracts. Inhibition of caspase-8 by z-IETD-fmk did not block the sensitizing effect of TNFalpha. Furthermore, exogenous ceramide, a mediator of TNFalpha signaling, could not substitute for TNFalpha in sensitization to drug-induced apoptosis. In contrast, we observed mitochondrial changes following cotreatment of cells with TNFalpha and drugs. Mitochondrial permeability transition, cytochrome c release and subsequent processing of caspase-9 preceded the onset of apoptosis, and were enhanced by TNFalpha pretreatment. Interestingly, although transcription factor NF-kappaB protected HD-MyZ cells from drug-induced apoptosis, TNFalpha-mediated sensitization was independent of NF-kappaB, since overexpressing a dominant-negative IkappaB mutant did not alter the TNFalpha effect. Sensitization for drug-induced apoptosis by TNFalpha was abrogated by Bcl-x(L). Thus, the sensitizing effect of TNFalpha is mediated by the mitochondrial pathway and involves processing of caspase-2, -3 and -9, but appears to be independent of caspase-8 processing, Bid cleavage and NF-kappaB signaling. Therefore, sensitization by TNFalpha is mediated at least in part through different pathways, as reported for TRAIL. There, sensitization occurs through a FADD/caspase-8-dependent mechanism. Regarding TNFalpha, the sensitizing effect was also observed in myeloid leukemia cells. Therefore, TNFalpha or alternate molecules activating its pathways might be useful as sensitizers for chemotherapy in hematological malignancies.","['Schmelz, Karin', 'Wieder, Thomas', 'Tamm, Ingo', 'Muller, Antje', 'Essmann, Frank', 'Geilen, Christoph-C', 'Schulze-Osthoff, Klaus', 'Dorken, Bernd', 'Daniel, Peter-T']","['Schmelz K', 'Wieder T', 'Tamm I', 'Muller A', 'Essmann F', 'Geilen CC', 'Schulze-Osthoff K', 'Dorken B', 'Daniel PT']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, University Medical Center Charite-Campus CBB, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Ceramides/toxicity', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Epirubicin/toxicity', 'Etoposide/toxicity', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects/physiology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/physiology', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/metabolism', 'Sphingomyelins/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein']",2004/07/27 05:00,2004/10/30 09:00,['2004/07/27 05:00'],"['2004/07/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/30 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/27 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Sep 2;23(40):6743-59. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207848.,"['10.1038/sj.onc.1207848 [doi]', '1207848 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CHST11 belongs to the HNK1 family of Golgi-associated sulfotransferases, a group of glycosaminoglycan-modifying enzymes, and is expressed mainly in the hematopoietic lineage. Northern Blot analysis of tumor RNA using CHST11-specific probes showed expression of two CHST11 forms of abnormal size. 5'- and 3'-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) revealed IGH/CHST11 as well as CHST11/IGH fusion RNAs expressed from the der(14) and der(12) chromosomes.

Although doxorubicin is toxic to both cancer and cardiac cells, there are evidences suggesting that the mechanism of cell death is different for the two cell types. To investigate further this issue, we have compared the proapoptotic effects of doxorubicin and the functionally related anthracenedione compound mitoxantrone, which is also used in the clinic for the treatment of cancer. After evaluating the toxicity of the two drugs to mammary adenocarcinoma MTLn3 cells and H9C2 cardiomyocytes, we dissected the drug-induced apoptotic machinery by measuring the effects on the cell cycle progression, DNA condensation and fragmentation, production of endogenous peroxides and caspase activation. Both doxorubicin and mitoxantrone are potent inducers of apoptosis in H9C2 cardiomyocytes and MTLn3 breast cancer cells, but there are significant differences between the two cell types in terms of kinetics and order of the events. In particular, flow cytometry measurements of drug-induced changes in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and mitochondrial mass with different fluorescent probes suggested that the two drugs induced a progressive increase in mitochondrial mass in the cancer cells but not in the cardiac cells. The hypothesis was validated by means of electron microscopy, which revealed a significant increase in the number of mitochondria in drug-treated MTLn3 but not in H9C2 cells. The mitochondrial proliferation precedes the nuclear apoptosis in doxorubicin-treated MTLn3 cells. The changes in the architecture and number of mitochondria are linked to the drug-induced perturbation of the cell cycle progression and apoptosis. The proliferation of mitochondria could explain the higher toxicity of doxorubicin to cancer cells compared to cardiac cells and this suggests novel therapeutic opportunities to better control the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines.","['Kluza, Jerome', 'Marchetti, Philippe', 'Gallego, Miguel-Angel', 'Lancel, Steve', 'Fournier, Charles', 'Loyens, Anne', 'Beauvillain, Jean-Claude', 'Bailly, Christian']","['Kluza J', 'Marchetti P', 'Gallego MA', 'Lancel S', 'Fournier C', 'Loyens A', 'Beauvillain JC', 'Bailly C']","['INSERM U-524 and Laboratoire de Pharmacologie Antitumorale du Centre Oscar Lambret, IRCL, Place de Verdun, 59045 Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Female', 'Heart/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*pathology/*ultrastructure', 'Mitochondria, Heart/drug effects/*ultrastructure', 'Mitoxantrone/pharmacology']",2004/07/27 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/07/27 05:00'],"['2004/07/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/27 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Sep 16;23(42):7018-30. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207936.,"['10.1038/sj.onc.1207936 [doi]', '1207936 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We prospectively investigated the GvMC at different time points after allogeneic BMT and donor-lymphocyte infusions (DLI). Samples were gathered from a patient with MCL treated with allogeneic BMT from an unrelated HLA identical donor. Parameters for detection of a GvMC effect included flow cytometrical analysis of mast cell (MC) populations in peripheral blood and BM, BM smear and histology, chimerism analysis of flow cytometrically sorted BM CD117+/CD34- MC and testing for anti-mast cell reactivity of donor lymphocytes by interferon (IFN)-gamma ELISPOT. DLIs reduced MC from 5 to 0.5%. MC chimerism analysis demonstrated a complete recipient genotype after BMT, suggesting that the persistent mastocytosis was part of residual neoplastic disease. At 3.7 years after BMT, there is some evidence for relapse. In summary, BMT and DLIs attenuated the mastocytosis from an aggressive to an indolent form and may have improved the patients' prognosis.

The use of retroviral tagging as a means of identifying cancer-causing genes has, however, almost entirely been restricted to hematopoietic tumors. The aim of this study was to develop a system allowing for the retroviral tagging of candidate genes in malignant brain tumors. Mouse gliomas were induced by a recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus encoding platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain. The underlying idea was that tumors evolve through a combination of PDGF-mediated autocrine growth stimulation and insertional mutagenesis of genes that cooperate with PDGF in gliomagenesis. Common insertion sites (loci that were tagged in more than one tumor) were identified by cloning and sequencing retroviral flanking segments, followed by blast searches of mouse genome databases. A number of candidate brain tumor loci (Btls) were identified. Several of these Btls correspond to known tumor-causing genes; these findings strongly support the underlying idea of our experimental approach. Other Btls harbor genes with a hitherto unproven role in transformation or oncogenesis. Our findings indicate that retroviral tagging with a growth factor-encoding virus may be a powerful means of identifying candidate tumor-causing genes in nonhematopoietic tumors.","['Johansson, Fredrik K', 'Brodd, Josefin', 'Eklof, Charlotta', 'Ferletta, Maria', 'Hesselager, Goran', 'Tiger, Carl-Fredrik', 'Uhrbom, Lene', 'Westermark, Bengt']","['Johansson FK', 'Brodd J', 'Eklof C', 'Ferletta M', 'Hesselager G', 'Tiger CF', 'Uhrbom L', 'Westermark B']","['Department of Genetics and Pathology, The Rudbeck Laboratory, University Hospital, SE-751 85 Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Brain Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glioma/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction']",2004/07/27 05:00,2004/09/11 05:00,['2004/07/27 05:00'],"['2004/07/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/11 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/27 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Aug 3;101(31):11334-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0402716101.

In the current study, we demonstrate that PML negatively regulated the SAPK2/p38 signaling pathway by sequestering p38 from its upstream kinases, MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6, whereas PML did not affect the SAPK1/c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase pathway. PML associated with p38 both in vitro and in vivo and the carboxyl terminus of PML mediated the interaction. In contrast to other studies of PML and PML-nuclear bodies (NB), our study shows that the formation of PML-NBs was not required for PML to suppress p38 activity because PML was still able to bind and inhibit p38 activity under the conditions in which PML-NBs were disrupted. In addition, we show that the promotion of Fas-induced cell death by PML correlated with the extent of p38 inhibition by PML, suggesting that PML might regulate apoptosis through manipulating SAPK2/p38 pathways. Our findings define a novel function of PML as a negative regulator of p38 kinase and provide further understanding on the mechanism of how PML induces multiple pathways of apoptosis.","['Shin, Jinwook', 'Park, Boyoun', 'Cho, Sunglim', 'Lee, Sunray', 'Kim, Youngkyun', 'Lee, Seong-Ok', 'Cho, Kwangmin', 'Lee, Sungwook', 'Jin, Bong-Suk', 'Ahn, Jin-Hyun', 'Choi, Eui-Ju', 'Ahn, Kwangseog']","['Shin J', 'Park B', 'Cho S', 'Lee S', 'Kim Y', 'Lee SO', 'Cho K', 'Lee S', 'Jin BS', 'Ahn JH', 'Choi EJ', 'Ahn K']","['College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 6)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 3', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 6', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'fas Receptor/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2004/07/27 05:00,2004/10/27 09:00,['2004/07/27 05:00'],"['2004/07/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/27 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Sep 24;279(39):40994-1003. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M407369200.

In the present study, we characterized the precise binding element, which we named invMED1, and revealed the presence of the LRP130 protein as the nuclear factor. Its binding intensity increases with the endogenous MDR1 geneexpression and with the MDR level of CEM leukemia cells. Interestingly, the LRP130 level did not vary with the chemoresistance level. We observed the involvement of LRP130 in the transcriptional activity of the MDR1 gene promoter, and moreover, in that of the MDR-related, invMED1-containing, MVP gene promoter. We used siRNAs and transcriptional decoys in two unrelated human cancer cell lines to show the role of the invMED1/LRP130 couple in both MDR1 and MVP endogenous genes activities. We showed that invMED1 was localized in the -105/-100 and -148/-143 regions of the MDR1 and MVP gene promoters, respectively.

Their efficacy sequence in decreasing outward IMIC (Ni2+ = Mg2+ > Ca2+ > Ba2+) and in inducing inward IMIC (Ni2+ >> Mg2+ = Ca2+ approximately Ba2+), and their permeabilities calculated from reversal potentials are similar to those of TRPM6 and TRPM7 channels. The trivalent cations Gd3+ and Dy3+ also block IMIC in a voltage-dependent manner (delta = 0.4-0.5). In addition they inhibit the inward current carried by divalent cations. IMIC is regulated by pH. Decreasing or increasing extracellular pH decreased and increased IMIC, respectively (pH0.5 = 6.9, nH = 0.98). Qualitatively similar results were obtained on IMIC in rat basophilic leukaemia cells. These effects in cardiac myocytes were absent in the presence of high intracellular buffering by 40 mm Hepes. Our results suggest that IMIC in cardiac cells is due to TRPM channels, most probably to TRPM6 or TRPM7 channels or to their heteromultimeres.","['Gwanyanya, Asfree', 'Amuzescu, Bogdan', 'Zakharov, Sergey I', 'Macianskiene, Regina', 'Sipido, Karin R', 'Bolotina, Victoria M', 'Vereecke, Johan', 'Mubagwa, Kanigula']","['Gwanyanya A', 'Amuzescu B', 'Zakharov SI', 'Macianskiene R', 'Sipido KR', 'Bolotina VM', 'Vereecke J', 'Mubagwa K']","['Centre for Experimental Surgery & Anaesthesiology, Katholieke Universiteit, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Physiol,The Journal of physiology,0266262,"['0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (TRPM Cation Channels)', '0 (TRPM6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TRPM7 protein, human)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cations, Divalent/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Ion Channels/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Magnesium/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects/physiology', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*metabolism', 'Permeability/drug effects', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Rats', 'Swine', 'TRPM Cation Channels']",2004/07/24 05:00,2005/02/12 09:00,['2004/07/24 05:00'],"['2004/07/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/12 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/24 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Physiol. 2004 Sep 15;559(Pt 3):761-76. doi: 10.1113/jphysiol.2004.067637.

Although AML1 possesses several subdomains of defined biochemical functions, the physiologic relevance of each subdomain to hematopoietic development has been poorly understood. Recently, the consequence of carboxy-terminal truncation in AML1 was analyzed by the hematopoietic rescue assay of AML1-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells using the gene knock-in approach. Nonetheless, a role for specific internal domains, as well as for mutations found in a human disease, of AML1 remains to be elucidated. In this study, we established an experimental system to efficiently evaluate the hematopoietic potential of AML1 using a coculture system of the murine embryonic para-aortic splanchnopleural (P-Sp) region with a stromal cell line, OP9. In this system, the hematopoietic defect of AML1-deficient P-Sp can be rescued by expressing AML1 with retroviral infection. By analysis of AML1 mutants, we demonstrated that the hematopoietic potential of AML1 was closely related to its transcriptional activity. Furthermore, we showed that other Runx transcription factors, Runx2/AML3 or Runx3/AML2, could rescue the hematopoietic defect of AML1-deficient P-Sp. Thus, this experimental system will become a valuable tool to analyze the physiologic function and domain contribution of Runx proteins in hematopoiesis.","['Goyama, Susumu', 'Yamaguchi, Yuko', 'Imai, Yoichi', 'Kawazu, Masahito', 'Nakagawa, Masahiro', 'Asai, Takashi', 'Kumano, Keiki', 'Mitani, Kinuko', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Chiba, Shigeru', 'Kurokawa, Mineo', 'Hirai, Hisamaru']","['Goyama S', 'Yamaguchi Y', 'Imai Y', 'Kawazu M', 'Nakagawa M', 'Asai T', 'Kumano K', 'Mitani K', 'Ogawa S', 'Chiba S', 'Kurokawa M', 'Hirai H']","['Department of Hematology & Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Runx3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aorta', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Extraembryonic Membranes/*cytology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Splanchnic Circulation', 'Stromal Cells/cytology', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2004/07/24 05:00,2004/12/31 09:00,['2004/07/24 05:00'],"['2004/07/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/31 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/24 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Dec 1;104(12):3558-64. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-04-1535.

There are multiple targets with agents directed to them that may prove to be synergistic with imatinib. These approaches are attractive, particularly when dealing with imatinib resistant CML, to prevent resistance and improve the probability of cure.

Antiapoptotic proteins are a major focus of cancer therapy and make attractive targets for RNAi. An IL-10 RNAi sequence was designed in accordance with Tuschl rules and was modeled to a hairpin configuration. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common leukemia in the Western world, the failure to undergo apoptosis may be responsible for the accumulation of malignant B-1 cells. Interleukin-10, despite controversy, has been shown to have antiapoptotic properties, and increased endogenous IL-10 production has been found in CLL by several labs. A malignant B-1 cell line, LNC, derived from an NZB mouse (a murine model for CLL) was utilized as a target for IL-10 RNAi. Our earlier studies of antisense IL-10 resulted in antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects. The cytotoxic effects of IL-10 RNAi were dose- and time-dependent, with an optimal dose 10-fold lower than that of antisense IL-10. IL-10 RNAi lowered IL-10 protein as measured by ELISA. 2 micro M IL-10 RNAi initiated a G2/M block and a decrease in the message for cdc25C, the M-phase inducer phosphatase. IL-10 RNAi efficiently induced apoptosis. Bcl7C, a member of the antiapoptotic Bcl family, was significantly down-regulated. IL-10 modulating Bcl7C expression represents a novel mechanism in the evasion of apoptosis. This approach, by itself or in conjunction with current therapies, merits consideration in similar B-cell malignancies.","['McCarthy, Brian A', 'Mansour, Amal', 'Lin, Yi-Chu', 'Kotenko, Sergei', 'Raveche, Elizabeth']","['McCarthy BA', 'Mansour A', 'Lin YC', 'Kotenko S', 'Raveche E']","['UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Immun,Cancer immunity,101119871,"['0 (RNA, Double-Stranded)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Interleukin-10/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NZB', 'Models, Molecular', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2004/07/24 05:00,2005/03/04 09:00,['2004/07/24 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/24 05:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Cancer Immun. 2004 Jul 23;4:6.,['040304 [pii]'],20040723,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital. The medical records of adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia diagnosed between January 1989 and June 2000 and undergoing induction chemotherapy were included. Only the patients who presented with a pulmonary infiltrate, secondary leukemia (e.g., transformed chronic myeloid leukemia underlying myelodysplastic syndrome, or disease following alkylating agent therapy) were included and those developing infiltrates following consolidation chemotherapy were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 124 patients were admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of AML during the study period. Thirty-one patients were excluded; 93 patients received induction chemotherapy and were included in the study analysis. The median age was 36 years (15 - 70 years); 58 males and 35 females. Sixty two percent patients received Cytosine Arabinoside (Ara-C), 17% received Etoposide, 11% received Ara-C and Mitoxantrone, and 6% received All-trans-retinoic Acid. The mean onset and duration of neutropenia were 5 and 15 days, respectively. Pulmonary infiltrates were identified during 45% of neutropenic episodes. A presumptive causative organism was isolated from 50% of patients with an infiltrate: Gram-positive bacteria were most common (47%) followed by Gram-negative bacilli (33%) and fungi (20%). Survival data were available for 88 patients; median disease free survival for the entire cohort was 7 months. Male sex (p=0.015), onset of neutropenia (p=0.02) and bilateral distribution of an infiltrate (p=0.03) were statistically significant predictors of early mortality. For patients with and without pneumonia, the median disease-free interval and overall survival were 2.5 and 4.6 months and 9 and 13 months (p=0.038 and p=0.095) respectively. CONCLUSION: Neutropenia occurred at a mean of 5.0 after initiation of induction chemotherapy. The majority of patients had bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Male sex, onset of neutropenia and bilateral distribution of an infiltrate were found to be statistically significant predictors of early mortality.","['Gangat, N', 'Khan, M A A', 'Mujib, M', 'Khurshid, M']","['Gangat N', 'Khan MA', 'Mujib M', 'Khurshid M']","['The Aga Khan University, Karachi.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Pakistan,J Pak Med Assoc,JPMA.

Male gender, increasing age, ethnicity (high in Caucasians, lowest in Asians), and family history are risk factors. Although no specific extrinsic etiologic factors have been established, farming and pesticide exposure are associated with increased risk. Migration studies confirm that ethnic groups retain the risk associated with their origin rather than their new location, favoring a role for heredity. Kindreds with multiple cases of CLL have been well described in the literature and studies in large populations confirm that lymphoproliferative malignancies and especially CLL occur together at a rate that cannot be attributed to chance. Since environmental factors cannot readily explain the familial aggregations, a hereditary factor that affects susceptibility to CLL is likely. The identification of clones that are immunophenotypically identical to CLL in healthy individuals from CLL kindreds (14% to 18%) as well as in the general population (3.5% in age bracket >65 years) suggests a possible precursor condition, but longitudinal studies will be necessary to establish significance in the general population. Family (linkage) and population (candidate gene) studies to date have been too small to identify the specific genes that account for increased susceptibility; larger studies including planned consortia to identify additional high-risk kindreds for genetic studies, as well as the application of advanced technologies such as genomics, cytogenetic, expression, and proteomics, are widely expected to advance understanding over the next few years.","['Caporaso, Neil', 'Marti, Gerald E', 'Goldin, Lynn']","['Caporaso N', 'Marti GE', 'Goldin L']","['Genetic Epideimology Branch, Division of Cancer Epideiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', '*Family Health', 'Female', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology/*etiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Siblings']",2004/07/23 05:00,2005/01/26 09:00,['2004/07/23 05:00'],"['2004/07/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/23 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2004 Jul;41(3):201-6. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2004.05.002.,"['S0037196304000897 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2004.05.002 [doi]']",,,62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies of inherited susceptibility have identified the early oncogenic events in both familial and ""sporadic"" forms of several malignant disorders, and this may also be possible in CLL. However, the utility of linkage analysis in identifying a predisposition locus for the disease is limited because large multigenerational families segregating CLL are rare, while the more frequent small nuclear CLL families contain insufficient numbers of affected individuals. The power to detect predisposition gene(s) could be greatly increased by extending the number of affected individuals within a particular family, for example, by identifying family members with subclinical levels of disease. High-sensitivity flow cytometry techniques, developed to monitor disease in CLL patients undergoing treatment, have allowed accurate enumeration of subclinical levels of CLL cells in healthy individuals from the general population and CLL families. Emerging evidence confirms the phenotypic, genotypic, and clinical associations between the aberrant cells in healthy individuals and those in CLL patients. The data suggest that inherited factors increase the susceptibility to both indolent and aggressive CLL, and they provide unbiased demonstration that the age of onset in CLL families is younger than in the general population.","['Rawstron, Andy', 'Hillmen, Peter', 'Houlston, Richard']","['Rawstron A', 'Hillmen P', 'Houlston R']","['HMDS, Leeds Teaching Hospitals, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,['0 (Immunoglobulins)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Cluster Analysis', '*Family Health', 'Genetic Carrier Screening', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics', '*Preleukemia/diagnosis/genetics']",2004/07/23 05:00,2005/01/26 09:00,['2004/07/23 05:00'],"['2004/07/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/23 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2004 Jul;41(3):192-200. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2004.05.001.,"['S0037196304000885 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2004.05.001 [doi]']",,,74,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of experiments show that the resulting MLL fusion genes directly contribute to leukemogenesis. Among the many known MLL fusion partners, AF4 is relatively common, particularly in acute lymphoblastic leukemia in infants. The AF4 protein interacts with the product of another gene, AF9, which is also fused to MLL in acute leukemias. Based on mapping studies of the AF9-binding domain of AF4, we have developed a peptide, designated PFWT, which disrupts the AF4-AF9 interaction in vitro and in vivo. We provide evidence that this peptide is able to inhibit the proliferation of leukemia cells with t(4;11) chromosomal translocations expressing MLL-AF4 fusion genes. Further, we show that this inhibition is mediated through apoptosis. Importantly, the peptide does not affect the proliferative capacity of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Our findings indicate that the AF4-AF9 protein complex is a promising new target for leukemia therapy and that the PFWT peptide may serve as a lead compound for drug development.","['Srinivasan, R S', 'Nesbit, J B', 'Marrero, L', 'Erfurth, F', 'LaRussa, V F', 'Hemenway, C S']","['Srinivasan RS', 'Nesbit JB', 'Marrero L', 'Erfurth F', 'LaRussa VF', 'Hemenway CS']","['Program in Molecular and Cellular Biology, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (MLLT3 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2004/07/23 05:00,2004/09/10 05:00,['2004/07/23 05:00'],"['2004/07/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/23 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Aug;18(8):1364-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403415.,"['10.1038/sj.leu.2403415 [doi]', '2403415 [pii]']",,"['CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 78318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The D(10) (10 % survival dose) of HTLV-I was about 20 J m(-2), while that of BLV was about 180 J m(-2), which was similar to the reported D(10) of BLV. The UV sensitivity of HTLV-I and BLV was also examined by detecting viral DNA synthesis 24 h after infection. The D(10) values determined by PCR using the gag primers for HTLV-I and BLV were close to those determined by the infectivity assays. Further PCR analyses were then performed to determine D(10) values using several different primers located between the 5'-long terminal repeat (5'-LTR) and the tax1 gene. The difference in UV sensitivity between HTLV-I and BLV was detected very early during replication, even during reverse transcription of the 5'-LTR of irradiated viruses, and became more prominent as reverse transcription proceeded towards the tax1 gene. Chimeric mouse retroviruses that contain the LTR-tax1 fragments of HTLV-I and BLV were made and hardly any difference in UV sensitivity was detected between them, suggesting that the difference was not determined by the linear RNA sequences of HTLV-I and BLV. HTLV-I was found to be much more sensitive than other retroviruses to UV.","['Shimizu, Akira', 'Shimizu, Nobuaki', 'Tanaka, Atsushi', 'Jinno-Oue, Atsushi', 'Roy, Bibhuti Bhusan', 'Shinagawa, Masahiko', 'Ishikawa, Osamu', 'Hoshino, Hiroo']","['Shimizu A', 'Shimizu N', 'Tanaka A', 'Jinno-Oue A', 'Roy BB', 'Shinagawa M', 'Ishikawa O', 'Hoshino H']","['Department of Dermatology, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma 371-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Virology and Preventive Medicine, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma 371-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Virology and Preventive Medicine, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma 371-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Virology and Preventive Medicine, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma 371-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Virology and Preventive Medicine, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma 371-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Virology and Preventive Medicine, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma 371-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Virology and Preventive Medicine, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma 371-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma 371-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Virology and Preventive Medicine, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma 371-8511, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['DNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/radiation effects', 'RNA, Viral/radiation effects', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Ultraviolet Rays', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/radiation effects']",2004/07/23 05:00,2004/08/25 05:00,['2004/07/23 05:00'],"['2004/07/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/23 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2004 Aug;85(Pt 8):2397-2406. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.19578-0.,['10.1099/vir.0.19578-0 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1099/vir.0.19578-0 [doi],

It specifically inhibits influenza A viruses at the step of primary transcription, a process known to occur in the nucleus of infected cells. However, the exact mechanism of inhibition is still poorly understood. The Mx1 GTPase has previously been shown to accumulate in distinct nuclear dots that are spatially associated with promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs), but the significance of this association is not known. Here it is reported that, in cells lacking PML and, as a consequence, PML NBs, Mx1 still formed nuclear dots. These dots were indistinguishable from the dots observed in wild-type cells, indicating that intact PML NBs are not required for Mx1 dot formation. Furthermore, Mx1 retained its antiviral activity against influenza A virus in these PML-deficient cells, which were fully permissive for influenza A virus. Nuclear Mx proteins from other species showed a similar subnuclear distribution. This was also the case for the human MxA GTPase when this otherwise cytoplasmic protein was translocated into the nucleus by virtue of a foreign nuclear localization signal. Human MxA and mouse Mx1 do not interact or form heterooligomers. Yet, they co-localized to a large degree when co-expressed in the nucleus. Taken together, these findings suggest that Mx1 dots represent distinct nuclear domains ('Mx nuclear domains') that are frequently associated with, but functionally independent of, PML NBs.","['Engelhardt, Othmar G', 'Sirma, Huseyin', 'Pandolfi, Pier-Paolo', 'Haller, Otto']","['Engelhardt OG', 'Sirma H', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Haller O']","['Abteilung Virologie, Institut fur Medizinische Mikrobiologie und Hygiene, Universitat Freiburg, Hermann-Herder-Strasse 11, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Heinrich-Pette-Institut fur experimentelle Virologie und Immunologie an der Universitat Hamburg, Martinistrasse 52, D-20251 Hamburg, Germany.', 'Molecular Biology Program, Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Sloan-Kettering Institute, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA.', 'Abteilung Virologie, Institut fur Medizinische Mikrobiologie und Hygiene, Universitat Freiburg, Hermann-Herder-Strasse 11, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (MX1 protein, human)', '0 (Mx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myxovirus Resistance Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Influenza A virus/*growth & development', 'Mice', 'Myxovirus Resistance Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2004/07/23 05:00,2004/08/25 05:00,['2004/07/23 05:00'],"['2004/07/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/23 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2004 Aug;85(Pt 8):2315-2326. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.79795-0.,['10.1099/vir.0.79795-0 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1099/vir.0.79795-0 [doi],

We show that this unanticipated localization is not due to a default in the Tax-2 nuclear localization signal functions nor to major differences in Tax-2 versus Tax-1 binding to the IKKgamma/NEMO protein. In addition, we demonstrate that inhibiting the proteasome results in a relocalization of Tax-1 in the cytoplasm, similar to that of Tax-2. By using a series of Tax-1/Tax-2 chimeras, we determined that the minimal domain that is necessary for Tax-2 peculiar distribution encompasses amino acids 90-100. Finally, we show a high correlation between intracellular localization of Tax and their NF-kappaB or CREB transactivating ability.","['Meertens, Laurent', 'Chevalier, Sebastien', 'Weil, Robert', 'Gessain, Antoine', 'Mahieux, Renaud']","['Meertens L', 'Chevalier S', 'Weil R', 'Gessain A', 'Mahieux R']","[""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur, 75724 Paris Cedex 15, France. meertens@pasteur.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids/chemistry', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Gene Products, tax/*chemistry/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histidine/chemistry', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Nuclear Localization Signals', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",2004/07/23 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/07/23 05:00'],"['2004/07/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/23 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Oct 8;279(41):43307-20. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M400497200.

METHODS: Compliance was assessed through specific interviews, annotations from medical charts, and erythrocytic determination of 6-mercaptopurine metabolites. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients who had concluded maintenance phase of chemotherapy were included in the study. Mothers were responsible for delivering 6-MP in 87% of cases. Thirty five interviewees said that medical prescription was well understood and that the main reason for non-compliance was forgetfulness. Non-compliance was detected through interviews (33.3% of the cases), reports from medical charts (30.7%), and drug determination (16.6%); 53.8% of children were found to be non-compliant. Non-compliance was significantly associated with chronic undernourishment. Although not statistically significant, there was a trend for the group of non-compliant children to be associated with low per capita family income. No significant associations of non-compliance with age at diagnosis, gender, parents' schooling level, number of family members, power consumption, and medians of absolute leucocyte or neutrophil blood counts were detected. A short follow up period precluded valid analysis on outcome. In the non-compliant group (n = 21), seven children relapsed, contrasting with three relapses in the compliant group (n = 18). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that non-compliance is one of the mechanisms which underlies the adverse influence of socioeconomic factors on the outcome of children with ALL. Additional studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis. Comprehensive approaches to the problem of non-compliance are urgently needed.","['de Oliveira, B M', 'Viana, M B', 'Zani, C L', 'Romanha, A J']","['de Oliveira BM', 'Viana MB', 'Zani CL', 'Romanha AJ']","['Haematology Division, Department of Paediatrics, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. benigna@uol.com.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/therapeutic use', 'Mothers', 'Nutrition Disorders/complications', '*Patient Compliance', 'Poverty', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/complications/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence']",2004/07/23 05:00,2004/08/21 05:00,['2004/07/23 05:00'],"['2004/07/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/23 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 2004 Aug;89(8):785-8. doi: 10.1136/adc.2003.030775.,"['10.1136/adc.2003.030775 [doi]', '89/8/785 [pii]']",,,,PMC1720019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mechanical stimuli, such as flow shear stress, simultaneously activate both Erk-1 and -2 in osteoblasts, resulting in stimulation of osteoblast proliferation. This study sought to test whether Erk-1, -2, or both are essential for the fluid flow shear stress-induced osteoblast proliferation. Moloney leukemia virus (MLV)-based vectors expressing wild-type (wt)- or kinase-deficient (kd) Erk-1 and Erk-2, respectively, were constructed and used to transduce human TE85 osteosarcoma cells with an MOI of 30. An MLV-red fluorescent protein (RFP) vector was included as a control. Effects of Erk-1 and -2 overexpression on cell proliferation in response to a 30-min constant fluid flow shear stress at 20 dynes/cm2 were determined with [3H]thymidine incorporation 24 h after the shear stress. The MLV-Erk vector-transduced TE85 cells showed a >10- and approximately 2-fold overexpression of Erk-1 and -2 protein, respectively. The RFP expressing control cells and the parental TE85 cells each showed an approximately twofold increase (P < 0.01) in [3H]thymidine incorporation in response to the shear stress. Cells overexpressing wt-Erk-1 or -2 showed small enhancing effects on the response to the shear stress in the increases in [3H]thymidine incorporation and cell number. Conversely, overexpression of kd-Erk-1 or -2 each alone completely abolished the shear stress-induced osteoblast proliferation. Overexpression of either kd-Erk-1 or kd-Erk-2 alone did not have a significant effect on basal osteoblast proliferation, suggesting that the Erk signaling pathway may not be essential for basal cell proliferation. In summary, this study demonstrates for the first time that Erk-1 and -2 are both required for the mitogenic response to fluid flow shear stress in human osteoblasts and that blocking Erk-1 or -2 each alone is sufficient to completely block the mitogenic response to shear stress-induced proliferation.","['Kapur, Sonia', 'Chen, Shin-Tai', 'Baylink, David J', 'Lau, K-H William']","['Kapur S', 'Chen ST', 'Baylink DJ', 'Lau KH']","['Musculoskeletal Disease Center (151), Jerry L.

Here we present a new graphical modelling technique, which is based on decomposable graphical models, and apply it to a set of gene expression profiles from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The new method explains probabilistic dependencies of expression levels in terms of the concerted action of underlying genetic functional modules, which are represented as so-called ""cliques"" in the graph. In addition, the method uses continuous-valued (instead of discretized) expression levels, and makes no particular assumption about their probability distribution. We show that the method successfully groups members of known functional modules to cliques.

Although 99mTc tetrofosmin has been used previously as a myocardial perfusion agent, it is now also being used in the imaging of various tumours. In the current study, Tc tetrofosmin was used in the investigation of acute leukaemia. AIM: To show the uptake pattern of 99mTc tetrofosmin in the bone marrow of patients with acute leukaemia, and to ascertain the relationship between 99mTc tetrofosmin uptake and the level of Pgp expression and their relation to the response to chemotherapy. In addition, CD95, which is an indicator of apoptosis (programmed cell death), has also been assessed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pgp and CD95 were detected by using flow cytometry. Of the 27 acute leukaemia patients assessed, nine had previously received chemotherapy, and 18 had had an initial diagnosis. All patients had undergone 99mTc tetrofosmin scintigraphy, and their Pgp and CD95 levels had been determined. The same parameters were studied again for 14 patients. The responses to chemotherapy were assessed by patients' clinicians. A control group of 37 patients without bone marrow pathology was also studied in order to provide comparisons for the scintigraphy results. The control images were assessed only qualitatively. RESULTS: In leukaemia patients the uptake of 99mTc tetrofosmin into bone marrow was found to be considerably higher than in control patients (P=0.000). An analysis of the relationship between Pgp, CD95, and the qualitative and quantitative tetrofosmin uptake ratios (URs) showed that there was an inverse correlation only between Pgp and the quantitative uptake ratio (P=0.016, r=-0.461). When the patients were grouped as 'good' and 'poor', as related to the chemotherapy response, there were no meaningful differences between these two groups regarding Pgp, CD95 and tetrofosmin URs (P>0.05). By evaluating the scintigraphic findings of the 'repeated' 14 patients, we showed that if the 99mTc tetrofosmin UR in the second imaging test was reduced by >0.08, the response to chemotherapy tended to be good. This method, based on follow-up scanning with tetrofosmin, showed a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 62% in the prediction of a 'good' response, if a decrease of 0.08 was taken into consideration. CONCLUSION: In this study, patients with acute leukaemia showed significant uptake of tetrofosmin into the bone marrow. The addition of basal and repeated 99mTc tetrofosmin scintigraphy to the management protocol for leukaemia could lead to the preferential determination of responses to chemotherapy, by evaluating whole bone marrow non-invasively. This method seems promising, but it needs further support from various similar investigations comprising more patients in order to confirm our results.","['Sukan, Aysun', 'Yapar, Zeynep', 'SAhin, Berksoy', 'Kara, Oguz', 'Fuat Yapar, A', 'CEtiner, Salih', 'Kibar, Mustafa']","['Sukan A', 'Yapar Z', 'SAhin B', 'Kara O', 'Fuat Yapar A', 'CEtiner S', 'Kibar M']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, Cukurova University Medical School, Adana, Turkey. aysunsukan@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",England,Nucl Med Commun,Nuclear medicine communications,8201017,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (Organotechnetium Compounds)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '42FOP1YX93 (technetium tc-99m tetrofosmin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/diagnostic imaging/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/*metabolism', 'Organotechnetium Compounds/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/pharmacokinetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",2004/07/22 05:00,2005/03/22 09:00,['2004/07/22 05:00'],"['2004/07/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/22 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nucl Med Commun. 2004 Aug;25(8):777-85. doi: 10.1097/01.mnm.0000134319.32279.0f.,"['00006231-200408000-00004 [pii]', '10.1097/01.mnm.0000134319.32279.0f [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The mutant IkappaBalpha gene was transfected into HL-60 cells by liposome-mediated techniques. G418 resistant clones stably expressing mutant IkappaBalpha were obtained by the limiting dilution method. TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The expression of bcl-xL was detected by RT-PCR and Western blot after 4 hours exposure of parental HL-60 and transfected HL-60 cells to a variety of concentrations of TNF-alpha. The percentage of apoptotic leukemia cells was evaluated by flow cytometry (FCM). RESULTS: Mutant IkappaBalpha protein was confirmed to exist by Western blot. The results of EMSA showed that NF-kappaB activation by TNF-alpha in HL-60 cells was induced in a dose-dependent manner, but was almost completely inhibited by mutant IkappaBalpha repressor in transfected cells. The levels of bcl-xL mRNA and protein in HL-60 cells increased after exposure to TNF-alpha, but changed very little in transfected HL-60 cells. The inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by mutant IkappaBalpha enhanced TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. The cytotoxic effects of TNF-alpha were amplified in a time- and dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: NF-kappaB activation plays an important role in the resistance to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. The inhibition of NF-kappaB by mutant IkappaBalpha could provide a new approach that may enhance the anti-leukemia effects of TNF-alpha or even of other cytotoxic agents.","['Cao, Wen-jing', 'Zhang, Yao-zhen', 'Zhang, Dong-hua', 'Li, Deng-ju', 'Tang, Jin-zhi']","['Cao WJ', 'Zhang YZ', 'Zhang DH', 'Li DJ', 'Tang JZ']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong Science and Technology University, Wuhan 430030, China. wj_tsao@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/*physiology', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein']",2004/07/22 05:00,2004/10/29 09:00,['2004/07/22 05:00'],"['2004/07/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/22 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2004 Jul;117(7):972-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The TaqMan quantitative real-time RT-PCR method was established by using cloned WT-1 cDNA or synthesized oligonucleotides resembling WT-1 cDNA fragments in limit dilution as template until a stable and reliable standard curve was obtained. In a 25-month follow-up, the transcriptional levels of WT-1, Bcr-Abl, and Abl gene, were quantitatively measured in bone marrow cells from 25 CML or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients with the Ph chromosome. In addition, the expression of these genes in 40 samples of normal peripheral blood was also examined using the same method. The ratios of WT-1/Abl and Bcr-Abl/Abl were both plotted, and the two expression patterns were compared as well as their clinical significance. RESULTS: The levels of WT-1 expression in normal peripheral blood were detectable. In CML and Ph positive ALL patients, WT-1 expression levels changed in parallel with the Bcr-Abl expression pattern as the disease progressed or responded to effective treatment.

We studied the transformation of MDS into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Leukemic transformation in 151 patients with MDS was dynamically followed up. The clinical manifestation, peripheral blood and bone marrow condition, karyotypes, immunophenotypes, response to treatment, and prognosis of AML evolution from MDS (MDS-AML) were also observed. RESULTS: During the course of this study, over the past eight years and seven months, 21 (13.91%) of 151 MDS patients progressed to overt leukemia, with a median interval of 5 (1 - 23) months. There were no significant differences between rates of leukemic transformation in comparison with the refractory anemia (RA), RA with excess of blasts (RAEB), and RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t) patient groups. Transformation occurred either gradually or rapidly. There were five parameters positively correlated to leukemic transformation: under 40 years of age, pancytopenia of 3 lineages, more than 15% blasts in the bone marrow, at least two abnormal karyotypes, and treatment with combined chemotherapy. All of the 21 patients with leukemia suffered from MDS-AML, and most of them were M2, M4, or M5. Two (9.52%) MDS-AML patients developed extramedullary infiltration. Leukopenia was found in 47.62% of these patients. Two thirds of these patients, whose bone marrows were generally hypercellular, suffered from neutropenia. After developing AML, 8 (47.06%) patients developed abnormal karyotypes. High expression of immature myeloid antigens, including CD33 [(49.83 +/- 24.50)%], CD13 [(36.38 +/- 33.84)%], monocytic antigen CD14 [(38.50 +/- 24.60)%], and stem cell marker CD34 [(34.67 +/- 30.59)%], were found on bone marrow mononuclear cells from MDS-AML patients after leukemic transformation. In some cases, lymphoid antigens, such as CD5, CD7, CD9, and CD19, coexisted with myeloid antigens. A low complete remission rate (31.25%) and a short survival time, with median survival of 6 (1 - 28) months, were found in patients with MDS-AML treated by induction chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: MDS has a high risk of developing into AML, either gradually or rapidly. Patients with MDS-AML have specific biological characteristics and a worse prognosis.","['Shi, Jun', 'Shao, Zong-hong', 'Liu, Hong', 'Bai, Jie', 'Cao, Yan-ran', 'He, Guang-sheng', 'Tu, Mei-feng', 'Wang, Xiu-li', 'Hao, Yu-shu', 'Yang, Tian-ying', 'Yang, Cong-li']","['Shi J', 'Shao ZH', 'Liu H', 'Bai J', 'Cao YR', 'He GS', 'Tu MF', 'Wang XL', 'Hao YS', 'Yang TY', 'Yang CL']","['First Department of Clinical Hematology, Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/genetics/immunology', 'Prognosis']",2004/07/22 05:00,2004/10/29 09:00,['2004/07/22 05:00'],"['2004/07/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/22 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2004 Jul;117(7):963-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the first trimester the intervillous space is filled by a clear fluid, in part derived from secretions from the endometrial glands via openings in the basal plate. The aim was to determine the activity of the glands throughout the first trimester, and to identify components of the secretions. METHODS: Samples of human decidua basalis from 5-14 weeks gestational age were examined by transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemically. An archival collection of placenta-in-situ samples was also reviewed. RESULTS: The thickness of the endometrium beneath the implantation site reduced from approximately 5 mm at 6 weeks to 1 mm at 14 weeks of gestation. The glandular epithelium also transformed from tall columnar cells, packed with secretory organelles, to a low cuboidal layer over this period. The lumens of the glands were always filled with precipitated secretions, and communications with the intervillous space could be traced until at least 10 weeks. The glandular epithelium reacted strongly for leukaemia inhibitory factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor beta, alpha tocopherol transfer protein, MUC-1 and glycodelin, and weakly for lactoferrin. As gestation advanced uterine natural killer cells became closely approximated to the basal surface of the epithelium. These cells were also immunopositive for epidermal growth factor. CONCLUSIONS: Morphologically the endometrial glands are best developed and most active during early human pregnancy. The glands gradually regress over the first trimester, but still communicate with the intervillous space until at least 10 weeks. Hence, they could provide an important source of nutrients, growth factors and cytokines for the feto-placental unit. The endometrium may therefore play a greater role in regulating placental growth and differentiation post-implantation than previously appreciated.","['Hempstock, Joanne', 'Cindrova-Davies, Tereza', 'Jauniaux, Eric', 'Burton, Graham J']","['Hempstock J', 'Cindrova-Davies T', 'Jauniaux E', 'Burton GJ']","['Department of Anatomy, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. jo_hempstock@yahoo.co.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Reprod Biol Endocrinol,Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&E,101153627,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Mucins)']",IM,"['Cytokines/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Decidua/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Endometrium/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Growth Substances/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Confocal/methods', 'Microscopy, Electron/methods', 'Mucins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimester, First/*physiology']",2004/07/22 05:00,2004/11/13 09:00,['2004/07/22 05:00'],"['2004/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2004/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/22 05:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Reprod Biol Endocrinol. 2004 Jul 20;2:58. doi: 10.1186/1477-7827-2-58.,"['10.1186/1477-7827-2-58 [doi]', '1477-7827-2-58 [pii]']",20040720,,,PMC493283,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is important to understand the assumptions and role of the various methods of analysis to interpret published trials and to design future studies appropriately. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The methods of analysis used for testing the effectiveness and safety of transfusion strategies are reviewed from several recent PLT transfusion trigger trials. The underlying assumptions of these methods are discussed, as well as the clinical interpretations of the resulting summary statistics. Four methods of analysis were applied to data from a large PLT transfusion trigger study to illustrate the differences in the interpretations that can arise from various approaches. RESULTS: PLT transfusion trigger trials of patients with leukemia have based their primary analyses on 1) simple dichotomous classifications of whether or not at least 1 day of clinically important bleeding was experienced; 2) the time to the first day of clinically important bleeding; and 3) the proportion of days at risk with clinically important bleeding. Recurrent event methods provide a robust alternative approach to the analysis of this kind of data and should be considered if interest is in capturing the overall burden of bleeding over time. These four methods differ in the extent to which they utilize information on the number of days with bleeding and the temporal variation in bleeding patterns. Inferences drawn regarding the relative safety and efficacy of different transfusion triggers can vary depending on the method of analysis. CONCLUSION: To rigorously design and analyze future PLT transfusion studies based on bleeding outcomes, it is important to have a clear understanding of the interpretation of the different ways of analyzing bleeding outcomes. The analysis strategy should be selected based on the clinical question being addressed.","['Cook, R J', 'Heddle, N M', 'Rebulla, P', 'Sigouin, C S', 'Webert, K E']","['Cook RJ', 'Heddle NM', 'Rebulla P', 'Sigouin CS', 'Webert KE']","['Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,IM,"['Hemorrhage/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Platelet Transfusion/*adverse effects', '*Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/07/22 05:00,2004/08/20 05:00,['2004/07/22 05:00'],"['2004/07/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/22 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2004 Aug;44(8):1135-42. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2004.03231.x.,"['10.1111/j.1537-2995.2004.03231.x [doi]', 'TRF03231 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,"['Biomedical Excellence for Safer Transfusion (BEST) Working Party of the', 'International Society for Blood Transfusion']",,,,,,,,,

(2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 47542-47549), binds MCL1, a protein of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family. The fortilin-MCL1 interaction stabilizes and increases the half-life of fortilin but not necessarily of MCL1 (Zhang, D., Li, F., Weidner, D., Mnjoyan, Z. H., and Fujise, K. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 37430-37438). It is not known to what extent each protein depends on the other for its apoptotic activity. Here, we present evidence that fortilin and MCL1 are capable of functioning as antiapoptotic proteins independently of each other. Using a robust small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing system developed in our laboratory, we analyzed the cytoprotective effects of fortilin and MCL1 together and apart in U2OS cell lines exposed to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in both monoclonal and polyclonal cell populations. When MCL1 was silenced by MCL1-targeted siRNA, fortilin was still able to protect cells from 5-FU-induced cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, when fortilin was silenced by fortilin-targeted siRNA, MCL1 was also able to protect cells from 5-FU-induced cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Together, these data clearly suggest that fortilin and MCL1 can exert their cytoprotective activities independently of each other. The silencing of fortilin and MCL1 did not qualitatively change the subcellular localization of MCL1 and fortilin, respectively. The biological significance of fortilin-MCL1 interaction may be that it increases cellular resistance to apoptosis by allowing MCL1, an independently antiapoptotic protein, to stabilize another independently antiapoptotic protein, fortilin.","['Graidist, Potchanapond', 'Phongdara, Amornrat', 'Fujise, Ken']","['Graidist P', 'Phongdara A', 'Fujise K']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Prince of Songkla University, Hat-Yai, Songkhla 90112, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Protein, Translationally-Controlled 1)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Fluorouracil/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Trypan Blue/pharmacology', 'Tumor Protein, Translationally-Controlled 1']",2004/07/21 05:00,2004/10/27 09:00,['2004/07/21 05:00'],"['2004/07/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/21 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Sep 24;279(39):40868-75. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M401454200.

Similar to other coronaviruses, spike (S)-glycoprotein of the virus interacts with a cellular receptor and mediates membrane fusion to allow viral entry into susceptible target cells. Accordingly, S-protein plays an important role in virus infection cycle and is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. To begin to understand its biochemical and immunological properties, we expressed both full-length and ectodomain of the protein in various primate cells. Our results show that the protein has an electrophoretic mobility of about 160-170 kDa. The protein is glycosylated with high mannose and/or hybrid oligosaccharides, which account for approximately 30 kDa of the apparent protein mass. The detection of S-protein by immunoassays was difficult using human convalescent sera, suggesting that the protein may not elicit strong humoral immune response in virus-infected patients. We were able to pseudotype murine leukemia virus particles with S-protein and produce SARS pseudoviruses. Pseudoviruses infected Vero E6 cells in a pH-independent manner and the infection could be specifically inhibited by convalescent sera. Consistent with low levels of antibodies against S-protein, neutralizing activity was weak with 50% neutralization titers ranging between 1:15 to 1:25. To facilitate quantifying pseudovirus-infected cells, which are stained blue with X-Gal, we devised an automated procedure using an ELISPOT analyzer. The high-throughput capacity of this procedure and the safety of using SARS pseudoviruses should make possible large-scale analyses of neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV.","['Han, Dong P', 'Kim, Hyung G', 'Kim, Young B', 'Poon, Leo L M', 'Cho, Michael W']","['Han DP', 'Kim HG', 'Kim YB', 'Poon LL', 'Cho MW']","['Department of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (spike glycoprotein, SARS-CoV)', '0 (spike protein, mouse hepatitis virus)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Convalescence', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Glycosylation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Mannose/chemistry', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis/chemistry/*genetics', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neutralization Tests/*methods', 'Oligosaccharides/chemistry', 'Reassortant Viruses/isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'SARS Virus/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome/blood/*diagnosis', 'Species Specificity', 'Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus', 'Vero Cells', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*analysis/chemistry/*genetics']",2004/07/21 05:00,2004/10/01 05:00,['2004/07/21 05:00'],"['2004/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2004/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/21 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 2004 Aug 15;326(1):140-9. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2004.05.017.,"['10.1016/j.virol.2004.05.017 [doi]', 'S0042682204003678 [pii]']",,['R21 AI059217/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC7127165,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The U3 region of A8-LTR contains a unique structure of enhancer motifs consisting of three repeats of a 38-bp sequence containing FVa, LVb/C4, and CORE motifs. Replacement or deletion of the 38-bp sequence in the A8-U3 resulted in a marked reduction in tumorigenicity. Furthermore, the virus with 57-U3 gained high tumorigenicity after construction of the three 38-bp repeats in the U3 region. These findings indicated that the repeats of the 38-bp sequence of A8-LTR are essential for the rapid induction of thymoma. Interestingly, the repeat of the 38-bp sequence did not accelerate the amount of integrated viral DNA in the thymus during the early phase of infection, although it contributed to higher production of infectious virus. Thus, it was demonstrated that the ability to induce thymoma, which correlates with virus titer in the thymus, is not determined by the rate of viral DNA integration into the host genome.","['Takase-Yoden, Sayaka', 'Watanabe, Rihito']","['Takase-Yoden S', 'Watanabe R']","['Department of Bioinformatics, Faculty of Engineering, Soka University, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-8577, Japan. takase@t.soka.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics/physiology', 'Thymoma/*virology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*virology', 'Virulence', 'Virus Integration']",2004/07/21 05:00,2004/10/01 05:00,['2004/07/21 05:00'],"['2004/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2004/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2004/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/21 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 2004 Aug 15;326(1):29-40. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2004.04.047.,"['10.1016/j.virol.2004.04.047 [doi]', 'S0042682204003526 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hot water extract of Youngia japonica inhibited cell proliferation and growth of all cancer cell lines to various extent. K-562 cells were the most sensitive to the extract whereas S-180 cells were the least. It did not show any significant cytotoxic effects on normal mammalian Vero cells up to the concentration of 450 microg/mL. The ethanol extract of whole plant of Youngia japonica exhibited antiviral activity against RSV cultured in HEp-2 cells, but did not have any activity against Flu A and HSV-1. Two partially purified fractions (Fr.10 and Fr.11) from the 95% ethanol extract exhibited significant anti-RSV with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the range of 3.0-6.0 microg/mL. The ratio of the viral titer reduction in the absence (viral control) and presence of the maximal non-cytotoxic concentration (MNCC) of the Fr.10 and Fr.11 was both estimated to be 1 x 10(4) (RF, viral titer reduction factors), indicating that their anti-RSV activity was high enough to justify for further analysis.

One promising application of this technology is the molecular diagnostics of cancer, e.g. to distinguish normal tissue from tumor or to classify tumors into different types or subtypes. One problem arising from the use of microarray data is how to analyze the high-dimensional gene expression data, typically with thousands of variables (genes) and much fewer observations (samples). There is a need to develop reliable classification methods to make full use of microarray data and to evaluate accurately the predictive ability and reliability of such derived models. In this paper, discriminant partial least squares was used to classify the different types of human tumors using four microarray datasets and showed good prediction performance. Four different cross-validation procedures (leave-one-out versus leave-half-out; incomplete versus full) were used to evaluate the classification model. Our results indicate that discriminant partial least squares using leave-half-out cross-validation provides a more realistic estimate of the predictive ability of a classification model, which may be overestimated by some of the cross-validation procedures, and the information obtained from different cross-validation procedures can be used to evaluate the reliability of the classification model.","['Tan, Yongxi', 'Shi, Leming', 'Tong, Weida', 'Hwang, G T Gene', 'Wang, Charles']","['Tan Y', 'Shi L', 'Tong W', 'Hwang GT', 'Wang C']","['Burns and Allen Research Institute Microarray Core, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Comput Biol Chem,Computational biology and chemistry,101157394,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Breast Neoplasms/classification/genetics', '*Computer Simulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Leukemia/classification/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/genetics', '*Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms/*classification/genetics', 'Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary/classification/genetics', 'Neuroblastoma/classification/genetics', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/classification/genetics', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/classification/genetics']",2004/07/21 05:00,2004/09/15 05:00,['2004/07/21 05:00'],"['2004/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/04 00:00 [revised]', '2004/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/15 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/21 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Comput Biol Chem. 2004 Jul;28(3):235-44. doi: 10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2004.05.002.,"['10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2004.05.002 [doi]', 'S147692710400043X [pii]']",,['M01-RR00425/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Profiles of cancer cell signaling networks might therefore identify mechanisms by which such cells interpret environmental cues for continued growth. Using multiparameter flow cytometry, we monitored phospho-protein responses to environmental cues in acute myeloid leukemia at the single cell level. By exposing cancer cell signaling networks to potentiating inputs, rather than relying upon the basal levels of protein phosphorylation alone, we could discern unique cancer network profiles that correlated with genetics and disease outcome. Strikingly, individual cancers manifested multiple cell subsets with unique network profiles, reflecting cancer heterogeneity at the level of signaling response. The results revealed a dramatic remodeling of signaling networks in cancer cells. Thus, single cell measurements of phospho-protein responses reveal shifts in signaling potential of a phospho-protein network, allowing for categorizing of cell network phenotypes by multidimensional molecular profiles of signaling.","['Irish, Jonathan M', 'Hovland, Randi', 'Krutzik, Peter O', 'Perez, Omar D', 'Bruserud, Oystein', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn T', 'Nolan, Garry P']","['Irish JM', 'Hovland R', 'Krutzik PO', 'Perez OD', 'Bruserud O', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Nolan GP']","['Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Baxter Laboratory of Genetic Pharmacology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/pharmacology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/physiology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*genetics', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",2004/07/21 05:00,2004/09/04 05:00,['2004/07/21 05:00'],"['2004/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/28 00:00 [revised]', '2004/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/21 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell. 2004 Jul 23;118(2):217-28. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2004.06.028.,"['10.1016/j.cell.2004.06.028 [doi]', 'S0092867404006282 [pii]']",,['N01-HV-28183I/HV/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

H pylori infection induces active inflammation with neutrophilic infiltrations as well as production of oxygen free radicals that can cause DNA damage. The DNA damage induced by oxygen free radicals could have very harmful consequences, leading to gene modifications that are potentially mutagenic and/or carcinogenic. The aims of the present study were to assess the effect of H pylori infection on the expression of inducible nitric oxidative synthase (iNOS) and the production of 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a sensitive marker of oxidative DNA injury in human gastric mucosa with and without tumor lesions, and to assess the possible factors affecting cell death signaling due to oxidative DNA damage. METHODS: In this study, 40 gastric carcinoma specimens and adjacent specimens were obtained from surgical resection. We determined the level of 8-OHdG formation by HPLC-ECD, and the expression of iNOS and mechanism of cell death signaling (including nuclear factor-kappaB(NFkappaB), MEKK-1, Caspase 3, B Cell lymphomal leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1)) by Western-blot assay. RESULTS: The concentrations of 8-OHdG, iNOS, NFkappaB, Mcl-1 and IAP were significantly higher in cancer tissues than in adjacent non-cancer tissues. In addition, significantly higher concentrations of 8-OHdG, iNOS, NFkappaB, Mcl-1 and IAP were detected in patients infected with H pylori compared with patients who were not infected with H pylori. Furthermore, 8-OHdG, iNOS, NFkappaB, Mcl-1 and IAP concentrations were significantly higher in stage 3 and 4 patients than in stage 1 and 2 patients. CONCLUSION: Chronic H pylori infection induces iNOS expression and subsequent DNA damage as well as enhances anti-apoptosis signal transduction. This sequence of events supports the hypothesis that oxygen-free radical-mediated damage due to H pylori plays a pivotal role in the development of gastric carcinoma in patients with chronic gastritis.","['Chang, Chi-Sen', 'Chen, Wei-Na', 'Lin, Hui-Hsuan', 'Wu, Cheng-Chung', 'Wang, Chau-Jong']","['Chang CS', 'Chen WN', 'Lin HH', 'Wu CC', 'Wang CJ']","['Institute of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, No. 110, Sec. 1, Chien Kuo North Road, 402 Taichung, Taiwan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,World J Gastroenterol,World journal of gastroenterology,100883448,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proteins)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/complications/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', '*DNA Damage', 'Female', 'Helicobacter Infections/complications/*genetics/physiopathology', '*Helicobacter pylori', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Stomach Neoplasms/complications/*genetics/physiopathology']",2004/07/20 05:00,2004/09/24 05:00,['2004/07/20 05:00'],"['2004/07/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/20 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,World J Gastroenterol. 2004 Aug 1;10(15):2232-40. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v10.i15.2232.,['10.3748/wjg.v10.i15.2232 [doi]'],,,,PMC4724973,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that, in contrast to extensively aggregated FcepsilonRI, receptor dimers (1) induced a less extensive association of FcepsilonRI with detergent-resistant membranes, (2) delayed the tyrosine phosphorylation and membrane recruitment of several signaling molecules, (3) triggered a slower but more sustained increase in concentration of free cytoplasmic calcium, (4) induced degranulation which was not inhibited at higher concentrations of the cross-linking mAb, and (5) failed to produce clusters of FcepsilonRI, Syk kinase and Grb2 adapter in osmiophilic membranes, as detected by immunogold electron microscopy on membrane sheets. Despite striking differences in the topography of FcepsilonRI dimers and multimers, biochemical differences were less pronounced.

One plausible explanation for the neurodegeneration of these disorders proposes that inclusions of such proteins sequester other significant nuclear proteins in inactive form. The present study shows that PML protein is sequestered by inclusions of the pathogenic mutant form of the polyglutamine protein ataxin-1 and that this sequestration removes from the nucleus the free 0.2-1 microm diameter PML nuclear domains (PML-NDs), together with at least one of their many cargo proteins (Sp100). The present study demonstrates that this sequestration can be effected equally by another nuclear protein, RED, which lacks a polyglutamine tract, but expresses a polar zipper repeat. The sequestered PML-NDs no longer respond to stress signals (heat shock or ionizing radiation) to which they are normally sensitive. In both cases, there is independent evidence that the cells initiate other responses to their injury (nuclear translocation of heat shock protein or generation of gamma-H2AX-rich nuclear foci, respectively). The data thus provide strong evidence that multiple species of nuclear inclusion functionally sequester PML-NDs.

We describe here the genetic organisation of the Alh locus in D. melanogaster. We show that an independent lethal complementation group encoding a muscle protein (Mlp84B) is located within an Alh intron. We have already shown that the leucine zipper (LZ) domain of ALH activates several Polycomb group-responsive elements. We further demonstrate that the LZ domain on its own bears the Alh vital function, since it is necessary and sufficient for rescue of Alh mutant lethality.

Samples were obtained from 258 children, including 92 receiving anticancer chemotherapy, 108 long-term survivors, 40 children without any renal disease, and 18 patients with chronic renal insufficiency. CysC of patients on current chemotherapy was assessed both before and after treatment. Significant correlations were found between cysC and S(Cr) and between 1/cysC and C( Counahan).

NBS1 potentiates the enzymatic activity of MRE11 and directs the R/M/N complex to sites of DNA damage, where it forms nuclear foci by interacting with phosphorylated H2AX. The R/M/N complex also activates the ATM kinase, which is a major kinase involved in the activation of DNA damage signal pathways. The ATM requires the R/M/N complex for its own activation following DNA damage, and for conformational change to develop a high affinity for target proteins. In addition, association of NBS1 with PML, the promyelocytic leukemia protein, is required to form nuclear bodies, which have various functions depending on their location and composition. These nuclear bodies function not only in response to DNA damage, but are also involved in telomere maintenance when they are located on telomeres.

The cell antioxidant capacity against H2O2 was estimated by the electron spin resonance (ESR) spin-trapping technique in the Fenton reaction system via Fe+2 ion action with H2O2 resulting in hydroxyl radical generation. The effects of catalase inhibitors, such as sodium azide and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, on the antioxidant capacity of cells were tested. Based on our observation, it can be concluded that the defensive capacity of cells against H2O2 depends on the ratio between catalase/GPx/SOD and H2O2, especially at high-stress situations, and the intracellular balance of these enzymes are more important than the influence of the single component.","['Kartvelishvili, Tamar', 'Abuladze, Marina', 'Asatiani, Nino', 'Akhvlediani, Joseph', 'Asanishvili, Lali', 'Holman, Hoi-Ying N', 'Sapojnikova, Nelly']","['Kartvelishvili T', 'Abuladze M', 'Asatiani N', 'Akhvlediani J', 'Asanishvili L', 'Holman HY', 'Sapojnikova N']","['Institute of Molecular Biology and Biophysics, Georgian Academy of Sciences, 14,Gotua Str., 0160 Tbilisi, Georgia. tkartvelishvili@hotmail.com,']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,ScientificWorldJournal,TheScientificWorldJournal,101131163,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Spin Labels)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/chemistry/metabolism', 'Catalase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Extracts/chemistry', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Diploidy', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Epithelial Cells/*chemistry/enzymology/pathology', 'Fibroblasts/chemistry/enzymology', 'Genome, Human', 'Genomic Instability/genetics', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/pathology', 'Lung/chemistry/cytology/enzymology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Spin Labels', 'Spin Trapping/*methods', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism/physiology']",2004/07/20 05:00,2004/09/09 05:00,['2004/07/20 05:00'],"['2004/07/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/20 05:00 [entrez]']",epublish,ScientificWorldJournal. 2004 Jun 29;4:490-9. doi: 10.1100/tsw.2004.99.,['10.1100/tsw.2004.99 [doi]'],20040629,,,PMC5956506,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been found to cause nasal, stomach, and thyroid tumours in rodent feeding studies at levels that are much higher than likely human exposures. AIMS: To evaluate mortality rates from 1968 to 1999 and cancer incidence rates from 1969 to 1999 for alachlor manufacturing workers at a plant in Muscatine, Iowa. METHODS: Worker mortality and cancer incidence rates were compared to corresponding rates for the Iowa state general population. Analyses addressed potential intensity and duration of exposure. RESULTS: For workers with any period of high alachlor exposure, mortality from all causes combined was lower than expected (42 observed deaths, SMR 64, 95% CI 46 to 86) and cancer mortality was slightly lower than expected (13 observed deaths, SMR 79, 95% CI 42 to 136). Cancer incidence for workers with potential high exposure was similar to that for Iowa residents, both overall (29 observed cases, SIR 123, 95% CI 82 to 177) and for workers exposed for five or more years and with at least 15 years since first exposure (eight observed cases, SIR 113, 95% CI 49 to 224). There were no cases of nasal, stomach, or thyroid cancer. CONCLUSIONS: There were no cancers of the types found in toxicology studies and no discernible relation between cancer incidence for any site and years of alachlor exposure or time since first exposure. Despite the small size of this population, the findings are important because these workers had chronic exposure potential during extended manufacturing campaigns, while use in agriculture is typically limited to a few days or weeks each year.","['Acquavella, J F', 'Delzell, E', 'Cheng, H', 'Lynch, C F', 'Johnson, G']","['Acquavella JF', 'Delzell E', 'Cheng H', 'Lynch CF', 'Johnson G']","['Monsanto Company, 800 North Lindbergh Blvd, St Louis, MO 63167, USA. john.f.acquavella@monsanto.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Herbicides)', '24S2S61PXL (alachlor)']",IM,"['Acetamides/*poisoning', 'Adult', '*Chemical Industry', 'Cohort Studies', 'Environmental Monitoring/methods', 'Epidemiological Monitoring', 'Female', 'Herbicides/*poisoning', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Iowa/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/chemically induced/epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology/mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology/mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects', 'Sex Distribution']",2004/07/20 05:00,2004/08/31 05:00,['2004/07/20 05:00'],"['2004/07/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/31 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/20 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2004 Aug;61(8):680-5. doi: 10.1136/oem.2003.010934.,"['10.1136/oem.2003.010934 [doi]', '61/8/680 [pii]']",,,,PMC1740830,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retrovirus-based constructs were generated to introduce FPR-siRNA into a rat leukemia cell line transfected to overexpress FPR. Cells infected with FPR-siRNAT28, which targets the nucleotides 926 to 944 of FPR mRNA corresponding to the third extracellular loop of the putative receptor protein, showed significantly reduced expression of FPR mRNA and protein, in association with impaired calcium mobilization and chemotactic responses to peptide agonists. Direct transduction of synthetic FPR-siRNAT28 into human macrophages also inhibited the expression of FPR and abrogated cell chemotaxis and the release of superoxide anions induced by the bacterial formylpeptide. FPR-siRNA additionally abrogated the expression and function of FPR in a human malignant glioma cell line. Our study demonstrates successful application of siRNA to silence a G protein-coupled chemoattractant receptor involved in inflammation and suggests the potential to use this approach in studies of receptor regulation and prevention of undesirable side effects associated with FPR activation.","['Le, Yingying', 'Iribarren, Pablo', 'Zhou, Ye', 'Gong, Wanghua', 'Hu, Jinyue', 'Zhang, Xia', 'Wang, Ji Ming']","['Le Y', 'Iribarren P', 'Zhou Y', 'Gong W', 'Hu J', 'Zhang X', 'Wang JM']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunoregulation, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Bldg. 560, Room 31-40, MD 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Small Interfering/analysis/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/07/20 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/07/20 05:00'],"['2004/07/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/20 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2004 Oct;66(4):1022-8. doi: 10.1124/mol.104.001982.

Direct regulation of the activity of RGS-RhoGEFs p115 or leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) by Galpha13 has previously been demonstrated. However, the precise biochemical mechanism by which Galpha13 stimulates the RhoGEF activity of these proteins has not yet been well understood. Based on the crystal structure of Galphai1 in complex with RGS4, we mutated the Galpha13 residue lysine 204 to alanine (Galpha13K204A) and characterized the effect of this mutation in its regulation of RGS-RhoGEFs p115 or LARG. Compared with wild-type Galpha13, Galpha13K204A induced much less serum-response factor activation when expressed in HeLa cells. Recombinant Galpha13K204A exhibits normal function in terms of nucleotide binding, basal GTP hydrolysis, and formation of heterotrimer with betagamma. We found that lysine 204 of Galpha13 is important for interaction with the RGS domain of p115 or LARG and for the GTPase-activating protein activity of these proteins. In addition, the K204A mutation of Galpha13 impaired its regulation of the RhoGEF activity of p115 or LARG. We conclude that lysine 204 of Galpha13 is important for interaction with RGS-RhoGEFs and is critically involved in the regulation of their activity.","['Nakamura, Susumu', 'Kreutz, Barry', 'Tanabe, Shihori', 'Suzuki, Nobuchika', 'Kozasa, Tohru']","['Nakamura S', 'Kreutz B', 'Tanabe S', 'Suzuki N', 'Kozasa T']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago 60612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['Alanine/genetics', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13/*metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Lysine/genetics/*physiology', 'Mutation', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors']",2004/07/20 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/07/20 05:00'],"['2004/07/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/20 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2004 Oct;66(4):1029-34. doi: 10.1124/mol.104.002287.

There are several distinct genetic subtypes, characterized by typical changes in gene expression pattern. In addition to cytogenetic markers, the in vivo response to treatment is an emerging prognostic marker for risk stratification. However, it has not yet been reported whether gene expression profiles can predict risk group stratification already at the time of diagnosis. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed bone marrow samples of 31 ALL patients to identify changes in gene expression that are associated with the current risk assignment, irrespective of the genetic subtype. Gene expression profiles were established using oligonucleotide microarrays. RESULTS: Considering all low- and high-risk patients, no gene was capable of predicting the risk assignment already at time of diagnosis. However, screening for risk group associated genes using more homogeneous subsets of patients revealed 10(6) discriminatory probe sets. The prognostic significance of these probe sets was subsequently determined for the entire series of patients. Using the selected subgroups as the training set and the remaining samples as an independent test set, logistic regression using 3 predictor variables could accurately predict current risk assignment for 10 out of 12 patients. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression profiles established from a cytogenetically heterogeneous study group are not, as yet, sufficiently accurate to be used prognostically in a clinical setting.

Results of the CETLAM AML-99 protocol.,791-800,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The benefits of high-dose cytarabine, anthracyclines and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are greater in younger rather than in older patients. We assessed the proportion of patients over 60 years with de novo AML who qualified for intensive therapy and determined the feasibility and results of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in first complete remission (CR). DESIGN AND METHODS: Induction therapy included idarubicin, cytarabine and etoposide. Patients who achieved CR received one cycle of mitoxantrone and cytarabine and ASCT as consolidation therapies. RESULTS: Over a 4-year period, 258 patients were registered of whom 135 (52%) were enrolled for intensive treatment. The CR rate was 61%, advanced age (p=0.033) and unfavorable cytogenetics (p=0.015) emerged as independent negative prognostic factors for CR. The 2-year overall survival (OS) was 23 % (CI 14%-30%) and was poorer in patients with unfavorable cytogenetics (p=0.035), age over 70 years (p=0.019) or leukocytosis (p=0.006). Only 27% of the potential candidates underwent ASCT. The probability of 2-year leukemia-free survival after consolidation was 39% (CI 6%-71%) for these patients and 22% (CI 6% - 39%) for candidate patients not undergoing ASCT (p=0.07). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Over 25% of the patients 60 to 70 years with de novo AML benefit from standard intensive treatment.

Zosuquidar trihydochloride (Z.3HCL) is a potent and selective inhibitor of P-gp which rapidly and effectively inhibits drug efflux. DESIGN AND METHODS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical effects of Z.3HCL and determine its influence on P-gp activity. Sixteen AML patients were entered into a phase 1 dose ranging clinical trial of Z.3HCL, co-administered intravenously with daunorubicin and cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C). Clinical outcomes, toxicity abd adverse events were assessed. P-gp function was analyzed by flow cytometry. In vitro cytotoxicity was studied using the MTT assay. RESULTS: Eleven patients achieved a complete remission and one a partial remission with a median survival of 559 (range 38-906) days. Non-hematologic grade 3 and 4 toxicities were seen in 4 patients. Z.3HCL infusion was associated with rapid inhibition of Rh123 efflux in CD56+ cells in 16/16 patients and in CD33+ cells from 6/10 patients. The median inhibition was 95% for CD56+ cells and 85.25% for CD33+ cells was significantly elevated in 6/16 patients. The median IC50, using a MTT assay for daunorubicin, decreased significantly between Z.3HCL modulated and unmodulated cells (n=11,153 and 247 ng/mL respectively, p=0.01).

This hypothesis was systematically tested by functionally analysing the early, intermediate and late events of the apoptotic process in primary AML (n = 31) blasts following activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of apoptosis (etoposide and cytarabine as DNA damaging agents, FAS-ligand as an activator of the death receptor pathway). Activation of the extrinsic pathway by FAS-ligand did not induce apoptosis in primary AML, instead the proapoptotic signal was shown to 'fade', even in the early phase of the apoptotic sequence. However, activation of the intrinsic pathway induced severe cytotoxicity in all samples that showed the characteristic features of typical apoptosis, with a prominent apoptotic volume decrease (blebbing) in the early phase, significant increases in caspase 3 activity (intermediate or effector phase) and breakdown of cellular energy production in the late phase of apoptosis. These characteristics did not differ between prognostically favourable versus unfavourable AML karyotypes or between clinically responding versus refractory AML--indicating that a functional apoptotic apparatus is present even in the unfavourable AML subgroups. Our data indicate that the mechanism for a broad clinical resistance is not a dysfunctional apparatus per se but rather the consequence of anti-apoptotic regulation impeding otherwise functional apoptotic machinery.","['Braess, Jan', 'Schneiderat, Peter', 'Schoch, Claudia', 'Fiegl, Michael', 'Lorenz, Isolde', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang']","['Braess J', 'Schneiderat P', 'Schoch C', 'Fiegl M', 'Lorenz I', 'Hiddemann W']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich, Germany. jan.braess@med3.med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Etoposide/*therapeutic use', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/07/20 05:00,2004/09/21 05:00,['2004/07/20 05:00'],"['2004/07/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/20 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Aug;126(3):338-47. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05039.x.,"['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05039.x [doi]', 'BJH5039 [pii]']",,,,,,['Copyright 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of the various cytogenetic subgroups was as follows: normal - 9%; t(11q23) - 22%; t(8;21) - 13%; t(15;17) - 8%; inv(16) - 3.4%; abn(3q) - 4.6%; 7/7q-(sole or main) - 5.8%; del(9q)(sole) and +21(sole) - 4.6% each; t(8;16) - 2.3%; t(6;9), t(1;22), +8(sole) - 1.1% each; and miscellaneous - 18%. The overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) (4 years) for 94 patients treated with the modified Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) AML protocols (non-irradiated) were 59.9% (SE = 5%) and 55.7% (SE = 5%), respectively, and for the favourable t(8;21), t(15;17) and inv(16), OS was 60% (SE = 15%), 83% (SE = 15%) and 100% respectively. For the normal group it was 62% (SE = 17%), miscellaneous 64% (SE = 12%), t(11q23) 44.6% (SE = 11%) and of the -7/7q-, del(9q)(sole) or t(6;9), none had survived at 4 years. The incidence of cytogenetic subgroups in the Israeli childhood AML population and their outcome were similar to other recently reported paediatric series. Cytogenetic abnormalities still carry clinical relevance for treatment stratification in the context of modern chemotherapy.","['Stark, Batia', 'Jeison, Marta', 'Gabay, Leticia Glazer', 'Mardoukh, Jacques', 'Luria, Drorit', 'Bar-Am, Irit', 'Avrahami, Gali', 'Kapeliushnik, Yossef', 'Sthoeger, Dalia', 'Herzel, Gavriel', 'Steinberg, David M', 'Cohen, Ian J', 'Goshen, Yacov', 'Stein, Jerry', 'Zaizov, Rina', 'Yaniv, Isaac']","['Stark B', 'Jeison M', 'Gabay LG', 'Mardoukh J', 'Luria D', 'Bar-Am I', 'Avrahami G', 'Kapeliushnik Y', 'Sthoeger D', 'Herzel G', 'Steinberg DM', 'Cohen IJ', 'Goshen Y', 'Stein J', 'Zaizov R', 'Yaniv I']","[""Centre of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Centre of Israel, Petah Tiqva, Israel. bstark@clalit.orgil""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Disorders/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Israel', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Metaphase', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/07/20 05:00,2004/09/21 05:00,['2004/07/20 05:00'],"['2004/07/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/20 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Aug;126(3):320-37. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05038.x.,"['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05038.x [doi]', 'BJH5038 [pii]']",,,,,,['Copyright 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunocytochemistry revealed that, in non-neoplastic haematopoiesis, the granulopoietic lineage as well as megakaryocytes showed membranous and cytoplasmic staining to various degrees along with unlabelled nuclei. Besides haematopoiesis, beta-catenin prominently marked bone marrow vascularity and diverse stroma cells. beta-Catenin gene was inversely expressed in AML and ALL with a lack of protein expression in neoplastic cells in ALL. In contrast, the other haematological disorders under study, except for Ph+ CML, did not show significant alterations of overall beta-catenin gene expression compared with normal bone marrow. These data suggest different regulatory mechanisms in the expression and function of beta-catenin in haematopoietic cells.","['Serinsoz, Ebru', 'Neusch, Michael', 'Busche, Guntram', 'Wasielewski, Reinhard', 'Kreipe, Hans', 'Bock, Oliver']","['Serinsoz E', 'Neusch M', 'Busche G', 'Wasielewski R', 'Kreipe H', 'Bock O']","['Institute of Pathology, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*chemistry', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulocytes/chemistry', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/chemistry', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Trans-Activators/analysis/*genetics', 'beta Catenin']",2004/07/20 05:00,2004/09/21 05:00,['2004/07/20 05:00'],"['2004/07/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/20 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Aug;126(3):313-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05049.x.,"['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05049.x [doi]', 'BJH5049 [pii]']",,,,,,['Copyright 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antitumor activity of NMs has been attributed to their ability to cross-link the twin strands of DNA. The resulting bifunctional lesions, if not repaired, can inhibit DNA replication and transcription, eventually leading to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and the inhibition of tumor growth. The predominant bifunctional DNA lesions of NM have been reported to involve the distal guanine bases in the opposite strands of 5'-GNC sequences. In the present work, the formation of guanine-adenine and adenine-adenine adducts of N,N-bis(2-chloroethyl)methylamine (mechlorethamine) in double-stranded DNA is demonstrated. Guanine-adenine cross-links of mechlorethamine were identified as N-(2-[N3-adenyl]ethyl)-N-(2-[N7-guanyl]ethyl)methylamine (N3A-N7G-EMA), N-(2-[N1-adenyl]ethyl)-N-(2-[N7-guanyl]ethyl)methylamine, and N-(2-[N(6)-adenyl]ethyl)-N-(2-[N7-guanyl]ethyl)methylamine. All three adducts were produced interstrand, while N3A-N7G-EMA was the dominant intrastrand G-A cross-link. The prevalent adenine-adenine mechlorethamine lesions have the structure of N,N-bis(2-[N3-adenyl]ethyl)methylamine (bis-N3A-EMA). DNA-derived lesions have the same HPLC retention times, UV spectra, and MS/MS fragmentation patterns as the authentic standards prepared independently. bis-N3A-EMA lesions were produced in a concentration-dependent manner in calf thymus DNA treated with increasing amounts of mechlorethamine. Furthermore, HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis was used to demonstrate the formation of analogous N3-N3 adenine lesions in DNA treated with aromatic nitrogen mustards, N,N-bis(2-chloroethyl)-p-aminophenylbutyric acid and L-phenylalanine mustard. The presence of cross-linked adenine-adenine lesions may explain the enhanced cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of NMs in cells deficient in N3-alkyladenine glycosylase.","['Balcome, Shawn', 'Park, Soobong', 'Quirk Dorr, Danae R', 'Hafner, Lucy', 'Phillips, Laura', 'Tretyakova, Natalia']","['Balcome S', 'Park S', 'Quirk Dorr DR', 'Hafner L', 'Phillips L', 'Tretyakova N']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Room 760E, Box 806 Mayo, 420 Delaware Street Southeast, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Adenine/*chemistry', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cattle', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'DNA/drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'Mechlorethamine/chemistry', 'Melphalan/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",2004/07/20 05:00,2004/10/16 09:00,['2004/07/20 05:00'],"['2004/07/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/20 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2004 Jul;17(7):950-62. doi: 10.1021/tx0499463.,['10.1021/tx0499463 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After another remission of 3 years, a pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which expressed CD10, CD19, CD22, CD79a, CD34 and terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase, developed and led to death. Molecular analysis of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene showed that the initial lymphoma and its relapse were clonally related. At leukemic relapse, 2 clones related to the initial and relapsed lymphoma clones were present. DLBC lymphomas arise from post-follicle center B cells, whereas ALL arises from pregerminal B cells. Therefore, a direct transformation of DLBC lymphoma to ALL appears unlikely. The overall features suggest instead separate lymphoma and leukemic evolution from a common mutated B-cell precursor rather than transformation of DLBC lymphoma to ALL.","['Au, W Y', 'Srivastava, G', 'Wong, K Y', 'Chung, L P', 'Ma, S K', 'Wan, T S', 'Kwong, Y L']","['Au WY', 'Srivastava G', 'Wong KY', 'Chung LP', 'Ma SK', 'Wan TS', 'Kwong YL']","['Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '135844-68-7 (RPL22 protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*pathology', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Ribosomal Proteins/analysis']",2004/07/17 05:00,2004/08/25 05:00,['2004/07/17 05:00'],"['2004/07/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/17 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2004 Jul;35(7):900-3. doi: 10.1016/j.humpath.2004.04.002.,"['S0046817704002199 [pii]', '10.1016/j.humpath.2004.04.002 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PCR analysis of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement was successfully performed in 81 out of the 106 DNA specimens extracted from formol-paraffin blocks. Out of the 81 samples with good-quality DNA, 18 gave a single or double discrete amplification band(s), which was reproducible only in four specimens. Sequencing finally proved monoclonal B-cell population of both pre- and postfollicular origin in all four samples (5%), one CML and three CMPD-NOS.

Early studies of experimental bone marrow transplantation revealed an important role for NK cells in the rejection of allogeneic grafts and contributed significantly to our understanding of NK cell behavior. Both animal models and in vitro studies have since implicated NK cells as contributors to the pathology of clinical transplantation.

In this study, we investigated the effects of yomogin on the cytotoxicity, induction of apoptosis, and putative pathways of its actions in human promyelocytic leukemia cells. Yomogin-treated HL-60 cells displayed several features of apoptosis, including DNA fragmentation, formation of DNA ladders in agarose gel electrophoresis, and externalization of annexin-V targeted phosphatidylserine residues. We observed that yomogin caused activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3. A general caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk), caspase-8 inhibitor (z-IETD-fmk) and caspase-3 inhibitor (z-DEVD-fmk), almost completely suppressed the yomogin-induced DNA fragmentation. We further demonstrated that yomogin induced Bid cleavage, mitochondrial translocation of Bax from the cytosol, and cytochrome c release from mitochondria in a caspase-8-dependent manner. Taken together, our data indicate that yomogin is a potent inducer of apoptosis and facilitates its activity via caspase-8 activation, Bid cleavage, Bax translocation to mitochondria, and subsequent release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm, providing a potential mechanism for the anticancer activity of yomogin.","['Jeong, Seoung-Hee', 'Koo, Sung-Ja', 'Ha, Joo-Hun', 'Ryu, Shi-Yong', 'Park, Hee-Juhn', 'Lee, Kyung-Tae']","['Jeong SH', 'Koo SJ', 'Ha JH', 'Ryu SY', 'Park HJ', 'Lee KT']","['College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Hoegi-dong, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes, Eudesmane)', '0 (yomogin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Artemisia', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Sesquiterpenes/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Sesquiterpenes, Eudesmane']",2004/07/17 05:00,2005/02/16 09:00,['2004/07/17 05:00'],"['2004/07/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/17 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2004 Jul;27(7):1106-11. doi: 10.1248/bpb.27.1106.,['10.1248/bpb.27.1106 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a previous report, we showed that dioscin was able to induce cytotoxicity and apoptosis in human myeloblast leukemia HL-60 cells. This study further investigated the action mechanisms underlying this effect. The activation of caspase-9 and -3, but not caspase-8, together with the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, demonstrated that the apoptotic signaling triggered by dioscin was mediated through the intrinsic mitochondria-dependent pathway. We also investigated its anti-proliferative effect on human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed that dioscin treatment induced the accumulation of cells in the G(2)/M phase. Cytomorphology with DAPI and Wright-Giemsa staining demonstrated the enlargement of cell volume and multinucleation in the treated cells. Subsequent apoptosis was delineated with phosphatidylserine externalization and DNA hypodiploidy. Trillin was one of the hydrolysates of dioscin. We demonstrated that it could induce multinucleation in HL-60, K562 and human promyelocytic leukemia NB(4) cells, suggesting its extensive mitotic-arresting effects. As the diosgenyl sapogenin, diosgenin was also shown to be able to induce multinucleation and apoptosis in K562 cells in a similar manner to dioscin. These findings suggest that diosgenyl saponins have the properties to induce mitotic arrest and apoptosis, suggesting that they may be a new kind of antimitotic agent.","['Liu, Ming-Jie', 'Wang, Zhao', 'Ju, Yong', 'Zhou, Jiang-bing', 'Wang, Yu', 'Wong, Ricky Ngok-Shun']","['Liu MJ', 'Wang Z', 'Ju Y', 'Zhou JB', 'Wang Y', 'Wong RN']","['Department of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, Tsinghua University.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Saponins)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mitosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Plant Extracts/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Saponins/isolation & purification/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2004/07/17 05:00,2005/02/16 09:00,['2004/07/17 05:00'],"['2004/07/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/17 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2004 Jul;27(7):1059-65. doi: 10.1248/bpb.27.1059.,['10.1248/bpb.27.1059 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients receiving RA alone invariably develop RA resistance. RA-resistant cells can serve as useful models for the development of treatments for both APL and other leukemias. Previously, we showed that RA and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) promote monocytic differentiation of the APL cell line NB4 and U937 monoblastic cells. Here, we report that combining TNF with RA leads to maturation of several RA-resistant APL cells along a monocytic pathway, whereas UF-1, a patient-derived RA-resistant cell line, showed characteristics of granulocytic differentiation. We found distinct differences in gene regulation between UF-1 cells and cells showing monocytic differentiation. Although IRF-7 was up-regulated by TNF and RA in all cells tested, expression of c-jun and PU.1 correlated with monocytic differentiation. Furthermore, synergistic induction of PU.1 DNA binding and macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (m-CSF-1R) mRNA was observed only in cells differentiating into monocytes. Using neutralizing antibodies against m-CSF-1R or its ligand, we found that inhibiting this pathway strongly reduced CD14 expression in response to RA and TNF, suggesting that this pathway is essential for their synergy in RA-resistant leukemia cells.","['Witcher, Michael', 'Shiu, Hoi Ying', 'Guo, Qi', 'Miller, Wilson H Jr']","['Witcher M', 'Shiu HY', 'Guo Q', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer B.

The GOELAL02 trial evaluated the impact of early allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) or delayed unpurged autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for patients who had no human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor or who were older than 50 years. Inclusion criteria included at least one of the following: age older than 35 years; non-T-ALL; leukocytosis greater than 30 x 10(9)/L; t(9;22), t(4;11), or t(1; 19); or failure to achieve complete remission (CR) after one induction course. Among 198 patients, the median age was 33 years. The CR rate was 80% with vincristine, idarubicine, L-asparaginase, and randomized intravenous injection or oral steroids (P = nonsignificant [ns]). AlloBMT was performed after 2 consolidation courses while ASCT was delayed after 1 additional reinduction. Intensified conditioning regimen before transplantation included etoposide, cyclophosphamide, and total body irradiation (TBI). Median follow-up was 5.1 years. The median overall survival (OS) was 29 months, with a 6-year OS of 41%.

Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, STI571), a Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor, selectively inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis of CML cells. Despite the success of imatinib mesylate in the treatment of CML, resistance is observed, particularly in advanced disease. The most common imatinib mesylate resistance mechanism involves Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutations that impart varying degrees of drug insensitivity. AP23464, a potent adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-based inhibitor of Src and Abl kinases, displays antiproliferative activity against a human CML cell line and Bcr-Abl-transduced Ba/F3 cells (IC(50) = 14 nM; imatinib mesylate IC(50) = 350 nM). AP23464 ablates Bcr-Abl tyrosine phosphorylation, blocks cell cycle progression, and promotes apoptosis of Bcr-Abl-expressing cells. Biochemical assays with purified glutathione S transferase (GST)-Abl kinase domain confirmed that AP23464 directly inhibits Abl activity. Importantly, the low nanomolar cellular and biochemical inhibitory properties of AP23464 extend to frequently observed imatinib mesylate-resistant Bcr-Abl mutants, including nucleotide binding P-loop mutants Q252H, Y253F, E255K, C-terminal loop mutant M351T, and activation loop mutant H396P. AP23464 was ineffective against mutant T315I, an imatinib mesylate contact residue. The potency of AP23464 against imatinib mesylate-refractory Bcr-Abl and its distinct binding mode relative to imatinib mesylate warrant further investigation of AP23464 for the treatment of CML.","[""O'Hare, Thomas"", 'Pollock, Roy', 'Stoffregen, Eric P', 'Keats, Jeffrey A', 'Abdullah, Omar M', 'Moseson, Erika M', 'Rivera, Victor M', 'Tang, Hao', 'Metcalf, Chester A 3rd', 'Bohacek, Regine S', 'Wang, Yihan', 'Sundaramoorthi, Raji', 'Shakespeare, William C', 'Dalgarno, David', 'Clackson, Tim', 'Sawyer, Tomi K', 'Deininger, Michael W', 'Druker, Brian J']","[""O'Hare T"", 'Pollock R', 'Stoffregen EP', 'Keats JA', 'Abdullah OM', 'Moseson EM', 'Rivera VM', 'Tang H', 'Metcalf CA 3rd', 'Bohacek RS', 'Wang Y', 'Sundaramoorthi R', 'Shakespeare WC', 'Dalgarno D', 'Clackson T', 'Sawyer TK', 'Deininger MW', 'Druker BJ']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, L592, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, Portland, OR 97239, USA. oharet@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AP23464)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PD 173955)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Amino Acids/genetics/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Milk Proteins/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Piperazines/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Pyridones/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry/pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",2004/07/17 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/07/17 05:00'],"['2004/07/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/17 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Oct 15;104(8):2532-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-05-1851.

We tested the sensitivity of 8 activation loop mutations to the small molecule FLT3 inhibitor, MLN518. Each FLT3 activation loop mutant, including D835Y, D835A, D835E, D835H, D835N, D835V, D835del, and I836del, transformed Ba/F3 cells to factor-independent proliferation and had constitutive tyrosine kinase activation, as assessed by FLT3 autophosphorylation and activation of downstream effectors, including STAT5 and ERK. MLN518 inhibited FLT3 autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of STAT5 and ERK in FLT3-ITD-transformed Ba/F3 cells with an IC(50) (50% inhibition of cell viability) of approximately 500 nM. However, there was a broad spectrum of sensitivity among the 8 activation loop mutants, with IC(50) ranging from approximately 500 nM to more than 10 microM for the inhibition of phosphorylation of FLT3, STAT5, and ERK. The relative sensitivity of the mutants to MLN518 in biochemical assays correlated with the cellular IC(50) for cytokine-independent proliferation of FLT3-transformed Ba/F3 cells in the presence of MLN518. Thus, certain activation loop mutations in FLT3 simultaneously confer resistance to small molecule inhibitors. These findings have implications for the evaluation of responses in clinical trials with FLT3 inhibitors and provide a strategy to screen for compounds that can overcome resistance.","['Clark, Jennifer J', 'Cools, Jan', 'Curley, David P', 'Yu, Jin-Chen', 'Lokker, Nathalie A', 'Giese, Neill A', 'Gilliland, D Gary']","['Clark JJ', 'Cools J', 'Curley DP', 'Yu JC', 'Lokker NA', 'Giese NA', 'Gilliland DG']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

Therefore, models which incorporate sparsity in terms of variables (genes) are desirable for this kind of problem. This paper proposes a two-level hierarchical Bayesian model for variable selection which assumes a prior that favors sparseness. We adopt a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based computation technique to simulate the parameters from the posteriors. The method is applied to leukemia data from a previous study and a published dataset on breast cancer.

METHODS: The blood distribution and protein binding of imatinib and CGP74588 were determined in vitro using (14)C labelled compounds. RESULTS: The mean fraction of imatinib in plasma (f(p)) was 45% in dog, 50% in mouse, 65% in rat, 70% in healthy humans and up to 92% in acute lymphatic leukaemia (AML) patients. Similarly, f(p) for CGP74588 was low in dog and monkey (30%), higher in rat, mouse and humans (70%) and highest in some AML patients (90%). The unbound fraction of imatinib and CGP74588 in plasma was lower in rat, mouse, healthy humans and AML patients (2.3-6.5% at concentrations < or = 5000 ng ml(-1)) compared to monkey and dog (7.6-19%). Both compounds displayed high binding to human alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein. AML patients had a reduced haematocrit and showed greatest variability in their blood binding parameters. CONCLUSION: Imatinib and CGP74588 displayed very similar blood binding parameters within all species/groups investigated. The five species clustered into two distinct groups with rat, mouse and humans being clearly different from dog and monkey.

All the employees in this industry were followed-up in several registers. The risk of disease was analyzed in relation to occupational exposure to EMF, latency, and duration of employment. A specific job-exposure matrix was developed and validated by comparison with direct measurements of EMF during a workday. Linkage with the Danish Cancer Register did not identify increased risks for the cancers suggested a priori to be associated with exposure to EMF, including leukemia, brain tumors, and breast cancer. Significantly increased risks for lung cancer and mesothelioma were identified for workers highly exposed to asbestos. Linkage with the National Mortality Register revealed a significantly increased overall mortality rate from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), with an increasing trend with duration of employment and EMF exposure. In addition, a significantly increased mortality rate from electric accidents was observed. It was hypothesized that the observation of increased mortality from ALS was associated with exposure to EMF or electric shocks. No increased mortality rate from cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease was observed. Linkage with the National Hospital Register also revealed an increased risk of ALS and, thereby confirmed the finding of an increased mortality rate for this disease in the previous study. Linkage of the cohort with the Multiple Sclerosis Register revealed an increased risk of multiple sclerosis, which was not, however, significant. Linkage with the Pacemaker Register showed no increased risk of severe arrhythmia-related heart disease. The second part of the study included the establishment of a large, nationwide cohort of mobile phone subscribers comprising some 420 000 persons. No increased risk was observed for the cancers considered a priori to be possibly associated with the radiofrequency fields emitted by mobile phones, which were brain tumors, including acoustic neuroma, salivary gland tumors, and leukemia. The data were analyzed by duration of phone use, latency, system used (NMT, GSM or both) and age at first subscription. A study of the incidence of ocular malignant melanoma in comparison with the annual increase among the mobile phone subscribers showed a highly stable incidence rate for this rare cancer in Denmark over close to 50 years of registration. On the basis of these studies and the scientific literature, it is concluded that occupational exposure to 50-Hz EMF is not associated with an increased risk of cancer, but that these fields, electric shocks, or some other unknown factor related to alternating current electricity may be associated with the risk of ALS. There is no clear evidence that 50-Hz EMF is associated with other neurodegenerative or cardiovascular diseases. At present, there is little, if any, evidence that the use of mobile phones is associated with cancer in adults, including brain tumors, acoustic neuroma, cancer of the salivary glands, leukemia, or malignant melanoma of the eye.","['Johansen, Christoffer']",['Johansen C'],"['Department of Psychosocial Cancer Research, Institute of Cancer Epidemiology, The Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen, Denmark. christof@cancer.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Finland,Scand J Work Environ Health,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",7511540,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Arrhythmias, Cardiac/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries/epidemiology']",2004/07/17 05:00,2004/10/07 09:00,['2004/07/17 05:00'],"['2004/07/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/17 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Scand J Work Environ Health. 2004;30 Suppl 1:1-30.,['792 [pii]'],,,116,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These strains were characterized by a high frequency of high-level resistance to gentamicin (40.8%). Resistance to amoxicillin concerns 40% of E. faecium strains. Seventeen multiresistant strains of E. faecium isolated from 7 patients (colonized during a long period and receiving a gut decontamination treatment) were the subject of a phenotypic analysis (biotyping, antibiotyping and determination of MICs to beta-lactam, aminoglycosides and glycopeptides). This analysis showed that these strains are distinguishable, endogenic and specific for each patient, the common multiresistance trait resulted from the selective pressure of decontamination treatment used for our patient.","['Abbassi, M S', 'Achour, W', 'Ben Hassen, A']","['Abbassi MS', 'Achour W', 'Ben Hassen A']","['Laboratoire du Centre national de greffe de moelle osseuse (UR99-08/14), Rue Djebel Lakhdar, Bab Saadoun, 1006, Tunis, Tunisie.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Bull Soc Pathol Exot,Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique (1990),9212564,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Colony Count, Microbial', 'DNA, Bacterial/analysis/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', '*Enterococcus/classification/genetics/immunology', 'Feces/microbiology', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/drug therapy/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests/methods', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Phenotype', 'Population Surveillance', 'Serotyping', 'Time Factors', 'Tunisia/epidemiology', 'Urban Health/statistics & numerical data']",2004/07/17 05:00,2004/08/21 05:00,['2004/07/17 05:00'],"['2004/07/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/17 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bull Soc Pathol Exot. 2004 May;97(2):91-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Caracteristiques des souches d'enterocoques isolees chez des patients neutropeniques au centre national de greffe de moelle osseuse de Tunis.,,,,,,,

Graft purging involves either in vivo or ex vivo HPC manipulation in order to reduce the level of tumor cell contamination. Some phase II trials suggest that patients who receive purged products may have a superior transplant outcome. Phase I trials demonstrate the feasibility of purging methods including ex vivo graft incubation with chemotherapeutic drugs, monoclonal antibodies and complement, and CD34+ cell selection. A phase II trial in follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma demonstrates that patients who receive HPC products purged negative for bcl-2 gene rearrangements have a superior outcome, compared with patients who receive polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive products. This finding, however, has not been confirmed in a randomized trial. HPC purging has demonstrated no benefit in a phase III trial in myeloma. Phase II trials in acute myelogenous leukemia show comparable outcomes for patients who receive either purged or unpurged HPC grafts. Limitations of purging include possible progenitor cell loss, delayed engraftment, and qualitative immune defects following transplant. Data to justify routine use of HPC graft purging are insufficient. Phase I and II data support development of phase III trials of both in vivo and in vitro purging methods.","['Alvarnas, Joseph C', 'Forman, Stephen J']","['Alvarnas JC', 'Forman SJ']","['City of Hope--Samaritan Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center, Phoenix, AZ 85006, USA. joseph.alvarnas@bannerhealth.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncology (Williston Park),"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",8712059,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Genetic Markers)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2004/07/17 05:00,2004/09/24 05:00,['2004/07/17 05:00'],"['2004/07/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/17 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,"Oncology (Williston Park). 2004 Jun;18(7):867-76; discussion 876-8, 881, 884.",['163496 [pii]'],,,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, about 20% to 25% of patients who were relatively young and had suitable HLA-matched donors have in recent years been offered treatment by allogeneic stem cell transplantation, a procedure that can cure CML but is associated with an appreciable risk of morbidity and mortality. However, following the recognition in the 1980s that the p210 oncoprotein encoded by the BCR-ABL fusion gene on the Philadelphia chromosome had greatly enhanced tyrosine kinase activity and was probably the initiating event in the chronic phase of CML, much effort was directed toward development of drugs that would selectively inhibit this kinase activity. In 1998 these efforts culminated in the first clinical use of imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), which has since been shown to produce impressive results in treatment of patients with CML in chronic phase. In previously untreated patients, the incidence of complete cytogenetic responses exceeds 80%, and the majority of responses appear thus far to be durable. Imatinib also proved active in patients with accelerated phase and blastic phase disease, but in most of these cases, the benefits have been relatively short-lived. The advent of imatinib has thus necessitated a fundamental reappraisal of the approach to the initial management of CML.","['Mughal, Tariq I', 'Goldman, John M']","['Mughal TI', 'Goldman JM']","['Department of Haematology, Hammersmith Hospital at the Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom. tmughal@freenet.co.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncology (Williston Park),"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",8712059,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Patient Selection', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Stem Cell Transplantation']",2004/07/17 05:00,2004/09/24 05:00,['2004/07/17 05:00'],"['2004/07/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/17 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,"Oncology (Williston Park). 2004 Jun;18(7):837-44, 847; discussion 847-50, 853-4.",['163706 [pii]'],,,94,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because oral etoposide has been found to be highly effective in patients with relapsed medulloblastoma and neuroblastoma who had previously received intravenous etoposide, we investigated its use for intraocular retinoblastoma. PROCEDURE: A pilot trial of oral etoposide (50 mg/m2/ day for 21 days) in five children (6 eyes) with relapsed refractory intraocular retinoblastoma was performed. All had previously received chemotherapy, including intravenous etoposide in four patients, and all had received radiation therapy. Three patients (3 eyes) had vitreous seeds. Response was evaluated after one cycle. RESULTS: No serious acute toxicity was encountered, and no responses were noted. Four patients (5 eyes) had progressive disease. Stable disease was noted in one eye without vitreous disease. One patient developed secondary acute myeloid leukemia 30 months after exposure to oral etoposide. CONCLUSIONS: Oral etoposide was not an effective agent in this population. The role of etoposide in the treatment of higher risk intraocular retinoblastoma deserves further study.","['Dunkel, Ira J', 'Chantada, Guillermo L', 'Fandino, Adriana C', 'Abramson, David H']","['Dunkel IJ', 'Chantada GL', 'Fandino AC', 'Abramson DH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ophthalmic Genet,Ophthalmic genetics,9436057,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage', 'Child, Preschool', 'Etoposide/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Retinal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Retinoblastoma/*drug therapy/physiopathology']",2004/07/17 05:00,2004/08/04 05:00,['2004/07/17 05:00'],"['2004/07/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/17 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ophthalmic Genet. 2004 Mar;25(1):25-9. doi: 10.1076/opge.25.1.25.29003.,['10.1076/opge.25.1.25.29003 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM) responses have been associated with more favorable outcomes; all current children's cancer group (CCG) protocols for ALL require BM evaluation at days 7 and 14 with subsequent therapy based on the results. Morphologic interpretation of aspirate smears during induction chemotherapy is challenging, as the samples are often hypocellular, excessively friable, and cytologically altered by drugs. We have shown discordancy of day 7 and 14 BM lymphoblast counts using morphologic and flow cytometric immunophenotypic analyses (FC). The aim of our study was to determine the utility, reliability, and cost effectiveness of lymphoblast enumeration using DNA content analysis by flow cytometry (DNA-FC) and to further demonstrate the subjectivity of morphologic review. All new cases of ALL had DNA-FC and FC analyses. The percentage of lymphoblasts as determined by both methods was compared for 82 aneuploid cases. Three pathologists independently reviewed aspirate smears from 39 bone marrow samples of aneuploid ALL that were obtained during early induction. These results were compared among themselves and with the results obtained by DNA-FC. We found excellent correlation between the percentage of lymphoblasts as determined by DNA-FC and FC (R2 = 0.97) over a range of 0 to 99%. Pathologic review agreed with the DNA-FC, on average, 68%. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of morphologic review, averaged 53, 84, 78, and 63%, respectively, when using DNA-FC as the ""gold standard."" All three pathologists achieved agreement of lymphoblast percentage by morphology in 72%. In our laboratory, the use of DNA-FC equates to one-sixth the time and one-half the price of FC per exam. We have shown a strong correlation between blast counts determined by DNA-FC and FC. DNA-FC is an objective, economical, and reliable method to assess early response in induction marrows from aneuploid ALL where morphology is often uninterpretable. This test is highly reproducible and available at most pediatric institutions. Prospective studies need to be employed to evaluate the effect of more definitive methods (DNA-FC and FC) of assessing the early response in bone marrows on prognosis.","['Finn, Laura S', 'Hawkins, Douglas S', 'Rutledge, Joe C', 'Patterson, Kathleen']","['Finn LS', 'Hawkins DS', 'Rutledge JC', 'Patterson K']","[""Department of Laboratories, Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA. laura.finn@seattlechildrens.org""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Dev Pathol,Pediatric and developmental pathology : the official journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology and the Paediatric Pathology Society,9809673,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['*Aneuploidy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Child', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', '*Flow Cytometry/standards', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",2004/07/17 05:00,2004/11/04 09:00,['2004/07/17 05:00'],"['2004/07/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/17 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Dev Pathol. 2004 Jan-Feb;7(1):39-47. doi: 10.1007/s10024-003-2017-x.,['10.1007/s10024-003-2017-x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We proved, using flow cytometric detection of the CD66b surface molecule, a synergistic effect of CA: at day 10, 18.3% of CD66b-positive cells were detected after treatment with ATRA only, and 33% when CA and ATRA were combined together. NBT-assay confirmed that this additive effect of CA on ATRA-induced differentiation. Proliferating activity as assessed by MTT-assay was generally not affected by CA at given concentrations. However, cell proliferation was significantly reduced by 52 micro M CA at 96-h intervals. This effect was markedly enhanced when CA, at both concentrations, and ATRA were combined.

However, we have previously found that the growth of a myeloid leukemia cell line, OCI/AML-6, was suppressed by Notch activation induced by stimulation with a recombinant Notch ligand, Delta-1 protein. We recently found that the growth of another leukemia cell line, THP-1, was also suppressed by the ligands Delta-1 and Jagged-1. In this study, we tried to clarify the cellular and molecular mechanism of the growth suppression induced by Notch activation. Flow cytometric analysis showed that Delta-1 stimulation increased the expression of differentiation markers such as CD11b and CD13 while it decreased the expression of CD117 (c-KIT), a marker for primitive cells in THP-1 cells. In OCI/AML-6 cells, Delta-1 stimulation decreased the expression of CD11b and CD14 and increased CD34 expression. Namely, Delta-1 showed the opposite effects on the differentiation markers of each cell line. Delta-1 stimulation did not increase the binding of annexin V, a marker for apoptotic cells in either cell line. Since the growth of myeloid cells is regulated by MAP kinase and JAK/STAT pathways, we investigated the effects of the ligand stimulation on these pathways. Delta-1 stimulation did not induce the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and STAT3 proteins in either cell line. Pre-exposure to Delta-1 did not affect the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and STAT3 induced by G-CSF in OCI/AML-6 cells, either. Namely, it is thought that these pathways are not involved in the growth suppression caused by Notch ligands. Our study revealed several findings on Notch function.

After IL-2 withdrawal, these cells were arrested in the G1 phase and then underwent apoptosis. p27Kip1 was observed to act as a cell cycle inhibitor. A decrease in the amount of Bcl-xL was more distinct than that of Bcl-2, while Bax increased slightly during IL-2 withdrawal. The activation of caspase-3 and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential were also observed. An overexpression of Bcl-xL protein in the KK1, one of the ATL cell lines, suppressed apoptosis by the 3rd day, however, apoptosis could not be prevented completely. Thereafter, a decrease in Bcl-xL and an activation of caspase-3 were observed even under the overexpression of Bcl-xL.

We now investigated the action of three novel amphiphilic dimers with different structures in various 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) sensitive and resistant human colon tumor cell lines (CCL228, CCL227, 5-FU resistant CCL227 and HT-29) as well as in L1210 murine leukemia cells. Activity of the heterodimers was determined by clonogenic and growth inhibition assays including the induction of programmed cell death. In addition, the in vivo effects were tested in L1210 leukemia bearing mice. We show that these compounds inhibited the number of colonies of 5-FU sensitive and resistant human colon tumor cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 0.65 to 1 nM. The investigated dimers induced dose-dependent apoptosis in HT-29 colon tumor cells as well as in L1210 leukemia cells. No significant difference in the cytotoxicity of these agents could be observed between 5-FU sensitive and resistant cells, indicating that these compounds might be used in the treatment of 5-FU resistant tumors. In L1210 leukemia bearing mice the survival of tumor-bearing animals was significantly increased in comparison with untreated control animals. We therefore conclude that these new heterodinucleoside phosphates of 5-FdUrd and Ara-C might be an additional option for the treatment of sensitive and 5-FU resistant colon cancer and hematological malignancies.","['Saiko, Philipp', 'Horvath, Zsuzsanna', 'Bauer, Wolfgang', 'Hoechtl, Thomas', 'Grusch, Michael', 'Krupitza, Georg', 'Rauko, Peter', 'Mader, Robert M', 'Jaeger, Walter', 'Schott, Herbert', 'Novotny, Ladislav', 'Fritzer-Szekeres, Monika', 'Szekeres, Thomas']","['Saiko P', 'Horvath Z', 'Bauer W', 'Hoechtl T', 'Grusch M', 'Krupitza G', 'Rauko P', 'Mader RM', 'Jaeger W', 'Schott H', 'Novotny L', 'Fritzer-Szekeres M', 'Szekeres T']","['Clinical Institute of Med. and Chem.

In contrast, when cultured in vitro, B-CLL tumour cells rapidly undergo apoptosis. There is mounting evidence that P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) family transporter, plays a significant role in the regulation of apoptosis induced by various stimuli. Since P-gp is commonly expressed in B-CLL cells, we aimed to establish whether its expression level influences resistance to spontaneous apoptosis in B-CLL. For that purpose, P-gp expression by UIC2 antibody staining and P-gp activity by rhodamine 123 (Rh123) efflux in presence or absence of P-gp inhibitor verapamil were studied in peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from 43 previously untreated B-CLL patients. Simultaneously, the percentage of cells undergoing spontaneous in vitro apoptosis (apoptotic index, AI) by means of activation of caspases and annexin-V-based assays was evaluated. The AI were higher in B-CLL cells than in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (medians of AI 27.7% vs 3.9%, p=0.0001 and 34.7% vs 7.4%, p=0.0038, in 24 and 48-hour culture respectively). The AI were also higher among female patients as compared to male patients (medians: 29.7 vs 19.2 p=0.048). Interestingly, we found moderate inverse correlation between P-gp protein expression and AI after 24-hour culture in analysed B-CLL samples (r= -0.36, p=0.019). Moreover, P-gp positive B-CLL samples expressed significantly higher AI than P-gp negative samples with an arbitrary cut-off at Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics D-value 0.2 (medians of AI 18.4% vs 29.7%, p=0.026). Based on these results we suggest that P-gp expression has some protective effect on B-CLL cell survival in vitro. The difference in the rates of spontaneous apoptosis among male and female patients may contribute to gender-dependent variations in clinical outcome in B-CLL.","['Jamroziak, K', 'Smolewski, P', 'Cebula, B', 'Szmigielska-Kaplon, A', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z', 'Robak, T']","['Jamroziak K', 'Smolewski P', 'Cebula B', 'Szmigielska-Kaplon A', 'Darzynkiewicz Z', 'Robak T']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, 93-513, Poland. krzysztof.jamroziak@wp.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*biosynthesis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sex Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/07/16 05:00,2004/09/24 05:00,['2004/07/16 05:00'],"['2004/07/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/16 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neoplasma. 2004;51(3):181-7.,,,"['R01 CA028704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA028704-26/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The apoptotic effect of CAM was reversible in the cells studied. The induction of apoptosis influenced the expression of apoptosis and cell cycle regulators as detected by cDNA arrays, RT-PCR or Western blotting. According to cDNA arrays e.g. bax, bfl1, bak, pRb2, c-jun, jun-B were upregulated, and cdk4, cyclin B1, wee1, CRAF1, DP1 were downregulated. A number of other regulators like p21 and cdc25A, as well as some other genes linked with apoptosis, as p53 and the bcl-2 family, were up- or down-regulated as determined by real-time PCR.

In one manifestation of this regulation, the mRNA levels of several cyclin genes oscillate during the cycle in mammalian cells.

Here we used a new, minimally-disturbing method for producing multi-cycle synchronous growth of human MOLT-4 cells, in combination with quantitative real-time RT-PCR, to compare cell cycle-dependent transcript levels and half-lives of cyclin A2, B1, D3, E and PCNA mRNAs. While all mRNA levels except cyclin D3 varied in the cycle, there were no apparent variations in message half-lives. This differs from several previous reports of dramatic fluctuations in the stabilities of cyclin mRNAs, and infers that fluctuations in cyclin mRNA transcript levels during the MOLT-4 cell cycle are not due to variations in half-lives.

Unexpectedly, B cell precursor leukemia cells harboring a BCR-ABL1 gene rearrangement do not depend on antigen receptor mediated survival signals. Genes involved in the signaling cascade of the antigen receptor are silenced and in most cases, the dominant tumor clone does not carry a functional IGH gene rearrangement. However, upon inhibition of the BCR-ABL1 kinase activity by STI571, only leukemia cells expressing an antigen receptor are able to survive. Since resistance to STI571 is frequent in the therapy of BCR-ABL1(+) B cell precursor leukemia, antigen receptor signaling may represent a mechanism through which these cells can temporarily evade STI571-induced apoptosis. This may open a time frame, during which leukemia cells acquire secondary transforming events that confer definitive resistance to STI571.","['Klein, Florian', 'Feldhahn, Niklas', 'Muschen, Markus']","['Klein F', 'Feldhahn N', 'Muschen M']","['Laboratory for Molecular Stem Cell Biology, Institute for Transplantation Diagnostics and Cell Therapeutics, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*enzymology/genetics', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",2004/07/16 05:00,2006/04/15 09:00,['2004/07/16 05:00'],"['2004/07/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/16 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2004 Jul;3(7):858-60.

GATA-2 is a transcription factor expressed in early progenitor cells and implicated in the control of the fate of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells. We have investigated the possibility that the GATA and nuclear hormone receptor pathways are functionally linked through direct protein-protein interaction. Here we demonstrate that in human myeloid KG1 cells, RA receptor alpha (RARalpha), the major RAR expressed in hematopoietic cells, associates with GATA-2. This association is mediated by the zinc fingers of GATA-2 and the DNA-binding domain of RARalpha. As a consequence of this interaction, RARalpha is tethered to the DNA sites that are recognized and bound by GATA-2, and the transcriptional activity of GATA-2 becomes RA responsive. The RA responsiveness of GATA-dependent transcription is eliminated by expression of either a dominant negative form of RARalpha or a GATA-2 mutant that fails to interact with RARalpha. Overexpression of RXRalpha inhibits RARalpha binding to the GATA-2-DNA complex, thus resulting in attenuation of the effects of RARalpha on GATA-2 activity. In addition, inhibition by RA of GATA-2-dependent hematopoietic colony formation in an embryonic stem cell model of hematopoietic differentiation provided biological evidence for functional cross talk between RA and GATA-2-dependent pathways.","['Tsuzuki, Shinobu', 'Kitajima, Kenji', 'Nakano, Toru', 'Glasow, Annegret', 'Zelent, Arthur', 'Enver, Tariq']","['Tsuzuki S', 'Kitajima K', 'Nakano T', 'Glasow A', 'Zelent A', 'Enver T']","['Section of Gene Function and Regulation, Institute of Cancer Research, London SW3 6JB, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'Mutation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",2004/07/16 05:00,2004/08/18 05:00,['2004/07/16 05:00'],"['2004/07/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/16 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2004 Aug;24(15):6824-36. doi: 10.1128/MCB.24.15.6824-6836.2004.,"['10.1128/MCB.24.15.6824-6836.2004 [doi]', '24/15/6824 [pii]']",,,,PMC444844,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TR1.3 rapidly induces thrombotic events in brain microvessels and causes cell-specific syncytium formation of brain capillary endothelial cells (BCEC). A single amino acid substitution, W102G, in the MLV envelope protein (Env) regulates the pathogenic effects. The role of Env in determining this disease phenotype compared to the induction of spongiform encephalomyelitis with a longer latency, as seen in several other MLV and in human retroviruses, was determined by studying in vitro-attenuated TR1.3. Virus cloned from this selection, termed TRM, induced progressive neurological disease characterized by ataxia and paralysis and the appearance of spongiform neurodegeneration throughout the brain stem and spinal cord. This disease was associated with virus replication in both BCEC and highly ramified glial cells. TRM did not induce syncytium formation, either in vivo or in vitro. Sequence and mutational analyses demonstrated that TRM contained a reversion of Env G102W but that neurological disease mapped to the single amino acid substitution Env S159P.

We investigated whether cell surface expression of a chimeric protein containing the cytoplasmic domain of the TM protein (CTM) of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) was regulated by two membrane-proximal dileucine motifs or by tyrosine Y487 or Y498 in YXXL motifs. A chimeric protein composed of the extracellular and membrane-spanning portions of human CD8-alpha plus a wild-type (wt) BLV CTM was detectable on the surface of only 40% of the cells in which it was transiently expressed. Replacement of either dileucine pair with alanines increased the level of surface display of chimeric proteins. Nearly all cells became surface positive when both dileucine motifs were altered simultaneously and when either an N-terminal segment containing both dileucine motifs or a C-terminal segment containing all YXXL motifs was deleted. In contrast, replacement of Y487 or Y498 with alanine or phenylalanine enabled only small increases in surface display compared with wt levels. Chimeric proteins had similar stabilities but were downmodulated from the cell surface at three different rates. Point mutants segregated into each of the three groups of proteins categorized according to these different rates. Interestingly, Y487 mutants were downmodulated less efficiently than Y498 mutants, which behaved like wt. CD8-CTM chimeric proteins were phosphorylated on serine residues, but the native BLV Env protein was not phosphorylated either in transfected cells or in a lymphoid cell line constitutively producing BLV. Thus, both dileucine and YXXL motifs within the BLV CTM contribute to downmodulation of a protein containing this domain. Interactions with other proteins may influence surface exposure of Env protein complexes in virus-infected cells, assisting in viral evasion of adaptive immunity.","['Novakovic, Sinisa', 'Sawai, Earl T', 'Radke, Kathryn']","['Novakovic S', 'Sawai ET', 'Radke K']","['Department of Animal Science, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA 95616-8521, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Membrane/*chemistry', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*chemistry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/analysis/*chemistry']",2004/07/16 05:00,2004/08/07 05:00,['2004/07/16 05:00'],"['2004/07/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/07 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/16 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Aug;78(15):8301-11. doi: 10.1128/JVI.78.15.8301-8311.2004.,"['10.1128/JVI.78.15.8301-8311.2004 [doi]', '78/15/8301 [pii]']",,"['R01 AI046145/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI46145/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA46374/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC446140,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the antiretroviral function of a murine homologue of APOBEC3G (muAPOBEC3G) on several retrovirus systems with different producer cells. MuAPOBEC3G did not suppress the infectivity of murine retroviral vectors produced from human or murine cells, whereas it showed antiviral activity on both wild-type and Deltavif virions of HIV-1 in human cells. In contrast, huAPOBEC3G showed broad antiviral activity on HIV-1 and murine retroviral vectors produced from human cells as well as murine cells. These data suggested that muAPOBEC3G does not possess antiretroviral activity on murine retroviruses and has a different target specificity from that of huAPOBEC3G and that huAPOBEC3G works as a broad antiviral factor not only in human cells but also in murine cells. A functional interaction study between human and murine APOBEC3G supported the former hypothesis. Furthermore, studies on the expression of APOBEC3G in producer cells and its incorporation into virions revealed that muAPOBEC3G is incorporated into HIV-1 virions but not into MLV virions. Thus, muAPOBEC3G cannot suppress the infectivity of murine retrovirus because it is not incorporated into virions.

We analyzed factors affecting clinical outcome of ALL patients receiving a related or unrelated stem-cell graft from matched donors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The total study population was 264 adult patients receiving a myeloablative allogeneic stem-cell transplant for ALL at nine bone marrow transplantation centers between 1990 and 2002. Of these, 221 patients receiving a matched related or unrelated graft were analyzed. One hundred forty-eight patients received transplantation in complete remission; 62 patients were in relapse; and 11 patients were refractory to chemotherapy before transplant. Fifty percent of patients received bone marrow, and 50% received peripheral blood stem cell from a human leukocyte antigen-identical related (n = 103), or matched unrelated (n = 118) donor. RESULTS: Disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 years was 28%, with 76 patients (34%) still alive (2.2 to 103 months post-transplantation), and 145 deceased (65 relapses, transplant-related mortality, 45%). We observed an advantage regarding DFS in favor of patients receiving transplantation during their first complete remission (CR) in comparison with patients receiving transplantation in or after second CR (P =.014) or who relapsed (P <.001). We observed a clear trend toward improved survival in favor of B-lineage ALL patients compared with T-lineage ALL patients (P =.052), and Philadelphia chromosome-positive patients had no poorer outcome than Philadelphia chromosome-negative patients. Total-body irradiation-based conditioning improved DFS in comparison with busulfan (P =.041). CONCLUSION: Myeloablative matched related or matched unrelated allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation in ALL patients should be performed in first CR.","['Kiehl, Michael G', 'Kraut, Ludwig', 'Schwerdtfeger, Rainer', 'Hertenstein, Bernd', 'Remberger, Mats', 'Kroeger, Nicolaus', 'Stelljes, Mathias', 'Bornhaeuser, Martin', 'Martin, Hans', 'Scheid, Christoph', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Zander, Axel R', 'Kienast, Joachim', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Diehl, Volker', 'Fauser, Axel A', 'Ringden, Olle']","['Kiehl MG', 'Kraut L', 'Schwerdtfeger R', 'Hertenstein B', 'Remberger M', 'Kroeger N', 'Stelljes M', 'Bornhaeuser M', 'Martin H', 'Scheid C', 'Ganser A', 'Zander AR', 'Kienast J', 'Ehninger G', 'Hoelzer D', 'Diehl V', 'Fauser AA', 'Ringden O']","['Clinic for Bone Marrow Transplantation and Hematology/Oncology, Dr-Ottmar-Kohler-Strasse 2, 55743 Idar-Oberstein, Germany. mkiehl@bmt-center-io.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Family', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/07/16 05:00,2004/09/04 05:00,['2004/07/16 05:00'],"['2004/07/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/16 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2004 Jul 15;22(14):2816-25. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2004.07.130.,"['10.1200/JCO.2004.07.130 [doi]', '22/14/2816 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NB4 cells, derived from human acute promyelocytic leukemia, display this genotype and phenotype. All trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) induces differentiation of NB4 cell cultures in vitro and APL in vivo, although resistance to differentiation therapy frequently develops. To identify genes involved in differentiation, we compared gene expression at the mRNA and protein levels using microarray analyses and two-dimensional (2D) difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE), plus MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometry. Differentially expressed transcripts were identified using oligonucleotide-based microarrays with targets representing almost 14 000 genes. Real time PCR was performed on a subset of genes whose products were shown to be differentially expressed using proteomic and/or genomic approaches. Our analyses identified 46 genes that were differentially expressed in NB4 +/- ATRA; 22 were identified using 2D-DIGE and 24 using microarray analysis. All but four of these genes were expressed at higher levels in differentiated cells, and several controlled cell structure (internal and cytoskelatal) or signal transduction. We observed that proteome analysis with DIGE and silver-stained 2D gel electrophoresis analyses revealed significant differences between the two measurement approaches. Furthermore, our data showed significant discordance between gene expression at the protein and transcript levels.","['Wang, Daojing', 'Jensen, Ronald', 'Gendeh, Gurmil', 'Williams, Katherine', 'Pallavicini, Maria G']","['Wang D', 'Jensen R', 'Gendeh G', 'Williams K', 'Pallavicini MG']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, 94143, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,"['0 (Proteome)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', '*Proteome', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/07/16 05:00,2004/12/21 09:00,['2004/07/16 05:00'],"['2004/07/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/16 05:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2004 May-Jun;3(3):627-35. doi: 10.1021/pr049976r.,['10.1021/pr049976r [doi]'],,['R33 CA86135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
