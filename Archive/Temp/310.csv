The mutant SFFV-Friend murine leukemia virus complex did not induce symptoms of the erythroproliferative disease in adult DBA/2 mice. During passage through newborn DBA/2 mice, the mutant virus complex invariably gave rise to weakly pathogenic variant SFFVs. All of the variant SFFVs induced in adult DBA/2 mice a transient mild splenomegaly associated with normal or slightly low hematocrit value, and they produced gp55 with a molecular weight similar to that of gp55 of the wild-type SFFV. For the two isolates of variant SFFV, the 3' portion of the viral DNA intermediate containing the 3' portion of the gp55 gene was molecularly cloned. Nucleotide sequences of these biologically active cloned DNAs were determined and showed that the variant SFFV genomes arose from the mutant SFFV genome by regaining the single base insertion, indicating that the single base insertion is essential for the biological activity of gp55. Evidence is presented indicating that the single base insertion which causes a loss of the cytoplasmic domain of the env-related protein is not related to the localization of the further-glycosylated form of gp55 in the plasma membrane but is involved with the release of gp55 from cells.","['Amanuma, H', 'Watanabe, N', 'Nishi, M', 'Ikawa, Y']","['Amanuma H', 'Watanabe N', 'Nishi M', 'Ikawa Y']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Structural Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Variation', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/microbiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Plasmids', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics', 'Viral Structural Proteins/*genetics']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Nov;63(11):4824-33. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.11.4824-4833.1989.,"['Tsukuba Life Science Center, Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, Ibaraki, Japan.']",,PMC251120,['10.1128/JVI.63.11.4824-4833.1989 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

On the one hand, the synergy between PMA and A23187 and the suppression of Ag-mediated signals (hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids and rise in concentration of cytosolic Ca2+) by PMA were totally dependent on protein kinase C. The loss of synergistic and inhibitory actions of PMA, for example, correlated with the loss of protein kinase C (as determined by immunoblotting techniques) when cells were continuously exposed to PMA. Furthermore, the permeabilization of RBL-2H3 cells resulted in the loss of both protein kinase C and the inhibitory action of PMA, but both were retained if cells were exposed to PMA before permeabilization Ag-induced secretion, on the other hand, was not as dependent on the presence of protein kinase C. The potent inhibitor of this enzyme, staurosporine, which blocked completely the secretory response to the combination of PMA and A23187, did not inhibit Ag-induced secretion except at concentrations (greater than 10 nM) that inhibited Ag-stimulated hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids as well. Also RBL-2H3 cells still showed some secretory-response (approximately 25% of normal) to Ag when cells were depleted (greater than 98%) of protein kinase C by prolonged treatment with PMA.

The results showed a dose-dependent inhibition of SHBG synthesis, with a 50% reduction of SHBG in the medium, assayed by IRMA, using 250 nM L-asparaginase. Furthermore, a time-dependent inhibition was observed using a fixed concentration of the drug (50 nM) added for variable time intervals (1-4 days).

In normal individuals, examination of paired sera showed that the dominant humoral immune response during early convalescence was to the virus major capsid protein (58 kD) and during late convalescence to the minor capsid species (83 kD). In patients with persistent parvovirus infection, variable titers against intact particles were detected by RIA, but the sera from these patients had minimal or no IgG to capsid proteins determined by Western analysis. Competition experiments suggested that this discrepancy was not explicable on the basis of immune complex formation alone and that these patients may have a qualitative abnormality in antibody binding to virus. In neutralization experiments, in which erythroid colony formation in vitro was used as an assay of parvovirus activity, sera from patients with poor reactivity on immunoblotting were also inadequate in inhibiting viral infectivity. A cellular response to purified B19 parvovirus could not be demonstrated using proliferation assays and PBMC from individuals with serologic evidence of exposure to virus. These results suggest that production of neutralizing antibody to capsid protein plays a major role in limiting parvovirus infection in man.","['Kurtzman, G J', 'Cohen, B J', 'Field, A M', 'Oseas, R', 'Blaese, R M', 'Young, N S']","['Kurtzman GJ', 'Cohen BJ', 'Field AM', 'Oseas R', 'Blaese RM', 'Young NS']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications/immunology', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis/*immunology', 'Antibody Formation', 'Blotting, Western', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Male', 'Parvoviridae/*immunology/isolation & purification/ultrastructure', 'Parvoviridae Infections/complications/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/immunology', 'Radioimmunoassay']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1989 Oct;84(4):1114-23. doi: 10.1172/JCI114274.,"['Cell Biology Section, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",,PMC329767,['10.1172/JCI114274 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Susceptible mice, such as C57BL/6J mice, develop a profound impairment of lymphoproliferative response to mitogens and hyperplasia of lymphoid organs and succumb to infection within 6 months. These changes do not occur in resistant mice, such as A/J mice. Resistance to MAIDS is a dominant trait since (C57BL/6J x A/J)F1 hybrid mice did not develop any immune dysfunctions following infection. Genetic regulation of the trait of resistance/susceptibility to MAIDS was determined in AXB/BXA recombinant inbred (RI) mouse strains (derived from resistant A/J and susceptible C57BL/6J progenitors). Two different criteria were used to determine their resistance or susceptibility to developing MAIDS: the gross pathologic evaluation of lymphoid organs at 13-15 weeks of infection, and survival. RI mouse strains segregated into two non-overlapping groups. The first group did not develop any significant pathology, and these mouse strains were considered as resistant to MAIDS. The second group showed the virus-induced pathological changes as well as an immunological dysfunction as seen in C57BL/6J progenitor mice, and these strains were thus considered as susceptible to MAIDS. This bimodal strain distribution pattern of resistance/susceptibility to MAIDS among the RI strains suggests that this phenotype is controlled by a single gene. Linkage analysis with other allelic markers showed a strong association between resistance/susceptibility to MAIDS and the H-2 complex. Possession of the H-2b haplotype derived from C57BL/6J mice was associated with susceptibility to MAIDS, while the H-2a haplotype conferred resistance to the disease. This finding was confirmed by demonstrating that H-2a congenics on the susceptible C57BL/10 background were as resistant to MAIDS as A/J mice which donated the H-2a locus. Gene(s) within the H-2 complex thus represent the major regulatory mechanism of resistance/susceptibility to MAIDS.","['Hamelin-Bourassa, D', 'Skamene, E', 'Gervais, F']","['Hamelin-Bourassa D', 'Skamene E', 'Gervais F']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Immunogenetics,Immunogenetics,0420404,['0 (H-2 Antigens)'],IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'H-2 Antigens/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunogenetics. 1989;30(4):266-72. doi: 10.1007/BF02421330.,"['McGill Centre for the Study of the Host Resistance, Montreal General Hospital Research Institute, Quebec, Canada.']",,,['10.1007/BF02421330 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The 3'-N-unsubstituted (Group 1), 3'-N-acyl (Group 2), and 3'-N-alkyl (Group 3) analogues were tested for: (a) in vivo antitumor activity and in vitro cytotoxicity; (b) cellular or tissue uptake and metabolic conversion; (c) strength of DNA intercalation; and (d) interaction with DNA topoisomerase II (topo-II). Compounds of Group 1 were cytotoxic, were strongly intercalative, and, except for those with C-14 side chain substitution, induced the formation of topo-II-DNA cleavable complexes. As shown previously, esterolysis of C-14-acyl substituents was required to yield a metabolite which can interact with topo-II in the purified system. The C-14-substituted compounds of Group 2 and their C-14-unsubstituted metabolites were cytotoxic. These drugs were weak intercalators, and the C-14-unsubstituted cogeners induced cleavable complex formation in the purified system, but with reduced potency relative to doxorubicin. The type of the 3'-N-position substituent determined whether Group 3 analogues were cytotoxic and strong intercalators, or less active and nonintercalating. Although C-14-unsubstituted intercalators of Group 3 did not form cleavable complexes in the purified system, they were cytotoxic. The study shows that DNA intercalation is required but not sufficient for the activity by topo-II-targeted anthracyclines. In addition to the planar chromophore which is involved in intercalation, two other domains of the anthracycline molecule are important for the interaction with topo-II: (a) substitution of the C-14 position totally inhibits drug activity in the purified system, but enhances cytotoxicity by aiding drug uptake and presumably acting on other cellular targets; and (b) substitutions on the 3'-N position of the sugar ring can, depending on the nature of the substituent, inhibit intercalation and/or topo-II-targeting activity. These findings may provide guidance for the synthesis and development of new active analogues.","['Bodley, A', 'Liu, L F', 'Israel, M', 'Seshadri, R', 'Koseki, Y', 'Giuliani, F C', 'Kirschenbaum, S', 'Silber, R', 'Potmesil, M']","['Bodley A', 'Liu LF', 'Israel M', 'Seshadri R', 'Koseki Y', 'Giuliani FC', 'Kirschenbaum S', 'Silber R', 'Potmesil M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/*drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Nov 1;49(21):5969-78.,"['Department of Biological Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']","['CA-11655/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-37082/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-37209/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA damage, which at 37 degrees C is equivalent to several hundred rads of ionizing radiation exposure, diminishes as the temperature of drug exposure is lowered. At all temperatures below about 15 degrees C no DNA damage is detectable in L1210 cells exposed to Adriamycin, even at relatively high doses. The low temperature inactivity is not due to a redistribution of intracellular drug since at both 37 and 0 degrees C there is a high concentration of Adriamycin in both nuclear and cytoplasmic locations. The temperature profile for DNA damage parallels the profile for cytotoxicity, i.e., at low temperature, the drug is completely inactive as a cytotoxic agent (P. Lane, P. Vichi, D. L. Bain, and T. R. Tritton, Cancer Res., 47:4038-4042, 1987). Thus, DNA breaks and cell kill appear to be correlated with one another. However, when we examined DNA lesions in nuclei isolated from L1210 cells we found that the low temperature inability to sustain Adriamycin-induced single-strand breaks or DNA-protein cross-links was absent. In nuclei, then, the drug can provoke DNA damage at low temperature, while in whole cells it cannot. Topoisomerase II, an enzyme implicated in catalyzing DNA lesions in cells exposed to intercalating agents, retains its catalytic activity both to unknot P4 DNA at 0 degrees C, and to be induced by drug to alter the release of pBR322 supercoils, so a low temperature inactivation of this enzyme cannot explain the results. We propose that intact L1210 cells have a regulatory factor which controls DNA damage, possibly through topoisomerase II, but which is lost when nuclei are isolated.","['Vichi, P', 'Robison, S', 'Tritton, T R']","['Vichi P', 'Robison S', 'Tritton TR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism/*toxicity', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Plasmids', '*Temperature', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",1989/10/15 00:00,1989/10/15 00:01,['1989/10/15 00:00'],"['1989/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Oct 15;49(20):5575-80.,"['Department of Pharmacology, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By IB, however, only two out of 15 IF-positive SS patients' sera reacted with STL-C specific 125 kD molecule. These results suggested the presence of heterogenous components in the N-C antigen.

Erythroid cells from these mice differ from normal erythroid cells in that they can proliferate and differentiate in the apparent absence of the erythroid hormone erythropoietin (Epo). Although it was recently shown that the unique envelope protein encoded by SFFV is responsible for altering the hormonal requirements of erythroid cells for growth and differentiation, the mechanisms by which this occurs is not known. Since the SFFV envelope protein appears to interact with a target present only in erythroid cells and since Epo is specific for these cells, it is possible that the virus is exerting its effect through this hormone. In an effort to ascertain if this is the case, we examined cells from SFFVP-infected mice to determine (a) if they produce Epo or other erythroid growth factors that stimulate erythroid cells to grow in an autocrine-like manner and (b) if they express elevated numbers of Epo receptors that may result in a reduced requirement for the level of Epo needed for growth and differentiation. Our results indicate that SFFVP-infected cells do not secrete Epo or any other erythroid growth factors that could account for the reduced hormonal requirements of these cells. Also, our studies using iodinated Epo in cell binding assays and cross-linking studies indicate that SFFVP-infected cells are not significantly different from normal erythroid cells in the number, affinity, or size of their Epo receptors.","['Ruscetti, S K', 'Ruscetti, F W']","['Ruscetti SK', 'Ruscetti FW']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Phenylhydrazines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '064F424C9K (phenylhydrazine)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phenylhydrazines/pharmacology', 'Polycythemia/*etiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*analysis', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/physiology']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Oct;3(10):703-7.,"['National Cancer Institute, Laboratory of Genetics, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have indicated the involvement of endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV) in the development of age-dependent poliomyelitis caused by infection of old C58 or AKR mice by lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV). The only genetic components which segregate with susceptibility to LDV-induced paralytic disease are multiple proviral copies of ecotropic MuLV and the permissive allele, at the Fv-1 locus, for N-tropic, ecotropic virus replication (Fv-1n/n). Using in situ hybridization and Northern (RNA) blot hybridization, we have correlated the expression of the endogenous MuLV, both temporally and spatially, with LDV infection of anterior horn motor neurons and the development of paralysis. Our data indicate that treatment of 6- to 7-month-old C58/M mice with cyclophosphamide, which renders these mice susceptible to LDV-induced paralytic disease, results in transient increases in ecotropic MuLV RNA levels in motor neurons throughout the spinal cord. Peripheral inoculation of C58/M mice with LDV, at the time of elevated MuLV RNA levels, results in a rapid spread of LDV to some spinal cord motor neurons. LDV infections then spread slowly but progressively throughout the spinal cord, involving an increasing number of motor neurons. LDV replication is cytocidal and results in neuron destruction and paralysis of the infected animals 2 to 3 weeks postinfection. The slow replication of LDV in the spinal cord contrasts sharply with the rapid replication of LDV in macrophages, the normal host cells for LDV, during the acute phase of infection. The data indicate that the interaction between the endogenous MuLV with the generally nonpathogenic murine togavirus LDV occurs at the level of the motor neuron.

Dibutyryl cyclic AMP-treated cells showed rapid superoxide anion production in response to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) and slow, sustained response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Retinoic acid-induced cells showed a slow, sustained response to both FMLP and PMA. Interferon-gamma-treated cells produced no superoxide anion on stimulation with FMLP, whereas tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-treated cells showed a slight response. Chemotactic peptide receptor association was the same in the HL-60 cells treated with different agents, despite marked differences in the superoxide anion generation and actin polymerization responses to FMLP and PMA in these cells. In mature neutrophils chemotactic peptide receptor association with the cytoskeleton was not affected by either pertussis or cholera toxin. However, both toxins inhibited FMLP-induced actin polymerization and superoxide anion generation. This suggested involvement of a G-protein similar to Gt, rather than Gi or Gs. Neither toxin had any effect on PMA-induced superoxide anion generation. These observations indicate that receptor association with the cytoskeleton may not have a significant role in affecting signal recognition and response. Among the several possible roles suggested, clearance of the occupied receptors may be the most important role of the cytoskeletal association. HL-60 cells induced to differentiate with different agents (because of their varied functional responses) might prove very useful in dissecting the molecular mechanisms regulating stimulus-induced activation of neutrophils.","['Rao, K M', 'Currie, M S', 'Cohen, H J', 'Weinberg, J B']","['Rao KM', 'Currie MS', 'Cohen HJ', 'Weinberg JB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)']",IM,"['Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cholera Toxin/pharmacology', 'Cytoskeleton/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/*physiology', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*physiology', 'Superoxides/biosynthesis', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1989 Oct;141(1):119-25. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041410118.,"['Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27705.']","['5730-CA09307/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-AI23308/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 DK 38472/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,['10.1002/jcp.1041410118 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence for a drug-resistant form of topoisomerase II.,16411-20,"HL-60/AMSA is a human leukemia cell line that is 100 times more resistant to the cytotoxic actions of the antineoplastic, topoisomerase II-reactive DNA intercalating acridine derivative amsacrine (m-AMSA) than is its parent HL-60 line. HL-60/AMSA cells are minimally resistant to etoposide, a topoisomerase II-reactive drug that does not intercalate. Previously we showed that HL-60 topoisomerase II activity in cells, nuclei, or nuclear extracts was sensitive to m-AMSA and etoposide, while HL-60/AMSA topoisomerase II was resistant to m-AMSA but sensitive to etoposide. Now we show that purified topoisomerase II from the two cell lines exhibits the same drug sensitivity or resistance as that in the nuclear extracts although the magnitude of the m-AMSA resistance of HL-60/AMSA topoisomerase II in vitro is not as great as the resistance of the intact HL-60/AMSA cells. In addition HL-60/AMSA cells are cross-resistant to topoisomerase II-reactive intercalators from the anthracycline and ellipticine families and the pattern of sensitivity or resistance to the cytotoxic actions of the various topoisomerase II-reactive drugs is paralleled by topoisomerase II-reactive drug-induced DNA cleavage and protein cross-link production in cells and the production of drug-induced, topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage and protein cross-linking in isolated biochemical systems. In addition to its lowered sensitivity to intercalators, HL-60/AMSA differed from HL-60 in 1) the susceptibility of its topoisomerase II to stimulation of DNA topoisomerase II complex formation by ATP, 2) the catalytic activity of its topoisomerase II in an ionic environment chosen to reproduce the environment found within the living cell, and 3) the observed restriction enzyme pattern on a Southern blot probed with a cDNA for human topoisomerase II. These data indicate that an m-AMSA-resistant form of topoisomerase II contributes to the resistance of HL-60/AMSA to m-AMSA and to other topoisomerase II-reactive DNA intercalating agents. The drug resistance is associated with additional biochemical and molecular alterations that may be important determinants of cellular sensitivity or resistance to topoisomerase II-reactive drugs.","['Zwelling, L A', 'Hinds, M', 'Chan, D', 'Mayes, J', 'Sie, K L', 'Parker, E', 'Silberman, L', 'Radcliffe, A', 'Beran, M', 'Blick, M']","['Zwelling LA', 'Hinds M', 'Chan D', 'Mayes J', 'Sie KL', 'Parker E', 'Silberman L', 'Radcliffe A', 'Beran M', 'Blick M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Amsacrine/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Drug Resistance', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/*drug effects/enzymology']",1989/10/05 00:00,1989/10/05 00:01,['1989/10/05 00:00'],"['1989/10/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/05 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Oct 5;264(28):16411-20.,"['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']","['CA39809/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA40090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR 5511-23/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,['S0021-9258(19)84722-1 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Decreased content of glycosphingolipids and granulocytic differentiation by neolacto series gangliosides.,16149-54,"We have recently reported that neolacto series gangliosides (NeuAc-nLc) are increased during granulocytic differentiation of human myelogenous leukemia cell line HL-60 cells induced by retinoic acid and that HL-60 cells are differentiated into mature granulocytes when the cells are cultivated with NeuAc-nLc (Nojiri, H., Kitagawa, S., Nakamura, M., Kirito, K., Enomoto, Y., and Saito, M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 7443-7446). In contrast to these wild-type-HL-60 cells, HL-60 cells resistant to differentiation induction by retinoic acid showed a markedly decreased content of gangliosides, especially NeuAc-nLc, and did not show any increase in the content of gangliosides when cultivated with retinoic acid. Neutral glycosphingolipids, the precursors of gangliosides, were not accumulated in these resistant cells. When retinoic acid-resistant HL-60 cells were cultivated in the presence of NeuAc-nLc, the cells were found to be differentiated into mature granulocytes on morphological and functional criteria. The differentiation of cells was dependent on the concentration of gangliosides and was accompanied by inhibition of cell growth. Wild-type HL-60 cells differentiated by NeuAc-nLc showed the changes in ganglioside composition, which were similar to those in wild-type HL-60 cells differentiated by retinoic acid; among the gangliosides changed, 2----3 sialylparagloboside and 2----3 sialylnorhexaosylceramide were increased. These findings suggest (a) that the synthesis of particular NeuAc-nLe molecules is an important step for retinoic acid-induced granulocytic differentiation and this step could be bypassed or replaced by exogenous NeuAc-nLc, and (b) that the defective synthesis of particular NeuAc-nLc molecules is responsible for the failure of differentiation induction in retinoic acid-resistant HL-60 cells by retinoic acid.","['Kitagawa, S', 'Nojiri, H', 'Nakamura, M', 'Gallagher, R E', 'Saito, M']","['Kitagawa S', 'Nojiri H', 'Nakamura M', 'Gallagher RE', 'Saito M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Gangliosides/*pharmacology', 'Glycosphingolipids/*metabolism', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology/drug effects']",1989/09/25 00:00,1989/09/25 00:01,['1989/09/25 00:00'],"['1989/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Sep 25;264(27):16149-54.,"['Division of Hemopoiesis, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi-ken, Japan.']",,,['S0021-9258(18)71599-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Following digestion with trypsin, glycopeptides containing individual N-glycosylation sites were obtained by gel filtration and subsequent reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the glycopeptides demonstrated that only asparagine residues 11 and 26, located in the N-terminal domains of gp52 and gp65, carry carbohydrate substituents, while the potential N-glycosylation sites in the C-terminal portions of the molecules are not used.

DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Convenience sample of three patients with adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma. Two patients developed hypercalcemia, and one patient was normocalcemic. SETTING: Inpatient facilities at two university-affiliated medical centers. INTERVENTION: All patients had a lymph node biopsy. In addition, samples of ascitic or pleural fluid, or both, were obtained from these patients. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Using RNA blot analysis, we showed that parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were constitutively expressed in the tumor cells from all patients. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production-stimulating activity, assessed using osteoblast-like UMR106 cells, was demonstrated in the pleural and ascitic fluids from the two patients who developed hypercalcemia. The elution profiles of the cAMP production-stimulating activity in the ascitic fluid extracts were very similar to those of the tumor extracts from hypercalcemic nude rats that had been implanted with a human cancer tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Parathyroid hormone-related protein is produced by tumor cells in adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma, which may be an important factor in the development of hypercalcemia in the patients with this disease. However, the development of hypercalcemia may depend on other factors such as the number of tumor cells, access of the protein into systemic circulation, and the presence of some additional substances.","['Motokura, T', 'Fukumoto, S', 'Matsumoto, T', 'Takahashi, S', 'Fujita, A', 'Yamashita, T', 'Igarashi, T', 'Ogata, E']","['Motokura T', 'Fukumoto S', 'Matsumoto T', 'Takahashi S', 'Fujita A', 'Yamashita T', 'Igarashi T', 'Ogata E']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PTHLH protein, human)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Cyclic AMP/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Paraneoplastic Endocrine Syndromes/*metabolism', 'Parathyroid Hormone/*metabolism', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Nude', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/09/15 00:00,1989/09/15 00:01,['1989/09/15 00:00'],"['1989/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1989 Sep 15;111(6):484-8. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-111-6-484.,['University of Tokyo School of Medicine.'],,,['10.7326/0003-4819-111-6-484 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The spectrum of neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases associated significantly with FeLV infection was determined statistically. Three-quarters of the cats with persistent FeLV infections died of non-neoplastic diseases and about 23% died of tumors, nearly exclusively those of the leukemia/lymphoma disease complex. A strong association with liver degeneration, icterus and a FeLV-associated enteritis was found in addition to the known association with non-neoplastic diseases and conditions such as anemia, bacterial secondary infections and respiratory tract inflammations due to the immunosuppressive effect of FeLV, hemorrhages and feline infectious peritonitis. Surprisingly, diseases and conditions like feline infectious panleukopenia, enteritis (of other types than FeLV-associated enteritis and feline infectious panleukopenia), glomerulonephritis, uremia and hemorrhagic cystitis were not associated with persistent FeLV infection. Another unexpected finding was that most pathogenic infectious agents demonstrated in the cats were not FeLV-associated either. Thus, immunosuppression due to FeLV infection seems to make the animals susceptible to certain pathogenic infectious agents, but not to the majority.","['Reinacher, M']",['Reinacher M'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,,IM,"['Anemia/complications/veterinary', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Infections/complications/veterinary', '*Cat Diseases', 'Cats', 'Enteritis/complications/veterinary', 'Jaundice/complications/veterinary', 'Leukemia/complications/epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Liver Diseases/complications/veterinary', 'Neoplasms/complications/veterinary', 'Retroviridae Infections/complications/*veterinary']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1989 May;21(1):85-95. doi: 10.1016/0165-2427(89)90132-3.,"['Department of Veterinary Pathology, Justus-Liebig-Universitat Giessen, Federal Republic of Germany.']",,PMC7133624,"['0165-2427(89)90132-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2427(89)90132-3 [doi]']",,,,,22,,,,,,,

FeLV is also important to human individuals as a comparative model, as it may cause a variety of diseases, some malignant and some benign, such as immunosuppression, which bears a resemblance to AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) in man. FeLV is transmitted among cats by contagion. The main sources of infection are persistently infected carrier cats which continuously excrete virus. Dissemination of FeLV among cats may be prevented by identifying infected carrier cats and removing them from contact with non-infected cats. Removal programmes using indirect immunofluorescence antibody tests were applied successfully in The Netherlands. The proportion of FeLV-positive cats decreased from 9% in 1974 to approximately 3% in 1985 during such a programme. The results of a removal programme carried out in a catbreeders' society were even better: the incidence of cats positive for FeLV decreased from 11% in 1974 to less than 2% within 4 years. None of the cats tested in this society has been found to be positive for FeLV since 1984. Besides removal programmes, other methods of control, such as pre-exposure treatment, were developed to prevent the spread of FeLV. We attempted to protect kittens against oronasal infection with FeLV by treatment with virus-neutralizing (VN) monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) directed against an epitope on the viral glycoprotein gp70. However, no protection was achieved. It is unlikely that the amount of VN antibodies, the mode and route of their application or the infectious dose of FeLV used can account for this failure. Other possible explanations for the lack of protective effect are that (i) the restricted epitope specificity of the MoAb preparation used may have led to selection of neutralization-resistant virus mutants, or (ii) other mechanisms than virus neutralization (complement-mediated lysis, antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity), that may be involved in protection, function less efficiently with MoAb. However, in the light of our finding that an early anti-idiotypic response is observed in all cats following administration of the MoAb preparation, the rapid clearance of anti-FeLV MoAb from the circulation is a more likely explanation. Efforts were further made to develop a vaccine for controlling FeLV infection. The immunostimulating complex vaccine (FeLV-ISCOM vaccine), a subunit vaccine in which FeLV gp70 is presented in a particular manner, looks promising. The protective effect of FeLV-ISCOM vaccine was studied by vaccinating six 8-week-old SPF cats with ISCOM, followed by oronasal challenge with FeLV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Weijer, K', 'Uytdehaag, F G', 'Osterhaus, A D']","['Weijer K', 'Uytdehaag FG', 'Osterhaus AD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)', '0 (feline leukemia virus vaccine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Cat Diseases/epidemiology/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Cats', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/immunology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/prevention & control/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*immunology/isolation & purification', '*Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic', 'Vaccination/veterinary', '*Viral Envelope Proteins', '*Viral Vaccines']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1989 May;21(1):69-83. doi: 10.1016/0165-2427(89)90131-1.,"['The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Division of Immunology, Amsterdam.']",,,"['0165-2427(89)90131-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2427(89)90131-1 [doi]']",,,,,49,,,,,,,

The addition of whole ultraviolet light-inactivated FeLV and FeLV proteins to normal cat neutrophils produced no significant suppression of the respiratory burst. These data suggest two possible mechanisms for suppression. The first is partially due to viral alterations of the neutrophil as seen in viremic cats, but, because exogenously applied FeLV or FeLV proteins had no effect on the respiratory burst, an additional mechanism is present. The second mechanism may be caused by a latent FeLV infection residing in nonviremic cat bone marrows which alters their immune system, resulting in immunosuppression.","['Dezzutti, C S', 'Wright, K A', 'Lewis, M G', 'Lafrado, L J', 'Olsen, R G']","['Dezzutti CS', 'Wright KA', 'Lewis MG', 'Lafrado LJ', 'Olsen RG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Viral Proteins)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/enzymology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Viral Proteins/pharmacology']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1989 May;21(1):55-67. doi: 10.1016/0165-2427(89)90130-x.,"['Ohio State University, Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Columbus 43210.']","['CA-30338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31547/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P 30 CA-16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0165-2427(89)90130-X [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2427(89)90130-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The first is the establishment of an appropriate humoral and cellular immune response leading to a condition of immunity to subsequent infection with the retrovirus. Alternatively, the host may fail to develop a successful immune response, resulting in a chronic viremia associated with immunosuppression and ultimately death due to secondary pathogens. An alternate disease course is the establishment of a latent infection characterized by the presence of neutralizing antibody and strong cellular immune reactivity. Recent data from the feline leukemia virus (FeLV) system suggest that cats infected with this virus may develop immunosuppression in the form of persistent neutrophil dysfunction. The potential effect of this cellular dysfunction is the possible susceptibility of the host to the same opportunistic pathogens which are responsible for the increased mortality noted in chronic FeLV infections. These data demonstrate that persistent retroviremia is not essential for the establishment of immunosuppression. This overview presents data accumulated from the feline model of the human acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and discusses its relationship to human retroviral infections.","['Lafrado, L J', 'Dezzutti, C S', 'Lewis, M G', 'Olsen, R G']","['Lafrado LJ', 'Dezzutti CS', 'Lewis MG', 'Olsen RG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,['EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)'],IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Animals', 'Cats', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*etiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Opportunistic Infections/etiology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Viremia/veterinary']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1989 May;21(1):39-46. doi: 10.1016/0165-2427(89)90128-1.,"['Primate Research Institute, Holloman Air Force Base, NM 88330-1027.']","['CA-30338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31547/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0165-2427(89)90128-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2427(89)90128-1 [doi]']",,,,,37,,,,,,,

The virus is a typical lentivirus in gross and structural morphology. It replicates preferentially but not exclusively in feline T-lymphoblastoid cells, where it causes a characteristic cytopathic effect. The major structural proteins are 10, 17 (small gag), 28 (major core), 31 (endonuclease?), 41 (transmembrane?), 52 (core precursor polyprotein), 54/62 (reverse transcriptase?), and 110/130 (major envelope) kilodaltons in size. The various proteins are antigenically distinguishable from those of other lentiviruses, although serum from EIAV-infected horses will cross-react with some FIV antigens. Kittens experimentally infected with FIV manifest a transient (several days to 2 weeks) fever and neutropenia beginning 4 to 8 weeks after inoculation. This is associated with a generalized lymphadenopathy that persists for up to 9 months. Most cats recover from this initial phase of the disease and become lifelong carriers of the virus. Complete recovery does not occur to any extent in nature or in the laboratory setting. One experimentally infected cat died from a myeloproliferative disorder several months after infection. The terminal AIDS-like phase of the illness has been seen mainly in naturally infected cats. It appears a year or more following the initial infection in an unknown proportion of infected animals. FIV has been identified in cats from all parts of the world. It is most prevalent in high density populations of free roaming cats (feral and pet), and is very uncommon in closed purebred catteries. Male cats are twice as likely to become infected as females. Older male cats adopted as feral or stray animals are at the highest risk of infection, therefore. The infection rate among freely roaming cats rises throughout life, and reaches levels ranging from less than 1% to 12% or more depending on the area. Clinically affected cats tend to be 5 years or older at the time of hospitalization. Experimental and seroepidemiologic studies suggest that FIV is transmitted mainly by bites. Intimate, non-traumatic contact (mutual grooming, shared use of food, water and litter pans) is inefficient in transmitting the infection. In utero and venereal transmission could not be demonstrated in laboratory settings. There is no statistical linkage between FIV and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infections in nature. The FeLV infection rate in FIV-infected animals is the same as it is for non-FIV-infected cats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Pedersen, N C', 'Yamamoto, J K', 'Ishida, T', 'Hansen, H']","['Pedersen NC', 'Yamamoto JK', 'Ishida T', 'Hansen H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', '*Cat Diseases/immunology/microbiology', 'Cats', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/etiology/*veterinary', 'Male', 'Opportunistic Infections/etiology/immunology/veterinary', '*Retroviridae/analysis/immunology/ultrastructure', 'Retroviridae Infections/epidemiology/immunology/microbiology/*veterinary']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1989 May;21(1):111-29. doi: 10.1016/0165-2427(89)90134-7.,"['Department of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis 95616.']",,,"['0165-2427(89)90134-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2427(89)90134-7 [doi]']",,,,,27,,,,,,,

One of the principal international guidelines in TBI is to use in vivo dosimetry in order to compare the prescribed dose with that absorbed. The use of in vivo dosimetry is also useful as a retrospective evaluation of any deviation from the prescribed dose greater than +/- 5% for relevant parts of the body, especially in the lung and in other organs at risk. In this paper, Electron Spin Resonance (ESR), using alanine dosimeters, is demonstrated to be a powerful tool for absorbed dose evaluation in TBI by detection of free radicals produced in alanine by ionizing radiation. In this study, we present the results obtained using ESR dosimetry in eleven patients undergoing TBI. The major advantages appear to be: 1. the ESR signal in alanine dosimetry is stable for years without fading: 2. the detection of the ESR signal does not destroy the information and so enables a retrospective judgment of the TBI plan adopted.","['Indovina, P L', 'Benassi, M', 'Giacco, G C', 'Primavera, A', 'Rosati, A']","['Indovina PL', 'Benassi M', 'Giacco GC', 'Primavera A', 'Rosati A']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

However, there are a number of serious problems and limitations associated with autologous or allogeneic BMT. One of these is an increase in opportunistic infections, of which cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is one of the most important. Cytomegalovirus has been associated with more frequent deaths than any other single agent, with no reproducibly successful or therapy currently available. Recently usage of interleukin-2 or immunomodulation has been suggested as a powerful modality to combat infectious disease. In this study we showed that bone marrow activated in interleukin-2 for 2 days has the ability to lyse spleen cells infected for 3 days with murine CMV (acute infection model) or salivary gland cells infected for 7 days (chronic infection model), while nonactivated bone marrow or natural killer (NK) cells showed no such lysis.

Both cell types had high but slightly different affinities for TNF alpha. The myeloid cells had major cross-linked products of 98-100 kDa, which were similar in their N-linked glycosylation, whereas the cells of epithelial origin contained a major cross-linked product of 75 kDa, a second product of 95 kDa. The major receptors of both cell types (studied mostly with HL60 and HEp2 cells) are different proteins because (a) their apparent molecular masses were different and no evidence was obtained for cell-specific proteases, which could generate the differently sized receptors from one common receptor molecule; (b) anti-receptor antibodies, which precipitated the 95- and 75-kDa products, did not precipitate the 100-kDa cross-linked complex; (c) the native TNF alpha-receptor complexes had different proteolytic fingerprints; (d) the tryptic fragments differed in their association with the cell membrane vesicles; (e) the receptors differed in their degree of N-linked glycosylation; and (f) O-linked glycosylation was found on the major receptor of HL60 but not of HEp2 cells.

The infiltrates of Hodgkin's disease differed from those of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in their cellular component of Hodgkin and Sternberg-Reed cells and the irregularity in the fibre pattern. Based upon histological and immunohistochemical criteria the 20 cases were divided into three groups. Group 1 (n = 10) contained seven chronic lymphocytic leukaemias of B type, one lymphoplasmacytoid immunocytoma, and two centroblastic/centrocytic lymphomas. The non-Hodgkin's lymphoma components showed a monotypic immunoglobulin distribution pattern and/or leukaemic blood picture. Adjacent to the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was typical Hodgkin's disease in which Hodgkin and Sternberg-Reed cells were positive for both immunoglobulin light chains and IgG and reacted with anti-CD15. Group 2 (n = 5) consisted exclusively of centroblastic/centrocytic lymphoma in combination with Hodgkin's disease in which the few Hodgkin and Sternberg-Reed cells were negative with anti-CD15 monoclonal antibody. Group 3 (n = 5) consisted of four chronic lymphocytic leukaemias of B type and one lymphoplasmacytoid immunocytoma. In these cases no combination with Hodgkin's disease could be diagnosed apart from the presence of partially CD15 positive Hodgkin and Sternberg-Reed cells. The following conclusions were drawn: anti-CD15 (LeuM1 and 3C4/C3D-1) can neither confirm nor exclude Hodgkin's disease since, while they do not detect Hodgkin and Sternberg-Reed cells in all cases of Hodgkin's disease, they do recognize Hodgkin and Sternberg-Reed cells in some B-cell lymphomas; anti-CD30 (Ber-H2) reacted with Hodgkin and Sternberg-Reed cells in all cases of Hodgkin's disease and also detected these cells in cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","['Hansmann, M L', 'Fellbaum, C', 'Hui, P K', 'Lennert, K']","['Hansmann ML', 'Fellbaum C', 'Hui PK', 'Lennert K']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ki-1 Antigen)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ki-1 Antigen', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/ultrastructure', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Histopathology. 1989 Jul;15(1):35-48. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.1989.tb03039.x.,"['Institute of Pathology, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, FRG.']",,,['10.1111/j.1365-2559.1989.tb03039.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Transfection of a human T cell leukemia cell line, Jurkat, or an African green monkey kidney cell line, CV1, with a cDNA encoding E2 protein, a trans-activator of bovine papilloma virus type 1, results in activation of interleukin 2 (IL-2), interleukin 3 (IL-3) and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) genes in a transient transfection assay. 5' deletion and mutation analyses showed that the sequence between positions -60 and a TATA-like sequence is required for basic promotor function and that the sequence between positions -95 and -73 containing conserved lymphokine element 2 (CLE2) and a GC box (CLE2/GC box) mediates the positive response to E2 protein. The latter has been previously shown to respond to PMA/A23187 stimulation or to p40tax, a trans-activator encoded by human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-I). The sequence located between -108 and -99 (CLE1) is inhibitory to E2 protein or PMA/A23187 stimulation. The combination of E2 protein and PMA/A23187 appears to eliminate an inhibitory effect of the upstream region. However, E2 protein, like p40tax, mediates a positive response through CLE1 alone linked to the basic promoter sequence.

This violet alkaloid, designated dercitin, inhibited the proliferation of cultured murine and human leukemia, lung, and colon tumor cells at nM concentrations (IC50 values of 63-150 nM) and prolonged the life of mice bearing ascitic P388 tumors (%T/C = 170, 5 mg/kg, i.p., QD1-9). Dercitin was also active against i.p. B16 melanoma and modestly inhibited the growth of s.c. Lewis lung carcinoma on the same schedule. DNA blocked the antiproliferative effects of the agent in culture, and incorporation studies indicated that dercitin disrupted DNA and RNA synthesis with less effects on protein synthesis, similar to the effects of known DNA intercalators. After 1-h exposure to 400 nM dercitin, the rates of incorporation of [3H]uridine, [3H]thymidine, and [3H]leucine by cultured P388 cells were inhibited 83, 61, and 23%, respectively. Equilibrium dialysis indicated that dercitin bound calf thymus DNA with an affinity of 3.1 microM and maximal binding of 0.20 mol dercitin/mol base pair. Binding involved intercalation as evidenced by ability to relax supercoiled phi X174 DNA (half maximal concentration for dercitin relaxation was 36 nM). The effects of dercitin on DNA mobility were reversible, and complete relaxation of DNA with topoisomerase I in the presence of dercitin followed by phenol extraction resulted in the appearance of supercoiled DNA. Dercitin, at microM concentrations, had a small effect in the K+-sodium dodecyl sulfate assay using cultured P388 cells, suggesting minimal inhibition of topoisomerase activity.

Relaxation of DNA at a given concentration was greater than inhibition of nick translation suggesting that the effects of dercitin on enzyme activity were secondary to changes in DNA conformation.

Cotreatment of L1210 cells with aphidicolin, which is an inhibitor of replicative DNA polymerases, completely abolished camptothecin cytotoxicity, suggesting the involvement of DNA replication in camptothecin cytotoxicity. In order to study the role of DNA replication in drug action, a cell-free SV40 DNA replication system was used in the present study. Camptothecin inhibited SV40 DNA replication in this cell-free system only in the presence of topoisomerase I. Addition of excess purified calf thymus DNA topoisomerase I to this extract system in the presence of camptothecin resulted in severe inhibition of SV40 DNA replication and the accumulation of linearized replication products, which contained covalently bound DNA topoisomerase I. We propose that the collision between moving replication forks and camptothecin-stabilized topoisomerase I-DNA cleavable complexes results in fork arrest and possibly fork breakage, which are lethal to proliferating cells.","['Hsiang, Y H', 'Lihou, M G', 'Liu, L F']","['Hsiang YH', 'Lihou MG', 'Liu LF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aphidicolin', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'DNA, Viral/*drug effects', 'Diterpenes/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Mice', 'Simian virus 40/genetics', 'Thymus Gland/enzymology', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1989/09/15 00:00,1989/09/15 00:01,['1989/09/15 00:00'],"['1989/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Sep 15;49(18):5077-82.,"['Department of Biological Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']","['CA-39962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-40884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Electron microscopy of hypericin-treated, virus-producing cells revealed the production of particles containing immature or abnormally assembled cores, suggesting the compounds may interfere with processing of gag-encoded precursor polyproteins. The released virions contain no detectable activity of reverse transcriptase.

In addition to p40tax and a tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), an activator of protein kinase C, we report here that forskolin, an activator of adenyl cyclase, also induces function of the HTLV-I enhancer. Experiments with mutants of the HTLV-I enhancer revealed that TPA-induced activation was not mediated by solely a 21-base-pair (bp) sequence that is repeated three times in the enhancer, whereas the 21-bp enhancer element can act as a sufficient cis-acting sequence for activation by both p40tax and forskolin. In addition, we found that nuclear factor(s) like the cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE) binding factor could bind to the HTLV-I 21-bp enhancer element. However, a difference was found in sequences required for activation by p40tax and forskolin. A CRE related sequence present in the 21-bp enhancer element was enough for forskolin-induced activation. On the other hand, p40tax required a much longer sequence that is overlapping but not identical to the CRE related sequence, suggesting that the forskolin-induced cyclic AMP pathway may be partly involved in, but not sufficient for p40tax-mediating trans-activation of the HTLV-I enhancer.","['Nakamura, M', 'Niki, M', 'Ohtani, K', 'Sugamura, K']","['Nakamura M', 'Niki M', 'Ohtani K', 'Sugamura K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '00BH33GNGH (Cadmium)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'J6K4F9V3BA (Cadmium Chloride)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Composition', 'Base Sequence', 'Cadmium/pharmacology', 'Cadmium Chloride', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Colforsin/*pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/*physiology', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', '*Genes, Viral/drug effects', 'HTLV-I Antigens/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/drug effects/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasmids', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",1989/07/11 00:00,1989/07/11 00:01,['1989/07/11 00:00'],"['1989/07/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/11 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1989 Jul 11;17(13):5207-21. doi: 10.1093/nar/17.13.5207.,"['Department of Microbiology, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.']",,PMC318106,['10.1093/nar/17.13.5207 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In earlier studies we have demonstrated that IL2-induced inhibition of erythropoiesis is mediated by activated T-Lymphocytes expressing the IL2-receptor. We have now examined the role of activated T cells and interferon-gamma (IF gamma) in inhibition of normal erythropoiesis and in HTLV-I associated lymphoproliferative disease. T cells were activated by triggering of the antigen receptor complex with CD3 monoclonal antibody. Incubation with CD5 antibody recognizing a T cell epitope distinct from the antigen receptor served as a control. Supernatants derived from CD3 activated T cells generated in the presence of IL2 caused a dose-dependent suppression of erythropoiesis. Treatment of supernatant interferon-gamma neutralizing antibody caused a greater than 95% abrogation of inhibition. Next we investigated the mechanisms for acquired pure red cell aplasia in a patient with T gamma-lymphoproliferative disease (T gamma-LPD). Patient marrow erythroid progenitors were 17 +/- 9% of control and increased to 88-102% of control following marrow T cell depletion. Myeloid progenitors were normal. Patient suppressor T cells inhibited growth of autologous and allogeneic marrow erythroid but not myeloid progenitors and produced high titers of IF gamma. The inhibitory factor in patient T cell supernatant was acid labile and sensitive to trypsin, consistent with properties of IF gamma. Prior depletion of activated T cells abrogated the suppressive effect of patient T cell-derived supernatant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Burdach, S', 'Levitt, L', 'Wahn, V', 'Gobel, U']","['Burdach S', 'Levitt L', 'Wahn V', 'Gobel U']",['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*diagnosis/genetics', '*Erythropoiesis', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics', 'Interleukin-2/*genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 1989 Jun;12(3):116-9. doi: 10.1159/000216617.,"['Zentrum fur Kinderheilkunde, Medizinische Einrichfungen, Universitat Dusseldorf.']",,,['10.1159/000216617 [doi]'],,,,Lymphokin-vermittelte Suppression der Erythropoese durch normale T-Lymphozyten und bei Retrovirus-assoziierter lymphoproliferativer Erkrankung.,,,,,,,,

Surface antigen phenotype and karyotype in developing and primary lymphomas.,553-9,"CFW/D mice injected neonatally with a type B retrovirus, (DMBA-LV), rapidly develop thymic lymphomas. The present study examined simultaneously the karyotype and the expression of surface antigens on thymocytes from DMBA-LV treated mice at 28, 35 and 42 days of age during the development of lymphomas, and of cells from primary lymphomas. DMBA-LV treatment resulted in disturbances in the proportions of thymic Lyt 1+2-, Lyt 1-2+ and Lyt 1+2+ subpopulations. As a group, virus-treated mice showed a significant decrease in the size of the Lyt 1+2- subpopulation in thymuses during tumor development. However, developing tumors and primary tumors showed individual patterns of alteration in the proportions of thymocyte subpopulations rather than consistent trends for any one thymocyte subpopulation to increase or decrease. Cells with the abnormal chromosome complement, trisomy 15, were present early in the development of tumors and became the predominant karyotype in fully developed tumors. A correlation between the appearance of trisomy 15 and a particular thymocyte surface antigen phenotype was not detected. The results suggest that retrovirus infection disrupts, but does not eliminate the ability of developing thymocytes to form phenotypically distinct subpopulations.","['Mueller, R E', 'Ball, J K', 'Chan, F P']","['Mueller RE', 'Ball JK', 'Chan FP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)']",IM,"['9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Chromosome Aberrations/genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Lymphoma/*classification/etiology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*classification/etiology/genetics']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(7):553-9. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90122-7.,"['Department of Anatomy, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada.']",,,"['0145-2126(89)90122-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(89)90122-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to study the in vitro and in vivo oncogenicity of N-ras and to compare its pathogenicity to that of H-ras, we have inserted an activated or a normal form of human N-ras cDNA into a slightly modified Harvey murine sarcoma virus-derived vector in which the H-ras p21 coding region had been deleted. The resulting constructions were transfected into NIH 3T3 cells. The activated N-ras-containing construct (HSN) induced 10(4) foci per microgram of DNA and was found to be as transforming as H-ras was. After infection of the transfected cells by either the ecotropic Moloney murine leukemia virus or the amphotropic 4070A helper viruses, rescued transforming viruses were injected into newborn mice. Both pseudotypes of HSN virus containing activated N-ras induced the typical Harvey disease with similar latency. However, we found that the virus which contained normal N-ras p21 (HSn) was also pathogenic and induced splenomegaly, lymphadenopathies, and sarcoma in mice after a latency of 3 to 7 weeks. In addition, Moloney murine leukemia virus pseudotypes of N-ras caused neurological disorders in 30% of the infected animals. These results differed markedly from those of previous experiments in which we had inserted the activated form of N-ras in the pSV(X) vector: the resulting SVN-ras virus was transforming on NIH 3T3 cells but was poorly oncogenic in vivo (M. Souyri, C. F. Koehne, P. V. O'Donnel, T. H. Aldrich, M. E. Furth, and E. Fleissner, Virology 158:69-78). However, similarly poor oncogenicity was also observed when the v-H-ras coding sequence was inserted in pSV(X) vector, which indicated that the vector sequences play a crucial role in the pathogenicity of a given oncogene. Altogether, these data demonstrated unequivocally that N-ras is potentially as oncogenic as H-ras and that such oncogenic effect could depend on the vector environment.","['Souyri, M', 'Vigon, I', 'Charon, M', 'Tambourin, P']","['Souyri M', 'Vigon I', 'Charon M', 'Tambourin P']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Animals', '*Genes, ras', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Harvey murine sarcoma virus/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*etiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/*genetics', 'Transfection']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Sep;63(9):3944-53. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.9.3944-3953.1989.,"[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie et Oncologie des Maladies Retrovirales, Hopital Cochin, INSERM U152, CNRS UA628, Paris, France.""]",,PMC250991,['10.1128/JVI.63.9.3944-3953.1989 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a small proportion (ca. 5%) is processed to form a derivative that occurs on plasma membranes and causes mitosis of infected erythroblasts. We have now found that gp55 folds heterogeneously in the RER to form components with different disulfide bonds and that this difference may determine their processing fates. RER gp55 consists predominantly of monomers with intrachain disulfide bonds. In contrast, the processed molecules are disulfide-bonded dimers. These dimers are extensively modified in transit to cell surfaces by conversion of four N-linked high-mannose oligosaccharides to complex derivatives and by attachment of a sialylated O-linked oligosaccharide. The plasma membrane dimers are then slowly shed into the medium by a mechanism that involves proteolytic cleavage of approximately 25 membrane-anchoring hydrophobic amino acids from the carboxyl termini of the glycoproteins. Consequently, shed molecules have shorter polypeptide chains than cell-associated gp55. We conclude that gp55 folds into different disulfide-bonded components that do not substantially isomerize, and that only one specific dimer is competent for export from the RER. Mitogenic activity of gp55 could be caused by the cell surface dimers, by the shed derivative, or by the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic anchors that remain in the membranes after the shedding reaction.","['Gliniak, B C', 'Kabat, D']","['Gliniak BC', 'Kabat D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Disulfides', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/analysis/*metabolism']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Sep;63(9):3561-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.9.3561-3568.1989.,"['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201-3098.']",['CA-25810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC250945,['10.1128/JVI.63.9.3561-3568.1989 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The highest prevalences were observed in female prostitutes (7.4%), patients with neurologic syndromes (5.8%), and lepers (13.7%).

These receptors have been shown to have specificity for virus reminiscent of an immune-specific receptor. Previous studies on T cell lymphoma binding to retroviruses have involved measurement of the interaction of labelled virus with cells using fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis (McGrath et al., J. Virol. (1978) 25, 923; McGrath and Weissman, Cell (1979) 17, 65; Weissman and McGrath, Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. (1982) 98, 103). Here we report development of an assay for measuring lymphoma binding to virus, prepared as an immunoabsorbent adhered to a microtiter plate. Using this assay, we have shown that only T and not B cell lymphomas can bind to T cell-tropic viruses, and some cell lines have greatest specificity for homologous virus. The AKR-derived T cell lymphomas, SL3 and KKT-2, show greater specificity for leukemogenic AKR viruses, than for an AKR xenotropic virus or the recombinant AKR virus, MCF247. The RadLV-induced T cell lines, C6VL/1 and BL/VL3, have been found to bind cross-reactively to several different murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs). RadLV-induced T cell lymphomas do have greater specificity for their cognate retroviruses since free, homologous retrovirus can best block the interaction between cells and virus adhered to the wells of a microtiter plate. Cross-reactive interactions are more easily demonstrated by this assay, probably because low avidity interactions are stabilized as a result of the mode of virus presentation. Binding specificity for retroviral envelope determinants has been demonstrated using a rat anti-retroviral antiserum prepared as an F(ab)1 fragment. This antiserum can inhibit the interaction between the C6VL/1 thymoma and its RadLV virus. Specificity of this antibody for a gp70-like protein was confirmed by NaDodSO4-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and by loss of this activity after absorption of antibody on virus. Antibodies specific for RadLV/VL3 gp70 determinants can inhibit the interaction of C6VL/1 with RadLV/VL3 suggesting that cross-reactive binding to heterologous virus is also specific for a gp70 viral env determinant.","[""O'Neill, H C"", 'Weissman, I L']","[""O'Neill HC"", 'Weissman IL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/analysis/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*microbiology', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*microbiology', 'Thymoma/*microbiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/analysis']",1989/08/15 00:00,1989/08/15 00:01,['1989/08/15 00:00'],"['1989/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1989 Aug 15;122(1):79-90. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(89)90337-2.,"['Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical Centre, CA 94305.']",['CA32031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['0022-1759(89)90337-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(89)90337-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Relationship to lymphoid differentiation.,506-16,"We have studied recombinatorial events of the T cell receptor delta and gamma chain genes in hematopoietic malignancies and related these to normal stages of lymphoid differentiation. T cell receptor delta gene recombinatorial events were found in 91% of acute T cell lymphoblastic leukemia, 68% of non-T, non-B lymphoid precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 80% of mixed lineage acute leukemias. Mature B-lineage leukemias and acute nonlymphocytic leukemias retained the T-cell receptor delta gene in the germline configuration. The incidence of T cell receptor gamma and delta was particularly high in CD10+CD19+ non-T, non-B lymphoid precursor ALL. In lymphoid precursor ALL, T cell receptor delta was frequently rearranged while T cell receptor gamma was in the germline configuration. This suggests that TCR delta rearrangements may precede TCR gamma rearrangements in lymphoid ontogeny. In T-ALL, only concordant T cell receptor delta and gamma rearrangements were observed. Several distinct rearrangements were defined using a panel of restriction enzymes. Most of the rearrangements observed in T-ALL represented joining events of J delta 1 to upstream regions.

However, the methods commonly employed to enrich and purify virus from culture media such as pelleting and density-gradient centrifugation result in a low recovery of the viral external glycoproteins. This is an obvious drawback when the virus is intended for use in a vaccine. In search for alternative methods to concentrate and purify FeLV, we have attempted extraction in two-phase systems based on water-soluble polymers (Albertsson PA., Biochem Biophys Acta 1958; 27: 378-395). A variety of polymer systems was tested. Some of them seem attractive for a large-scale concentration of the virus and/or its glycoprotein. The distribution between the phases of two FeLV proteins, the outer envelope protein, gp70, and the gag protein, p27, was determined. With a system composed of dextran sulfate and polyvinyl alcohol both the glycoprotein and the gag protein were almost completely recovered in the lower phase which constitutes about 3% of the total system in weight. The two proteins were more than 40-fold purified as calculated on protein basis.

In the action of IGF-II, a pertussis toxin (or islet-activating protein; IAP)-sensitive GTP-binding protein (G protein) is inferred to be involved (Nishimoto, I., Hata, Y., Ogata, E., and Kojima, I. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 12120-12126). In the present study, we examined the direct coupling of the IGF-II receptor with G proteins. In broken Balb/c3T3 cell membranes, 10 nM IGF-II rapidly attenuated the IAP-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of a 40-kDa protein in a manner requiring magnesium ion. The IGF-II-mediated attenuation in the IAP substrate activity was 80% recovered after washing off IGF-II and inhibited by coexisting guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate), while either aluminum fluoride solution (10 mM NaF plus 100 microM AlCl3) or 100 microM guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) reproduced the action of IGF-II. When purified IAP substrate G proteins (Gi1, Gi2, G0) were incubated with IGF-II in the presence of membranes from IAP-treated Balb/c3T3 cells, the attenuation in the IAP substrate activity was evident in Gi2, but not in Gi1 or G0. On the other hand, 10 nM insulin had no effect on the modification of the 40-kDa IAP substrate in Balb/c3T3 cell membranes, whereas 10 nM IGF-I elicited a slow onset of the IAP sensitivity attenuation from the 40-kDa protein. However, the specific involvement of the IGF-II receptor in the modification of the IAP substrate induced by low concentrations of IGF-II was suggested by the observations that (i) IGF-I receptor-lacking cell membranes were effective for the Gi2 modification by IGF-II, (ii) the ability of membranes to mediate the action of IGF-II was markedly attenuated in IGF-II receptor-lacking cell membranes, and (iii) agonistic anti-IGF-II receptor antibody mimicked the action of IGF-II on the 40-kDa protein in Balb/c3T3 cell membranes in a dose-dependent manner similar to that observed in the antibody-induced blocking of membrane IGF-II binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Nishimoto, I', 'Murayama, Y', 'Katada, T', 'Ui, M', 'Ogata, E']","['Nishimoto I', 'Murayama Y', 'Katada T', 'Ui M', 'Ogata E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Somatomedin)', '0 (Somatomedins)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '20762-30-5 (Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Clone Cells/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/pharmacology', 'Insulin/pharmacology', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/pharmacology', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'KB Cells/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Weight', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/immunology/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Somatomedin', 'Somatomedins/*metabolism', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/metabolism']",1989/08/25 00:00,1989/08/25 00:01,['1989/08/25 00:00'],"['1989/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Aug 25;264(24):14029-38.,"['Fourth Department of Internal Medicine, University of Tokyo School of Medicine, Japan.']",,,['S0021-9258(18)71637-2 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Donor-derived PCs developed in 4 out of 76 pristane-treated recipients [latent periods: 38-82 (mean 51) days] that had received spleen cells from pristane-treated donors, and also in 2 out of 41 pristane-treated recipients that had received untreated donor-derived spleen cells (latent periods: 65 and 120 days). Three of the PCs in the former and both PCs in the latter group were tested for integration and expression of the v-abl gene, with positive results. This indicates that the spleen contains PC-precursor cells that can be activated by A-MuLV even before the impact of pristane. All 6 donor-origin PCs carried a translocation involving chromosome 15, band D2/3. Four of these corresponded to a typical 12;15 translocation, one was a variant 6;15 translocation and the 6th may represent a previously unidentified translocation between chromosome 15 and the lambda gene-carrying chromosome 16. No PCs developed among 29 pristane-untreated recipients that had received pristane-treated donor-derived spleen cells. In addition to PCs, monocytic tumors developed in 37 (26%) of all recipients.

Macrophage-secreted PGE2 was previously shown to promote unresponsiveness to antigen in normal B lymphocytes. This observation suggested that B lymphomas might also be regulated by prostanoids. Five non-PG-secreting Ly-1+ B lymphomas (CH12, CH31, CH33, NBL and WEHI-231) were incubated for 24-72 h with PGE2, PGE1 or PGF2 alpha. The level of lymphoma growth at the end of culture was determined using a colorimetric assay which detects only viable cells. A marked heterogeneity was observed with respect to the sensitivity of these lymphomas to PGE2 and PGE1. CH31 was very sensitive, being growth inhibited by as little as 10(-8) M PGE. In contrast, CH12, a more mature lymphoma, was highly resistant, whereas CH33, NBL and WEHI-231 were of intermediate resistance. All five lymphomas demonstrated little or no growth inhibition when cultured with PGF2 alpha. Moreover, unlike PGE2, PGF2 alpha failed to elevate intracellular cAMP levels. It was previously shown that CH31, CH33 and WEHI-231 could be growth inhibited by anti-immunoglobulin antibodies which cross-link surface immunoglobulin. Interestingly, these three lymphomas were rendered more sensitive to this treatment if PGE2 was present. For example, 10(-8) M PGE2 alone had little effect on CH33, but significantly augmented growth inhibition induced by suboptimal quantities of anti-immunoglobulin antibody. Cholera toxin, another agent which was found to rapidly elevate intracellular cAMP levels, also synergized with suboptimal doses of anti-immunoglobulin to induce growth inhibition. Overall these data suggest that, in vivo, macrophage-secreted prostanoids may slow the growth of some lymphomas and that anti-immunoglobulin or anti-idiotype treatment may be more effective in the presence of agents which elevate cAMP such as E-series PG.","['Phipps, R P', 'Lee, D', 'Schad, V', 'Warner, G L']","['Phipps RP', 'Lee D', 'Schad V', 'Warner GL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Prostaglandins E)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', 'B7IN85G1HY (Dinoprost)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cholera Toxin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/physiology', 'Dinoprost/pharmacology', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Synergism', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Prostaglandins E/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1989 Jun;19(6):995-1001. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830190607.,"['Immunology Unit of the Cancer Center, University of Rochester, NY.']","['5-P30-CA-11198/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42739/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA-09363/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,['10.1002/eji.1830190607 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Initially, the effects on biological activity of covalently attaching biotin to erythropoietin alternatively at carboxylate, amino, or sialic acid groups were compared. Biotinylation of erythropoietin at carboxylate groups using biotin-amidocaproyl hydrazide plus 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide led to substantial biological inactivation, although biotinylated molecules retained detectable activity when prepared at low stoichiometries. Biotinylation at amino groups using sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido) hexanoate resulted in a high level of biological inactivation with little, if any, retention of biological activity, regardless of labeling stoichiometries. Biotinylation at sialic acid moieties using periodate and biotinamidocaproyl hydrazide proceeded efficiently (greater than 95% and 80% labeling efficiencies for human urinary and recombinant erythropoietin, respectively) and yielded stably biotinylated erythropoietin molecules possessing comparably high biological activity (ie, 45% of the activity of unmodified hormone). Utility of recombinant biotin-(sialyl)-erythropoietin (in combination with 125I-streptavidin) in the assay of cell surface receptors was demonstrated using two distinct murine erythroleukemia cell lines, Friend 745 and Rauscher Red 1. The densities and affinities of specific hormone binding sites were 116 +/- 4 sites, 3.3 +/- 0.4 nmol/L kd and 164 +/- 5 sites, 2.7 +/- 0.4 nmol/L kd, respectively. It is predicted that the present development of biotin-(sialyl)-erythropoietin as a chemically and biologically stable, bioactive ligand will assist in advancing an understanding of the regulated expression and physicochemistry of the human and murine erythropoietin receptors.","['Wojchowski, D M', 'Caslake, L']","['Wojchowski DM', 'Caslake L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', '9013-20-1 (Streptavidin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins', '*Biotin/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Erythropoietin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Radioligand Assay/methods', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*analysis', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Streptavidin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1989/08/15 00:00,1989/08/15 00:01,['1989/08/15 00:00'],"['1989/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1989 Aug 15;74(3):952-8.,"['Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park 16802.']",['DK40242/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,['S0006-4971(20)75413-3 [pii]'],,,['Blood. 1989 Dec;74(8):2772-3.

In all 11 T-cell malignancies, rearrangement and/or deletion of TCR delta was detected irrespective of the stage of maturation of the tumor. The organization of TCR delta correlated with the phenotype of the tumor: In ""prethymic"" T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), TCR delta was the only TCR gene to be rearranged. More mature T cell malignancies expressing CD4 together with CD3 showed deletion of both alleles of TCR delta, suggestive of TCR V alpha-J alpha rearrangement. All 43 B-cell tumors expressing surface immunoglobulin (sIg), including two cases of adult B-cell ALL, had germline configuration of TCR delta/alpha. In contrast, all 17 B-cell precursor ALLs (null, common, and pre-B-cell ALLs) had rearrangement and/or deletion of TCR delta/alpha. A single case of ""histiocytic"" lymphoma also showed biallelic deletion of TCR delta. Oligoclonal rearrangements of Ig and TCR genes were observed in two cases of B-cell precursor ALL and in one case of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Patterns of such ""aberrant"" TCR rearrangement were similar to those observed in T-lineage malignancies. In particular, seven of eight cases of B-cell precursor ALL and the histiocytic lymphoma which demonstrated biallelic TCR delta deletion, (suggestive of a V alpha-J alpha rearrangement) had clonal TCR beta rearrangement. These data support the hypothesis that supposedly aberrant rearrangements of the TCR genes may follow the same developmental controls as found in T-cell differentiation, despite the lack of evidence for further commitment to the T-cell lineage. TCR delta rearrangement is a useful marker of clonality of immature T-cell tumors which may have only this gene rearranged but is not specific to the T-cell lineage.","['Dyer, M J']",['Dyer MJ'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Child', 'Cytoplasm/analysis', '*Gene Rearrangement, alpha-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/*genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/classification/genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/classification/genetics', 'Lymphoma/classification/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics']",1989/08/15 00:00,1989/08/15 00:01,['1989/08/15 00:00'],"['1989/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1989 Aug 15;74(3):1073-83.,"['Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, England.']",,,['S0006-4971(20)75431-5 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

There was no subpopulation of growth factor-responsive or differentiation-defective cells before induction of differentiation in either type of clone. In both clones, induction of differentiation-induced requirement for a hematopoietic protein for cell viability. Viability of the cells was maintained by IL-6, IL-3, or macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) but not by GM-CSF in the cells differentiated by IL-6, and by GM-CSF or IL-3 but not by IL-6 or M-CSF in the cells differentiated by GM-CSF or IL-3. The viable cells with a differentiated phenotype continued to multiply. In undifferentiated leukemic cells with no or few surface receptors for some of these proteins, there was an upregulation of the number of receptors during differentiation for the proteins to which the cells responded. But there were also differentiating leukemic cells with an upregulation of GM-CSF receptors although GM-CSF could not maintain the viability of the differentiating cells. The results indicate that induction of hormone responsiveness and upregulation of the hormone receptors can both occur in differentiating leukemic cells, and that the regulation of these two events can be separated.","['Lotem, J', 'Sachs, L']","['Lotem J', 'Sachs L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6', 'Interleukins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1989 Aug 1;74(2):579-85.,"['Department of Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",,,['S0006-4971(20)85345-2 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In 13 of 15 cases of primary AML high-affinity (kd 26 to 414 pmol/L) receptors for IL-3 were demonstrable on the cells. The average numbers of IL-3 receptors ranged from 21 to 145 receptors per cell. Normal WBCs showed IL-3 receptors on their surface at similar densities. IL-3 receptor positivity often correlated with GM-CSF receptor positivity of AML; GM-CSF receptors were demonstrated on the cells of 11 of 15 cases, although average numbers of GM-CSF receptors were ten times greater. The in vitro response of the cells to exogenous IL-3 or GM-CSF was examined by measuring thymidine uptake. Because IL-3 and GM-CSF were potent inducers of DNA synthesis in vitro, apparently relatively few receptors are required to permit activation of growth. These experiments did not provide evidence for overexpression or increased receptor sensitivity as an explanation for AML growth. In a minority of cases, however, the cells were unable to respond to IL-3 (four of 15 cases) or GM-CSF (four of 15 cases) despite normal receptor availability on the cell surface.","['Budel, L M', 'Touw, I P', 'Delwel, R', 'Clark, S C', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Budel LM', 'Touw IP', 'Delwel R', 'Clark SC', 'Lowenberg B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*metabolism', 'Eosinophils/metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*metabolism', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*analysis', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1989 Aug 1;74(2):565-71.,"['Dr Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,['S0006-4971(20)85343-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We further analyzed IgH gene rearrangements in detail using upstream to DH (diversity region of IgH) region probe to distinguish DJ from V-DJ recombination. All dual genotyped cells in each stage except one case in stage II showed the V-DJ rearrangements. This suggests the cross-lineage involvement of the putative recombinase, particularly in the process of V-DJ rearrangements. We next examined the transcriptional status of Ig genes as an indirect reflection of the accessibility of these genes to the recombinase. Properly spliced IgH transcripts of normal size were observed in stage IV and surface Ig positive stage, but not in stage II nor III. However, IgH transcripts of aberrant sizes were seen in stage II, III, and also IV. Cross-lineage gene rearrangements were shown to occur frequently when normally spliced IgH gene begins to be transcribed or just before this. These findings may implicate that V-DJ or V-VDJ gene rearrangements forming functional IgH genes, induce frequently TCR or TRG gene rearrangements.

This line mediated strong lysis of tumor target lines expressing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens, such as Raji, CEM, and Molt-4 cells, but no killing of K562 and Daudi cells, which are deficient in MHC class I. In contrast, lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells from normal donors destroyed all these tumor targets, without MHC restriction. Line AK-1, originating from residual normal T cells present in the leukemic blood, lysed autologous leukemic blasts and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from many but not all allogeneic individuals but failed to kill autologous remission lymphocytes. Destruction of the autologous leukemic targets by AK-1 could be inhibited by unlabeled competitor target cells that were lysed by AK-1, but not by target cells that were not lysed. This suggests that AK-1 specifically recognized an alien determinant on the autologous ALL cells, crossreactive with allogeneic MHC class I antigens. This reactivity with some degree of tumor specificity may be a leukemic equivalent to responses reported for populations of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) seen in some solid tumors.","['Fisch, P', 'Weil-Hillman, G', 'Uppenkamp, M', 'Hank, J A', 'Chen, B P', 'Sosman, J A', 'Bridges, A', 'Colamonici, O R', 'Sondel, P M']","['Fisch P', 'Weil-Hillman G', 'Uppenkamp M', 'Hank JA', 'Chen BP', 'Sosman JA', 'Bridges A', 'Colamonici OR', 'Sondel PM']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'CD3 Complex', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1989 Jul;74(1):343-53.,"['Department of Human Oncology, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53792.']","['CA-32685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CM-47669/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-03186/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,['S0006-4971(20)77361-1 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In this investigation, studies on the receptors for EP were extended to other mouse erythroid cells and human erythroid cells as well as to the placentas of mice and rats. Only lower affinity receptors for EP were detected on erythroblasts purified from the spleens of mice infected with the polycythemia strain of Friend virus and a murine erythroleukemia cell line, both of which are not responsive to EP in culture. Internalization of 125I-EP was observed in both groups of cells. The structure of the receptor determined by cross-linking 125I-EP was two equally labeled proteins of 100 Kd and 85 Kd molecular mass in all these mouse erythroid cells. The structure of the receptor was found to be very similar in human erythroid colony forming cells cultured from normal blood. These cells respond to EP with erythroid maturation and were previously shown to have high and lower affinity receptors. Placentas from mice and rats were found to have only lower affinity receptors for EP, and when placental membranes were cross-linked to 125I-EP, the same 100 Kd and 85 Kd bands were found as seen in mouse and human erythroid cells.

A similar pattern of DNA fragmentation was observed when these cells were gamma-irradiated or treated with cycloheximide. Distinct morphological changes occurred after treatment, indicating a form of cell death, regulated from within, termed apoptosis. A set of nuclear proteins ranging in size from 10-18 kDa appeared by 40 h following treatment with dexamethasone. Treatment of cells with gamma-irradiation or cycloheximide also produced the same protein pattern. This set of proteins, and a doublet approximately 55 kDa in size, had apparent nuclease activity which was not observed in untreated cells. However, protein microsequencing of these bands in the 10-18 kDa region revealed that they were histone proteins.

Variants that were resistant to ACV were found to be thymidine kinase deficient. Evidence for alteration in the DNA polymerase was not found when ACV triphosphate or phosphonoacetic acid was used as the inhibitor. In vivo studies with the plaque-purified viruses showed that ACV resistance was associated with a reduced neurovirulence.

This process begins with multipotential stem cells which can self-renew and also undergo progressive differentiation to progenitor cells committed to particular lineages, ultimately yielding mature blood cells (D. Metcalf and M. A. S. Moore, Haematopoietic Cells, 1971). Early commitment of lymphoid progenitors is generally believed to separate the lymphoid lineage from the myeloid and erythroid lineages, whose progenitors are separated late in differentiation (Metcalf and Moore, 1971). We recently developed a derivative of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) in which the enhancer sequences from simian virus 40 were substituted into the M-MuLV long terminal repeat. This recombinant virus (delta Mo + SV M-MuLV) induces pre-B and B lymphoid leukemia with long latency after inoculation of 2-day-old NIH Swiss mice (R. Hanecak, P. K. Pattengale, and H. Fan, J. Virol. 62:2427-2436, 1988). In this report, we describe the derivation of a permanent, virus-producing cell line with the phenotypic characteristics of mature macrophages from a B-cell-derived lymphoblastic lymphoma induced by delta Mo + SV M-MuLV. Comparison studies of immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangements and also delta Mo + SV M-MuLV proviral integration sites confirmed that the macrophage cell line was derived from the original B-lymphoblastic lymphoma. Moreover, inoculation of the macrophage cell line into animals resulted in histiocytic sarcomas of the macrophage type, thus reflecting stable conversion of B-lymphoid tumor cells to the macrophage phenotype. These results suggest a closer relationship between lymphoid and myeloid cells than previously believed.","['Hanecak, R', 'Zovich, D C', 'Pattengale, P K', 'Fan, H']","['Hanecak R', 'Zovich DC', 'Pattengale PK', 'Fan H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Lymphoma/genetics/microbiology/*pathology', 'Macrophages/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Simian virus 40/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1989 May;9(5):2264-8. doi: 10.1128/mcb.9.5.2264-2268.1989.,"['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine 92717.']",,PMC363027,['10.1128/mcb.9.5.2264-2268.1989 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In the M1 type, Auer rods were of high prognostic significance regarding both the induction success (P = 0.003) and the remission duration (P = 0.004), whereas no significant differences between Auer rod-positive and -negative patients in other subtypes were found. Occurrence of Auer rods was independent of hyperleukocytosis, the most powerful prognostic parameter in the studies AML-BFM-78 and -83, whereas absence of Auer rods was associated with the AML risk group M5. In the M1 type, Auer rod-negative leukemias appears to represent cases of poorly differentiated AML.

In contrast to the endogenous nonrearranged MMTV proviruses, these mutated copies are highly expressed in leukemic T cells. To investigate whether the sequence alterations in the LTR are responsible for the high expression of rearranged MMTV proviruses, we made constructs in which normal and variant LTRs drive the bacterial reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). Two different rearranged LTRs were used, one containing a 420-base-pair (bp) deletion (L13) and another carrying a 456-bp deletion plus an 82-bp insertion (L42). These constructs were transfected into murine (GRSL) and human (MOLT-4) T-cell lines that either had or had not been treated with phorbol ester (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate [TPA]). In GRSL cells, the L13-LTR-CAT construct showed transcriptional activity that was further enhanced by TPA. In MOLT-4 cells, both variant LTRs were active, but only after stimulation with TPA. In contrast, normal(N)-LTR-CAT constructs were not expressed, irrespective of TPA addition. In XC rat fibrosarcoma cells, neither normal nor variant LTRs gave rise to detectable CAT activity, either in the presence or in the absence of TPA, but dexamethasone strongly stimulated CAT activity driven by N and L42 LTRs. The L13 LTR was considerably less active, probably caused by the deletion of the distal part of the glucocorticoid responsive element. We conclude that the LTR rearrangements generate TPA responsiveness and contribute to T-cell-specific expression of MMTV variants.","['Theunissen, H J', 'Paardekooper, M', 'Maduro, L J', 'Michalides, R J', 'Nusse, R']","['Theunissen HJ', 'Paardekooper M', 'Maduro LJ', 'Michalides RJ', 'Nusse R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*microbiology', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Aug;63(8):3466-71. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.8.3466-3471.1989.,"['Division of Molecular Biology, Antoni van Leeuwenhoekhuis, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam.']",,PMC250923,['10.1128/JVI.63.8.3466-3471.1989 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, when the virus was passaged, the elongated LTRs efficiently duplicated, placing histidinol dehydrogenase-coding sequences in the 5' LTR just 30 nucleotides from the flanking cellular DNA. Selection for histidinol expression generated cell clones in which histidinol gene sequences in the 5' LTR were invariably expressed on transcripts initiating in nearby cellular sequences. The efficiency of transducing histidinol resistance was 2,500-fold lower than the efficiency of transducing neomycin resistance when the neomycin phosphotransferase gene was located within the retrovirus and expressed from an independent promoter. By tagging transcriptionally active sites, the vector provides a means to identify and isolate promoters active in different cell types. Furthermore, the virus may be useful as an insertional mutagen, since selection for cell populations containing proviruses only in expressed sites is expected to reduce the number of intergrants needed to screen for loss of gene function.","['von Melchner, H', 'Ruley, H E']","['von Melchner H', 'Ruley HE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', 'EC 1.1.- (Alcohol Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.23 (histidinol dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.95 (Kanamycin Kinase)']",IM,"['Alcohol Oxidoreductases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Markers', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Kanamycin Kinase', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Phosphotransferases/genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Aug;63(8):3227-33. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.8.3227-3233.1989.,"['Center for Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge 02139.']","['14051/PHS HHS/United States', 'P01CA42063/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC250892,['10.1128/JVI.63.8.3227-3233.1989 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we investigate the effects of the immediate (DGLA, precursor to PGE1), arachidonic acid (AA, PGE precursors, dihomogamma linolenic acid (DGLA, precursor to PGE1), arachidonic acid (AA, precursor to PGE2), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, precursor to PGE3) on IL-2 production by PHA-stimulated human PBMC. DGLA and AA inhibited IL-2 production in a dose-dependent manner: half-maximal inhibition was obtained by using the fatty acids at the dose of 10 micrograms/ml without significant effects on cell viability. EPA inhibited IL-2 production by PBMC of only some donors. Incubation of cells in the presence of oleic, stearic, and palmitic acids, which are not PG precursors, did not affect mitogen-induced IL-2 production. A progressive increase in incorporation of DGLA into cellular lipids was observed over a 48-h incubation period. IL-2 production was reduced also when PBMC were pretreated overnight with DGLA or AA and washed before exposure to PHA. Whereas addition of the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, at the time of mitogenic stimulation led to increased IL-2 production and prevented mitogen- and fatty acid-induced increases in PGE release, it had no significant effect on the capacity of the fatty acids to suppress IL-2 production. Time course experiments showed that DGLA and AA inhibited IL-2 production even at times of minimal or no PGE release by the treated cultures. Moreover, DGLA and AA inhibited IL-2 production by the human leukemia T cell line Jurkat which, when appropriately induced, is able to release high levels of IL-2 in the absence of accessory cells and measurable PGE production. Taken together, these data indicate that essential fatty acids inhibit IL-2 production directly without conversion into their cyclo-oxygenase pathway products, and suggest that human lymphocyte function may be altered profoundly by small changes in their fatty acid profile.","['Santoli, D', 'Zurier, R B']","['Santoli D', 'Zurier RB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Linolenic Acids)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Prostaglandins E)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '78YC2MAX4O (gamma-Linolenic Acid)']",IM,"['Arachidonic Acid', 'Arachidonic Acids/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Linolenic Acids/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Phytohemagglutinins', 'Prostaglandins E/metabolism/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'gamma-Linolenic Acid']",1989/08/15 00:00,1989/08/15 00:01,['1989/08/15 00:00'],"['1989/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Aug 15;143(4):1303-9.,"['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, PA 19104.']","['AR 38501/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 47589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['J Immunol 1990 Jan 15;144(2):774'],,,,,,,,,,,

Assays of spleen cells for their ability to generate in vitro CTL responses to TNP-modified autologous cells (self + x CTL) and to alloantigens (allo CTL) showed that self + x CTL responses were greatly impaired at 3 to 4 wk postinfection and were undetectable thereafter. Allo CTL responses were normal at 3 to 4 wk, but were reduced at 8 to 9 wk and absent at 14 wk postinfection. This sequential loss of self + x and allo CTL responses was related to a selective defect in Ly-4(CD4)+ Th cell function associated with impaired production of IL-2 and deficient proliferative responses to Con A or to soluble Ag. Changes in the functional characteristics of Ly-4(CD4)+ T cells were unrelated to changes in their frequency in spleen, but did correlate with marked alterations in their distribution among four subsets defined by mAb SM3C11 and SM6C10. Assays of CTL responses generated by mixtures of spleen cells from normal and infected mice suggested that active suppression of Ly-4(CD4)+ Th function may contribute to this defect.

In contrast to the usual surface budding of the enveloped virus on the plasma membrane of vertebrate cells leading to cytolysis within 20 h, K-562 cells do not show surface budding, and the cells remain intact for periods of several months. Several unusual features of the infection include: 1) the rough endoplasmic reticulum arranges early into continuous perinuclear chains; 2) during the time of virus replication and release, the nucleocapsids aggregate on the cytoplasmic side of internal vesicles in the region of the cell where the Golgi complex is normally located; and 3) during this same time period, the vesicles are seen to contain enveloped virions and rod-like formations, a result suggesting that budding has occurred into these vesicles. Viruses are presumably released from the cell as these vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane. By 12 days post-infection and thereafter, the intact cells show electron-dense aggregates of chromatin, large vacuoles and lipid inclusions throughout the cytoplasm, and only a few virion-containing vesicles.","['Brady, B E', 'Gerard, D', 'Wust, C J', 'Lozzio, C B', 'Brown, A']","['Brady BE', 'Gerard D', 'Wust CJ', 'Lozzio CB', 'Brown A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Cell Biol,European journal of cell biology,7906240,,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Inclusion Bodies/*ultrastructure', 'Semliki forest virus', 'Togaviridae Infections/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*ultrastructure']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cell Biol. 1989 Apr;48(2):203-11.,"['Department of Microbiology, University of Tennessee, Knoxville 37996-0845.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The others include herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1, HSV type 2, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). In a series of two articles, we review the clinical diseases caused by VZV and EBV infections; we pay particular attention to the manifestations of these two viral infections in immunosuppressed and immunocompromised patients. In addition to the clinical reviews, each of the two articles begins with a brief discussion of the molecular aspects of VZV and EBV, respectively; this introduction describes features of the genome and immunogenic viral proteins which have clinical relevance. A model for pathogenesis is included. The first review concerns VZV infections. Recent data about the DNA sequence of the entire VZV genome are included, as well as a review of the VZV glycoproteins. Primary VZV infection (chickenpox) and VZV reactivation (zoster) are described in detail in both healthy individuals and people with cancer. The decade-long VZV vaccine trials in children with leukemia receive special emphasis because they have engendered considerable interest and debate. The second review (published here) covers EBV infections. This virus has been implicated in the causation of a wide variety of human hematological and oncological disorders, besides classical infectious mononucleosis. In particular, Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and lymphoproliferative disorders are strongly associated with EBV infection of the transformed cells. In addition, immunologically mediated cytopenias occasionally follow EBV infection. Finally, treatment regimens with antiviral chemotherapy and other agents are discussed for both VZV and EBV infections.","['Giller, R H', 'Grose, C']","['Giller RH', 'Grose C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,,IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/etiology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Viral', 'Hematologic Diseases/etiology', '*Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Infectious Mononucleosis/etiology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 1989;9(2):149-95. doi: 10.1016/s1040-8428(89)80009-5.,"['Department of Pediatrics, University of Iowa Hospitals, Iowa City.']",,,"['S1040-8428(89)80009-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s1040-8428(89)80009-5 [doi]']",,,,,217,,,,,,,

At pH 7.4, the fluorescence of DNR in HL-60 cells appears distributed diffusely in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. In contrast, HL-60/AR cells show much less fluorescence in the nucleus and cytoplasm; most of the fluorescence localizes first to the Golgi apparatus and is then gradually shifted to the lysosomes and/or mitochondria. In pharmacokinetic studies, HL-60/AR cells exposed to different extracellular concentrations of [14C]DNR consistently accumulated less radioactive drug than the parent HL-60 cells. Incubation of HL-60/AR cells with sodium azide and deoxyglucose blocked the efflux of [14C]DNR and also prevented the shift of DNR fluorescence from the Golgi apparatus to the lysosomes/mitochondria. The efflux and the intracellular shift of DNR could also be inhibited by lowering the temperature to 18 degrees C, which stops endosomal membrane fusion. When DNR was allowed to accumulate in HL-60 or HL-60/AR cells at pH 5 there was an increase in the proportion of drug fluorescence in the membranes of both HL-60 and HL-60/AR cells; a decrease in the amount of drug retained by HL-60, but not by HL-60/AR cells; and a decrease in the cytostatic effects of DNR on both HL-60 and HL-60/AR cells. These data suggest that DNR resistance is associated with a failure of DNR to pass through membranes and to bind to cytoplasmic and nuclear structures. Instead, most of the drug is taken up by the Golgi apparatus from which it is then shifted to the lysosomes or to mitochondria, or out of the cell.","['Hindenburg, A A', 'Gervasoni, J E Jr', 'Krishna, S', 'Stewart, V J', 'Rosado, M', 'Lutzky, J', 'Bhalla, K', 'Baker, M A', 'Taub, R N']","['Hindenburg AA', 'Gervasoni JE Jr', 'Krishna S', 'Stewart VJ', 'Rosado M', 'Lutzky J', 'Bhalla K', 'Baker MA', 'Taub RN']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Azides)', '0 (Protons)', '968JJ8C9DV (Sodium Azide)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Azides/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacokinetics', 'Deoxyglucose/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Fluorescence', 'Golgi Apparatus/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Protons', 'Sodium Azide', 'Temperature']",1989/08/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1989/08/15 00:00'],"['1989/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1989/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Aug 15;49(16):4607-14.,"['Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032.']","['CA-31761/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 120-kDa membrane-associated form is a phosphorylated glycoprotein, which is derived from a non-phosphorylated intracellular 84-kDa apoprotein that is co-translationally N-glycosylated with a carbohydrate portion of 6 kDa. The other form of the Ki-1 antigen is a non-glycosylated phosphoprotein of 57 kDa which only occurs intracellularly. Both forms of the antigen are phosphorylated at serine residues. Enzymatic cleavage with sialidase reduced the 120-kDa membrane antigen by about 15 kDa, while its 90-kDa precursor and the 57-kDa intracellular form of the Ki-1 antigen remained unaltered. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the 57-kDa and 90/120-kDa molecules are synthesized independently of each other. Four to eight hours after synthesis, the degradation of the 120-kDa molecule to a 105-kDa membrane-associated intermediate begins.

To test this assumption the expression of both SFFV and helper virus in partially congenic mice which differ at the Fv-2 locus, a gene that specifically controls susceptibility to SFFV, was analysed. When the mice were infected with LLV (a strain of Friend SFFV-free helper virus), there was no detectable effect of Fv-2 genotype on LLV expression as tested by virus infectivity in the XC plaque assay or by quantitative viral antigen analysis in an immunoprecipitation assay. However, after infection with FV complex there was an amplification of LLV (as well as SFFV) synthesis in Fv-2s as compared with Fv-2r hosts. To determine whether the increased LLV synthesis in Fv-2s mice was due to an increased population of susceptible target cells as a result of SFFV infection and/or transformation, the ratios of LLV-infected cells in the spleens of LLV- and FV-infected Fv-2s hosts in an infectious centre assay, were compared. Since the percentage of LLV-infected cells was equivalent in both instances, the higher rate of LLV synthesis after infection with FV complex was presumably due to intrinsic properties of SFFV-infected erythroid cells.","['Anand, R', 'Steeves, R A', 'Lilly, F']","['Anand R', 'Steeves RA', 'Lilly F']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Microbios,Microbios,0207257,['0 (Retroviridae Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Organ Size', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Spleen/microbiology/pathology', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*physiology', 'Viral Plaque Assay', '*Virus Replication']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Microbios. 1989;58(235):71-82.,"['Department of Molecular Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461.']","['19873/PHS HHS/United States', '19931/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) established in this way carry the latent EBV genome as multiple copies of an extrachromosomal episome. Viral gene expression in LCLs is highly restricted; products identified correspond to a membrane protein (latent membrane protein; LMP), a nuclear antigen complex (Epstein-Barr nuclear antigens; EBNAs 1 to 6), two small RNA species (EBERs 1 and 2) and RNA species thought to encode a second membrane-associated polypeptide designated terminal protein (TP). Here we have investigated the temporal sequence of expression of the characterized 'latent' proteins during the initiation of immortalization when resting B cells are stimulated to enter and traverse the cell cycle. The analysis has been carried out on prolymphocytic leukaemia cells infected in vitro with either the immortalizing B95-8 strain of virus or the non-immortalizing P3HR1 strain. The results reveal that following B95-8 infection, a sequence of EBV expression is initiated within approximately 8 h with the synthesis of detectable levels of EBNA 2 shortly followed by EBNAs 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6. There is then a delay of approximately 40 h until the expression of LMP completes the latent pattern of proteins found in LCLs. P3HR1 infection, however, produces only transient expression of some EBNA species in a small percentage of cells after approximately 48 h. These observations suggest the failure of P3HR1 virus to immortalize may not be due solely to the absence of EBNA 2 expression and that cellular and/or virus-mediated events occur after EBNA synthesis which then facilitate efficient LMP expression and immortalization.","['Allday, M J', 'Crawford, D H', 'Griffin, B E']","['Allday MJ', 'Crawford DH', 'Griffin BE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus)', '0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/analysis/*microbiology/pathology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/analysis/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/metabolism/*microbiology/pathology', 'Mice', '*Viral Matrix Proteins']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1989 Jul;70 ( Pt 7):1755-64. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-70-7-1755.,"['Department of Virology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, U.K.']",,,['10.1099/0022-1317-70-7-1755 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we describe the morphologic and functional characteristics of IL-2-dependent cytotoxic lymphocytes derived from feline PBL. Stimulation of feline PBL with Con A followed by culturing in 50 U of gibbon monkey IL-2 human rIL-2 induced long term lymphocyte cultures. These lymphocytes are cytotoxic for the feline leukemia virus-induced T cell lymphoma (FL74), in a 4-h 51Cr release assay. All cell lines are either constitutively cytotoxic for FL74 cells, or cytotoxic in a lectin-dependent cell cytotoxic assay, the latter being a characteristic of low passage cultures. In contrast, no cell lines express self lysis or lysis for other lines. [3H]TdR uptake showed that 1 U of human rIL-2 produces a 50% maximal proliferative response by feline lymphocytes suggesting a high degree of homology between the ligand binding sites of feline and human IL-2R. Feline cytotoxic lymphocytes possess abundant cytoplasm containing large azurophilic granules characteristic of LGL. These granules are bound by a bilipid membrane and contain numerous smaller membrane-bound vesicles 50 to 60 nm in diameter. A model is proposed, whereby subsequent to binding of LGL to target cell the large granules fuse to the LGL plasma membrane and release the small vesicles into the binding pocket.

At least one of these, the alpha 3 chain, represents a novel form for which protein products and enzymatic activities are just beginning to be defined in rodents. We have recently demonstrated that expression of alpha 3 is largely confined to neuromuscular tissues of fetal and adult rats (Schneider, J. W., R. W. Mercer, M. Gilmore-Hebert, M. F. Utset, C.

In uninduced HL60 cells, alpha 3 mRNA comprised 20-30% of total Na+,K+-ATPase mRNA. Furthermore, in HL60 and HEL cells, both alpha and alpha 3 mRNA declined after induction of maturation by DMSO, retinoic acid, or hemin. However, the reduction in alpha 3 mRNA was far more dramatic. alpha 3 mRNA virtually disappeared, but alpha mRNA declined by only approximately 50%. In contrast, when maturation of HL60 cells along the monocyte/macrophage lineage was induced by exposure to phorbol esters, alpha 3 mRNA remained abundant. Moreover, mRNA for the beta subunit of the Na+,K+-ATPase increased dramatically. Our results demonstrate that the alpha 3 isoform, formerly thought to be confined to neuromuscular tissues, is expressed in restricted lineages of hematopoietic origin. These leukemia cell lines should provide a useful model for analyzing regulation of the alpha 3 isoform gene and characterization of alpha 3 isoform activities.","['Gilmore-Hebert, M', 'Schneider, J W', 'Greene, A L', 'Berliner, N', 'Stolle, C A', 'Lomax, K', 'Mercer, R W', 'Benz, E J Jr']","['Gilmore-Hebert M', 'Schneider JW', 'Greene AL', 'Berliner N', 'Stolle CA', 'Lomax K', 'Mercer RW', 'Benz EJ Jr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'DNA', 'DNA Probes', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic System/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/*genetics']",1989/07/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1989 Jul;84(1):347-51. doi: 10.1172/JCI114161.,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",,PMC303989,['10.1172/JCI114161 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

By adding to such reactions distamycin, a compound whose effects on DNA have been extensively characterized, we investigated the effects of drug binding upon topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage induced by VM-26. We have found a correspondence between distamycin binding (determined by footprinting analysis) and topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage of SV40 DNA (determined by sequencing gel analysis). Distamycin binding potentiated the cleavage of specific sites in the near proximity of distamycin-binding sites (within at least 25 base pairs), which indicates that DNA secondary structure is involved in topoisomerase II-DNA interactions. That distamycin potentiated cleavage only at sites that were recognized in the absence of distamycin and suppressed cleavage directly at distamycin-binding sites indicates that topoisomerase II recognizes DNA on the basis of primary sequence. In addition, distamycin stimulated topoisomerase II-mediated DNA relaxation and antagonized the inhibitory effect of VM-26. These results show that the DNA sequence-specific binding of distamycin produces local and propagated effects in the DNA which markedly affect topoisomerase II activity.","['Fesen, M', 'Pommier, Y']","['Fesen M', 'Pommier Y']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Distamycins)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Distamycins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electrophoresis', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation/drug effects', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Simian virus 40/*genetics', 'Teniposide/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/07/05 00:00,1989/07/05 00:01,['1989/07/05 00:00'],"['1989/07/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/05 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Jul 5;264(19):11354-9.,"['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",,,['S0021-9258(18)60471-5 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Effects on class II antigen expression.,26-31,"We have reported previously that the Kirsten murine sarcoma virus (Ki-MSV), which carries the v-Ki-ras oncogene, prevents the induction of the class II MHC antigen H-2A and reduces the induction of class I MHC antigens by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) on C3H10T 1/2 fibroblasts. It is here shown that the abolition by the virus of H-2A expression extends also to class II antigen H-2E and that this is maintained for at least 7 days after IFN treatment. In addition no concentration of IFN-gamma tested, including supra-optimal concentrations for class I antigen expression, induced class II antigens on MSV-infected cells. Thus MSV inhibits the induction by IFN-gamma of class II MHC antigens by a mechanism other than via a change in kinetics of response to, or in the sensitivity of the cells to, IFN. The possibility that transformation by MSV could result in the (selective) outgrowth of cells unresponsive to IFN was refuted by the observation that clones of C3H10T 1/2, when infected with Ki-MSV, expressed no or dramatically reduced levels of H-2A or H-2E. One C3H10T 1/2 clone chosen for high class II expression, when transformed with Ki-MSV, did express low levels of class II antigens at optimal concentrations of IFN-gamma, suggesting that the degree of the reduction of class II expression varies with the cells that are infected. Comparison with mechanisms whereby other viruses inhibit MHC antigen display revealed an interesting possibility: IFN response sequences (IRS) identified in the virus genomes might act in trans to (down) regulate MHC antigen expression. This could be an important mechanism determining the tumourigenicity of, and immune evasion by, Ki-MSV and other viruses.","['Maudsley, D J', 'Morris, A G']","['Maudsley DJ', 'Morris AG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*analysis', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Kirsten murine sarcoma virus/*immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/*immunology', 'Time Factors']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunology. 1989 May;67(1):26-31.,"['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K.']",,PMC1385283,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effects on class I antigen expression.,21-5,"We have reported previously that the Kirsten murine sarcoma virus (Ki-MSV) that carries the v-Ki-ras oncogene prevents C3H10T 1/2 fibroblasts from being able to respond to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) with the expression of the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen, H-2A. In this report we investigate further as to whether MSV or its parent virus Kirsten murine leukaemia virus (Ki-MLV) is able to reduce host class I MHC antigen expression. The results demonstrate that class I expression is diminished in MSV-infected cells over a time-course of 7 days after exposure to IFN-gamma and over a range of IFN-gamma concentrations. The optimal concentration of IFN-gamma for maximal class I expression remained unchanged. Cells infected with Ki-MLV, which failed to abolish the induction by IFN-gamma of class II antigens, also expressed lower levels of class I antigens, similar to those for cells infected with Ki-MSV, after exposure to IFN-gamma. It is likely therefore that the inhibition of class I induction is due to genetic material shared between the viruses, principally in the long terminal repeats (LTR), and hence that the mechanism of action is distinct from that responsible for the abolition of class II induction by Ki-MSV alone. Since class I antigens are required for CD8+ T cells (mainly cytotoxic T cells) to recognize (foreign) antigen this reduction in class I expression might lead to reduced visibility of infected cells to T cells and thus might contribute to the tumorigenicity of Ki-MSV-infected cells.","['Maudsley, D J', 'Morris, A G']","['Maudsley DJ', 'Morris AG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*analysis', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Kirsten murine sarcoma virus/*immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/*immunology', 'Time Factors']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunology. 1989 May;67(1):21-5.,"['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K.']",,PMC1385282,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, it has been suggested that amplification of the c-myc proto-oncogene is a co-operative event in v-abl induced fibroblast transformation. We have investigated amplification of the c-myc, p53 and c-fos nuclear proto-oncogenes in several Abelson murine leukaemia virus (A-MuLV) transformed fibroblast lines. None of these proto-oncogenes were detectably rearranged or amplified in v-abl transformed Swiss 3T3 lines. In contrast, NIH3T3 fibroblasts transformed by the v-abl gene consistently showed a 4 to 16-fold amplification of the c-myc gene. These data show that c-myc gene amplification is not an obligatory event associated with A-MuLV transformation, but may be restricted to cell lines derived from NIH3T3. c-myc gene amplification also did not correlate with a reduced latency period for tumour induction in nude mice. In addition, c-myc amplification was not selected during tumourigenesis, indicating that this event is not required for A-MuLV transformed Swiss 3T3 cells to display a full tumourigenic phenotype.","['Colledge, W H', 'Gebhardt, A', 'Edge, M D', 'Bell, J C']","['Colledge WH', 'Gebhardt A', 'Edge MD', 'Bell JC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Fibroblasts/*microbiology/ultrastructure', '*Gene Amplification', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1989 Jun;4(6):753-7.,"['Laboratory of Eukaryotic Molecular Genetics, National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we show that MPLV-infected pluripotent, granulomacrophage and megakaryocyte progenitor cells proliferated and differentiated in semisolid cultures in the absence of the exogenous growth factors which are absolutely required for colony formation of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. These factor-independent colonies were morphologically and cytologically similar to normal colonies and did not show any sign of impaired differentiation. Factor-independent colony formation was not influenced by the seeding density. MPLV-infected cells were unable to stimulate colony development of uninfected progenitors in coculture assays, and retransplanted clusters continued to grow in the absence of accessory cells. These data suggest that spontaneous colony formation does not result from a paracrine secretion of growth factors and indicate that MPLV is unique among naturally occurring murine retrovirus for its ability to abrogate the growth factor requirements of a broad spectrum of hematopoietic progenitor cells.","['Wendling, F', 'Vigon, I', 'Souyri, M', 'Tambourin, P']","['Wendling F', 'Vigon I', 'Souyri M', 'Tambourin P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Growth Substances/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/microbiology/pathology/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Spleen', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Jul;3(7):475-80.,"['Laboratoire Immunologie et Oncologie des Maladies Retrovirales, Hopital Cochin, Paris, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of the DNA sequence shows, however, that this gene, the T1c gene from the Tlac genotype, could not encode a TL antigen or any other functional class I molecule due to the presence of numerous stop codons and frameshift mutations in the coding regions. This result suggests that the earlier transformation data may have been incorrect or perhaps that the clone containing the T1c gene contains sequences that induced expression of a serologically reactive Tla gene in the genome of the recipient L cell. The T1c gene is structurally related to the previously sequenced T13c gene that encodes a serologically defined TL antigen. The 3' half of the T1c gene including exons 4, 5, 6, and the 3' untranslated region has about 85% nucleotide similarity (including introns) with the corresponding parts of the T13c gene; however, the 5' half of the T1c gene has little homology with the T13c gene. There is a sharp line of demarcation between the homologous and nonhomologous regions, and this border occurs precisely at a B2 Alu repeat sequence present in the T13c gene. This suggests that a recombination event took place here and that an Alu repeat sequence that is known to have characteristics of transposable elements played some role in a recombination or gene conversion event.","['Fisher, D A', 'Pecht, M', 'Hood, L']","['Fisher DA', 'Pecht M', 'Hood L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,J Mol Evol,Journal of molecular evolution,0360051,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/*genetics', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Gene Conversion', '*Genes, MHC Class I', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Pseudogenes', 'Recombination, Genetic', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Mol Evol. 1989 Apr;28(4):306-12. doi: 10.1007/BF02103426.,"['Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena 91125.']",['GM 06956/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,['10.1007/BF02103426 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Immediately after a 10-min pulse, gp52 was detected as a monomer in the upper part of the sucrose gradient (fractions 12 and 14) and it remained as such after a 2-h chase period. However, the processed form, gp65, was found in a lower part of the gradient (fraction 8) after a 2-h chase. The position of gp65 was found to correspond to the position of trimeric influenza hemagglutinin which was analyzed on a parallel sucrose gradient, suggesting that gp65 also exists as a trimer in this fraction. These results indicate that changes in the external domain of gp52 result in improper folding of the glycoprotein molecule, and suggest that this lack of oligomerization is responsible for the defective transport of the molecules. Only those molecules that do form oligomeric structures are transported to the Golgi complex and undergo further oligosaccharide processing, and transport to the cell surface.","['Kilpatrick, D R', 'Srinivas, R V', 'Compans, R W']","['Kilpatrick DR', 'Srinivas RV', 'Compans RW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Weight', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*genetics', 'Vaccinia virus/genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics/isolation & purification']",1989/06/25 00:00,1989/06/25 00:01,['1989/06/25 00:00'],"['1989/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Jun 25;264(18):10732-7.,"['Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama, Birmingham 35294.']","['CA 18611/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 40440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['S0021-9258(18)81683-0 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the cross-linking reagents disuccinimidyl suberate and dithiobissuccinimidyl propionate, we show that 125I-Epo can be specifically conjugated in a complex of 224kDa using mouse fetal liver cells, bone marrow cells, and Friend virus-induced splenic erythroblasts as demonstrated by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions. Under reducing conditions, the 224-kDa complex appeared as two Epo conjugates of 136 kDa and 119 kDa, and these bands were also observed to a variable extent in some nonreducing gels. Disulfide linking of the 136-kDa and 119-kDa bands was confirmed by two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis run under nonreducing followed by reducing conditions. With increasing time of 125I-Epo binding to Friend virus erythroblasts in the presence of sodium azide to inhibit receptor internalization, the 136-kDa and 119-kDa bands seen under reducing conditions increased markedly in intensity, whereas the 224-kDa band seen under nonreducing conditions declined. These results suggest that the 224-kDa Epo conjugate is inefficiently solubilized under nonreducing conditions following prolonged periods of Epo binding. A single class of saturable, high affinity receptors for Epo on each of the cell types tested is demonstrated. It is concluded that the two disulfide-linked Epo-binding proteins which can be independently cross-linked to Epo form a single ligand binding site.","['McCaffery, P J', 'Fraser, J K', 'Lin, F K', 'Berridge, M V']","['McCaffery PJ', 'Fraser JK', 'Lin FK', 'Berridge MV']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/*metabolism', 'Fetus', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Gestational Age', 'Kinetics', 'Liver/embryology/*metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Weight', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Spleen/metabolism']",1989/06/25 00:00,1989/06/25 00:01,['1989/06/25 00:00'],"['1989/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Jun 25;264(18):10507-12.,"['Malaghan Institute of Medical Research, Wellington School of Medicine, Wellington Hospital, New Zealand.']",,,['S0021-9258(18)81650-7 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

No single cytogenetic abnormality occurred commonly in the B-cell lymphomas, but some structural abnormalities were found in more than one stemline, in particular, ins (II) (A1; A2) in 3 tumors, and deletions involving the D-region of chromosome 14 in 3 other lymphomas.

Considering that DNA polymerase activity can be quantitated directly in crude sera, and that such analyses seems to give biological and clinical information, the development of an assay with improved sensitivity for extensive studies is justified.","['Neumuller, M', 'Kallander, C F', 'Gronowitz, J S']","['Neumuller M', 'Kallander CF', 'Gronowitz JS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Enzyme,Enzyme,1262265,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/blood/*enzymology', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*blood', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/blood/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/blood/*enzymology', 'Vitamin B 12/blood', 'Vitamin B 12 Deficiency/blood/*enzymology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Enzyme. 1989;41(1):6-16. doi: 10.1159/000469045.,"['Department of Medical Virology, Biomedical Center, Uppsala University, Sweden.']",,,['10.1159/000469045 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Investigators have attempted to correct or modulate dysfunction by removal of antibodies or CIC from plasma. Extra-corporeal immunoadsorption of plasma over columns containing a silica matrix and covalently attached highly purified staphylococcal protein A (PROSORBA column) is a procedure that specifically removes those plasma components by the interaction of protein A with the Fc region of IgG. The interaction of CIC with the Fc receptor on protein A has three specific results. First, there is direct removal of immunosuppressive CIC from the circulation. Studies of CIC-mediated immunosuppression in experimental systems have shown dose-response relationships over wide ranges of CIC concentrations. Thus, removal of CIC relative to the IgG antibody may be expected to exert some stimulation of the immune system. Second, the complement system is activated. Elevated levels of C3a, C4a, and C5a are observed in patients' circulating plasma after PROSORBA treatment. These levels peak one to three hours post-perfusion and are near normal levels by six hours post-perfusion. These complement components are stimulators of growth and activity of immune cells. In addition, by binding to CIC they stimulate clearance of CIC by the reticuloendothelial system. Thus, treatments may induce removal of more CIC than could be anticipated by the binding capacity of treatment columns. Third, antibody is released from CIC. Interaction of CIC with bound protein A with or without the aid of activated complement components leads to liberation of free antibody. Depending upon other factors, eg, amount of circulating antigen and/or unbound IgG, either free antibody or CIC containing more antibody relative to antigen (or both) may be infused into patients with the posttreatment plasma. Such CIC function as immune stimulators rather than suppressors of immune cell activity. The consequences of the treatments are summarized as follows. Stimulation of immune cellular activity is seen one to three hours posttreatment. During the first one to three treatments, cells of the granulocyte/macrophage series show the greatest increase. During and after treatments 2 to 4, lymphocytes show the greatest increase. At this point, increased blastogenic response to mitogens is observed along with an increase in the T helper/suppressor cell ratio.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Snyder, H W Jr', 'Balint, J P Jr', 'Jones, F R']","['Snyder HW Jr', 'Balint JP Jr', 'Jones FR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases/immunology/*therapy', 'Breast Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Cats', 'Humans', 'Immunosorbent Techniques/instrumentation', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Leukemia, Experimental/complications/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/immunology/*therapy', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic/immunology/*therapy']",1989/04/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 1989 Apr;26(2 Suppl 1):31-41.,"['IMRE Corp., Seattle, WA 98109.']",,,['0037-1963(89)90016-4 [pii]'],,,,,104,,,,,,,

Complete viral clearance and long-lasting tumor regression were achieved in nine of the cats and tumor regression without virus clearance was observed in two other cats. Since LSA cats rarely go into spontaneous remission, and since other forms of therapy are ineffective, these cats offered a unique system for analyzing details of the immune response to LSA and FeLV as they are cleared. Immunological parameters associated with the FeLV and LSA responses were assessed in detail in three responder cats and three nonresponders during the treatment and follow-up periods. Two serological parameters that always correlated with complete clearance of LSA were development of precipitating antibodies against FeLV-C gp70 and development of cytotoxic antibodies that kill cultured FL74 LSA cells in the presence of complement. The precipitating antibodies were detected prior to the clearance of LSA and prior to the detection of free cytotoxic antibodies. One serological parameter that always correlated with complete clearance of. FeLV was development of free antibodies to FeLV-AB gp70. Quantitative levels of FeLV-specific CIC and feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA)-specific CIC correlated well with fluctuating levels of the corresponding antigens and antibodies. These results suggest that the staphylococcal protein A treatment columns remove CIC ""blocking factors"" directly or indirectly and thereby stimulate existing antibody responses. These antibodies mediate clearance of FeLV and LSA.","['Snyder, H W Jr', 'Reed, D E', 'Jones, F R']","['Snyder HW Jr', 'Reed DE', 'Jones FR']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,['0 (Staphylococcal Protein A)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Cats', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Leukemia, Experimental/complications/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/immunology/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Staphylococcal Protein A/*therapeutic use']",1989/04/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 1989 Apr;26(2 Suppl 1):25-30.,"['IMRE Corp., Seattle, WA 98109.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The unique feature of DC vectors is that the transduced gene is inserted within the U3 region of the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR). Consequently, in the infected cell the gene is duplicated and transferred to the 5' LTR. The important result is that in its new position the gene is placed outside the retroviral transcriptional unit, eliminating or at least reducing the negative effects of the retroviral transcriptional unit. The utility of the DC vector design was tested by using a 2.1-kilobase-pair (kbp)-long adenosine deaminase (ADA; EC 3.5.4.4) minigene that was inserted into the 3' LTR of the N2 retroviral vector, generating a 2.7-kbp-long chimeric LTR. DNA blot analysis was used to show that the chimeric LTR was faithfully duplicated in cells infected with the corresponding virus, generating two copies of the ADA minigene, one copy in each LTR. Insertion of the ADA minigene into the 3' LTR of the N2 vector led to a 10- to 20-fold increase in ADA transcripts and human ADA isozyme synthesized in NIH 3T3 cells as compared to cells harboring the same vector in which the ADA minigene was inserted between the two LTRs. A similar increase in ADA expression was observed in two human lymphoid cell lines tested, HUT 78 and Raji. These results are consistent with previous observations that upstream promoters exert an inhibitory effect on promoters placed downstream and bear out the predictions used in the design of DC vectors. The use of DC vectors may contribute to the solution of the problems encountered in expressing retrovirally transduced genes in cultured cells and, in particular, when introduced into the live animal.","['Hantzopoulos, P A', 'Sullenger, B A', 'Ungers, G', 'Gilboa, E']","['Hantzopoulos PA', 'Sullenger BA', 'Ungers G', 'Gilboa E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Mice', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 May;86(10):3519-23. doi: 10.1073/pnas.86.10.3519.,"['Program in Molecular Biology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['CA-33050-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC287169,['10.1073/pnas.86.10.3519 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The CB-1 locus was mapped to murine chromosome 3 and was shown to be closely linked to another myeloid common site of viral integrations in myeloid leukemias, Evi-1. A comparison of the CB-1 restriction map with published restriction maps for other common integration sites demonstrated that it was nearly identical to the restriction map of a common site of Friend MuLV integration in myeloid tumors termed Fim-3 (Bordereaux et al. 1987). Genomic clones representing approximately 110 kb of the CB-1 locus and 80 kb of the 5' region of the Evi-1 locus demonstrate no physical overlap of these viral integration sites. Previous studies (Morishita et al. 1988) have shown that retroviral insertions in the Evi-1 locus activate the expression of a gene potentially encoding a 120 kd zinc finger protein. Evi-1 expression is also activated in cell lines with viral integrations in the CB-1 locus.

DNA from DA-2 cells transformed fibroblasts in DNA transfection experiments, and the transformed fibroblasts contained the rearranged H-ras locus. The rearrangement involved one allele and was present in tissue from the primary tumor from which the cell line was isolated. Cloning and sequencing of the rearranged allele and comparison with the normal allele demonstrated that the rearrangement was complex and probably resulted from the integration of a retrovirus in the H-ras locus between a 5' noncoding exon and the first coding exon and a subsequent homologous recombination between this provirus and another newly acquired provirus also located on chromosome 7. These events resulted in the translocation of the coding exons of the H-ras locus away from the 5' noncoding exon region to a new genomic site on chromosome 7. Sequencing of the coding regions of the gene failed to detect mutations in the 12th, 13th, 59th, or 61st codons.

The quinazoline ring of 2 and 4 was constructed from the pivotal intermediate 9 in a novel and unambiguous manner during the final step of the synthesis under very mild conditions. 2-Desamino-2-methyl-N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolate (DMPDDF) (2) was a strong inhibitor of human and Lactobacillus casei thymidylate synthases, whereas 2-desamino-2-(trifluoromethyl)-N10-propargyl-5,8-didezafolate (3) and 2-desamino-2,3-dimethyl-N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolate (4) were only weak inhibitors of this enzyme. DMPDDF exhibited excellent growth inhibition of Manca human lymphoid leukemia and H35 hepatoma cells in culture. The inhibitor activities of 2 were 43- and 65-fold greater than that of PDDF, respectively, in these cell lines. H35R cells that are resistant to methotrexate by virtue of a transport defect were cross resistant to DMPDDF but not to PDDF. H35FF cells which have 70-fold greater amounts of thymidylate synthase compared to H35N cells were 130-fold resistant to DMPDDF. Furthermore, the toxicity of DMPDDF to H35 hepatoma cells could be completely reversed by thymidine, establishing its locus of action as thymidylate synthase. Transport studies in vitro established that DMPDDF effectively inhibits MTX influx into H35 hepatoma cells, whereas PDDF has no effect on MTX transport in this cell line. These data suggest that the greater activity of DMPDDF relative to PDDF is partly due to the ability of the former compound to enter cells via the MTX/reduced folate transport system. Enzyme inhibition data of 4 suggest that the presence of N3H in DMPDDF is essential for binding to thymidylate synthase.","['Patil, S D', 'Jones, C', 'Nair, M G', 'Galivan, J', 'Maley, F', 'Kisliuk, R L', 'Gaumont, Y', 'Duch, D', 'Ferone, R']","['Patil SD', 'Jones C', 'Nair MG', 'Galivan J', 'Maley F', 'Kisliuk RL', 'Gaumont Y', 'Duch D', 'Ferone R']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '107174-40-3 (N(10)-propargyl-5,8-dideaza-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid)', '112887-78-2 (2-desamino-2-trifluoromethyl-N(10)-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid)', '119820-56-3 (2-desamino-2,3-dimethyl-N(10)-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'N8VP1Y24AU (ICI 198583)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology', 'Folic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Humans', 'Lactobacillus casei/drug effects/enzymology', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Molecular Structure', 'Streptococcus/drug effects', 'Tetrahydrofolates/pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1989 Jun;32(6):1284-9. doi: 10.1021/jm00126a023.,"['Department of Biochemistry, University of South Alabama, Mobile 36688.']","['CA 25933/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 27101/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32687/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,['10.1021/jm00126a023 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

To compare the relative ability of cytoplasts and cells to generate second-messengers (inositol phosphates, Ca2+) in response to stimulation of the high affinity receptor for IgE, we normalized our results per recovered receptor by using the tightly bound IgE as a marker. This marker correlated well with other estimates of plasma membrane recovery. Furthermore, data normalized on this basis correlated well with data expressed as percentage of phosphoinositides hydrolyzed. The purest fraction of cytoplasts (containing about 6% of the receptors) was satisfactorily devoid of organelles and, at early times, generated about 50% as much inositol phosphates per receptor as did the intact, untreated cells. This response of the cytoplasts, like that of the cells, was totally dependent upon aggregation of the receptors. The response by the cytoplasts (in the 5-min time frame which we examined), unlike that of the cells, was not enhanced by the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Furthermore, unlike the cells, the cytoplasts failed to raise their intracellular free Ca2+ levels after addition of polyvalent Ag.

We have studied the expression of this gene either after introduction of the corresponding human chromosome into murine erythroid cells using somatic hybrids or after transfection into both erythroid and non-erythroid cells. Using somatic hybrids, we showed that activation of the erythroid-specific promoter of the PBG-D gene did not reduce the rate of initiation of the ubiquitous promoter. Transfection experiments in erythroid cells showed that the PBG-D erythroid transcription unit, controlled by the PBG-D erythroid promoter, was correctly transcribed and regulated. Furthermore, we found that the PBG-D erythroid promoter alone was sufficient for correct expression and regulation of a reporter gene during erythroid differentiation. When the human PBG-D gene was transfected into non-erythroid cells, only the ubiquitous promoter was active. Deletion of the ubiquitous promoter did not lead to any activation of the erythroid promoter, suggesting that its inactivity in non-erythroid cells was not due to promoter occlusion but to a strict erythroid specificity.","['Raich, N', 'Mignotte, V', 'Dubart, A', 'Beaupain, D', 'Leboulch, P', 'Romana, M', 'Chabret, C', 'Charnay, P', 'Papayannopoulou, T', 'Goossens, M']","['Raich N', 'Mignotte V', 'Dubart A', 'Beaupain D', 'Leboulch P', 'Romana M', 'Chabret C', 'Charnay P', 'Papayannopoulou T', 'Goossens M', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.5.1.61 (Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase)', 'EC 4.3.1.- (Ammonia-Lyases)']",IM,"['Ammonia-Lyases/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Genes', 'Globins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Plasmids', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Simian virus 40/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', '*Transfection']",1989/06/15 00:00,1989/06/15 00:01,['1989/06/15 00:00'],"['1989/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Jun 15;264(17):10186-92.,"['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale Unite, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.']",,,['S0021-9258(18)81783-5 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report that the U3 region of BLV LTR contains multiple regulatory elements responsive to p38tax. A core element composing the p38tax-inducible U3 structure is suggested to be a heptanucleotide motif of 5'TGACGTCA3', the consensus sequence proposed for a cAMP-responsive element (CRE) and for the binding sites of a cellular transcription factor (ATF). Adenovirus-5 E3 and E4, c-fos and somatostatin regulatory regions containing CRE/ATF-element exhibited responsiveness to p38tax in a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase transient expression assay.

Members of a nested set of deletion mutations of the N-terminus of c-abl type IV in this expression system will activate abl to transform murine fibroblasts. The smallest of these deletions, delta XB, efficiently transforms lymphoid cells in vitro and causes leukemia in vivo demonstrating that gag sequences are not necessary for abl-induced leukemogenesis.

We proposed that a specific receptor for hemopexin was present on the plasma membranes of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs).

These observations suggest that the decreased incorporation of [3H]thymidine and [3H]uridine into acid-precipitable material that we observed earlier in the AD 143-treated cells may in part be the result of the AD 143-induced alteration of cell membrane activities, which in turn causes an inhibition of nucleoside uptake.","['Lameh, J', 'Chuang, R Y', 'Israel, M', 'Chuang, L F']","['Lameh J', 'Chuang RY', 'Israel M', 'Chuang LF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Nucleosides)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '80787-29-7 (N-trifluoroacetyladriamycin-14-O-hemiadipate)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Membrane Fluidity/*drug effects', 'Nucleosides/*pharmacokinetics', 'Thymidine/pharmacokinetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Uridine/pharmacokinetics']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Jun 1;49(11):2905-8.,"['Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis 95616.']","['CA 33022/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 37082/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This treatment resulted in a significant decrease in cell proliferation in all of the lines, which was most marked in HL-60 cells. After 5 days in culture, in several separate experiments with different oligomer preparations, 75% growth inhibition was observed in c-myb antisense treated cells in comparison to untreated HL-60 cells. Two c-myb antisense oligomers of identical length with either 2- or 4-bp mismatches had no effect on cell growth nor did an 18-bp c-myb sense or myeloperoxidase antisense oligomer. The effect of a c-myc antisense oligomer (18 bp) on the growth of HL-60, KG-1, and KG-1a cells was also studied. This oligomer had much less inhibitory effect on cell proliferation than did the c-myb antisense sequence. Interestingly, although c-myc antisense treatment induced maturation of HL-60 cells while it inhibited cell proliferation, such an effect was not noted in c-myb antisense treated cells. These studies indicate that the nuclear protein encoded by the c-myb protooncogene is required for maintenance of proliferation in certain leukemia cell lines. In compared to c-myc protein suggest that, at least in HL-60 cells, c-myc amplification or N-ras activation may not be sufficient to maintain the leukemic growth in the absence of c-myb protein. These findings support the hypothesis that development and maintenance of a malignant phenotype requires a multiplicity of interrelated genetic events.","['Anfossi, G', 'Gewirtz, A M', 'Calabretta, B']","['Anfossi G', 'Gewirtz AM', 'Calabretta B']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Oligonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'Peroxidase/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', '*RNA, Messenger', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 May;86(9):3379-83. doi: 10.1073/pnas.86.9.3379.,"['Department of Pathology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140.']","['CA01324/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36896/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA46782/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC287136,['10.1073/pnas.86.9.3379 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether the X region does encode immortalizing functions, a fragment of the HTLV-I provirus capable of expressing known X-region proteins was inserted into the genome of a transformation-defective, replication-competent Herpesvirus saimiri. Infection of fresh mitogen-activated human cord blood and thymocytes yielded immortal T-cell lines that had the same phenotype (CD4+, CD5+, HLA class II+, interleukin 2 receptor alpha-chain +) as lymphocytes transformed by cocultivation with HTLV-I.

Experimental results and theoretical calculations suggest that in glucose-containing medium the Na+ transport increases from 0.75 to 1.78 pmol/hour per cell. The permeability of plasma membranes for K+ increases 2.75 fold, while the passive flux of Na+ diminishes. The intensity of O2 adsorption by ascites tumor cells does not practically depend on the monovalent cation concentration gradient between the cells and the culture medium, whereas the rate of glycolysis decreases simultaneously with the diminution of the concentration gradient. In synchronized cultures at the beginning of the mitotic cycle, the bulk of ATP resynthesized via glycolysis is utilized for the synthesis of biopolymers, whereas that at the end of the S-phase and in the G2-phase is utilized for cation transport across plasma membranes. From 35 to 100% of the whole amount of ATP resynthesized via glycolysis is utilized for transport purposes. It is concluded that the observed increase in the Na+/K+ ratio in ascites tumor cells is connected with their enhanced ability to synthesize lactic acid.

The rate of this initial calcium-independent target cell disintegration was indicative of a first-order decay process for programmed target cells with a calculated half-life of less than 3 min. This initial, rapid disintegration phase was independent of the overall cytotoxic activity of the lymphocyte preparation tested. Moreover, initial rates of target cell disintegration were comparable for target cell lines that exhibit up to 6-fold differences in overall susceptibility to natural cytotoxicity. In these studies we also consistently observed very slow, calcium-independent disintegration of additional target cells following apparent completion of the rapid disintegration process. Using a 51Cr release assay and K-562 target cells, the kinetics of this slow disintegration process were examined and found to be similar for donors exhibiting up to a 2-fold difference in overall cytotoxic activity and independent of the concentration of programed target cells. Whereas the initial rapid disintegration mechanism was independent of temperature over the range of 10-37 degrees C, the slow disintegration mechanism exhibited a direct dependence on the incubation temperature. Furthermore, we observed that supernatants obtained after the termination of lytic programing by ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid could effect the slow lysis of fresh NK-susceptible target cell lines.

Among 11 cases of CD11+AUL, despite a lack of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, one patient's blasts possessed Auer rod in a basophilic cytoplasm and another one's blasts expressed MPO maintaining the same surface phenotype after 20 months of his clinical course. The blast from 2 cases possessed both myelomonocytic and monocyte-specific antigens on the cell-surface, whereas the remaining nine cases completely lacked monocyte-specific antigen which is detectable by monoclonal antibodies, Mo2, My4 and Leu M3 (CD14). In addition, we revealed the presence of MPO protein in the cytoplasm of 3 cases of AUL patients by cytoplasmic immunofluorescence test utilizing monoclonal antibody (MA1). Following these results, the former was diagnosed as acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AMMoL) and the latter as acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) by immunophenotypic analysis using flow cytometry (FACS IV) and cytoplasmic immunofluorescence test. We have also described three cases of acute megakaryocytic leukemia which were demonstrated by the presence of megakaryocyte-platelet-related cell-surface antigens detected by utilizing flow cytometry and monoclonal antibodies in addition to both the PPO activity which was shown by ultrastructural cytochemistry, and the emergence of differentiation antigens while culturing these leukemic cells.

These clones had an aberrant chromosomal marker identical to the patient's B cell lymphoma and each secreted IgMk anti-Pr2 similar to the pathologic autoantibody in the serum of the patient. In this study, we have further investigated the Pr2-specific autoimmune response through nucleotide sequencing of VH and VL region genes. We have shown that the seven clones share the same VDJ/VJ gene segments and junctional elements confirming their clonal origin. The VH sequences were 88% homologous to a VHI germline gene while the VL sequences were 97% homologous to a VkIII germline gene. Only 4 somatic mutations (3 silent and 1 conservative) were found in greater than 5,000 bp sequenced, suggesting that a low mutation rate existed. Based on a tumor mass of 10(12) cells and a minimum of 40 divisions, we estimated the somatic mutation rate to be 4.45 x 10(-5) m/bp/d. This somatic mutation rate is similar to those estimated for acute lymphocytic leukemia (pre-B cell) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (intermediate B cell), but significantly lower than the mutation frequency in follicular lymphomas (activated B cell). We propose that the difference in somatic mutation frequency of a B cell tumor may be related to the stage of B cell differentiation. In addition, the low mutation frequency observed in the Pr2-specific B cell tumor may also reflect, in part, selection by autoantigen to conserve sIg structure and specificity.","['Silberstein, L E', 'Litwin, S', 'Carmack, C E']","['Silberstein LE', 'Litwin S', 'Carmack CE']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Agglutinins)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Cryoglobulins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (cold agglutinins)']",IM,"['Agglutinins/*genetics/immunology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/*immunology', 'Autoantibodies/*genetics/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cryoglobulins', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1989 May 1;169(5):1631-43. doi: 10.1084/jem.169.5.1631.,"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104-4283.']","['CA-06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-39065-01AI/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-20964-15/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2189313,['10.1084/jem.169.5.1631 [doi]'],,"['GENBANK/X15611', 'GENBANK/X15987', 'GENBANK/Y00652']",,,,,,,,,,

When examined in 14-day-old human monocyte cultures, rHuIFN-alpha B/D was highly effective in preventing viral replication and cell destruction caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1/VR3). The effect observed with 100 units of this hybrid IFN was as good or higher than that observed with equivalent amounts of rHuIFN-alpha A or IFN-gamma. In addition, a single dose (5 X 10(7) U/kg) of rHuIFN-alpha B/D administered several hours after intranasal infection with HSV-1/VR3 suppressed pulmonary virus replication and prevented death due to interstitial pneumonia. Similarly, mice infected with a more aggressive strain of HSV-1 (McIntyre) were protected when this IFN preparation was administered at the time of virus infection and 1 day later. The anti-retroviral activity of rHuIFN-alpha B/D was examined in two murine leukemia retroviral models, Rauscher (RMLV) and Friend (FMLV), and a murine model of acquired immunodeficiency (LP-BM5). Treatment of RMLV or FMLV infected mice significantly prolonged mean survival times and the number of long-term FMLV survivors.

CsA had no inhibitory effects on TCR-mediated phosphatidylinositol metabolism. The inhibitory effects of CsA were not mediated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitory pathway and no effect of CsA on the Ca2+-induced binding of calmodulin to calmodulin-binding proteins could be demonstrated. CsA was also a potent inhibitor of IgE receptor-mediated exocytosis in rat basophil leukemia cells. CsA had no effect on receptor-mediated phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis; 400 ng/ml CsA resulted in a 90% inhibition of serotonin release but had no effect on phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. These results indicate that CsA may inhibit some common event in Ca2+-dependent secretory cells. Taken together, these results suggest that CsA does not inhibit signal transduction but rather interferes with the biochemical events in the later stages of Ca2+-dependent reactions that follow the binding of calmodulin to cytoskeletal or cytoplasmic calmodulin binding proteins.","['Trenn, G', 'Taffs, R', 'Hohman, R', 'Kincaid, R', 'Shevach, E M', 'Sitkovsky, M']","['Trenn G', 'Taffs R', 'Hohman R', 'Kincaid R', 'Shevach EM', 'Sitkovsky M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Calmodulin-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcimycin', 'Calmodulin-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Cyclosporins/*pharmacology', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/drug effects/physiology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Exocytosis/drug effects', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/drug effects/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Jun 1;142(11):3796-802.,"['Laboratory of Immunology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20912.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this antibody was reactive with B cells from cows infected with bovine leukemia virus (BLV). These BLV-infected B cells were found to express simultaneously high concentrations of both surface IgM and 8C11-detected antigen. The antigen recognized by this antibody was shown to be a 67.5 kDa molecule. Because similar findings have been made on mouse myelomas and on human chronic leukemia cells, where this antigen was considered to be the equivalent of mouse Ly-1 antigen and human Leu-1 or CD5 antigen, the T cell antigen detected on BLV-infected cells could be the bovine counterpart of the CD5 antigen. By another way, it has been found that the CD5 T cell antigen is also present on a minor subpopulation of B cells in the spleen but not in the blood. We suggest that in the bovine a similar B cell subpopulation should be the BLV target and expand as a consequence of viral insertion, leading to the persistent lymphocytosis observed on BLV-infected animals.","['Depelchin, A', 'Letesson, J J', 'Lostrie-Trussart, N', 'Mammerickx, M', 'Portetelle, D', 'Burny, A']","['Depelchin A', 'Letesson JJ', 'Lostrie-Trussart N', 'Mammerickx M', 'Portetelle D', 'Burny A']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/microbiology', 'Cattle/*immunology', 'Cattle Diseases/*immunology/pathology', 'Cross Reactions', 'Female', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology/*veterinary', '*Leukemia Virus, Bovine/immunology', '*Retroviridae/immunology']",1989/01/15 00:00,1989/01/15 00:01,['1989/01/15 00:00'],"['1989/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 1989 Jan 15;20(1):69-76. doi: 10.1016/0165-2478(89)90071-0.,"['Department of Immunology, University of Namur, Belgium.']",,,"['0165-2478(89)90071-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2478(89)90071-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

A unique-sequence probe (23.3), derived from a region immediately 5' to the proviral integration site, was found to map less than 0.5 cM from c in a standard backcross analysis. Southern blot analysis of DNAs from animals carrying homozygous or overlapping albino deletions demonstrated that the 23.3 probe was deleted in several relatively small c-region deletions.

Phorbol esters did not alter the adenosine or prostaglandin receptor-stimulated accumulation of cAMP in cells in which the phospholipid/Ca2+-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase-C) was down-regulated. cAMP stimulation induced by cholera toxin (CT) was enhanced by phorbol esters by 100-300%. The cAMP production induced by forskolin was never enhanced by more than 50% by 4 beta-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) and there was no stimulation at all after down-regulation of the adenosine receptor by treatment with NECA. Phorbol ester enhanced the NECA-stimulated accumulation of cAMP, even in the presence of concentrations of forskolin that increased the cAMP accumulation several-fold.

A. et al. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 10918-10921]. In the present study, the dephosphorylation of Ser 123 and Ser 126 of the gamma chain was investigated. Phorbol-ester-induced phosphorylation of the gamma-chain Ser 126 in vivo was reversed following removal of phorbol ester. Dephosphorylation of both Ser 123 and 126 was also observed in vitro using the microsome fraction of T lymphocytes. In order to identify the phosphatases acting at these two sites, the immunoprecipitated gamma chain was used as substrate either following treatment with protein kinase C in vitro, in which case phosphorylation occurs mainly at Ser 123, or following in vivo phosphorylation of Ser 126. Purified oligomeric forms of the polycation-stimulated phosphatases were more effective in dephosphorylating both phosphorylated forms of the gamma chain compared with equivalent amounts of ATP,Mg2+-dependent phosphatases or calcineurin. By using phosphopeptide analogues of the CD3 gamma chain containing Ser 123 or Ser 126 as substrates (A3 and A6), it was shown that polycation-stimulated phosphatases selectively dephosphorylated Ser 123 compared to Ser 126. In order to determine which phosphatases dephosphorylate the gamma chain in microsomes, A3 and A6 were used as substrates for characterising phosphatases in microsomes from human T leukaemia Jurkat 6 cells. Three phosphopeptide phosphatases (250-400 kDa) co-eluted through five purification steps with three forms of polycation-stimulated phosphorylase phosphatase. The partially purified A3/A6 phosphopeptide phosphatases were insensitive to Ca2+, calmodulin and inhibitor-1, and dephosphorylated A3 preferentially compared with A6. A latent form of microsomal ATP,Mg2+-dependent phosphorylase phosphatase was stimulated 10-fold by trypsinisation, but did not dephosphorylate phosphopeptides A3 and A6. The results show that high-Mr forms of polycation-stimulated phosphatases are the only enzymes in human T leukaemia cell microsomes which dephosphorylate gamma chain phosphopeptides. The data point to an important role for polycation-stimulated phosphatases in regulating the phosphorylation state, and so function(s), of the CD3 antigen.","['Alexander, D', 'Goris, J', 'Marais, R', 'Rothbard, J', 'Merlevede, W', 'Crumpton, M J']","['Alexander D', 'Goris J', 'Marais R', 'Rothbard J', 'Merlevede W', 'Crumpton MJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'CD3 Complex', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Microsomes/enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphates/metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism']",1989/04/15 00:00,1989/04/15 00:01,['1989/04/15 00:00'],"['1989/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1989 Apr 15;181(1):55-65. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb14693.x.,"[""Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, England.""]",,,['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb14693.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

D. Brewer et al., Biochem. Pharmacol., 34:2047-2050, 1985) and is currently undergoing Phase I clinical trials. Here we report that merbarone is an inhibitor of topoisomerase II. Merbarone inhibited purified mammalian topoisomerase II with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 20 microM, as assessed by ATP-dependent unknotting of P4 phage DNA or relaxation of supercoiled pBR322 plasmid. In contrast to the type II enzyme, inhibition of catalytic activity of topoisomerase I required about 10-fold higher concentrations of merbarone, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of approximately 200 microM. Unlike epipodophyllotoxin analogues and certain DNA intercalative agents which stabilize the topoisomerase II-DNA ""cleavable complex,"" merbarone did not cause detectable topoisomerase II-induced DNA cleavage. Furthermore, merbarone inhibited the production by amsacrine or teniposide of topoisomerase II-associated DNA strand breaks; under identical conditions novobiocin did not decrease these breaks, setting merbarone apart from a novobiocin-like class of topoisomerase II inhibitor. In L1210 cells, merbarone produced only small numbers of protein-associated DNA strand breaks, and only at very high concentrations. Merbarone reduced in a concentration-dependent manner the number of amsacrine- or teniposide-stimulated protein-associated DNA strand breaks in L1210 cells or their isolated nuclei. The data suggest that merbarone represents a novel type of topoisomerase II inhibitor.","['Drake, F H', 'Hofmann, G A', 'Mong, S M', 'Bartus, J O', 'Hertzberg, R P', 'Johnson, R K', 'Mattern, M R', 'Mirabelli, C K']","['Drake FH', 'Hofmann GA', 'Mong SM', 'Bartus JO', 'Hertzberg RP', 'Johnson RK', 'Mattern MR', 'Mirabelli CK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Thiobarbiturates)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)', 'YWB9IF596V (merbarone)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Teniposide/pharmacology', 'Thiobarbiturates/*pharmacology', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",1989/05/15 00:00,1989/05/15 00:01,['1989/05/15 00:00'],"['1989/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 May 15;49(10):2578-83.,"['Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Smith Kline and French Laboratories, Swedeland, Pennsylvania 19406.']",['CA-40884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we show that KU 812 and two of its clones are at least bipotent: in addition to a minor component of basophils, the majority of KU 812 cells belongs to the erythroid cell lineage with a significant percentage (about 15%) of mature hemoglobinized erythroblasts. This terminal differentiation is associated with the synchronized synthesis of the main erythroid proteins, including glycophorins, spectrin beta chain, band 3, and hemoglobin. The predominant hemoglobins are adult, fetal, and Bart's hemoglobin. Adult hemoglobin represented up to 75% of all hemoglobins in the KU 812 F clone in passages containing a high number of mature erythroblasts. Transcripts of all human globin chains were present with ten times less embryonic chain messenger RNA (mRNA) than alpha-, beta- or gamma-chain mRNA. Hemin slightly increased the total hemoglobin production of the cell line, especially gamma-globin chain synthesis, but did not modify the percentage of hemoglobinized cells. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) had a complex effect, inducing a proportion of KU 812 cells to adhere to the plastic culture flask. The adherent cell fraction expressed a very low level of specific erythroid proteins, but their ultrastructure was consistent with immature erythroid cells. In contrast, approximately 40% of the nonadherent cells were mature erythroid cells. Cell-sorting experiments showed that this paradoxic effect of PMA is mostly due to cell selection, the more mature cells being unable to adhere. In addition, KU 812 F was found to be sensitive to erythropoietin, which slightly increased its plating efficiency range (from 0% to 50%) in semisolid medium and enhanced hemoglobin accumulation twofold. In binding experiments using 125I erythropoietin, a single class of high-affinity Epo receptors (Kd: 250 pM) was detected by binding with a density of 205 receptors per cell. The KU 812 cell line is therefore a unique model for studying cell commitment toward different hematopoietic lineages and erythroid differentiation.","['Nakazawa, M', 'Mitjavila, M T', 'Debili, N', 'Casadevall, N', 'Mayeux, P', 'Rouyer-Fessard, P', 'Dubart, A', 'Romeo, P H', 'Beuzard, Y', 'Kishi, K']","['Nakazawa M', 'Mitjavila MT', 'Debili N', 'Casadevall N', 'Mayeux P', 'Rouyer-Fessard P', 'Dubart A', 'Romeo PH', 'Beuzard Y', 'Kishi K', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Blood Group Antigens)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Blood Group Antigens', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Erythroblasts/analysis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Erythropoietin/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/analysis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/analysis', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/analysis/metabolism/*pathology']",1989/05/15 00:00,1989/05/15 00:01,['1989/05/15 00:00'],"['1989/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1989 May 15;73(7):2003-13.,"['INSERM U 91, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.']",,,['S0006-4971(20)75520-5 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Complete hereditary and acquired MPO deficiencies are defined as lack of peroxidase activity in PMN. Using this criterion, we studied a patient with complete hereditary MPO deficiency, and a MPO deficient variant cell line of HL-60 (HL-60-A7), which we used as a model for acquired MPO deficiency. Western blot analysis showed complete absence of mature and precursor protein of MPO both in PMN from the patient and in HL-60-A7 cells. PMN from both parents had one half of normal levels of these proteins. To study further the molecular basis of this defect, we isolated an intron specific probe for MPO and used it and a cDNA probe. Both normal human bone marrow cells and the promyelocytic HL-60 leukemia cells contained MPO mRNA species of 2.8, 3.3, approximately 4, and greater than 8 kilobase (kb). The transcripts of greater than 8 and approximately 4 kb contained sequences hybridizing to a probe specific for intron 7 of the MPO gene. Bone marrow cells of the MPO deficient patient contained two species of heterogeneous nuclear (hn) RNA of greater than 8 and approximately 4 kb, but only trace amounts of the normal sized 3.3 kb MPO mRNA and undetectable 2.8 kb MPO mRNA.

Since lysosomal hydrolases including the sulfatase underwent the posttranslational phosphorylation processing at the carbohydrate moiety, we investigated two enzymes acting on the processing in peripheral leukocytes from leukemia patients. The activity level of the first enzyme in the processing, an N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase to form phosphodiester at the carbohydrates, was significantly higher in CML cells than in normal control. The transferase level in CML cells was also higher compared with that in normal bone marrow cells, which include myeloid progenitor cells. However, the activity of the second processing enzyme, a phosphodiester glycosidase that converts a phosphodiester to a phosphomonoester, showed no consistent change in CML cells. Thus, increment of the sulfatase variant containing phosphomonoesters and diesters in CML cells is most probably associated with elevated activities of the phosphotransferase.

To examine the functional integrity of Fc epsilon R, we have adopted a protein implantation procedure whereby the purified receptor complex was coreconstituted with Sendai virus envelopes. The latter promoted fusion of the hybrid vesicles with recipient cells such as rat basophilic leukemia, RBL-2H3, thus serving as a vehicle for the receptor. The implanted Fc epsilon R was complexed with 125I-labeled mouse IgE (anti-DNP) to permit receptor quantification as well as specific triggering by DNP20BSA. Implantation in the presence of unlabeled rat IgE, which blocked the native receptors on the recipient RBL-2H3 cells, resulted in incorporation of up to 15 ng of receptor-bound IgE/10(6) cells. This was roughly equivalent in amount to 10-20% of the native receptors on such cells. The exocytosis which was triggered in the recipient cells by reagents that specifically recognized the implanted IgE reached between 15 and 50% of the maximal response. Various treatments that interfered with the activities of the viral envelopes reduced both receptor incorporation (3-5-fold) and cell degranulation (3-10-fold). These included separation of the receptor from the reconstituted envelopes, addition of serum to the incubation mixture (to inhibit vesicle-cell binding), and trypsinization of the virus (to inhibit vesicle-cell fusion).

When a Hamilton syringe was used to load and inject a mitoxantrone solution (0.4 microgram/ml in water) on to a high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) system, about 95% of the loaded compound was found to bind to the glass surface of the syringe barrel and could not be removed by rinsing with water. It could, however, be removed slowly with an acidic solution and thus a small peak of mitoxantrone was present on the chromatogram whenever a blank acidic solution was injected with the syringe. The bound mitoxantrone could be removed effectively from the syringe surface with a solution of tetramethylammonium chloride, citric acid, methanol and water (elution solvent). This binding introduces a large error in assay results and might be one of the major factors responsible for contradictory pharmacokinetic data that have been reported. A new plasma preparation scheme and an HPLC method for mitoxantrone were developed to address this binding problem. Mitoxantrone was extracted directly from plasma samples with a plastic mini-column packed with non-bonded silica gel and eluted with the above elution solvent. The eluent was analysed by HPLC on an ODS column with an absorbance detector at 658 nm. The mobile phase was 0.1 M triethylamine phosphate (pH 3.0) in water-tetrahydrofuran-methanol (69:1:30) containing 0.02 M tetramethylammonium chloride. Methylene blue was added as an internal standard. Preliminary results showed that mitoxantrone levels in human plasma followed a triphasic decay curve after an intravenous bolus injection. The terminal elimination half-lives measured in three patients (mean t1/2 gamma = 25 min) were all shorter than the published values which ranged from 56 min to 9 days.","['Lin, K T', 'Rivard, G E', 'Leclerc, J M']","['Lin KT', 'Rivard GE', 'Leclerc JM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Chromatogr,Journal of chromatography,0427043,"['7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Mitoxantrone/*blood', 'Silicon Dioxide']",1989/03/10 00:00,1989/03/10 00:01,['1989/03/10 00:00'],"['1989/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/10 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Chromatogr. 1989 Mar 10;465(1):75-86. doi: 10.1016/s0021-9673(01)83574-3.,"['Centre de Recherche, Hopital Ste-Justine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",,,['10.1016/s0021-9673(01)83574-3 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The subcellular location of MPRCI reflects these two functions; receptor is found in the Golgi complex, in endosomes, and on the cell surface. To learn about the intracellular pathway followed by surface receptor and to study the relationship between the receptor pools, we examined the entry of the surface MPRCI into Golgi compartments that contain sialyltransferase. Sialic acid was removed from surface-labeled K562 cultured human erythroleukemia cells by neuraminidase treatment. When the cells were returned to culture at 37 degrees C, surface MPRCI was resialylated by the cells with a half-time of 1-2 h. Resialylation was inhibited by reduced temperature, a treatment that allows surface molecules to reach endosomes but blocks further transport. These results indicate that surface MPRCI is transported to the sialyltransferase compartment in the Golgi complex. After culture at 37 degrees C, a small fraction (10-20%) of the resialylated receptor was found on the cell surface. Because a similar fraction of the total receptor pool is found on the cell surface, it is likely that cell surface MPRCI mixes with the cellular pool after resialylation. These data also support the idea that extracellular and newly made lysosomal enzymes are transported to lysosomes through a common compartment.","['Jin, M', 'Sahagian, G G Jr', 'Snider, M D']","['Jin M', 'Sahagian GG Jr', 'Snider MD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Asialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Hexosephosphates)', '0 (Mannosephosphates)', '0 (Receptor, IGF Type 2)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)']",IM,"['Asialoglycoproteins/metabolism', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Golgi Apparatus/*metabolism', 'Hexosephosphates/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mannosephosphates/*metabolism', 'Neuraminidase/pharmacology', 'Receptor, IGF Type 2', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Sialyltransferases/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/05/05 00:00,1989/05/05 00:01,['1989/05/05 00:00'],"['1989/05/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/05 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 May 5;264(13):7675-80.,"['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']","['DK36632/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM38183/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,['S0021-9258(18)83287-2 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The present studies investigated whether sphingomyelinase action also inhibited a biologic process mediated via protein kinase C, phorbol ester-induced differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytic cells into macrophages. The potent phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) stimulated time- and concentration-dependent conversion of HL-60 cells into macrophages, ED50 congruent to 5 x 10(-10) M. Differentiation involved growth inhibition, adherence of the suspended cells to tissue culture plastic, morphologic changes, and development of specific enzymatic markers. Sphingomyelinase, which increased the level of sphingoid bases and inactivated protein kinase C, prevented this event. In control incubations, cell number increased 2.10-fold over 24 h, and 2 +/- 1% of the cells were adherent. In incubations with TPA (0.5 nM), cell number increased only 1.75-fold, and 30% were adherent. Sphingomyelinase (3.8 x 10(-5) unit/ml) restored growth to incubations containing TPA to 2.02-fold and reduced adherence to 15%. Sphingomyelinase (3.8 x 10(-2) unit/ml) also restored growth partially and reduced adherence to a maximal concentration of TPA (3 nM). Similar results were obtained with the sphingoid base sphingosine (3-4.5 microM). Sphingomyelinase antagonized the morphologic changes associated with conversion to the macrophage phenotype. Untreated HL-60 cells presented typical promyelocytic morphology with large nuclei, little cytoplasm, and uniformity of nuclear and cell shape. TPA induced a larger cell population with abundant cytoplasm and unusual shape. Sphingomyelinase prevented these changes. Sphingomyelinase blocked TPA-induced increases in the macrophage marker enzymes, acid phosphatase and alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase. These studies indicate that the action of a sphingomyelinase, like the sphingoid bases, blocks phorbol ester-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells into macrophages and provides further support for the concept that sphingomyelinase action may be sufficient to comprise a physiologically relevant inhibitory pathway for protein kinase C.","['Kolesnick, R N']",['Kolesnick RN'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Sphingolipids)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sphingolipids/metabolism', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/*pharmacology', 'Sphingosine/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/05/05 00:00,1989/05/05 00:01,['1989/05/05 00:00'],"['1989/05/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/05 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 May 5;264(13):7617-23.,"['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Cornell University Medical College, New York, New York 10021.']",['R01-CA-42385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['S0021-9258(18)83279-3 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

A role for cytosolic free calcium elevations and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate production.",7251-61,"UNLABELLED: The mechanisms by which the chemotactic peptide formyl-methyl-leucyl-phenyl-alanine stimulates Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane were investigated in the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60, induced to differentiate with dimethyl sulfoxide. Ca2+ influx was determined: (a) from the initial rate of Mn2+ influx, apparent from the quenching of intracellular quin2 or fura-2 fluorescence; (b) from the rate of the elevation of cytosolic free calcium, [Ca2+]i, upon readdition of Ca2+ to cells previously stimulated in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. [3H]Inositol tris-, tetrakis-, and pentakisphosphates were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography procedure which was optimized for the separation of inositol tetrakisphosphates, yielding three predominant isomers: inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4), inositol 1,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate, and inositol 1,3,4, 6-tetrakisphosphate. Both the kinetics and agonist dose dependence of Ca2+ influx stimulation correlated closely with the corresponding receptor-mediated variations of [Ca2+]i either in the presence or in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Of the different inositol phosphates determined in parallel and under the same conditions, accumulation of [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 correlated best with Ca2+ influx both temporally and in its dose dependence in the presence or in the absence of extracellular Ca2+; inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate was also correlated but to a lesser extent. Attenuations of [Ca2+]i elevations by decreasing extracellular Ca2+ or by increasing the cytosolic Ca2+ buffering capacity with quin2 led to parallel inhibition of Ca2+ influx and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 production. IN CONCLUSION: 1) activation of Ca2+ influx by formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine depends on the elevation of [Ca2+]i, the latter being initiated by Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores; 2) Ins(1,3, 4,5)P4 is a strong candidate for maintaining receptor-mediated activation of Ca2+ influx in differentiated HL-60 cells.","['Pittet, D', 'Lew, D P', 'Mayr, G W', 'Monod, A', 'Schlegel, W']","['Pittet D', 'Lew DP', 'Mayr GW', 'Monod A', 'Schlegel W']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Aminoquinolines)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Sugar Phosphates)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '83104-85-2 (Quin2-acetoxymethyl ester)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Aminoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Calcium/*physiology', 'Calcium Channels/physiology', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Inositol Phosphates/*physiology', 'Isomerism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/*physiology', 'Sugar Phosphates/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/05/05 00:00,1989/05/05 00:01,['1989/05/05 00:00'],"['1989/05/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/05 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 May 5;264(13):7251-61.,"['Infectious Diseases Division, University Hospital, Geneve, Switzerland.']",,,['S0021-9258(18)83228-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The resultant disease syndrome is characterized by persistent viremia, lymphopenia, progressive weight loss, persistent diarrhea, enteropathy, and opportunistic infections. The onset of clinical immunodeficiency disease is prefigured by the replication of the FeLV-FAIDS variant virus in bone marrow and other tissues. The FeLV-FAIDS system can be used to evaluate antiviral agents which act on steps in the replication cycle which are conserved among retroviruses (e.g. reverse transcriptase, protease, assembly). The persistence and magnitude of viremia serves as a useful parameter in antiviral studies because it can be easily measured, presages the eventual development of immunodeficiency, and provides a convenient indicator of therapeutic efficacy either in preventing de novo FeLV infection or in reversing or ameliorating established infection. We describe here the evaluation of 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC) against FeLV-FAIDS infection - both in vitro in cell culture assay systems and in vivo in cats administered ddC either via intravenous bolus dosage or via controlled release subcutaneous implants. We found that, although controlled release delivery of ddC inhibited de novo FeLV-FAIDS replication and delayed onset of viremia when therapy was discontinued (after 3 weeks), an equivalent incidence and level of viremia were established rapidly in both ddC-treated and control cats. The FeLV model, therefore, can be used to assess rapidly experimental single agent or combined antiviral therapies for persistent retrovirus infection and disease.","['Hoover, E A', 'Zeidner, N S', 'Perigo, N A', 'Quackenbush, S L', 'Strobel, J D', 'Hill, D L', 'Mullins, J I']","['Hoover EA', 'Zeidner NS', 'Perigo NA', 'Quackenbush SL', 'Strobel JD', 'Hill DL', 'Mullins JI']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Intervirology,Intervirology,0364265,"['0 (Delayed-Action Preparations)', '0 (Dideoxynucleosides)', '0 (Drug Implants)', '18771-50-1 (Tetrahydrouridine)', '6L3XT8CB3I (Zalcitabine)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*drug therapy', 'Animals', '*Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'Delayed-Action Preparations', 'Dideoxynucleosides/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Implants', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Retroviridae Infections/drug therapy', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Tetrahydrouridine/therapeutic use', 'Viremia/drug therapy', 'Zalcitabine']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Intervirology. 1989;30 Suppl 1:12-25. doi: 10.1159/000150120.,"['Department of Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523.']","['CA43216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 AI62524/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 AI72663/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,['10.1159/000150120 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in contrast to cell lines exhibiting multidrug resistance (MDR) associated with overexpression of P-glycoprotein, this line is not cross-resistant to the Vinca alkaloids, is not impaired in drug accumulation, and does not overexpress the mdrl gene (Cancer Res., 47: 1297, 5455, 1987). More recently we found that nuclear extracts of these cells exhibit decreased topoisomerase II catalytic and cleavage activity, compared to the drug-sensitive line (Biochemistry, 1988). These results suggest that an alteration in topoisomerase II or a modulator of this enzyme may be responsible for this altered topoisomerase II-form of multidrug resistance (at-MDR). In the present work, we studied the somatic cell genetics of at-MDR. We produced hybrid cell lines by polyethylene glycol-mediated fusion of the CEM/VM-1 line with a hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase-deficient, ouabain-resistant CEM line (CEM.AG1.OU1.5) that exhibits VM-26 sensitivity. Ten of the hybrid lines that grew in selective medium were randomly chosen for expansion and four were analyzed for both DNA content by flow cytometry and VM-26 sensitivity in a 72-h growth inhibition assay. The hybrid lines all contained approximately 2x DNA compared to unfused controls, indicating that the fusions were successful. The IC50 for VM-26 in 3 of the 4 lines was the same as that of the sensitive controls, ranging from 4.7 to 7.4 x 10(-8) M, and another was 76 x 10(-8) M. These data indicate that drug sensitivity was reconstituted by the hybridization procedure.

Treatment of K-562 human leukemic cells for 3 days with 30 and 10 microM 8-chloroadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Cl-cAMP) (site 1-selective) resulted in 60% and 20% growth inhibition, respectively (with over 90% viability). N6-Benzyl-cAMP (site 2-selective) (30 microM) treatment resulted in 20% growth inhibition by day 3. When 8-Cl-cAMP (10 microM) and N6-benzyl-cAMP (30 microM) were both added, growth was almost completely arrested. The growth inhibition was accompanied by megakaryocytic differentiation in K-562 cells. The untreated control cells expressed little or no detectable levels of glycoprotein IIb-IIIa surface antigen complex. 8-Cl-cAMP (30 microM) treatment for 3 days substantially increased the antigen expression, while N6-benzyl-cAMP caused little or no change in the antigen expression. When cells were treated with 8-Cl-cAMP in combination with N6-benzyl-cAMP, antigen expression was synergistically enhanced, and cells demonstrated megakaryocyte morphology. By Northern blotting, we examined the mRNA levels of the type I and type II protein kinase regulatory subunits (RI alpha and RII beta), the catalytic subunit, and c-myc during 8-Cl-cAMP treatment. The steady-state level of RII beta cAMP receptor mRNA sharply increased within 1 hr of treatment and remained elevated for 3 days, while that of the RI alpha receptor markedly decreased to below control level within 6 hr and remained low during treatment. However, 8-Cl-cAMP did not affect the mRNA level of the catalytic subunit. 8-Cl-cAMP treatment also brought about a rapid decrease in c-myc mRNA. Thus, differential regulation of cAMP receptor genes is an early event in cAMP-induced differentiation and growth control of K-562 leukemia cells.","['Tortora, G', 'Clair, T', 'Katsaros, D', 'Ally, S', 'Colamonici, O', 'Neckers, L M', 'Tagliaferri, P', 'Jahnsen, T', 'Robins, R K', 'Cho-Chung, Y S']","['Tortora G', 'Clair T', 'Katsaros D', 'Ally S', 'Colamonici O', 'Neckers LM', 'Tagliaferri P', 'Jahnsen T', 'Robins RK', 'Cho-Chung YS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Protein Kinases/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Apr;86(8):2849-52. doi: 10.1073/pnas.86.8.2849.,"['Cellular Biochemistry Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",,PMC287016,['10.1073/pnas.86.8.2849 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results lead to the following conclusions: (i) Circularization of viral DNA plays no role in integration. The direct precursor to the integrated MLV provirus is a linear molecule. (ii) The initial step in the integration reaction is probably a cleavage that removes the terminal 2 bases from each 3' end of the viral DNA.

Its transforming activity, as well as the nucleotide sequence of the 3' 2.7 kilobases of FTT, including v-myc, was determined. The predicted v-myc protein differs from feline c-myc by three amino acid changes and is truncated by two amino acids at the carboxyl terminus. Comparison with feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline c-myc, and other FeLV proviruses indicates that recombination junctions involved in the generation of FeLV-onc viruses occur at preferred locations within the virus. They usually follow or occur within the sequence ACCCC at 5' junctions and may result from homologous recombination between sequences of marked purine-pyrimidine strand bias, especially at 3' junctions. Some recombination sites also resemble recombinase recognition sequences utilized in immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor variable-region joining. Transfection of primary rat embryo fibroblasts and subsequent in vivo analysis revealed that morphologic and tumorigenic transformation require cotransfection of FTT with human EJ-ras DNA; neither gene alone is sufficient. FTT v-myc is expressed in these transformed rat cells as a 3.0-kilobase subgenomic RNA; however, in contrast to the depressed level of c-myc expression in v-myc-involved feline tumors, steady-state levels of rat c-myc RNA and protein are apparently unaltered.","['Doggett, D L', 'Drake, A L', 'Hirsch, V', 'Rowe, M E', 'Stallard, V', 'Mullins, J I']","['Doggett DL', 'Drake AL', 'Hirsch V', 'Rowe ME', 'Stallard V', 'Mullins JI']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics/*pathogenicity/ultrastructure', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1989 May;63(5):2108-17. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.5.2108-2117.1989.,"['Department of Cancer Biology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",,PMC250627,['10.1128/JVI.63.5.2108-2117.1989 [doi]'],,['GENBANK/M25762'],,,,,,,,,,

The behavior of BLV and related retroviruses during the latency period between initial infection and subsequent tumorigenesis is poorly understood. We used in situ hybridization to detect BLV transcripts in individual peripheral blood mononuclear cells from experimentally infected, asymptomatic sheep with latent infections. Viral RNA was not found in most peripheral blood cells that had been isolated as rapidly as possible from circulating blood, but it was present in rare cells. BLV RNA transcripts increased in a biphasic manner within a few hours after the blood cells were placed in culture. Exposure to fetal bovine serum was identified as the principal cause of this transcriptional activation, which occurred in fewer than 1 in 1,000 cells. Agents known to activate immune cells polyclonally caused a further increase in the number of cells containing BLV RNA within 8 h. In some cases, the numbers of viral transcripts within individual cells also increased. Thus, BLV is not detectably expressed in most resting lymphocytes circulating in the blood, but its transcription is activated by components of fetal bovine serum and can be augmented by molecules that mimic activation of immune cells. This activation, which might occur in lymphoid tissue during an immune response, may lead to the synthesis of viral regulatory proteins that are thought to initiate tumorigenesis through host cell genes.","['Lagarias, D M', 'Radke, K']","['Lagarias DM', 'Radke K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*microbiology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sheep/microbiology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1989 May;63(5):2099-107. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.5.2099-2107.1989.,"['Department of Avian Sciences, University of California, Davis 95616.']","['CA-40653/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-46374/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC250626,['10.1128/JVI.63.5.2099-2107.1989 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have shown that the choice of the helper virus used to rescue A-MuLV greatly influences its ability to induce pre-B-cell lymphomas. In this study, we investigated the role of the helper virus in A-MuLV-induced thymomas. A-MuLV rescued with the helper Moloney MuLV, BALB/c endogenous N-tropic MuLV, and two chimeric MuLVs derived from these two parents were injected intrathymically in young adult NIH Swiss mice. All four A-MuLV pseudotypes were found to be equally efficient in the induction of thymomas, whereas drastic differences were observed in their pre-B-cell lymphomagenic potential. Thymoma induction by A-MuLV was independent of the replication potential of the helper virus in the thymus, and no helper proviral sequences could be detected in the majority of thymomas induced by A-MuLV rescued with parental BALB/c endogenous or chimeric MuLVs. In the thymomas in which helper proviruses were present, none of them were found integrated in the Ahi-1 region, a common proviral integration site found in A-MuLV-induced pre-B-cell lymphomas (Y. Poirer, C. Kozak, and P. Jolicoeur, J. Virol. 62:3985-3992, 1988). In addition, helper-free stocks of A-MuLV were found to be as lymphomagneic as other pseudotypes in inducing thymomas after intrathymic inoculation, in contrast to their inability to induce pre-B-cell lymphomas when injected intraperitoneally in newborn mice. Restriction enzyme analysis revealed one to three A-MuLV proviruses in each thymoma, indicating the oligoclonality of these tumors. Analysis of the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor loci confirmed that the major population of cells of these primary thymomas belongs to the T-cell lineage. Together, these results indicate that the helper virus has no effect in the induction of A-MuLV-induced T-cell lymphomas, in contrast to its important role in the induction of A-MuLV-induced pre-B-cell lymphomas.

These tumors have been characterized as oligoclonal or monoclonal large-cell malignant lymphomas that closely resemble the EBV genome-positive B-cell lymphomas that arise in human allograft recipients. The expression of latent and lytic EBV-encoded proteins was investigated in these virus-induced tamarin lymphomas and in derived cell lines. The tamarin tumors were found to express EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA 1), EBNA 2, EBNA leader protein, and the latent membrane protein (LMP) as determined both by immunohistochemical staining and by immunoblotting. However, within the limits of the immunoblotting assays, no expression of the EBNA 3a protein family could be detected. Assays for lytic-cycle proteins by using both polyclonal human sera and monoclonal antibodies against viral capsid antigen, early antigen, and membrane antigen (gp340/220) showed minimal, if any, expression of these antigens in the lymphoma biopsies. In contrast, the cell lines derived from these lymphomas, even in early passage, expressed abundant levels of the lytic-cycle antigens and also expressed the EBNA 3a protein as well as EBNA 1, EBNA 2, EBNA leader protein, and LMP. This finding suggests that the virus-lymphoma cell interaction, in particular the switch to lytic cycle, is subject to some form of host control in vivo. The expression of EBNA 2 and LMP in these tamarin lymphomas strengthens their resemblance to posttransplant lymphomas in humans, since these human tumors are also EBNA 2 and LMP positive (L. S. Young, C. Alfieri, K. Hennessy, H. Evans, C. O'Hara, K. Anderson, A. Rickinson, E. Kieff, and J. I. Cohen, submitted for publication).

In this study the effects of extracellular ATP were studied using peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) isolated from both normal subjects and from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Changes in the permeability to Na+, Rb+, and Li+ ions were measured using conventional isotope and flame photometry techniques. In addition, changes in cytosolic (Ca2+) were fluorimetrically monitored to assess possible changes in net Ca2+ influx. ATP produced a 12-fold increase in 22Na+ influx into CLL cells but only a 3.5-fold increase in this flux in PBL cells. A maximal response was produced by 0.1 mmol/L ATP in the absence of Mg2+, while a twofold molar excess of Mg2+ over ATP abolished the response. ATP had no effect on the passive (ouabain-insensitive) 86Rb+ influx into PBL cells but stimulated this flux by fivefold in the CLL cells. Li+ influx into CLL cells was also stimulated threefold by ATP. Under these same conditions ATP also produced a net increase in total cell Na and a decrease in total cell K in the CLL cells. Exclusion of two normally impermeable dyes, trypan blue and ethidium bromide, was not altered in the ATP-treated CLL cells. Finally, extracellular ATP (3 mmol/L) produced no significant change in the cytosolic (Ca2+) of normal, monocyte-depleted populations of PBL. Conversely, this same concentration of ATP produced a very rapid (complete within 30 seconds) and a significant (an average threefold peak change) increase in the cytosolic (Ca2+) of cell preparations derived from five out of nine CLL patients. In these latter CLL cells, the ATP-induced elevation in cytosolic (Ca2+) appeared to be due to a net increase in Ca2+ influx, since no elevations were observed when the extracellular (Ca2+) was reduced to less than 0.1 mmol/L. These actions of ATP were specific in that equimolar concentrations of other nucleotides were without effect. These data indicate that treatment of CLL lymphocytes with extracellular ATP4 produces large increases in cation permeability. In contrast, there is less or no ATP-induced permeabilization of normal PBL.","['Wiley, J S', 'Dubyak, G R']","['Wiley JS', 'Dubyak GR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Rubidium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Sodium Channels)', '0 (Sodium Radioisotopes)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9FN79X2M3F (Lithium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*physiology', 'Calcium/*blood', '*Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Extracellular Space/metabolism/pathology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/pathology', 'Lithium/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Rubidium Radioisotopes', 'Sodium Channels/metabolism', 'Sodium Radioisotopes']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1989 Apr;73(5):1316-23.,"['Hematology Department, Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.']",['GM36387/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,['S0006-4971(20)75560-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Tryptic cleavage of p60v-abl was prevented in the presence of ATP. These results suggest that the catalytic kinase domain of v-abl-derived protein can be separated from other (regulatory) domains by limited proteolysis. p43v-abl readily phosphorylated tyrosine residues on several different protein and peptide substrates, including peptides containing only two amino acid residues. However, the local sequence of the tyrosine-containing peptide substrate significantly affected its rate of phosphorylation. Thus the primary structure and local conformation at the tyrosine acceptor site can play an important role in determining the substrate specificity of v-abl-derived kinase. Phosphorylation by p43v-abl requires Mn2+, Co2+ or Mg2+ and exhibits a strong preference for ATP as phosphate donor. Analogues of ATP and the thiol-reactive reagent N-ethylmaleimide inhibited p43v-abl kinase activity.

Chemically responsive promoter elements, such as the SV40 early, human metallothionein IIA and rat GRP78 gene promoters, retained their inducibility when EBV episome-based. Differences in gene expression obtained with the episomes reflected differential promoter activity rather than significant variations in episome copy numbers per cell. These observations provide guidelines for the optimal design of EBV episomal expression vectors for human expression work.","['Hauer, C A', 'Getty, R R', 'Tykocinski, M L']","['Hauer CA', 'Getty RR', 'Tykocinski ML']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell-Free System', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', '*Genes, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Replicon', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Transfection']",1989/03/11 00:00,1989/03/11 00:01,['1989/03/11 00:00'],"['1989/03/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/11 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1989 Mar 11;17(5):1989-2003. doi: 10.1093/nar/17.5.1989.,"['Institute of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106.']","['P30 CA 43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA 47566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC317538,['10.1093/nar/17.5.1989 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

These animal models may provide an insight into our understanding of AIDS but, with the exception of one strain of feline leukaemia virus, the determinants of pathogenicity have not yet been mapped to these viral genomes. The immunodeficiency-inducing feline leukaemia virus is replication-defective, harbouring the determinant of pathogenicity within its env sequences. We have studied the Duplan strain of murine leukaemia virus which induces, in C57BL/6 mice, a severe immunodeficiency disease with striking similarities to human AIDS. We have identified the aetiological agent of this murine immunodeficiency disease as another defective retrovirus, with a genome of 4.8 kilobases. Molecular cloning and sequencing of this DNA showed that the pol and env genes have been deleted, but that the complete gag region has been conserved and has a novel sequence encoding the p12 protein. As with the feline leukaemia virus, these results provide evidence for the role of defective retroviruses in inducing immunodeficiency and facilitate the study of the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency syndromes, including AIDS.","['Aziz, D C', 'Hanna, Z', 'Jolicoeur, P']","['Aziz DC', 'Hanna Z', 'Jolicoeur P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Pr60(gag) protein, murine AIDS virus)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral', '*Defective Viruses', 'Gene Products, gag', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*etiology', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Viral Proteins']",1989/04/06 00:00,1989/04/06 00:01,['1989/04/06 00:00'],"['1989/04/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/06 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/06 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 1989 Apr 6;338(6215):505-8. doi: 10.1038/338505a0.,"['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",,,['10.1038/338505a0 [doi]'],,['GENBANK/X14576'],,,,,,,,,,

Three hundred one of the patients received two doses of vaccine and 136 received a single dose of vaccine from 1 of 10 lots from two manufacturers. The patients have been followed for an average of three years (range, one to six). Seroconversion occurred in 88 percent of the 437 children after the first dose of vaccine and in 98 percent after one or two doses. The proportions of patients who were seronegative after one, three, and five years were 20, 25, and 30 percent, respectively, with little change over time in the geometric mean titers of specific antibody (6.3, 6.5, and 5.7, respectively). Chickenpox has been documented in 36 vaccinated patients (8 percent) who had 3 to 640 vesicles (mean, 100), mild illness, and no complications. Of the 83 vaccinated patients exposed to varicella within their families, 11 had chickenpox; the attack rate was 14 percent (8 percent among seropositive patients, 29 percent among seronegative patients). There was no relation between the time since vaccination and either the attack rate or the severity of the breakthrough illness. Two doses of vaccine appeared to be no more effective than a single dose. Of the 372 patients receiving maintenance chemotherapy when immunized, 149 (40 percent) had a rash, which was treated with acyclovir in 16 children (4 percent) and became a severe febrile illness in 4. These reactions were not fatal and were all associated with vaccine lots, the use of which has since been discontinued. We conclude that in children in remission from leukemia, varicella vaccine is safe and induces an immunity to chickenpox that persists for more than three years.","['Gershon, A A', 'Steinberg, S P']","['Gershon AA', 'Steinberg SP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Chickenpox Vaccine)', '0 (Vaccines, Attenuated)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Viral/*analysis', 'Chickenpox/*immunology/prevention & control/transmission', 'Chickenpox Vaccine', 'Child', 'Herpesvirus 3, Human/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Immunization Schedule', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Time Factors', 'Vaccines, Attenuated/immunology', 'Viral Vaccines/*immunology']",1989/04/06 00:00,1989/04/06 00:01,['1989/04/06 00:00'],"['1989/04/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/06 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/06 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1989 Apr 6;320(14):892-7. doi: 10.1056/NEJM198904063201403.,"['Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032.']","['AI 24021/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 62529/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,['10.1056/NEJM198904063201403 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a defined medium culture system, we demonstrate that transformation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts by A-MuLV abrogates their normal requirement for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) for cell growth. Analysis of constructed insertional mutant viruses revealed an absolute correlation between A-MuLV-encoded tyrosine kinase activity and PDGF-independent fibroblast growth. Sequences of the provirus not required for kinase activity appeared unnecessary for abrogating the fibroblast requirement for PDGF. Conversely, sequences required for kinase activity appeared necessary, suggesting that induction of PDGF-independent fibroblast growth, like cell transformation, is a function of this tyrosine kinase. Fibroblasts transformed by a partially transformation-defective mutant demonstrated incomplete morphological transformation but were still independent of PDGF for growth.

This locates the defect responsible for CT resistance at the membrane, somewhere between surface CT receptors and adenylate cyclase. CT-resistant BNML cells (CTR-BNML) do have surface CT receptors (several thousands per cell). Adenylate cyclase activity in CTR-BNML cells is not stimulated by cholera toxin. Other GS mediated stimulation of adenylate cyclase (by PGE, isoproterenol, histamine, NaF) remains relatively high, though 25-60% lower than in CTS-BNML cells.

To assess their biological significance in the tumorigenic process, we reinvestigated the presence of new proviruses chiefly in primary radio-induced tumors and in models of radioleukemogenesis which could give additional support for their role. Such models included thymic lymphomas originating after (i) graft of non-irradiated thymuses in thymectomized irradiated mice and (ii) the injection of a B-ecotropic retrovirus (T1223/B) in association with a subleukemogenic dose of irradiation. We report for the first time that new ecotropic proviral sequences are encountered in a significant number (30%) of primary lymphomas induced directly by irradiation or indirectly in non-irradiated thymuses grafted in irradiated hosts. The existence of a 3.5-kbp Kpn1 restriction fragment with ecotropic sequences in the digested DNA of these tumor cells indicates that these new sequences belong to an ecotropic provirus recombinant in the gag-pol region. We observed that most of the primary radio-induced tumors in which novel recombinant provirus could be detected, displayed the integration at a single or at a few sites, demonstrating their clonality with respect to viral integration. The same was observed in thymic lymphomas arising after T1223/B virus injection and irradiation and in in-vivo or in-vitro propagated tumors. Altogether, these data bring the first evidence of the integration of ecotropic recombinant proviral genomes in a significant number of primary radiation induced thymic lymphomas and of their possible role in view of their frequent occurrence in grafted thymomas.","['Baylac-Kalabokias, H', 'Astier-Gin, T', 'Borremans, B', 'Legrand, E', 'Hooghe, R', 'Houben-Defresne, M P', 'Janowski, M', 'Duplan, J F', 'Guillemain, B']","['Baylac-Kalabokias H', 'Astier-Gin T', 'Borremans B', 'Legrand E', 'Hooghe R', 'Houben-Defresne MP', 'Janowski M', 'Duplan JF', 'Guillemain B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Gammaretrovirus/analysis/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology/microbiology', 'Lymphoma/*etiology/genetics/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology/genetics/microbiology', 'Proviruses/analysis/*genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*etiology/genetics/microbiology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(2):131-43. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90137-9.,"['INSERM Unite 117, Bordeaux, France.']",,,['10.1016/0145-2126(89)90137-9 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that when 12- to 13-day-old embryos rather than 1-day-old chickens were infected with RAV-1, a novel B-cell lymphoma developed in which proviral insertions had activated expression of the c-myb gene. These tumors expressed elevated levels of a 4.5-kilobase myb-containing mRNA transcript that contained c-myb sequences not found in v-myb. The c-myc locus in these tumors appeared normal. The biological properties of the activated myb lymphoma were distinct from those of lymphoid leukosis. Metastatic disease developed within 7 weeks of infection. Distinct intermediate pathogenic stages with preneoplastic and primary neoplastic lesions were not detected. Although bursal tissues appeared to be nonmalignant on gross examination, Southern analyses of bursal DNA revealed the presence of tumor with the same clonal origin as abdominal lymphoma masses.

While Pr65gag is the precursor to the virion structural proteins, Pr75gag undergoes glycosylation and is found on the surface of the infected cell as gp85gag, and it is thought to play a role in virus maturation and spread. Pr65gag synthesis starts at an AUG codon within a favourable initiation context (AAUAUGG at positions 618 to 624). The gp85gag start codon is upstream but its precise location is not known. To map the initiation codon of gp85gag, we used deletion and site-directed mutagenesis of the leader sequence of MuLV RNA and in vitro translation of the RNAs. Synthesis of the MuLV gp85gag protein appears to be initiated at a CUG codon located within a favourable context (ACCCUGG at positions 354 to 359 for Moloney-MuLV). The possible function of gp85gag was investigated by expressing Moloney-MuLV and Friend-MuLV proviral DNA and mutants deficient for gp85gag synthesis in mouse and rat cells.

We compared the MHC class I as well as viral env and gag antigenic cell surface profiles of frequent T lymphomas of H-2I-A nonresponder-type mice to that of rare T lymphomas of H-2I-A responder-type mice. Membrane immunofluorescence studies, with a panel of anti-env mAbs (reactive with the highly conserved gp70f epitope, the p15Ec epitope, and the gp70-p15E complex), a polyclonal anti-p30 serum, and anti-H-2 class I mAbs, showed that all 17 nonresponder tumors tested expressed high levels of both env and gag viral proteins, and 15 of these 17 nonresponder tumors expressed high levels of H-2 class I K and D antigens. In contrast, 10 of 11 responder lymphomas lacked env and/or gag determinants. The only responder lymphoma with both strong env and gag expression failed to express H-2K and -D antigens. Preferential loss of env or gag expression did not correlate with H-2 class I allelic specificities. Both responder and nonresponder T lymphoma DNA contained multiple, predominantly MCF-like, newly acquired proviral integrations. Differences in viral antigen cell surface expression were confirmed at cytoplasmic and RNA levels. The amounts of 8.2- and 3.2-kb viral RNA were greatly reduced in two responder lymphomas when compared with four nonresponder lymphomas. In both responder lymphomas, aberrantly sized viral RNA species were found. Upon in vivo passage of these responder lymphomas in either immunocompetent or T cell-deficient nu/nu mice, it was found that various molecular mechanisms may underlie the lack of viral antigen expression at the cell surface of these lymphomas. One lymphoma re-expressed viral antigens when transplanted with nu/nu mice, whereas the other remained stably gag negative. The combined findings indicate that an H-2I-A-regulated antiviral immune response not only strongly reduces T lymphoma incidence, but also forces T lymphomas that still arise to poorly express viral antigens, thus explaining their escape from immunosurveillance.","['Vasmel, W L', 'Sijts, E J', 'Leupers, C J', 'Matthews, E A', 'Melief, C J']","['Vasmel WL', 'Sijts EJ', 'Leupers CJ', 'Matthews EA', 'Melief CJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'Cytoplasm/immunology', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Gene Products, gag', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae Proteins/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1989 Apr 1;169(4):1233-54. doi: 10.1084/jem.169.4.1233.,"['Division of Immunology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam.']",,PMC2189230,['10.1084/jem.169.4.1233 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

On the basis of this observation, we hypothesized that resistance to VM-26, which is partly attributed to multidrug resistance, also resulted in reduced formation of DNA lesions by the drug. In confirmation of this hypothesis, equitoxic concentrations of VM-26 produced fewer breaks in the DNA of LIa5 microM cells, the prototype L1210/VM-26 subline, than in that of L1210 cells. Previously, potassium cyanide (KCN) and verapamil were shown to increase the levels of VM-26 in LIa5 microM but not L1210 cells.

The present study was aimed at investigating possible regulation of such potentially destructive responses elicited by IL-1 on endothelial cells. Culture supernatants of IL-1-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HEC) were depleted of retroviral p15E-related Ag with immobilized anti-p15E mAb. The monocyte chemotactic and polarizing activity of supernatants of IL-1-treated HEC (presumably related to colony-stimulating factors being released by HEC) was markedly augmented by absorption on immobilized anti-p15E antibodies. Irrelevant IgG had no effect and anti-p15E antibodies did not affect the chemotactic activity of supernatants from unstimulated HEC. The material eluted from Sepharose-bound anti-p15E antibodies was devoid of chemotactic and polarizing activity and suppressed the polarization and migration of monocytes in response to chemoattractants. The alpha and beta molecular species of IL-1 were equally effective in inducing the production of p15E-related inhibitor.

Eicosapentaenoate supplements lowered the levels of oleate in phosphatidylinositol/serine, diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (GroPEtn), and alk-1-enylacyl-GroPEtn in the P388D1 cells but had little or no effect on the amounts of arachidonate in the cellular phospholipids. In contrast, supplementation of the cells with docosahexaenoic acid not only reduced the level of oleate but also decreased the amount of arachidonate by one-third in the alk-1-enylacyl-GroPEtn. When P388D1 cells were incubated for 1 h with [3H]alkyllyso-GroPEtn both [3H]alkylacyl-GroPEtn and [3H]alk-1-enylacyl-GroPEtn were formed. The sn-2 acyl composition of these two ether-containing GroPEtn lipids reflected the fatty acid supplement that the cells had received (e.g., 68% of the [3H]alk-1-enylacyl-GroPEtn from cells supplemented with docosahexaenoate contained this acyl group at the sn-2 position). Cells from both the controls and supplemented groups contained greater amounts of docosahexaenoate in the [3H]alk-1-enylacyl-GroPEtn (plasmalogen) than in the [3H]alkylacyl-GroPEtn subclass. Analysis of molecular species from pulse-chase experiments with intact cells and examination of the molecular species of [3H]alk-1-enylacyl-GroPEtn produced by the delta 1-desaturase system in cell-free membrane fractions suggest that the docosahexaenoate-containing species of [3H]alk-1-enylacyl-GroPEtn have a higher turnover rate than other molecular species. Possible biological implications of our findings are also discussed.","['Blank, M L', 'Smith, Z L', 'Lee, Y J', 'Snyder, F']","['Blank ML', 'Smith ZL', 'Lee YJ', 'Snyder F']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Phosphatidylethanolamines)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Plasmalogens)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '25167-62-8 (Docosahexaenoic Acids)', 'AAN7QOV9EA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Eicosapentaenoic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylethanolamines/biosynthesis', 'Phospholipids/*metabolism', 'Plasmalogens/*biosynthesis', 'Tritium']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1989 Mar;269(2):603-11. doi: 10.1016/0003-9861(89)90146-x.,"['Medical and Health Sciences Division, Oak Ridge Associated Universities, Tennessee 37831.']","['CA-41642-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-27109-08/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0003-9861(89)90146-X [pii]', '10.1016/0003-9861(89)90146-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

For example the lactol, lactam, thiolactone, and 20-deoxy derivatives did not stabilize the covalent DNA-topoisomerase I complex.

Two cytotoxic derivatives that did not inhibit topoisomerase I were shown to produce non-protein-associated DNA single-strand breaks and are likely to have a different mechanism of action. One of these compounds was tested for antitumor activity and was found to be inactive.

In the differentiated U-937 cells, PAF induced hydrolysis of phosphoinositides and synthesis of inositol phosphates. PAF-induced production of inositol phosphates was rapid, concentration-dependent and was inhibited by a receptor antagonist CV3988, indicating that it was mediated via a specific receptor. In fura-2-loaded, differentiated U-937 cells, PAF induced immediate and concentration-dependent calcium mobilization [( Ca++]i) that was inhibited by CV3988, but not by calcium channel blockers. Addition of an increasing concentration of calcium chelator, ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid, to the medium inhibited a large fraction (approximately 75%) of PAF receptor-induced [Ca++]i mobilization thus suggesting the majority of [Ca++]i mobilization was originated from extracellular milieu and a small portion (approximately 25%) was originated from intracellular sources. The inositol phosphate production induced by PAF, however, was independent from the extracellular calcium and was not inhibited by the addition of ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid. Neither [Ca++]i mobilization or phosphoinositide metabolism in U-937 cells was sensitive to treatment of pertussis toxin, but both types of effects were sensitive to treatment by an inhibitor of phospholipase C, manoalide. These results suggest that in differentiated U-937 cells PAF receptor is coupled through a pertussis toxin-insensitive guanine nucleotide binding protein to a phosphoinositide specific phospholipase C. Inositol-trisphosphate, and possibly diacylglycerol, could be the intracellular messengers for PAF receptor in U-937 cells.","['Barzaghi, G', 'Sarau, H M', 'Mong, S']","['Barzaghi G', 'Sarau HM', 'Mong S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '0 (platelet activating factor receptor)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'Platelet Activating Factor/*pharmacology', '*Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/physiology', '*Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1989 Feb;248(2):559-66.,"['Laboratory for Cardiovascular Clinical Pharmacology, Instituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milano, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed these data to evaluate the impact of pretreatment prognostic factors on outcome. In multivariate analysis, female gender was predictive of improved response (LD, P = .01; ED, P = .04) and survival (LD, P = .01; ED, P = .02). A performance status of 0 or 1 was associated with improved response rates in both subsets, but was statistically significant (P = .04) only for overall objective response in LD patients. Performance status was a highly significant predictor of survival in both LD and ED groups (P less than .001). Supraclavicular lymph node involvement, while still LD, had a borderline unfavorable impact on survival (P = .06) compared with a lesser extent of LD involvement. In ED patients, a decrease in survival rates was associated with an increased number of metastatic sites (P = .01). Changes in the patient population were noted with time: the percentage of women increased from 21% to greater than 35%; an increased number of metastatic sites was identified among ED patients; mean performance status improved for both LD and ED subsets. These trends reflect the changing demographics of lung cancer, improved lung cancer staging, and probably lead-time bias. Response rates, overall survival, and long-term (greater than 2-year) survival varied significantly among the five protocols, both before and after multivariate correction for identified prognostic variables.

Clomesone exhibited significant antitumor activity against the murine L1210 leukemia implanted i.p., s.c., and intracerebrally (i.c.). Activity against s.c.-implanted tumor was largely independent of schedule and route of administration. Therapeutically optimal single-dose treatment (for tumored mice) was less toxic to nontumored mice than therapeutically optimal prolonged treatment. Clomesone also exhibited activity against other murine tumors (P388 leukemia, B16 melanoma, Lewis lung carcinoma, and M5076 sarcoma). It was active against P388 leukemia sublines resistant to cyclophosphamide, L-phenylalanine mustard, and cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II). No activity was observed against a P388 subline resistant to N,N'-bis(2-chloroethyl)-N-nitrosourea or against Ridgway osteogenic sarcoma, a nitrosourea-resistant murine solid tumor. Clomesone is generally as effective as the chloroethylnitrosoureas against experimental tumor models. Since clomesone does not have the hydroxyethylating and carbamoylating activities of the chloroethylnitrosoureas (which do not appear to contribute to antitumor activity), it would likely be a more toxicologically selective compound.

The acquisition of maturation markers and changes in the activity, level, and phosphorylation of Topo II were determined after treatment with either novobiocin, a Topo II inhibitor, or PMA. Novobiocin at 50-150 microM induced differentiation in the HL-205 cells but not in the HL-525 cells, although both cell types were equally susceptible to novobiocin-evoked cytotoxicity. In both cell types, novobiocin induced similar reductions in topoisomerase I activity but different reductions in Topo II activity. Treatment with novobiocin at 150 microM for 6 h or at 2 mM for 30 min resulted in a 4-fold or higher reduction in Topo II activity in the differentiation-susceptible HL-205 cells but not in the differentiation-resistant HL-525 cells. A differential response in Topo II activity was also observed after treatment with PMA. The novobiocin-evoked decrease in Topo II activity seems to be due to an enhanced enzyme proteolysis, whereas the PMA-elicited decrease in Topo II activity is associated with an increase in Topo II phosphorylation. 1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine, which is an inhibitor of protein kinases, including protein kinase C, diminished the novobiocin-elicited proteolysis of Topo II and the PMA-induced Topo II phosphorylation, as well as the decrease in Topo II activity and the acquisition of differentiation markers induced by either novobiocin or PMA. These results suggest that induction of differentiation in HL-60 cells by novobiocin or PMA is associated with a reduction in Topo II activity, mediated directly or indirectly by a protein kinase(s), perhaps protein kinase C.","['Constantinou, A', 'Henning-Chubb, C', 'Huberman, E']","['Constantinou A', 'Henning-Chubb C', 'Huberman E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '17EC19951N (Novobiocin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/analysis', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*analysis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Novobiocin/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Mar 1;49(5):1110-7.,"['Medical Research Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Illinois 60439.']",['GM10662/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 750-bp LTR modified polytropic proviral structures were phylogenetically more restricted, being equally predominant in Mus musculus domesticus mice, but minor to undetectable in Mus spretus subspecies, and absent in other wild mouse populations.","[""Ch'ang, L Y"", 'Yang, W K', 'Myer, F E', 'Koh, C K', 'Boone, L R']","[""Ch'ang LY"", 'Yang WK', 'Myer FE', 'Koh CK', 'Boone LR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Genes', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/genetics/*microbiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muridae/genetics/*microbiology', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1989 Feb;168(2):245-55. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(89)90264-x.,"['Biology Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee 37831-8077.']",['Y01-ES-4-0118/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,['10.1016/0042-6822(89)90264-x [doi]'],,"['GENBANK/M23424', 'GENBANK/M23425', 'GENBANK/M23426', 'GENBANK/M23427']",,,,,,,,,,

Genetic potential for milk production was significantly greater in seropositive cows with persistent lymphocytosis (622 +/- 72 kg) and in seropositive hematologically normal cows (554 +/- 34 34 kg) than in seronegative herdmates (418 +/- 53 kg). When 305-day twice-daily-milking mature equivalent milk production records for the current lactation were adjusted for genetic potential, bovine leukemia virus-infected cows that were hematologically normal had significantly greater milk production than did seronegative herdmates, suggesting that early bovine leukemia virus infection was positively associated with milk yield. Genetic potential for fat production was significantly greater for cows with persistent lymphocytosis (21 +/- 2 kg) than for other seropositive (16 +/- 1 kg) and seronegative herdmates (13 +/- 2 kg); however, 305-day twice-daily-milking mature equivalent fat production for the current lactation was not significantly different between the groups. Thus, cows with persistent lymphocytosis did not produce fat according to their genetic potential. As an apparent consequence of tendencies for greater milk yield and less fat production, milk fat percentage was significantly reduced in cows with persistent lymphocytosis (3.33 +/- 0.09%) and other seropositive cows (3.48 +/- 0.05%) relative to seronegative herdmates (3.67 +/- 0.07%).

Cells exposed to arachidonic acid and the Ca2+ ionophore 23187 produced up to 180 times more LTs at the nonpermissive temperature (42 degrees C) than at the permissive temperature (37 degrees C). Induction of LT synthesis was detectable within 2 hr after temperature shift, whereas conventional macrophage markers became evident after 2-3 days. N-Formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine, opsonized zymosan, and complement factor C5a induced LT synthesis in temperature-sensitive mutant-transformed cells only when the cells were maintained at 42 degrees C, and this effect was blocked by pertussis toxin. When cells were kept at 42 degrees C for 48 hr and then shifted back to 37 degrees C to induce retrodifferentiation, LT synthesis rates declined within 8 hr and reached near control values within 36 hr. Retrodifferentiation also led to decreased LT synthesis in response to N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine, opsonized zymosan, and C5a.

Ha-MuSV induces focal transformation of mouse NIH 3T3 cells in vitro and tumors (fibrosarcomas and splenic erythroleukemias) in newborn mice. We have used these two assays to study the contribution of coding and noncoding viral sequences to the biological activity of Ha-MuSV. A good correlation was found between the in vitro and in vivo assays. In several different isogenic Ha-MuSV variants, those with a rasH gene that had one or both of the Ha-MuSV missense mutations were much more active biologically than the corresponding proto-oncogene. A Ha-MuSV variant that encoded the proto-oncogene protein induced lymphoid leukemias (with thymomas), with a relatively long latent period, rather than the fibrosarcomas and erythroleukemias characteristic of Ha-MuSV with one or both missense mutations. A VL30-derived segment with enhancer activity was identified downstream from v-rasH. A mutant Ha-MuSV from which this 3' noncoding segment was deleted expressed lower levels of the wild-type viral protein, displayed impaired transforming activity in vitro, and induced lymphoid leukemias (with thymomas). 5' noncoding rat c-rasH sequences were found to increase the biological activity of the virus when substituted for the corresponding segment of v-rasH. We conclude that (i) the biological activity of Ha-MuSV can be influence significantly by noncoding sequences located outside the long terminal repeat as well as by coding sequences, (ii) VL30 sequences positively regulate the expression of v-rasH, (iii) relatively low biological levels of ras, whether resulting from low-level expression of wild type v-rasH or high-levels of ras proto-oncogene protein, induce a type of tumor that differs from tumors induced by high biological levels of ras, and (iv) the in vivo pathogenicity of the Ha-MuSV variants correlated with their transforming activity on NIH 3T3 cells.","['Velu, T J', 'Vass, W C', 'Lowy, D R', 'Tambourin, P E']","['Velu TJ', 'Vass WC', 'Lowy DR', 'Tambourin PE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Oncogene Protein p21(ras))']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Harvey murine sarcoma virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Protein p21(ras)', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/*genetics', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*genetics', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Mar;63(3):1384-92. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.3.1384-1392.1989.,"['Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",,PMC247837,['10.1128/JVI.63.3.1384-1392.1989 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We conclude that conversion of normal proto-ras genes to viral ras genes depends on truncation of normal proto-ras regulatory elements and substitution by retroviral (long terminal repeat) promoters and that the transforming function of long terminal repeat-ras genes is enhanced by point mutations.","['Cichutek, K', 'Duesberg, P H']","['Cichutek K', 'Duesberg PH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Codon', 'Erythroblasts', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Rats', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/genetics']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Mar;63(3):1377-83. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.3.1377-1383.1989.,"['Department of Molecular Biology, University of California, Berkeley 94720.']",['5 R35 CA39915/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC247836,['10.1128/JVI.63.3.1377-1383.1989 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Other MCF viruses, such as MCF 30-2, replicate to high titers in thymocytes and do not accelerate the onset of leukemia. We used these two MCF viruses with different biological phenotypes to distinguish the effect of specific viral genes and genetic determinants on thymotropism and leukemogenicity. Our goal was to identify the viral sequences that distinguish thymotropic, nonleukemogenic viruses such as MCF 30-2 from thymotropic, leukemogenic viruses such as MCF 247. We cloned MCF 30-2, compared the genetic hallmarks of MCF 30-2 with those of MCF 247, constructed a series of recombinants, and tested the ability of recombinant viruses to replicate in the thymus and to induce leukemia. The results established that (i) MCF 30-2 and MCF 247 differ in the numbers of copies of the enhancer sequences in the long terminal repeats. (ii) The thymotropic phenotype of both viruses is independent of the number of copies of the enhancer sequences. (iii) The oncogenic phenotype of MCF 247 is correlated with the presence in the virus of duplicated enhancer sequences or with the presence of an enhancer with a specific sequence. These results show that the pathogenic phenotypes of MCF viruses are dissociable from the thymotropic phenotype and depend, at least in part, upon the enhancer sequences. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the molecular mechanisms by which the enhancer sequences determine thymotropism are different from those that determine oncogenicity.","['Holland, C A', 'Thomas, C Y', 'Chattopadhyay, S K', 'Koehne, C', ""O'Donnell, P V""]","['Holland CA', 'Thomas CY', 'Chattopadhyay SK', 'Koehne C', ""O'Donnell PV""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleotide Mapping', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics', 'Thymus Gland/*microbiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Mar;63(3):1284-92. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.3.1284-1292.1989.,"['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester 01605.']","['CA 39851/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC247825,['10.1128/JVI.63.3.1284-1292.1989 [doi]'],,"['GENBANK/M26169', 'GENBANK/M26170']",,,,,,,,,,

The stages of development of this disease were defined for C57BL mice on the basis of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly; histopathological changes consistent with B-cell activation; and alterations in expression of cell surface antigens affected by proliferation of T cells, B cells, and macrophages. By using this disease profile as a standard, the response of adult mice of various inbred strains and selected F1 hybrids was compared. We show that although the strains which are highly sensitive are of the Fv-1b genotype (i.e., permissive for B-tropic MuLVs), certain Fv-1b strains, e.g., BALB/c and A/J, are resistant to murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, whereas certain Fv-1n strains (permissive for N-tropic MuLVs but restrictive for B-tropic MuLVs), notably P/N, BDP, and AKR, show moderate sensitivity and (C57BL/6 x CBA/N)F1 mice (Fv-1n/b and thus dually restrictive) are of relatively high susceptibility.

The protective effect of anti-idiotype immunization appeared to be T dependent, because immunization of athymic mice had no effect on their susceptibility to tumor virus challenge.

Under these conditions PR cleaves decapeptides which are resistant in low ionic strength. This high, nonphysiological, salt concentration also increases the proteolytic activity of a cellular aspartic protease, pepsin. PR and pepsin show additional similarities: they both cleave a synthetic decapeptide at the same Tyr-Pro bond in low and high salt, while the cleavage site preferences of human renin and cathepsin-D in this substrate are altered at high salt concentrations. In addition, iodination of the tyrosine residue in this decapeptide causes an increase in the rates of hydrolysis by both PR and pepsin. However, Km values are too high to be estimated accurately for PR using Tyr-Pro and Tyr(I)-Pro decapeptides as substrates. Comparison of the digestion products of two additional decapeptides, altered in a single amino acid residue, shows that PR cleaves at fewer sites than all three cellular enzymes.

The interaction of Cp2ZrCl2 and Cp2VCl2 with adriamycin leads to compounds of 1:2 metal:drug stoichiometry, whereas the interaction of Cp2TiCl2 with adriamycin leads to two types of compounds of 1:2 and 1:1 stoichiometry. The Zr-adriamycin complex, which is unable to dissociate, even at a pH lower than 1, does not display antitumor activity against P-388 leukemia. However Ti-adriamycin complexes, which are more susceptible to dissociation in acidic media, exhibit antitumor activity that compares with that of the free drug. These complexes, unlike adriamycin, do not catalyze the flow of electrons from NADH to molecular oxygen through NADH dehydrogenase.

In the present work we have investigated whether Na+/H+ exchange is involved in normal human B cell proliferation and whether it is also operating in malignant B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) lymphocytes. Our results show that: 1) normal human B cells contain an operating Na+/H+ exchanger, as inferred by their ability to recover pHi after acid-loading in a HCO3- -free medium and by evidences that LPS and phorbol ester PMA elicit a pHi rise inhibitable by either 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA) or a Na+-free medium; 2) LPS-induced proliferation of normal human B cells is strongly inhibited when the amiloride analog EIPA (5 microM) is present in the culture medium (after 72 h the proportion of B cells incorporation bromodeoxyuridine falls from 13.9 +/- 3.9% to 2.8 +/- 1.1%); 3) EIPA does not affect BdR incorporation when B cells proliferation is induced by the co-mitogenic activity of IL-4 and low m.w. B cell growth factor (BCGF); 4) B-CLL cells, which proliferate in response to IL-4/BCGF but not to LPS, fail to increase pHi above their pHi resting levels when challenged with LPS or PMA and pHi recovery after acid-loading is highly impaired. These results lead to conclude that Na+/H+ exchange operation is necessary for LPS-(but not for IL-4/BCGF)-induced proliferation of human normal B lymphocytes and that Na+/H+ exchange activation is impaired in malignant B-CLL lymphocytes.","['Gaidano, G', 'Ghigo, D', 'Schena, M', 'Bergui, L', 'Treves, S', 'Turrini, F', 'Cappio, F C', 'Bosia, A']","['Gaidano G', 'Ghigo D', 'Schena M', 'Bergui L', 'Treves S', 'Turrini F', 'Cappio FC', 'Bosia A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '7DZO8EB0Z3 (Amiloride)', 'VW50CE070T (ethylisopropylamiloride)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Amiloride/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/classification/immunology/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*physiology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Interleukin-4', 'Interleukins', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/immunology/*metabolism', '*Lipopolysaccharides', '*Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Feb 1;142(3):913-8.,"['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, Universita di Torino, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-eight-hour coculture of normal feline bone marrow mononuclear cells with an underlayer of FSC-infected feline fibroblasts (FeF) resulted in infection of 60% to 90% of marrow mononuclear cells and pronounced depletion of early erythroid progenitor cells (BFUe). The dramatic depletion of BFUe was specific for FSC and did not occur in marrow cells infected with a molecularly cloned nonanemogenic subgroup A FeLV (FeLV 1161E; F6A). The ablation of BFUe by FSC in vitro paralleled both the decrease in BFUe and the induction of aplastic anemia in vivo.

VPL was administered as a loading dose (i.v.) (0.15 mg/kg) and then administered as a constant infusion (0.005 mg/kg) over 6 days. 24 h after verapamil, VNB 2 mg/m2 IVP was administered and followed 1 h later by a 5-day simultaneous continuous infusion of VP-16 (200 mg/m2/day) to seven pediatric patients (11 courses) with refractory malignancies. The mean age at treatment was 7.5 +/- 5.3 years, mean prior anthracycline dose (303 +/- 210 mg/m2) with a range of 0-606 mg/m2. Toxicity was limited to cardiac and hematological. The median nadir of the WBC was 900 at 14.5 +/- 0.5 days and platelet count 32,000 at 15.5 +/- 0.8 days. There were two episodes of bacterial sepsis both of which responded to i.v. antibiotics. Five of 11 courses resulted in first-degree block and one course in second-degree block. At Hour 120 of the VPL infusion the PR interval was 0.18 +/- 0.01 versus 0.13 +/- 0.01 at Hour 0 (P less than 0.0004). The ejection fraction by two-dimensional echocardiogram was not significantly different at Hour 0, 24, or 120 of the infusion (60.6 +/- 2.7 versus 52.7 +/- 5.1 versus 51.8 +/- 5.0%).

Two of 11 treatment courses resulted in hypotension secondary to inordinately high 24-h levels of VPL (1233 and 1263 ng/ml). These two episodes required inotropic support but did not require the discontinuation of VPL. There were 8 of 11 partial responses, the majority of which consisted of peripheral cytoreduction of leukemic blasts and one M-2A response in AML. The levels of VPL achieved in this study have been shown to augment the in vitro cytotoxicity of vinblastine and VP-16 to resistant cell lines.

Strain LY-S is sensitive to ionizing radiation relative to strain LY-R and is deficient in the rejoining of DNA double-strand breaks induced by this agent, whereas 2 radiation-resistant variants of strain LY-S have regained the ability to rejoin these double-strand breaks. We have found that the sensitivity of these cells to m-AMSA, VP-16, and ellipticine is correlated to their sensitivity to ionizing radiation. However, this correlation did not extend to their sensitivities to novobiocin, camptothecin, hydrogen peroxide, methyl nitrosourea and UV radiation. Thus, there appears to be a unique correlation between sensitivity to ionizing radiation and to topoisomerase II inhibitors which stabilize the cleavable complex between the enzyme and DNA. It is possible either that (1) topoisomerase II is altered in strain LY-S and that this enzyme is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks or (2) strain LY-S is deficient in a reaction which is necessary for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation as well as the repair of DNA damage induced by these topoisomerase II inhibitors. m-AMSA, VP-16, and ellipticine were found to be highly mutagenic at the tk locus in L5178Y strains which are heterozygous for the tk gene but not in a tk hemizygous strain, indicating that these inhibitors induce multilocus lesions in DNA, as does ionizing radiation. The differences in the sensitivity of strains LY-R and LY-S to the topoisomerase II inhibitors were paralleled by differences in the induction of protein-associated DNA double-strand breaks in the 2 strains. This correlation did not extend to the radiation-resistant variants of strain LY-S, however. The variants showed resistance to the cytotoxic effects of the inhibitors relative to strain LY-S, but exhibited DNA double-strand break induction similar to that observed in strain LY-S.","['Evans, H H', 'Ricanati, M', 'Horng, M F', 'Mencl, J']","['Evans HH', 'Ricanati M', 'Horng MF', 'Mencl J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Ellipticines)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '117VLW7484 (ellipticine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*pharmacology', 'Ellipticines/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L5178/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation', '*Radiation Tolerance', 'Species Specificity', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1989 Jan;217(1):53-63. doi: 10.1016/0921-8777(89)90036-0.,"['Department of Radiology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106.']","['P30 CA 43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA 15901/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0921-8777(89)90036-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0921-8777(89)90036-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Various single or mixed Marek's disease vaccines were inoculated at day 1, and ALV was injected at 1 to 10 days, with chickens of several experimental or commercial strains. Development of LL was monitored at 16 to 48 weeks in various experiments. In several strains of chickens we repeatedly found that the widely used serotype 3 turkey herpesvirus vaccine did not augment LL in comparison with unvaccinated controls. However, LL development and incidence were prominently augmented in several chicken strains vaccinated with serotype 2 vaccines, used alone or as mixtures with other serotypes. In one chicken strain, augmentation was demonstrated after natural exposure to ALV or serotype 2 Marek's disease virus viremic shedder chickens. Augmentation of LL by virulent or attenuated Marek's disease viruses of serotype 1 was intermediate in effect. Serotype 2 Marek's disease virus augmentation of LL was prominent in three laboratory lines and one commercial strain of White Leghorns, but it was not observed in an LL-resistant laboratory line or four commercial strains susceptible to ALV infection. Chickens developed similar levels of viremia and neutralizing antibodies to ALV regardless of the presence of augmentation of LL, suggesting that the mechanism of enhanced LL did not result from differences in susceptibility or immune response to ALV. We postulate that the serotype 2 herpesviruses may augment LL through one of several possible influences on bursal cells that are subsequently transformed by exogenous ALV.","['Bacon, L D', 'Witter, R L', 'Fadly, A M']","['Bacon LD', 'Witter RL', 'Fadly AM']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Vaccines, Attenuated)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Avian Leukosis/*etiology/pathology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Chickens/classification', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Herpesvirus 2, Gallid/classification/immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Vaccines, Attenuated/toxicity', 'Viral Vaccines/*toxicity', 'Viremia/etiology']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Feb;63(2):504-12. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.2.504-512.1989.,"['U.S. Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service Regional Poultry Research Laboratory, East Lansing, Michigan 48823.']",,PMC247718,['10.1128/JVI.63.2.504-512.1989 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The possibility that the lymphocyte recombinase apparatus plays a role in determining the position of breakage at the second locus has been a matter of controversy because of the inconsistent presence of heptamer-like recognition sequences adjoining breakpoints at this site. To further investigate this issue, sites of DNA recombination were analyzed in both the der(9) and der(7) products of t(7;9)(q34;q32), a recurrent translocation of human acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL). In each of three separate cases, the translocation has divided the TCR-beta locus, juxtaposing chromosome 9 DNA 5' to a J-region in the der(9) product and 3' to a D-region in the der(7) product, with variably sized N-insertions and small deletions detectable at the junctions. All three cases contain breakpoints in chromosome 9 DNA tightly clustered between two closely spaced, and oppositely oriented heptamer sequences, CAC(A/T)GTG, which perfectly match the consensus heptamer sequence recognized by the lymphocyte recombinase apparatus in normal antigen receptor gene rearrangement. In no case was there evidence of directly duplicated sequences in the two reciprocal products, as is often associated with recombination involving random staggered breakage of DNA. Taken together, these results support a mechanism for this particular translocation proceeding by recombinase-mediated breakage of both participating chromosomes.","['Tycko, B', 'Reynolds, T C', 'Smith, S D', 'Sklar, J']","['Tycko B', 'Reynolds TC', 'Smith SD', 'Sklar J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (DNA Probes)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*physiology', 'DNA Probes', '*Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'VDJ Recombinases']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1989 Feb 1;169(2):369-77. doi: 10.1084/jem.169.2.369.,"['Department of Pathology, Stanford University, California 94305.']",['CA-34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2189206,['10.1084/jem.169.2.369 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

I. (1983) J. Clin. Invest. 71, 1273-1281). In contrast, along with tubulin tyrosinolation, a distinctly different respiratory burst-associated random posttranslational incorporation of tyrosine into multiple PMN proteins is observed in PMNs stimulated with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (DAG). In studies exploring the mechanism(s) of signal transduction for these distinct neutrophil responses, we found that the fMet-Leu-Phe-induced stimulation of tubulin tyrosinolation in PMNs and in differentiated HL-60 cells is completely blocked by pertussis toxin, while the PMA-induced random incorporation of tyrosine is not inhibited. We also found that expression of the fMet-Leu-Phe-mediated stimulation of tubulin tyrosinolation in HL-60 cells is correlated with increases in the specific activity of protein kinase C and with the acquisition of respiratory burst activity which occur during induced myeloid maturation of these cells. Furthermore, both the fMet-Leu-Phe-induced stimulation of tubulin tyrosinolation and the PMA or DAG-induced random posttranslational incorporation of tyrosine into multiple proteins in activated neutrophils, were found to be reversibly inhibited (greater than 70%) by the protein kinase inhibitors 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)piperazine (C-I) and 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7), in parallel with inhibition of superoxide (O2-) generation. In related studies, we also found that fMet-Leu-Phe-stimulated O2- production is comparably inhibited by C-I and H-7, but in a highly temperature-dependent manner. Inhibition was observed only when C-I or H-7 is added to PMNs at physiologic temperature, i.e. 37 degrees C. Interestingly, inhibition of the PMA-induced O2- generation by C-I or H-7 was not found to be similarly temperature-dependent. Considered together, these findings argue against the suggestion that there is a protein kinase C-independent pathway for activation of the respiratory burst in neutrophils stimulated with N-formyl peptides.","['Nath, J', 'Powledge, A', 'Wright, D G']","['Nath J', 'Powledge A', 'Wright DG']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Tubulin)', '1069-87-0 (1,2-dioctanoylglycerol)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Diglycerides/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Oxygen Consumption', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', '*Signal Transduction', 'Superoxides/blood', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tubulin/*genetics', '*Tyrosine']",1989/01/15 00:00,1989/01/15 00:01,['1989/01/15 00:00'],"['1989/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Jan 15;264(2):848-55.,"['Department of Hematology, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Washington, D.C. 20307-5100.']",,,['S0021-9258(19)85020-2 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The work described here was initiated to test directly for a causative relationship between MuLV expression and resistance to lysis by macrophages. Northern blot analysis revealed that macrophage-resistant cells contain full length retroviral RNA. A panel of mAb which distinguish among host-range classes of MuLV detected only a non-recombinant ecotropic gp70 in these cells. The ecotropic MuLV from two independently derived macrophage resistant cells were isolated by limiting dilution cloning on Mus dunii fibroblasts. These viruses were then used to infect macrophage-sensitive cell lines and the resultant MuLV-positive cells tested for sensitivity to macrophage cytolysis. The MuLV-infected lines remained highly sensitive to macrophage lysis despite their high levels of cell surface gp70 and release of infectious MuLV. Thus, although we cannot rule out the possibility that MuLV or a product thereof is necessary for development of macrophage resistance in transformed cells, expression of MuLV per se is not sufficient to create the resistant phenotype.","['Gooding, L R', 'Taylor, J R', 'Laster, S M', 'Wehrly, K', 'Chesebro, B', 'Brickell, P M', 'Latchmann, D S', 'Rigby, P W']","['Gooding LR', 'Taylor JR', 'Laster SM', 'Wehrly K', 'Chesebro B', 'Brickell PM', 'Latchmann DS', 'Rigby PW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,['0 (Retroviridae Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Fibroblasts/immunology/microbiology/transplantation', '*Immunity, Cellular', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology/genetics/immunology', '*Macrophage Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics', 'Simian virus 40', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Jan 1;142(1):257-62.,"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322.']","['AI 07265/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-40266/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although intact ATCC HL-60 cells specifically and saturably take up 1,25-dihydroxy[3H]vitamin D-3, whole cell extracts have little or no specific binding of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3. The absence of specific binding can now be explained by the action of a serine proteinase in these cells. When diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), a potent inhibitor of serine proteinase, is added to the buffer used for extraction, specific binding of 1,25-dihydroxy[3H]vitamin D-3 in the extract is observed. The loss of specific binding could not be prevented by hydrolyzed DFP or other serine proteinase inhibitors, such as phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, benzamidine and aprotinin. The proteolytic activity from ATCC cells also destroyed specific 1,25-dihydroxy[3H]vitamin D-3 binding in high-salt extracts from pig intestinal nuclei or from another HL-60 cell line (LG HL-60 cells). However, the proteinase did not affect the levels of the specific binding in these preparations if the receptor was occupied with 1,25-dihydroxy[3H]vitamin D-3 prior to exposure to the proteinase. The binding and sedimentation characteristics of the receptors from various sources were not changed by the presence of DFP. The Kd of the receptor in ATCC HL-60 cells is 1.2.10(-10) M, which is identical to that in the LG HL-60 cells. The 1,25-dihydroxy[3H]vitamin D-3 receptor complex from the ATCC cells sediments as a single 3.5 S component and elutes from DNA-Sephadex column in two peaks at 0.09 and 0.15 M KCl. The material eluting at 0.15 M KCl has the same DNA-binding activity as preparations from pig intestine or LG HL-60 cells. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies to the pig receptor, IVG8C11, quantitatively precipitate the 1,25-dihydroxy[3H]vitamin D-3-binding activity from ATCC HL-60 cells as well as that from LG HL-60 cells or pig intestinal nuclei. Therefore, the previous failure to demonstrate the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 receptor in ATCC HL-60 cells is because of the presence of a potent serine proteinase and not because of an abnormal or absent receptor.","['Inaba, M', 'DeLuca, H F']","['Inaba M', 'DeLuca HF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '12UHW9R67N (Isoflurophate)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Humans', 'Isoflurophate/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Calcitriol', 'Receptors, Steroid/*metabolism']",1989/01/17 00:00,1989/01/17 00:01,['1989/01/17 00:00'],"['1989/01/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/17 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/17 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1989 Jan 17;1010(1):20-7. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(89)90179-1.,"['College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Department of Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison 53706.']",['DK-14881/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,"['0167-4889(89)90179-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(89)90179-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of a series of mutants affecting the expression of various portions of p135 indicated that the v-ets gene acts to mitogenically stimulate the proliferation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and reduces or abolishes their serum dependence.

Immunoprecipitation analysis of the extracellular glycoproteins of 61E and EECC, a replication-competent viral construct composed of the 61C env and 3' long terminal repeat fused to the 61E gag-pol genes, demonstrated that the gp70 of EECC could be distinguished from that of 61E by both feline immune serum and a murine monoclonal antibody. Molecular weights of both the envelope precursor polyprotein (gp80) and the mature extracellular glycoprotein (gp70) of 61E were smaller than the corresponding proteins from the pathogenic EECC. Both the molecular weight disparity and monoclonal antibody discrimination of the two gp80s were abolished by inhibition of envelope protein glycosylation with tunicamycin, whereas the apparent gp70 size differences were resolved by enzymatic removal of N-linked oligosaccharides. Pulse-chase studies in EECC-infected cells demonstrated that processing of gp80 to gp70 was delayed and that this retardation of envelope glycoprotein processing could be simulated in 61E-infected cells by treatment with the glucosidase inhibitor N-methyldeoxynojirimycin, a compound that causes retention of oligosaccharides in the high-mannose form. The resultant 61E gp70 then could be recognized by sera from EECC-immunized cats. The presence of a higher content of sialic acid on the apathogenic 61E gp70 indicated that oligosaccharides of 61E and EECC gp70 were processed differently. These data suggested that the unique biochemical properties which distinguish the envelope glycoproteins of the FeLV-FAIDS variant from its companion apathogenic parent virus were responsible for T-cell cytopathicity and induction of immunodeficiency disease. Further biochemical characterization of these glycoproteins should be useful in understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of immunodeficiency disease induced by retroviruses.","['Poss, M L', 'Mullins, J I', 'Hoover, E A']","['Poss ML', 'Mullins JI', 'Hoover EA']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Glycoproteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Glycoside Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics/immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Molecular Weight', 'Precipitin Tests', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Retroviridae Proteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology/*metabolism']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Jan;63(1):189-95. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.1.189-195.1989.,"['Department of Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523.']","['R01 AI 25273/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 01058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 43216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC247672,['10.1128/JVI.63.1.189-195.1989 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on pHi is dose dependent in a parallel manner to its effect on the proliferation and differentiation processes. The elevation of pHi by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is gradual but precedes the differentiation process. A significant increase in pHi was obtained after 16 h of incubation with the hormone and reached its maximum level after 48 h. pHi then dropped back to its initial level, which is also similar to that of peripheral normal blood monocytes. A rise in pHi was not observed during incubation of HL-60 cells with 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, a metabolite which does not promote their differentiation. In contrast, other agents such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate known to induce differentiation in this cell line do cause an increase in pHi. Moreover, alkalinization of HL-60 cells by NH4Cl causes induction of differentiation to monocytes. The results suggest that a rise in pHi plays a role in regulating the molecular mechanism of the inhibition of proliferation and the induction of differentiation in HL-60 cells.","['Hazav, P', 'Shany, S', 'Moran, A', 'Levy, R']","['Hazav P', 'Shany S', 'Moran A', 'Levy R']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers)', '01Q9PC255D (Ammonium Chloride)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Ammonium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Monocytes/pathology', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Jan 1;49(1):72-5.,"['Unit of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similarly, quantitative analysis of DNA cleavage activity using 3' 32P-end-labeled pBR322 restriction fragments showed that drug-stimulated topoisomerase II cleavage activity in nuclear extracts from sensitive cells was approximately 1.7- and 2.9-fold greater than that from resistant clone 3 and 7 cells, respectively. Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts from the three cell lines using antibody against the C-terminal half of recombinant-prepared human topoisomerase II polypeptide revealed reduced immunoreactivity of topoisomerase II protein in the drug-resistant cells.

The mechanism of action of these three agents involves conversion to the active methanediazonium ion and subsequent methylation of cellular macromolecules. As a consequence, the rates of conversion of the parent agent to the methylating species in the medium and within the cell are important parameters that also need to be considered to reach a more detailed understanding of the mechanism of action. In order to do this, a kinetic model has been developed to calculate the concentration of drug that is converted to active methylating species within the cell during the assay incubation period. The use of cell culture kinetic models was extended from simple compounds activated through solvolytic reactions (nitrosoureas) to an agent that undergoes selective intracellular activation (MNNG). By use of measured values for initial drug concentration, incubation time, and cell volume, as well as extracellular and intracellular chemical activation rate constants, the intracellular concentration, [P4], which represents the cumulative intracellular reaction products formed during the incubation period, was calculated and related to cytotoxicity.

Many reports have followed to show the presence of a transforming hst-1 gene in various types of cancerous and noncancerous tissues, suggesting that the hst-1 gene is the most common non-ras transforming gene. We cloned the hst-1 genomic fragments from DNAs of a normal individual and a patient with leukemia and also from NIH3T3 cells themselves. All of these clones transformed NIH3T3 cells upon transfection. Sequence analysis of the cDNA and genomic hst-1 led us to conclude that the normal hst-1 protein transforms NIH3T3 cells when its expression is deregulated. The hst-1 protein has 40-50% homology to basic and acidic fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and to the int-2 protein. The purified hst-1 protein synthesized in a baculovirus system was a potent heparin-binding growth factor for a variety of cells, including human endothelial cells. The hst-1 protein, when it was added to the culture medium, induced morphological transformation of NIH3T3 cells and anchorage-independent growth of NRK cells. The hst-1 gene is located 35 kbp downstream of one of its homologous genes, int-2, on human chromosome 11 at band q13.3. As in the case with the int-2 gene, the hst-1 transcripts were not detected in adult mice but found in mouse embryos. A relatively large amount of the hst-1 message was present in a mouse teratocarcinoma cell line, F9, while the int-2 mRNA was barely detected. Upon induction of differentiation in vitro, the hst-1 transcription was depressed to almost nil, and the int-2 message increased dramatically. The hst-1 and int-2 genes were coamplified in a variety of cancer cells, most notably in more than 50% of esophageal cancers.","['Terada, M', 'Yoshida, T', 'Sakamoto, H', 'Miyagawa, K', 'Katoh, O', 'Hattori, Y', 'Sugimura, T']","['Terada M', 'Yoshida T', 'Sakamoto H', 'Miyagawa K', 'Katoh O', 'Hattori Y', 'Sugimura T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Princess Takamatsu Symp,Princess Takamatsu symposia,9301172,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (FGF3 protein, human)', '0 (FGF4 protein, human)', '0 (Fgf3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fgf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 3)', '0 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 4)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 3', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 4', '*Fibroblast Growth Factors', 'Fibroblasts', 'Growth Substances/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Multigene Family', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/physiology', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transfection']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Princess Takamatsu Symp. 1989;20:71-80.,"['National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,41,,,,,,,

When degenerative lesions of the pulpal connective structures, and vascular-nervous complex have occurred, or when leukemic invading processes have been identified biological therapy is completely counterindicated.","['Gafar, M', 'Puchita, M', 'Popa, B', 'Pambuccian, G']","['Gafar M', 'Puchita M', 'Popa B', 'Pambuccian G']",['rum'],['Journal Article'],Romania,Rev Chir Oncol Radiol O R L Oftalmol Stomatol Ser Stomatol,"Revista de chirurgie, oncologie, radiologie, o. r. l., oftalmologie, stomatologie.

The I-J molecule detected by specific immunoprecipitation and subsequent one- or two-dimensional gel analysis was a Mr 84-90 K dimer composed of 42-46 K glycopeptide subunits having isoelectric point pH 5.3 to 6.4. A monomeric form of I-J also existed in some of the T cell clones. The I-J subunit was a glycosylated polypeptide with a 41 K backbone having at least two glycosylation sites. I-J was distinguishable from other known dimeric T cell surface molecules with comparable molecular size, that is, T cell receptor alpha beta heterodimer, A1 and YE molecules expressed on a T cell leukemia EL4, and mouse CD28. The I-Jk molecule was precipitable from T cell clones with I-Ak and I-Ek restriction specificities including a clone derived from an H-2b----H-2bxkF1 radiation bone marrow chimera. None of the H-2b-restricted T cell clones from H-2b and its F1 showed the I-Jk immunoreactivity. T cell clones having either I-Ab or I-Ek restriction specificities derived from intra-H-2 recombinant mouse B10.A(5R) were positive for the I-Jk, while an I-Ab-restricted T cell clone from B10.A(3R) was negative in the I-Jk immunoprecipitation. The results indicate that I-J is a novel dimeric surface molecule, most likely to be a homodimer, expressed on T cells according to the major histocompatibility complex.","['Nakayama, T', 'Kubo, R T', 'Kishimoto, H', 'Asano, Y', 'Tada, T']","['Nakayama T', 'Kubo RT', 'Kishimoto H', 'Asano Y', 'Tada T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (I-J-antigen)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (Acetylglucosaminidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.96 (Mannosyl-Glycoprotein Endo-beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidase)']",IM,"['Acetylglucosaminidase', 'Animals', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Mannosyl-Glycoprotein Endo-beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidase', 'Mice', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Species Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 1989;1(1):50-8. doi: 10.1093/intimm/1.1.50.,"['Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",,,['10.1093/intimm/1.1.50 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The hybrid cells contained different portions of the human chromosome 1 on a murine background. A total of 20 randomly chosen single or low-copy microclones were localized by Southern analysis on DNA of the hybrid panel: All probes were derived from chromosome I. Sixteen mapped in region 1p36.1-pter, two in 1p22-p36.1, and another two in 1cen-qter. The mapping of ten of these microclones was further refined by in situ hybridization.

These findings suggest that the newly identified TcR delta chain gene rearranges at a very early stage of T cell ontogeny; prior to the other TcR genes and perhaps at almost the same differentiation level as that of CD7 expression. The TcR delta gene is useful in evaluating clonality for the most immature T cell neoplasms not showing rearrangement of the other TcR genes. This gene is not lineage specific, however, when used in conjunction with IgHC gene, it may be a useful tool for the study of ALL/LBL.","['Kimura, N', 'Kikuchi, M']","['Kimura N', 'Kikuchi M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Nihon Ketsueki Gakkai Zasshi,Nihon Ketsueki Gakkai zasshi : journal of Japan Haematological Society,2984803R,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/*genetics', 'Hematologic Diseases/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta', '*T-Lymphocytes']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nihon Ketsueki Gakkai Zasshi. 1989 Dec;52(8):1471-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study also showed that the level of erythrocyte CR1 was not related to prognostic factors in NHL patients.","['Yen, J H', 'Liu, H W', 'Lin, S F', 'Chen, T P']","['Yen JH', 'Liu HW', 'Lin SF', 'Chen TP']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China (Republic : 1949- ),Zhonghua Min Guo Wei Sheng Wu Ji Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua Minguo wei sheng wu ji mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of microbiology and immunology,8008067,"['0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Receptors, Complement 3b)']",IM,"['Erythrocytes/*immunology', 'Hematologic Diseases/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Complement/*analysis/deficiency', 'Receptors, Complement 3b']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Min Guo Wei Sheng Wu Ji Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi. 1989 Aug;22(3):186-92.,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical College, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dissociation of hapten bound to surface antibody in the presence of solution antibody.,955-66,"We present a joint theoretical and experimental study on the effects of competition for ligand between receptors in solution and receptors on cell surfaces. We focus on the following experiment. After ligand and cell surface receptors equilibrate, solution receptors are introduced, and the dissociation of surface bound ligand is monitored. We derive theoretical expressions for the dissociation rate and compare with experiment. In a standard dissociation experiment (no solution receptors present) dissociation may be slowed by rebinding, i.e., at high receptor densities a ligand that dissociates from one receptor may rebind to other receptors before separating from the cell. Our theory predicts that rebinding will be prevented when S much greater than N2Kon/(16 pi 2D a4), where S is the free receptor site concentration in solution, N the number of free surface receptor sites per cell, Kon the forward rate constant for ligand-receptor binding in solution, D the diffusion coefficient of the ligand, and a the cell radius. The predicted concentration of solution receptors needed to prevent rebinding is proportional to the square of the cell surface receptor density. The experimental system used in these studies consists of a monovalent ligand, 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP)-aminocaproyl-L-tyrosine (DCT), that reversibly binds to a monoclonal anti-DNP immunoglobulin E (IgE). This IgE is both a solution receptor and, when anchored to its high affinity Fc epsilon receptor on rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells, a surface receptor. For RBL cells with 6 x 10(5) binding sites per cell, our theory predicts that to prevent DCT rebinding to cell surface IgE during dissociation requires S much greater than 2,400 nM. We show that for S = 200-1,700 nM, the dissociation rate of DCT from surface IgE is substantially slower than from solution IgE where no rebinding occurs. Other predictions are also tested and shown to be consistent with experiment.","['Goldstein, B', 'Posner, R G', 'Torney, D C', 'Erickson, J', 'Holowka, D', 'Baird, B']","['Goldstein B', 'Posner RG', 'Torney DC', 'Erickson J', 'Holowka D', 'Baird B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Haptens)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Solutions)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Haptens', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', '*Ligands', 'Mathematics', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Solutions']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 1989 Nov;56(5):955-66. doi: 10.1016/S0006-3495(89)82741-9.,"['Theoretical Division, University of California, Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico 87545.']","['AI18306/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI22449/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM35556/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1280594,"['S0006-3495(89)82741-9 [pii]', '10.1016/S0006-3495(89)82741-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Average platelet peroxidase-positivity in blast cells of TMD patients was similar to that found in cases of MKL. Blast cells from subjects with TMD contained a number of different granules, namely, alpha granules, those that were myeloperoxidase (MPO)-positive, electron-lucent or basophil-like, and those containing membrane components or ferritin particles. On the other hand, granules found in the blast cells of MKL patients with Down's syndrome included the electron-lucent variety, those with membrane components and a few that were basophil-like, but not alpha and MPO-positive granules nor those containing ferritin particles. A demarcation membrane system was observed in blasts from the TMD group, but not in the MKL group. These findings suggest that blast cells in TMD patients differentiate to megakaryocytes, neutrophils, basphils and erythroblasts, while those in cases of MKL show limited differentiation to immature megakaryocytes, erythroblasts and, sometime, basophils.

As CD20, CD21, CD22 and membrane immunoglobulin change during or after B-cell activation, and the CD45RA/CD45RO inversion is implicated in T-cell maturation, the possibility that the phenotypic differences are generated by a maturational diversity of the CLL clones has been investigated by testing the effects of TPA treatment of the leukaemic cells. TPA reduces the level of expression of CD20, CD21, mIg and CD45RA and increases CD45RO binding, thereby minimizing the phenotypic heterogeneity of the CLL clones and causing them to converge towards one end of the natural range. We propose that the phenotypic diversity in CLL is, at least in part, a consequence of maturational diversity where lymphocyte development is disrupted at different stages in different patients.","['Maddy, A H', 'Sanderson, A', 'Mackie, M J', 'Smith, S K']","['Maddy AH', 'Sanderson A', 'Mackie MJ', 'Smith SK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunology. 1989 Nov;68(3):346-52.,"['Department of Zoology, University of Edinburgh, U.K.']",,PMC1385446,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that none of these agents affected the cytotoxicity of gelonin conjugates to any significant extent. For example, monensin moderately (3-fold) enhanced the cytotoxicity of 5E9-gelonin for Namalwa cells but showed no effect when 5E9-gelonin was tested on HeLa cells. The potentiating effects of these agents for the cytotoxicity of free gelonin varied from marked to nonexistent, depending on the type of cells. In particular, adenovirus-2 potentiated the cytotoxicity of gelonin for HeLa cells but not for Namalwa cells. The three major adenoviral capsid proteins, penton, hexon, and fiber, were isolated. It was shown that penton potentiated the cytotoxicity of gelonin for HeLa cells and that hexon and fiber had no measurable effect on the cytotoxicity of gelonin.

It has been hypothesized that a disrupted peptidergic transmission between neurons could be the cellular basis of the neurological dysfunction. Since endogenous opioids have been recently found to alter neuronal function and possess anticonvulsant properties, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) immunoreactive beta-endorphin levels in children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) during chemotherapy and cranial irradiation have been studied. Twenty-seven children, 2 at low, 20 at medium and 5 with high risk ALL, undergoing prophylactic treatment for meningeal leukemia, entered the study. Sequential lumbar punctures with introduction of MTX combined with oral prednisone therapy were performed; each lumbar puncture sample was collected and assayed for immunoreactive beta-endorphin. All the patients studied showed a biphasic profile of the peptide with the minimum levels reached during the induction (days 14-28) and the maximum levels detected at the end of the intensification chemotherapy (days 49-55). In the 3 groups the beta-endorphin decrease corresponded to the period of prednisone therapy; the increase was concomitant with the suspension of oral glucocorticoids. 3 patients showed tonic-clonic seizures which coincided with the lowest cerebrospinal fluid beta-endorphin levels and, in the follow-up, 13 out of 27 patients displayed EEG abnormalities. From these findings a relationship between cerebrospinal fluid beta-endorphin concentrations and neuronal excitability in patients with ALL can be suggested. It is also evidenced that oral glucocorticoid therapy has profound inhibitory effects on central beta-endorphin levels.","['Iannetti, P', 'Fabbri, A', 'Meloni, G', 'Moleti, M L', 'Ulisse, S', 'Mandelli, F', 'Isidori, A', 'Imperato, C']","['Iannetti P', 'Fabbri A', 'Meloni G', 'Moleti ML', 'Ulisse S', 'Mandelli F', 'Isidori A', 'Imperato C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,J Endocrinol Invest,Journal of endocrinological investigation,7806594,"['60617-12-1 (beta-Endorphin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Nervous System Diseases/*cerebrospinal fluid/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*cerebrospinal fluid/complications/drug therapy', 'Prednisone/*therapeutic use', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'beta-Endorphin/*cerebrospinal fluid']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Endocrinol Invest. 1989 Oct;12(9):623-9. doi: 10.1007/BF03350022.,"['Istituto di Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Roma, La Sapienza, Italy.']",,,['10.1007/BF03350022 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

By chemical mutagenesis, we produced somatic cell variants of the human T-leukemia cell line, HPB-ALL, which expressed low amounts of TCR.CD3 complexes on their surface. RNA and protein analyses demonstrated that most variants synthesized normal amounts of the individual members of the complex, i.e. TCR-alpha, TCR-beta, CD3-gamma, -delta, -epsilon, and -zeta. In these variants, less than 10% of the TCR.CD3 complexes inside the cell contained the CD3-zeta 2 homodimer due to an intrinsic deficiency in the formation of the TCR-alpha/beta heterodimer. The low level of assembly of CD3-zeta 2 into the TCR.CD3 complex and an additional decrease in the rate of export of the TCR.CD3 complex from the endoplasmic reticulum explained the low level of expression of alpha/beta receptors on the surface of these mutants. Only cells with the complete set of subunits of the TCR.CD3 complex on their surface were capable of transducing CD3-mediated signals. The results presented in this paper indicate that TCR-alpha/beta heterodimer formation is an obligatory requirement for assemblage of CD3-zeta 2 into a functionally competent TCR.CD3 complex.","['Sancho, J', 'Chatila, T', 'Wong, R C', 'Hall, C', 'Blumberg, R', 'Alarcon, B', 'Geha, R S', 'Terhorst, C']","['Sancho J', 'Chatila T', 'Wong RC', 'Hall C', 'Blumberg R', 'Alarcon B', 'Geha RS', 'Terhorst C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/genetics/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Blotting, Northern', 'CD3 Complex', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1989/12/05 00:00,1989/12/05 00:01,['1989/12/05 00:00'],"['1989/12/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/05 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Dec 5;264(34):20760-9.,"['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']","['1 K08 DK01886-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-07593/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-15066/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,['S0021-9258(19)47128-7 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Normal colonic epithelial cells were cultured and the kinetics of expression of the three antigens was studied. A significant increase in the expression of the three markers was observed throughout the culture period in response to the lectin phytohemagglutinin and the epidermal growth factor. The kinetics of expression of the 4F2 antigen and the CALLA after lectin stimulation appeared to differ from that observed after epidermal growth factor. At the end of the cultures one-third of the cells expressed the 4F2 antigen and the transferrin receptor, whereas one-fifth were positive for CALLA. Thus, after these cultures the expression of the three markers was quantitatively similar to that observed with freshly isolated cells from inflamed mucosa. gamma-Interferon markedly induced the 4F2 antigen but had no effect on the transferrin receptor and the CALLA.

Cross-linking of receptor molecules was necessary for this effect since F(ab')2, but not Fab', fragments of LC4 could induce cell death. Five anti-CD3 mAb tested also caused apoptosis, but only when they were presented on a solid phase. Interestingly, soluble anti-CD3 mAb induced calcium flux and had an additive effect on the calcium flux and interleukin 2 receptor expression induced by LC4, but these anti-CD3 mAb reversed the growth inhibition and apoptosis caused by LC4. The calcium ionophore A23187, but not the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), also induced apoptosis, suggesting that protein kinase C activation alone does not cause apoptosis, although PMA is growth inhibitory. These results suggest that two distinct biological phenomena can accompany stimulation of the TcR/CD3 complex. In both cases, calcium flux and interleukin 2 receptor expression is induced, but only in one case is apoptosis and cell death seen. The signal initiating apoptosis can be selectively prevented by binding CD3 portion of the receptor in this cell line. This difference in signals mediated by the TcR/CD3 complex may be important in explaining the process of thymic selection, as well as in choosing anti-TcR mAb for therapeutic use.","['Takahashi, S', 'Maecker, H T', 'Levy, R']","['Takahashi S', 'Maecker HT', 'Levy R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*physiology', 'CD3 Complex', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA/*analysis', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1989 Oct;19(10):1911-9. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830191023.,"['Department of Medicine/Oncology, Stanford University Medical Center.']",['CA 34322/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['10.1002/eji.1830191023 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Fc epsilon RII were isolated by affinity chromatography using IgE-Sepharose or by anti-Fc epsilon RII antisera and protein A-Sepharose. The surface-exposed, IgE-binding alpha subunits of Fc epsilon RI [Fc epsilon RI alpha] were isolated by affinity chromatography using IgE and anti-IgE-Sepharose. Fc epsilon RI alpha on IMMC had an apparent molecular mass of 59 kDa, somewhat larger than that of PMC (51 kDa), RBL-2H3 cells (51 kDa) or RBL-CA10.7 cells (46 kDa). Brief (45 s) incubation of IMMC or PMC in glycine-HCl, pH 3, prior to iodination removed much of the surface-bound IgE. This permitted more thorough labeling of the receptors, but had no affect on the estimate of receptor size. Surprisingly and in contrast to acid-treated PMC, upon anti-IgE-Sepharose isolation acid-treated IMMC yielded an intensely radioactive Fc epsilon RI alpha band in the absence of added IgE. Such a finding suggests that IMMC, more so than PMC, may have an intracellular store of IgE, as has been suggested by many others. IMMC also differed from PMC in the number of forms of Fc epsilon RII isolated; 50-kDa and 58-kDa forms of Fc epsilon RII were obtained from IMMC, whereas PMC yielded most often a single 56-kDa Fc epsilon RII band. These results were mimicked by the two RBL cell sublines: RBL-2H3 cells yielded two Fc epsilon RII (46 kDa and 55 kDa), but only one form of Fc epsilon RII (54-kDa) was obtained from RBL-CA10.7 cells. Thus, the two subtypes of rat mast cells, which have previously been shown to differ in mediator profile and responsiveness to secretagogues and antiallergic drugs, are also distinguished by differences in IgER profile.","['Swieter, M', 'Chan, B M', 'Rimmer, C', 'McNeill, K', 'Froese, A', 'Befus, D']","['Swieter M', 'Chan BM', 'Rimmer C', 'McNeill K', 'Froese A', 'Befus D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*isolation & purification', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*analysis/cytology', 'Mast Cells/*analysis', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peritoneal Cavity/cytology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*isolation & purification', 'Receptors, IgG']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1989 Oct;19(10):1879-85. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830191019.,"['Department of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.']",,,['10.1002/eji.1830191019 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluorescence microscopy confirmed that the down-regulation is due to internalization of receptors. The endocytotic response to PMA shares several characteristics with endocytosis induced by immunochemical aggregation of surface-bound monomeric IgE: the rates of internalization both have a t1/2 of about 5 min, a maximum of 35% of the surface-bound IgE can be endocytosed by the action of PMA (50% by receptor aggregation), endocytosis is sustained for at least up to 60 min, neither stimulus requires extracellular Ca2+ and endocytosis induced by either stimulus is an active process, i.e., is dependent on temperature and cellular energy. Biochemical studies revealed some differences between the endocytotic responses to the two stimuli. After prolonged treatment of cells with dexamethasone, only endocytosis induced by PMA is inhibited. Cells depleted of protein kinase C by prolonged exposure to PMA can sustain a significant endocytotic response to aggregation of IgE receptors, but become completely desensitized to PMA. These data suggest that different biochemical pathways mediate the signals from the two stimuli and that protein kinase C is directly involved in endocytosis induced by PMA but does not have a major role in endocytosis induced by receptor aggregation.","['Ra, C', 'Furuichi, K', 'Rivera, J', 'Mullins, J M', 'Isersky, C', 'White, K N']","['Ra C', 'Furuichi K', 'Rivera J', 'Mullins JM', 'Isersky C', 'White KN']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '22144-77-0 (Cytochalasin D)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '86390-77-4 (1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'Cytochalasin D/pharmacology', 'Diglycerides/pharmacology', 'Endocytosis/*drug effects', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*immunology', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1989 Oct;19(10):1771-7. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830191002.,"['Section of Chemical Immunology Arthritis and Rheumatism Branch, National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",,,['10.1002/eji.1830191002 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to ADR, CMA, and 5-imino-3'-(3-cyano-4-morpholinyl)-3'-deaminoadriamycin (ICMA) have been shown to possess alkylating activity, as seen by their ability to produce DNA-DNA cross-links in human and murine tumor cells and in isolated lambda-phage DNA. We have compared the pharmacological activities of CMA, ICMA, and the alkylating agent, chlorambucil (CHL), in order to determine the roles of intercalation, the quinone ring, and DNA base composition, in cross-linking by CMA. CMA was 27-and 1000-fold more active than ICMA and CHL, respectively, in cross-linking DNA in L5178Y cells. In addition, the maximum level of cross-linking in L5178Y cells was reached more rapidly with CMA than with CHL, and the CMA cross-links were removed faster and more efficiently by these cells. CMA was 26- and 450-fold more active than ICMA and CHL, respectively, in producing DNA cross-links in isolated lambda-phage DNA. In contrast, the alkylating activity of CMA was only 6-fold greater than CHL, as measured by the ability of the drugs to bind to the nucleophile, p-nitrobenzyl pyridine. CMA was a better DNA intercalator than ICMA, whereas CHL did not intercalate. In addition, the intercalating agent, ethidium bromide, inhibited the cross-linking activity of CMA, but not that of CHL, suggesting that intercalation contributed to the cross-linking activity of CMA. CMA produced an increasing level of cross-linking, but showed no difference in intercalation, with isolated DNA of increasing G-C content, suggesting a preference for alkylating G-C bases. Both the cross-linking and intercalating, but not the alkylating, activities of CMA and ICMA were decreased by the reducing agent, sodium borohydride, providing additional evidence that the intercalative interaction of the ADR analogues with DNA contributes to their DNA cross-linking activity. Thus, alterations to the quinone group may effect the intercalating activity of these analogues and may contribute to the difference in cross-linking activity between CMA and ICMA.","['Jesson, M I', 'Johnston, J B', 'Robotham, E', 'Begleiter, A']","['Jesson MI', 'Johnston JB', 'Robotham E', 'Begleiter A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', ""88254-07-3 (3'-deamino-3'-(3-cyano-4-morpholinyl)doxorubicin)""]",IM,"['Alkylation', 'Animals', '*Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Bacteriophage lambda/metabolism', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Intercalating Agents', 'Leukemia L5178/pathology', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/12/15 00:00,1989/12/15 00:01,['1989/12/15 00:00'],"['1989/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Dec 15;49(24 Pt 1):7031-6.,"['Department of Pharmacology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report on further studies which indicate that the c-mos protein (a 41 to 43 kDa protein termed p43c-mos) is expressed in somatic tissues of mice and in cells grown in culture. In testes of mice, germ cell fractions have increased levels of p43c-mos relative to other cells of the testes. However, non-germ cells harbor significant levels of p43c-mos, as judged by comparison of testes from normal mice to those with mutations that affect the germ cell content of the testes. Thus, homozygous S1, at, and the W/Wv mutant mice are sterile due to severe deficiencies of germ cells. Such mice had only an estimated 50%-60% reduction in p43c-mos as judged by western immunoblotting using two different site-directed anti-mos antibodies. Similarly, X/X-sex reversed mice in which germ cells die after 10 days of age had only an 85% reduction of p43c-mos in mice 35 days of age. Thus, the germ cell content of testes did not correlated with p43c-mos levels in this tissue. Direct analyses of non-germ cells derived from mouse testes confirmed these findings, since Sertoli and Leydig cell lines grown in culture expressed p43c-mos. In addition, tissues such as kidney, liver, spleen and brain were found to contain p43c-mos. Surprisingly, mouse NIH3T3 cells were found to express significant levels of the c-mos protein based upon immunoblotting and one-dimensional peptide mapping experiments performed with both anti-mos antibodies. The concentration of the c-mos protein was not affected by expression of viral mos proteins. We conclude that the c-mos protein is enriched in male germ cells, but p43c-mos is also expressed in significant amounts in somatic tissues and in fibroblastic cells grown in culture.","['Herzog, N K', 'Ramagli, L S', 'Khorana, S', 'Arlinghaus, R B']","['Herzog NK', 'Ramagli LS', 'Khorana S', 'Arlinghaus RB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mos)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disorders of Sex Development', '*Gene Expression', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mos', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Sexual Maturation', 'Spermatogenesis', 'Testis/*enzymology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1989 Nov;4(11):1307-15.,"['Department of Molecular Pathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']","['CA08570/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45125/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['Oncogene 1990 Apr;5(4):623'],,,,,,,,,,,

It is currently undergoing i.v. and p.o. Phase II clinical evaluation. We report here the results of pharmacokinetic and systemic bioavailability studies of menogaril in three species (mouse, dog, and monkey). Upon i.v. administration, menogaril plasma concentration-time curves declined in a biexponential (dog) or triexponential (mouse and monkey) manner, with the terminal disposition half-life (t1/2) being considerably shorter in the dog (2.86 +/- 0.47 h) than in the mouse and monkey (21.6 and 19.0 +/- 3.7 h, respectively). The systemic clearance (CL, in liters/h/kg) was highest in mouse (6.2), followed by dog (2.9) and then monkey (1.4). The drug was extensively distributed in all three species, with steady state volumes of distribution being 88.5, 9.8, and 27.9 liters/kg in the mouse, dog, and monkey, respectively. One, two, and three metabolites were detected in the plasma of mice, monkeys, and dogs, respectively, using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The major fluorescent metabolite in all species coeluted with authentic N-demethyl-menogaril; the other two metabolites were present at low concentrations relative to unchanged menogaril and its putative N-demethylated metabolite. One of these metabolites, which was found in both the dog and monkey, eluted with authentic (7R)-nogarol. Mean maximum plasma concentrations of the putative N-demethylmenogaril metabolite were approximately one-tenth those of menogaril in all three species following i.v. drug administration. Upon p.o. treatment, first-pass metabolism or incomplete absorption reduced the systemic bioavailability to 12% in the dog and 33% in the mouse and monkey. N-Demethylmenogaril was the major fluorescent metabolite observed in the plasma of p.o. treated animals. Interspecies comparison of menogaril pharmacokinetic parameters in mice, dogs, monkeys, and humans using allometric techniques indicated that the parameters for mice, monkeys, and humans were highly correlated; in each of these species presystemic metabolism of p.o. administered menogaril reduced its systemic bioavailability to an equivalent extent (30-35%). To determine if metabolically formed N-demethylmenogaril might contribute to the overall antitumor activity of menogaril, we determined the effect of synthetic N-demethylmenogaril on the life span of mice bearing P388 leukemia.

The suggestion that the CD23 molecule (Fc epsilon II receptor) might be involved in the signalling pathway of LMW-BCGF prompted us to study the expression of this molecule on hairy cells and its modulation by IFN-alpha. By flow cytometry and direct binding experiments with anti CD23 monoclonal antibodies, the presence of the CD23 antigen was detected in 7 of 12 cases tested, on variable percentages of cells, ranging from low to medium expression. In vitro incubation of hairy cells with IFN-alpha, which elicits a suppression of the proliferative response of these cells to LMW-BCGF, induced a parallel significant reduction of CD23 expression in only three cases. Similarly, a transient in vivo decrease of CD23 expression, concommitant with an inhibition of the LMW-BCGF response, could be detected in only one of three patients injected with IFN-alpha. Soluble sCD23/IgE-binding factor (BF) was quantitated in the serum from six other patients with hyperleukocytic hairy cell leukemia (HCL) undergoing a clinical trial of IFN-alpha therapy. Before treatment, these patients presented higher concentrations of the cleaved soluble form of the CD23 molecule than normal controls. Within a few weeks of IFN-alpha administration, these levels markedly decreased, paralleling a diminution of blood leukemic cells. Of interest, no such diminution was noticed for another patient resistant to IFN-alpha therapy. These results show that the proliferative response of hairy cells to LMW-BCGF is not linked to the expression of the CD23 marker. Besides, when the latter molecule was present, its decrease following IFN-alpha treatment, which could be detected in some cases, was not necessarily required for the suppression of the LMW-BCGF response and is thus not mandatory for the therapeutic efficacy of IFN-alpha. Our results point out that quantitation of serum sCD23/IgE-BF, whether related to a process of autocrine proliferation or not, is a parameter of potential importance for therapy monitoring.","['Genot, E', 'Sarfati, M', 'Sigaux, F', 'Petit-Koskas, E', 'Billard, C', 'Mathiot, C', 'Falcoff, E', 'Delespesse, G', 'Kolb, J P']","['Genot E', 'Sarfati M', 'Sigaux F', 'Petit-Koskas E', 'Billard C', 'Mathiot C', 'Falcoff E', 'Delespesse G', 'Kolb JP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*metabolism/physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptors, Fc/*metabolism/physiology', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Solubility']",1989/11/15 00:00,1989/11/15 00:01,['1989/11/15 00:00'],"['1989/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1989 Nov 15;74(7):2455-63.,"['U.196 INSERM Recherche sur les interferons, Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",,,['S0006-4971(20)82854-7 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We showed that, as in gamma delta+ cell lines, extensive junctional diversity exists in these clones and that this diversity is due both to random nucleotide deletions/additions and to the use of at least two D delta segments. We also showed that a high percentage of these rearrangements are potentially translatable (7:13) and that such functional rearrangements occur in both surface CD3+ and CD3- cells. Comparison of alpha beta versus gamma delta surface expression demonstrates that all CD3+ T acute lymphoblastic leukemias with a functional V delta 1-J delta 1 rearrangement express a surface gamma delta receptor and are recognized by the anti-delta monoclonal antibody delta TCS1, whereas a control CD3+ gamma delta+ leukemic case that had not undergone V delta 1 rearrangement was delta TCS1-.

Here we describe a third mutant, J.CaM3, which also expresses high levels of receptors that are functionally impaired. Like J.CaM1, J.CaM3 demonstrates partial signal transduction via CD3/Ti to only certain stimuli. J.CaM1, J.CaM2, and J.CaM3 define three non-Ti complementation groups involved in receptor function. To evaluate the mutations further we have introduced a heterologous receptor, the human muscarinic receptor 1 (HM1), into the parental Jurkat and mutant cell lines. This receptor demonstrates signal transduction competence in all these hosts, indicating that 1) T cells express the necessary apparatus for the coupling of HM1 to second messenger generation and 2) the mutations in the J.CaM family all affect molecules that are specific to CD3/Ti, and not HM1, function. Finally, the HM1 receptor exhibits partial sensitivity to cholera toxin in Jurkat cells, in contrast to the virtually complete sensitivity of CD3/Ti to cholera toxin.","['Goldsmith, M A', 'Desai, D M', 'Schultz, T', 'Weiss, A']","['Goldsmith MA', 'Desai DM', 'Schultz T', 'Weiss A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Muscarinic)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/genetics/physiology', 'CD3 Complex', 'Cholera Toxin/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', '*Mutation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/physiology', 'Receptors, Muscarinic/genetics/*physiology', 'Second Messenger Systems/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/10/15 00:00,1989/10/15 00:01,['1989/10/15 00:00'],"['1989/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Oct 15;264(29):17190-7.,"['Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco.']",['R01 GM39553-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,['S0021-9258(18)71477-4 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Experimental and network thermodynamic analyses of the role of dihydrofolate polyglutamylates in antifolate action in cells.,17016-23,"Folate analogs that inhibit dihydrofolate reductase result in only partial interconversion of tetrahydrofolate cofactors to dihydrofolate with preservation of the major portion of reduced cellular folate cofactors in L1210 leukemia cells. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that low levels of dihydrofolate polyglutamates that accumulate in the presence of antifolates block thymidylate synthase to prevent depletion of reduced folate pools. This paper correlates biochemical analyses of rapid interconversions of radiolabeled folates and changes in purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis in L1210 murine leukemia cells exposed to antifolates with network thermodynamic computer modeling to assess this hypothesis. When cells are exposed to 1 microM trimetrexate there is an almost instantaneous inhibition of [3H] deoxyuridine or [14C]formate incorporation into nucleotides which is maximal within 5 min. This is associated with a rapid rise in cellular dihydrofolate (t1/2 approximately 1.5 min), which reaches a steady state that represents only 27.9% of the total folate pool. Pretreatment of cells with fluorodeoxyuridine, to inhibit thymidylate synthase by about 95% followed by trimetrexate only slows the rate of folate interconversion (t1/2 approximately 25 min) but not the final dihydrofolate level achieved. This is consistent with computer simulations which predict that direct inhibition of thymidylate synthase by 97, 98, and 99% should increase the half-time of dihydrofolate rise after trimetrexate to 40, 60, and 124 min, respectively, but the final level achieved is always the same as in cells with normal thymidylate synthase activity. The data reflect the high degree of catalytic activity of thymidylate synthase relative to tetrahydrofolate cofactor pools in the cells and the enormous extent of inhibition of this enzyme that is necessary to slow the rate of folate interconversions after addition of antifolates. The model predicts, and the data demonstrate, that virtually any residual thymidylate synthase activity will permit the interconversion of all tetrahydrofolate cofactors available for oxidation to dihydrofolate when dihydrofolate reductase activity is abolished, but the rate of interconversion will be slowed. Additional simulations indicate that the time course of cessation of tetrahydrofolate-dependent purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis after antifolates in these cells can be accounted for solely on the basis of tetrahydrofolate cofactor depletion alone. These data exclude the possibility that direct inhibition of thymidylate synthase by dihydrofolate polyglutamates, or any other intracellular folates that accumulate in cells after antifolates, can account for the rapid but partial interconversion of reduced folate cofactors to dihydrofolate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Seither, R L', 'Trent, D F', 'Mikulecky, D C', 'Rape, T J', 'Goldman, I D']","['Seither RL', 'Trent DF', 'Mikulecky DC', 'Rape TJ', 'Goldman ID']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Formates)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', '0YIW783RG1 (formic acid)', '4033-27-6 (dihydrofolate)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)', 'W78I7AY22C (Deoxyuridine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Computer Simulation', 'Deoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Floxuridine/pharmacology', 'Folic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Formates/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Purines/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/metabolism', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'Tetrahydrofolates/metabolism', 'Thermodynamics', 'Thymidylate Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Trimetrexate']",1989/10/15 00:00,1989/10/15 00:01,['1989/10/15 00:00'],"['1989/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Oct 15;264(29):17016-23.,"['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298.']","['CA-09340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['S0021-9258(18)71452-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Cross-linking of human recombinant 125I-IL4 to peripheral blood mononuclear cells identifies a trimolecular complex consisting of a 65/70-kDa doublet and a 110-kDa protein. Scatchard analysis reveals about 300 IL4 binding sites/cell on resting cells with an equilibrium binding constant (Kd) of approximately 100 pM. Stimulation by anti-CD3 antibodies causes an up-regulation of IL4 receptors by a factor of 2 to 3 without any change in binding affinity. In addition to this high-affinity binding site a second class of a previously unidentified, low-affinity receptor (Kd approximately 30 nM, approximately 9000 sites/cell) is expressed on resting lymphocytes. The number of low-affinity binding sites for IL 4 also increases twofold upon cell activation. Exogenous IL 4 enhances the expression of its receptor on resting lymphocytes and this effect is further increased by anti-CD3 activation. Binding of IL4 to its receptor is specific, being only inhibited by IL 4 and not by IL2. By contrast, the gibbon leukemia cell line MLA 144 expresses only high-affinity receptors for IL4. Cross-linking studies reveal a 45/50-kDa IL 4 receptor-associated doublet in addition to the three proteins identified in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

The cytotoxic effect in vitro was detected using a colorimetric assay with a tetrazolium salt, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. Dose-effect relationships of drugs alone and in combination were analyzed by the median effect principle and by the combination indices for quantitation of synergy or antagonism with the aid of a computer program. Trimetrexate alone was cytotoxic against the parent and all the resistant cell lines with the drug concentrations required to decrease the cell count to 50% of control in the nanomolar range (1.4, 1.6, 1.5, and 0.7 nM in CCRF-CEM, CCRF-CEM/E, CCRF-CEM/P, and CCRF-CEM/T, respectively) following 5 days of exposure.

Herein, we characterize the organization of the human CALLA/NEP gene and show that it spans more than 80 kilobases (kb) and is composed of 24 exons. Exons 1 and 2 encode 5' untranslated sequences; exon 3 [170 base pairs (bp)] encodes the initiation codon and transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain; 20 short exons (exons 4-23), ranging in size from 36 to 162 bp, encode most of the extracellular portion of the enzyme; and exon 24 (approximately 3400 bp) encodes the COOH-terminal 32 amino acids of the protein and contains the entire 3' untranslated region (UTR). Of note, the pentapeptide sequence (His-Glu-Ile-Thr-His) associated with metalloprotease zinc binding and substrate catalysis is encoded within a single exon (exon 19). Three types of CALLA/NEP cDNAs have been identified: these clones contain 5' UTR sequences differing from one another upstream of exon 3. These human 5' sequences are homologous to those found in rat brain and rabbit kidney NEP cDNAs. The three human CALLA cDNA types result from alternative splicing of exons 1, 2a, or 2b to the common exon 3. Moreover, exons 2a and 2b share the same 5' sequence but differ from each other by the use of two distinct donor splice sites 171 bp apart in the gene. The substantial conservation of 5' untranslated sequences among species and the existence of 5' alternative splicing suggest that CALLA gene expression may be differentially controlled in a tissue-specific and/or developmentally regulated fashion.","[""D'Adamio, L"", 'Shipp, M A', 'Masteller, E L', 'Reinherz, E L']","[""D'Adamio L"", 'Shipp MA', 'Masteller EL', 'Reinherz EL']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*genetics', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', '*Exons', 'Gene Amplification', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neprilysin/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*genetics/immunology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Sep;86(18):7103-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.86.18.7103.,"['Laboratory of Immunobiology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.']",,PMC298003,['10.1073/pnas.86.18.7103 [doi]'],,"['GENBANK/M26605', 'GENBANK/M26606', 'GENBANK/M26607', 'GENBANK/M26608', 'GENBANK/M26609', 'GENBANK/M26610', 'GENBANK/M26611', 'GENBANK/M26612', 'GENBANK/M26613', 'GENBANK/M26614', 'GENBANK/M26615', 'GENBANK/M26616', 'GENBANK/M26617', 'GENBANK/M26618', 'GENBANK/M26619', 'GENBANK/M26620', 'GENBANK/M26621', 'GENBANK/M26622', 'GENBANK/M26623', 'GENBANK/M26624', 'GENBANK/M26625', 'GENBANK/M26626', 'GENBANK/M26627', 'GENBANK/M26628']",,,,,,,,,,

Radioligand binding assays were performed using [125I]PTA-OH, a TXA2/PGH2 receptor antagonist. Scatchard analysis revealed one class of binding sites for 1-PTA-OH with a Kd = 122 +/- 18 nM and maximum binding = 1.7 +/- 0.3 x 10(5) sites/cell. Competition for [125I]PTA-OH binding with the TXA2/PGH2 receptor agonists SQ26655 and U46619 revealed one class of binding sites for SQ26655 with a Kd = 17 nM and two classes of binding sites for for U46619 with a Kd = 45 nM for the high-affinity site and a Kd = 450 nM for the low-affinity site.

The development of these two different diseases among HTLV-I-infected individuals may depend in part on differences in their T cell immunity associated with a difference of HLA phenotype. Peptides corresponding to 17 sites in the HTLV-I envelope protein were tested for their antigenicity for lymph node cells from B10.BR, B10.D2, B10.A(5R), and B10.HTT congenic mice, representing four independent MHC haplotypes, immunized with the native envelope protein. Ten of the 17 tested sites were predicted to be amphipathic alpha-helical sites and all of them were found to be antigenic for at least one of the four MHC congenic strains of mice. Three of the 17 sites were amphipathic 3(10)-helical sites and four sites were predicted to be non-helical sites: none of the 3(10)-helical sites were antigenic and only one of four non-predicted sites was found to be immunodominant. Furthermore, three potent immunodominant peptides, V1E1 (342-363), V1E8/SP4a (191-209), and V1E10 (141-156) were also shown to be immunogenic; i.e., these peptides could be used to immunize mice to elicit proliferative responses of lymph node cells to the native HTLV-I envelope protein. Furthermore, these three peptides were able to prime animals for an enhanced antibody response to the native protein. Because this priming followed the same Ir gene control as the proliferative response, it probably reflects the ability of these peptides to prime helper T cells. The localization of immunodominant sites in HTLV-I envelope protein in mice may be useful for finding antigenic and immunogenic sites in humans, for developing a peptide vaccine for the virus, and possibly for aiding in prognosis for the development of different disease manifestations of HTLV-I infection.","['Kurata, A', 'Palker, T J', 'Streilein, R D', 'Scearce, R M', 'Haynes, B F', 'Berzofsky, J A']","['Kurata A', 'Palker TJ', 'Streilein RD', 'Scearce RM', 'Haynes BF', 'Berzofsky JA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis', 'HTLV-I Antigens/administration & dosage/*analysis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Peptides/immunology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Retroviridae Proteins/administration & dosage/*analysis/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/administration & dosage/*analysis/immunology']",1989/09/15 00:00,1989/09/15 00:01,['1989/09/15 00:00'],"['1989/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Sep 15;143(6):2024-30.,"['Molecular Immunogenetics and Vaccine Research Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['CA 40660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gel retardation analyses revealed that nuclear extracts from cells of various human cancer cell lines [colon cancer (LS-174T), gastric cancer (TMK-1), and leukemia (K-562)] and rodent pheochromocytoma (PC12) show a concentration-dependent increase in binding activity to a synthetic DNA that contained the cAMP-responsive element 5'-TGACGTCA-3' after treatment with 8-Cl-cAMP. Such an increase in cAMP-responsive element binding activity was not observed in the 8-C1-cAMP-unresponsive MKN-1 gastric cancer cells.

It has recently been claimed that photodynamic therapy mediated by hematoporphyrin derivative (HPD) is selectively more efficient for killing leukemic cells than normal progenitors. To improve this effect, we studied the influence of hematoporphyrin dose, temperature during incubation and/or treatment, hematoporphyrin derivative incubation time, and fractionation of the argon laser light (488-514 nm) used for hematoporphyrin stimulation. Plating efficiency calculated after a 7-day period of growth on collagen gel medium showed a dose-dependent phototoxicity of HPD reaching 0.01% for normal hemopoietic progenitors and 0.001% for leukemic cells (dose = 12.5 micrograms/ml). The 10:1 ratio of normal hemopoietic progenitors to leukemic cells was also found to be the same or increased when temperature was 37 degrees C during incubation and 4 degrees C during laser irradiation. Similar results were also found when incubation time was varied from 75-120 min, or when laser irradiation dose was fractionated into 2 or 3 periods. The ratio of normal progenitors to leukemic cells reached 100:1 when 75 J/cm2 were fractionated into 3 periods after an incubation time of 120 min with 10 micrograms/ml HPD. Selectivity in photodynamic treatment seems to occur between normal hemopoietic progenitors and leukemic cells. The mechanism of this selectivity remains unclear, but experiments with the fractionated irradiation dose suggest that as in radiotherapy, better potentially lethal damage repair in normal cells could be a factor for selectivity in photodynamic therapy. Our results obtained with leukemic cells are fully in agreement with data in the literature concerning similar experimental models.","['Foultier, M T', 'Patrice, T', 'Praloran, V', 'Robillard, N', 'Le Bodic, L']","['Foultier MT', 'Patrice T', 'Praloran V', 'Robillard N', 'Le Bodic L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Biochimie,Biochimie,1264604,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hematoporphyrins)', '68335-15-9 (Hematoporphyrin Derivative)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Hematoporphyrin Derivative', '*Hematoporphyrin Photoradiation', 'Hematoporphyrins/*pharmacology', 'Lasers', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochimie. 1989 Jul;71(7):819-25. doi: 10.1016/0300-9084(89)90045-x.,"['Departement Laser, Hopital Laennec, Nantes, France.']",,,"['0300-9084(89)90045-X [pii]', '10.1016/0300-9084(89)90045-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

These findings demonstrate that the determination of MLV in addition to morphology may be a useful tool to distinguish the two previously described morphological B-CLL variants (typical and atypical) and that these two different B-CLL groups are also distinguishable on the basis of three enzyme activities, PK, PNP and LDH which have been shown to be less dependent on cell size than the other enzymes, also studied here.","['Vives Corrons, J L', 'Colomer, D', 'Pujades, A', 'Matutes, E', 'Pastor, C', 'Aymerich, M']","['Vives Corrons JL', 'Colomer D', 'Pujades A', 'Matutes E', 'Pastor C', 'Aymerich M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Phosphofructokinase-1)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase/blood', 'B-Lymphocytes/enzymology/*pathology', 'Glycolysis', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/pathology', 'Phosphofructokinase-1/blood', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/blood']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1989;82(1):22-6. doi: 10.1159/000205273.,"[""Servei d'Hematologia Biologica, Hospital Clinic i Provincial, Barcelona, Spain.""]",,,['10.1159/000205273 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

T lymphocyte clones are obtained by limiting dilution of lymphocytes from the blood of patients with an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The T cell clones are first selected for their CD8- CD4-phenotype and then for their ability to react with the monoclonal antibody anti-CD3 without presenting reactivity with a monoclonal antibody directed against the TCR alpha beta. Further biochemical studies have indicated that the CD3 associated structure expressed on the cell membrane of these T cell clones is a gamma delta heterodimer. Functional analysis have indicated that these cloned cells are able to kill in a classical cell mediated lysis assay the autologous leukemic cells only when also LAK activity is observed.

Formation of these receptors is largely separated by the preferential pairing of alpha-TCR with beta and gamma-TCR with delta, the sequential rearrangement and expression of the TCR loci during thymic development and the deletion of the delta-loci either prior to or concomitant with alpha-rearrangement in alpha beta TCR cells. Here we show that delta-TCR can substitute for alpha in pairing with beta to form a beta delta heterodimer. This receptor is expressed on the cell surface of the T-leukaemia cell line DND41 as analysed with beta- and delta-specific monoclonal antibodies. We suggest that a variety of factors including, for example, the deletion of the delta-TCR loci, can now be understood as exclusion mechanisms operating to prevent not only the formation of gamma delta receptors, but also of beta delta T-cell receptors, thereby promoting the numerically dominant alpha beta TCR lineage. Nevertheless, some developing T-cells that do not rearrange the alpha-loci may express the beta delta TCR as described here.","['Hochstenbach, F', 'Brenner, M B']","['Hochstenbach F', 'Brenner MB']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta']",1989/08/17 00:00,1989/08/17 00:01,['1989/08/17 00:00'],"['1989/08/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/17 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/17 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 1989 Aug 17;340(6234):562-5. doi: 10.1038/340562a0.,"['Laboratory of Immunochemistry, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.']",,,['10.1038/340562a0 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

These 125I-labeled protein segments disappeared after treating inverted vesicles with trypsin, and labeled components also disappeared when chloramine T mediated 125I-iodination was used to label receptors after inverted vesicles had been trypsin digested and solubilized. Biosynthetic labeling of receptors with 35S-methionine showed that a 17-19 kDa labeled fragment, designated beta', remains associated with alpha after trypsin digestion of inverted vesicles.

Indeed, a majority of blasts from three patients expressed several erythroid markers such as carbonic anhydrase 1, spectrin beta chain, and glycophorin A. In addition, band 3 and hemoglobin were immunologically detected in a fraction of the blast cells from two cases. At ultrastructural level, a majority or all blast cells exhibited erythroid differentiation features such as theta granules and ferritin molecules. However, platelet glycoproteins GP Ib, GP IIb, and GP IIIa were also immunologically detected in a fraction (from 14-82%) of the blasts. Since the ultrastructural study indicated that some promegakaryoblasts were also present in three patients, double labeling between erythroid markers (glycophorin A or carbonic anhydrase I) and platelet glycoprotein (Ib or IIIa) was performed and showed a clear overlap between the two kinds of markers. A similar approach was performed at ultrastructural level and indicated that blast cells with ultrastructural erythroid features of differentiation may have three distinct phenotypes, i.e., presence of glycophorin A without platelet glycoproteins or, conversely, the presence of platelet glycoproteins without glycophorin A and coexpression of glycophorin A and platelet glycoproteins. Expression of glycophorin A correlated directly with the differentiation level of the erythroid blasts, whereas platelet glycoproteins were essentially expressed in the more primitive leukemic erythroid cells. The GP Ib synthesized by these blasts was subsequently studied. The GP Ib alpha mRNA analyzed by Northern blot from these erythroid cells was identical in size with that from megakaryocytic cells as was the molecular weight of the GP Ib molecule from both after immunoprecipitation by a monoclonal antibody. Therefore, ""in vivo"" erythroid leukemic cells may express the main platelet glycoproteins including GP Ib.","['Debili, N', 'Kieffer, N', 'Mitjavila, M T', 'Villeval, J L', 'Guichard, J', 'Teillet, F', 'Henri, A', 'Clemetson, K J', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Breton-Gorius, J']","['Debili N', 'Kieffer N', 'Mitjavila MT', 'Villeval JL', 'Guichard J', 'Teillet F', 'Henri A', 'Clemetson KJ', 'Vainchenker W', 'Breton-Gorius J']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/genetics/metabolism', 'Erythroblasts/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/complications/genetics/*metabolism', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/immunology/*metabolism']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Sep;3(9):669-78.,"['INSERM U 91, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The established line grows in a single-cell suspension with a doubling time of 19 hours and expresses L3 morphologic features by the French-American-British classification. Immunologic study revealed that WSU-BL cells express IgM-lambda both in the cytoplasm and on the surface and react with monoclonal antibodies to B-cell antigens (B1, B4, BL3, BL4, HLA-DR, and common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen [CALLA]). These cells are negative for T-cell and myeloid/monocyte antigens as well as Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA). These results suggest that WSU-BL corresponds to an intermediate stage of B-cell differentiation. Both fresh tumor and WSU-BL cells had a hyperdiploid karyotype carrying the 8;14 chromosome translocation. Molecular studies showed that WSU-BL has a rearrangement of c-myc proto-oncogene and expresses c-myc RNA. Phorbol ester 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) were able to induce several phenotypic changes on WSU-BL cells. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of total cellular protein showed that either TPA or IFN-gamma induced both the synthesis or loss of several proteins. Analysis of the protein patterns indicated that some proteins were uniquely responsive to either TPA or IFN-gamma and others were common to both.

Interestingly, two out of seven cases of the M1 class cells exhibited enhanced levels of fms kinase. These data suggest that the determination of the fms kinase may be useful to subdivide the M1 class of the FAB classification into monocytic and non-monocytic precursor leukemia cells.","['Tamura, T', 'Brost, H', 'Kabisch, A', 'Lampert, F', 'Hadwiger-Fangmeier, A', 'Niemann, H']","['Tamura T', 'Brost H', 'Kabisch A', 'Lampert F', 'Hadwiger-Fangmeier A', 'Niemann H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Oncogene Protein gp140(v-fms))', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Escherichia coli/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/immunology', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Oncogene Protein gp140(v-fms)', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis/immunology', 'Rabbits', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Retroviridae Proteins/analysis/immunology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1989;115(3):235-41. doi: 10.1007/BF00391695.,"['Institut fur Medizinische Virologie, Justus-Liebig-Universitat Giessen, Federal Republic of Germany.']",,,['10.1007/BF00391695 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis confirmed this and showed altered electrophoretic mobilities of FNR subunits from TPA-treated cells. TPA treatment affected N-linked glycosylation, as tunicamycin treatment of K562 cells abolished differences in FNR mobility. Sialidase treatment of FNR immunoprecipitates minimized and sialidase treatment of intact cells eliminated these mobility differences between subunits from control and TPA-treated cells. Reduced sialylation of FNR from TPA-treated cells was further demonstrated by chromatography with bead-coupled lectins and by the greater negative charge of untreated K562 FNR subunits in two-dimensional isoelectric focusing-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A relationship between reduced FNR sialylation and reduced FN binding was suggested by adhesion assays of sialidase-treated K562 which showed that desialylation of cell surface FNR was associated with decreased cell adhesion. Thus, TPA treatment reduces the function, increases the expression, and alters the structure of K562 FNR, and these changes appear to involve FNR sialylation.","['Symington, B E', 'Symington, F W', 'Rohrschneider, L R']","['Symington BE', 'Symington FW', 'Rohrschneider LR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '24928-17-4 (phorbol-12,13-didecanoate)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neuraminidase', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Fibronectin', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*drug effects/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",1989/08/05 00:00,1989/08/05 00:01,['1989/08/05 00:00'],"['1989/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Aug 5;264(22):13258-66.,"['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Division of Basic, Seattle, Washington 98104.']","['CA 20551/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-07093/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K11 HL02216-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,['S0021-9258(18)51623-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

When the same samples were run in the presence of beta-MSH, a single band at 70 kD (gp70) was observed. Western blot analysis with polyclonal antiserum identified both the 69- and 67-kD bands as envelope gene products. Tryptic peptide mapping of each of the gp67 and gp69 bands confirmed the serological data, with each showing conserved as well as unique peptides. These results imply that the Moloney murine leukemia virus samples examined above contain two structurally different envelope gene products. Western blot analysis using ecotropic and dualtropic specific sera suggest that gp69 is derived from an ecotropic virus, while gp67 is from a dualtropic virus. This is consistent with the results of an earlier study which showed that the majority of the cysteines (4/5) in dualtropic gp70 are lost by a single deletion relative to the ecotropic gp70 species. This would account for the difference in mobility observed in the SDS-PAGE profile in the absence of beta-MSH.

This was first observed on CLL cells which represent a monoclonal proliferation of B cells arrested at an intermediate stage of activation. Cells of 5 out of 12 B-CLL studied display such an increase and all 5 proliferated, in vitro, directly in response to IL2. Similarly, upon triggering with anti-mu and IL2, normal tonsillar B lymphocytes also demonstrate an increase of CD23 expression but this was observed only on day 3. Interferon-gamma was able to inhibit this IL2-mediated up-regulation of CD23 on normal B cells but not on CLL-B cells; on those cells interferon-gamma was similarly unable to inhibit the IL4-mediated CD23 up-regulation.

Evidence for initiation and elongation in early Golgi compartments.,123-35,"The O-glycosylation of leukosialin, a major sialoglycoprotein found on leukocytes, has been studied in the human erythroleukemic cell line K562. The appearance of its O-linked chains has been followed in pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine by immunoprecipitation with an anti-peptide antiserum as well as with a lectin from Salvia sclarea seeds (SSA) specific for GalNAc-Ser/Thr and the peanut (Arachis hypogaea) agglutinin (PNA) which recognizes Gal beta 1----3GalNAc-Ser/Thr structures. An O-glycan-free precursor was converted into the fully O-glycosylated mature form within the 10-min labeling period and no intermediates carrying only GalNAc-Ser/Thr structures could be detected. The ionophore monensin was used in order to slow down intracellular traffic and thus O-glycan synthesis. The drug partly inhibited the transport from rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) to the Golgi and also the cell-surface expression of leukosialin. It was found to have a marked effect on the synthesis of O-linked carbohydrate structures of leukosialin since the amount of O-glycans containing only GalNAc or NeuNAc alpha 2----6GalNAc was significantly increased after monensin treatment. Under these conditions the biosynthesis of the N-glycan on leukosialin was completely arrested in an endoglycosidase-H-sensitive step of processing, whereas the O-glycans already contained galactose and sialic acid although at a reduced level. On the other hand, the small amounts of leukosialin expressed on the cell surface of monensin-treated cells carried the same glycans as those remaining blocked inside the cell. In addition, immunocytochemical studies using SSA and PNA on untreated K562 cells suggested the absence of detectable amounts of GalNAc-Ser/Thr-bearing glycoproteins in the RER as well as in the Golgi. In contrast Gal beta 1----3GalNAc structures could be detected on intracellular membranes which were tentatively identified as the cis-Golgi. Together these results lead us to the following conclusions: N-glycan transfer occurs in the RER before the initiation of O-glycans which takes place at the entrance of the protein into the Golgi; further elongation of O-glycans with galactose and sialic acid follows very rapidly, probably before the final processing of N-glycans to complex-type structures.","['Piller, V', 'Piller, F', 'Klier, F G', 'Fukuda, M']","['Piller V', 'Piller F', 'Klier FG', 'Fukuda M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (SPN protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)']",IM,"['*Antigens, CD', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Glycoside Hydrolases', 'Glycosylation', 'Golgi Apparatus/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lectins', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukosialin', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Oligosaccharides/isolation & purification', 'Polysaccharides/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*metabolism']",1989/07/15 00:00,1989/07/15 00:01,['1989/07/15 00:00'],"['1989/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1989 Jul 15;183(1):123-35. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb14904.x.,"['La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, Cancer Research Center.']",['R01 CA33895/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb14904.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, a better understanding of the mechanisms and clinical consequences of disordered fibrinolysis has emerged. Increased fibrinolytic activity is an uncommon but important cause of hemorrhagic disease. Congenital disorders of fibrinolysis which cause bleeding include increased plasma plasminogen activator activity and deficiency of alpha-2 antiplasmin. Acquired disorders associated with increased fibrinolytic activity and bleeding include liver cirrhosis, amyloidosis, acute promyelocytic leukemia, some solid tumors, and certain snake envenomation syndromes. Increased fibrinolysis is important to recognize because epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) may be required to prevent or control bleeding. Diminished fibrinolytic activity has been associated with a variety of thrombotic disorders, but a direct cause-and-effect relationship has yet to be established. Congenital abnormalities of fibrinolysis associated with thrombosis include plasminogen deficiency, decreased endothelial generation of plasminogen activator activity, and certain abnormal fibrinogens. Thrombosis in these disorders is effectively managed with warfarin. Diminished fibrinolysis has also been reported in ""idiopathic"" venous thrombosis, oral contraceptive-induced and post-operative venous thrombosis, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, but the significance of abnormal fibrinolysis in these disorders is uncertain. Large, prospective studies of fibrinolytic variables as risk factors for vascular and thrombotic disease are needed to determine whether pharmacologic augmentation of impaired fibrinolysis could be useful in the prevention or treatment of these disorders.","['Francis, R B Jr']",['Francis RB Jr'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,"['0 (Plasminogen Inactivators)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)', 'EC 3.4.21.7 (Fibrinolysin)']",IM,"['Blood Coagulation Disorders/*physiopathology', 'Female', 'Fibrinolysin/*physiology', '*Fibrinolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Plasminogen Activators/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Plasminogen Inactivators', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic', 'Thrombosis/*physiopathology']",1989/07/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blut. 1989 Jul;59(1):1-14. doi: 10.1007/BF00320240.,"['Department of Medicine, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles.']",,,['10.1007/BF00320240 [doi]'],,,,,198,,,,,,,

We first investigated the specific binding of 125I-labeled recombinant IL-1 (125I-rIL-1) (4 x 10(17) cpm/mol) to fresh marrow blasts from 11 BCP ALL patients. In five of 11 cases, the binding of 125I-rIL-1 was significantly blocked by excess cold rIL-1. In these five cases, the cell-bound radioactivity ranged from 146 cpm/10(6) cells to 2,412 cpm/10(6) cells (mean +/- SE = 782 +/- 414 cpm/10(6) cells), indicating that 4 to 60 femtomols (mean +/- SE = 20 +/- 10 femtomols) of 125I-rIL-1 specifically bound per 10(7) cells. The estimated number of 125I-rIL-1 molecules bound per cell ranged from 219 to 3,618 (mean +/- SE = 1173 +/- 621). In all five cases, BCP colony formation was stimulated by 10 ng/mL (570 femtomolar) rIL-1, and the background-subtracted colony numbers ranged from 130 to 298 (mean +/- SE = 226 +/- 31). In contrast, no stimulation was observed in six cases that showed no significant 125I-rIL-1 binding. Hence, there was a high correlation between 125I-rIL-1 binding and IL-1 responsiveness, indicating that functional IL-1 receptors were detected in ligand binding assays. Scatchard plot analysis of the specific equilibrium binding data for leukemic BCPs from two IL-1-responsive BCP ALL cases yielded straight linear regression lines, indicating the existence of a single class of 132 to 154 high affinity IL-1 receptors/cell. The apparent affinity constants (Ka) values ranged from 5.2 x 10(9) mol/L-1 to 1.2 x 10(10) mol/L-1. Notably, the concentrations of IL-1 required for half-maximal receptor occupancy (kd = 83 pmol/L to 190 pmol/L) were approximately three orders of magnitude higher than those needed to elicit a half-maximal proliferative response of leukemic BCPs in colony assays (0.1 to 1.0 ng/mL = 5.7 to 57 femtomolar), indicating that only a small fraction of IL-1 receptors need to be occupied to stimulate leukemic BCPs. Notably, IL-1 unresponsive leukemic BCPs from one BCP ALL patient and two BCP ALL cell lines (REH, KM-3) did not exhibit any significant IL-1 binding (less than 10 IL-1 binding sites/cell), and two additional IL-1 unresponsive BCP ALL cell lines (NALM-6, HPB-NULL) expressed only 24 to 54 IL-1 binding sites/cell with a Ka of 7.8 to 9.8 x 10(9) mol/L-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Uckun, F M', 'Myers, D E', 'Fauci, A S', 'Chandan-Langlie, M', 'Ambrus, J L']","['Uckun FM', 'Myers DE', 'Fauci AS', 'Chandan-Langlie M', 'Ambrus JL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/classification/*metabolism/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/classification/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1989 Aug 1;74(2):761-76.,"['Department of Therapeutic Radiology-Radiation Oncology, University of Minnesota Health Sciences Center, Minneapolis.']","['P01-CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-42633/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29-CA-42111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['S0006-4971(20)85370-1 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Since this translocation is a recurrent marker of T-ALL, we undertook to investigate its mode of formation and role in leukemogenesis. The cytogenetic breakpoint on chromosome 14 occurs in 14q11, the same band wherein lies the T-cell receptor alpha/delta chain gene; and Southern hybridization analysis of peripheral blood and bone marrow DNA uncovered a tumor-specific rearrangement in the D delta-J delta region of this locus. DNA encompassing the rearrangement was isolated by molecular cloning, and further analysis revealed it to be the t(11;14)(p13;q11) junction. Nucleotide sequence determination of the junction indicates that the 14q11 breakpoint occurs immediately adjacent to the D delta 2 gene segment. Hence, the translocation arose as an aberrant rearrangement between the downstream recombination signal of D delta 2 and a pseudo recombination signal adjacent to the chromosome 11 breakpoint. Finally, comparison of the breakpoint in band 11p13 with those of other translocations (11;14)(p13;q11) identified a breakpoint cluster region of approximately 1.2 kilobase-pairs (kb), alterations of which may promote the development of T-ALL.","['Yoffe, G', 'Schneider, N', 'Van Dyk, L', 'Yang, C Y', 'Siciliano, M', 'Buchanan, G', 'Capra, J D', 'Baer, R']","['Yoffe G', 'Schneider N', 'Van Dyk L', 'Yang CY', 'Siciliano M', 'Buchanan G', 'Capra JD', 'Baer R']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1989 Jul;74(1):374-9.,"['Department of Microbiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235-9048.']","['CA44016/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA46593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['S0006-4971(20)77365-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The T-ALL cells were also analyzed for rearrangement and transcription of the T-cell receptor(TcR)-beta and gamma genes as well as for the presence of TcR-alpha gene transcripts. Four T-ALLs expressed TcR-gamma delta at the cell surface, while three expressed TcR-alpha beta. The other five T-ALLs did not express a TcR-CD3 complex on their cell membrane. The TcR-gamma delta + T-ALL had rearranged both TcR-delta gene alleles and contained mature 2.2 and 1.5 kb TcR-delta transcripts. In one case, immature 1.9 and 1.2 kb TcR-delta transcripts were also found. Furthermore they contained mature TcR-gamma mRNA, mature or immature TcR-beta mRNA, but no TcR-alpha mRNA. The three TcR-alpha beta + T-ALLs contained mature alpha and beta transcripts, but lacked TcR-delta transcripts as a result of deletion of both TcR-delta gene alleles. These data are in line with a mutually exclusive expression of TcR-alpha and -delta genes, which may be important to ensure the presence of only one type of TcR per T cell. One of the five CD3- T-ALLs had germline TcR-beta, gamma, and delta genes. The other four CD3- T-ALLs had rearranged their TcR-beta, gamma, and delta genes and contained immature 1.9 and 1.2 kb TcR-delta gene transcripts. Remarkably, one of these T-ALLs also contained TcR-alpha transcripts in addition to the immature TcR-delta transcripts, which was in line with the deletion of one TcR-delta gene allele and rearrangement of the other allele. This suggests that prevention of dual receptor expression may not only be regulated by the presence of germline TcR-alpha genes in TcR-gamma delta + cells or by deletion of both TcR-delta gene alleles in TcR-alpha beta + cells, but also via other regulation mechanisms. Finally, our data indicated that the combinatorial repertoire of the TcR-delta genes is limited, which has also been described for the TcR-gamma genes.","['van Dongen, J J', 'Wolvers-Tettero, I L', 'Wassenaar, F', 'Borst, J', 'van den Elsen, P']","['van Dongen JJ', 'Wolvers-Tettero IL', 'Wassenaar F', 'Borst J', 'van den Elsen P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/genetics', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'CD3 Complex', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1989 Jul;74(1):334-42.,"['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Dijkzigt/Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,['S0006-4971(20)77360-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we have selected Leu-11a+ (CD-16) cells by fluorescence activated cell sorting and found that although Leu-11a enriched populations lysed K562 targets in 14-h 51Cr-release assays, they were unable to kill HSV-Fs targets unless a Leu-11a-depleted population was added back to the effectors or unless known activators of NK cells (IFN-alpha or IL-2) were added to the assays. In contrast, Leu-11a-enriched populations were able to mediate ADCC against HSV-Fs in the presence of sera from HSV-seropositive individuals without the requirement for accessory cells. We have begun preliminary characterization of the accessory cells which allow lysis of HSV-Fs by NK cells: they are HLA-DR+ cells which enrich in the light density fractions of Metrizamide density gradients. They need be present in very small numbers for lysis to take place and are not MHC restricted in that heterologous add-backs between anti-HLA-DR plus C and anti-Leu-11b plus C-treated populations are capable of target cell lysis at levels similar to those achieved with the autologous add-backs. Further, the levels of lysis in heterologous add-back experiments reflected the lytic potential of the effector rather than the accessory cell donor. Finally, although the requirement for accessory cells for NK lysis has been demonstrated for fibroblasts infected with HSV-1, CMV, and VZV, lysis of HSV-infected Raji lymphoblastoid cells is relatively accessory-cell independent, indicating that the requirement for accessory cells for lysis by NK cells is not a property of all herpesvirus-infected targets.","['Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, P', 'Feldman, M', 'Curl, S', 'Schnell, J', 'Denny, T']","['Fitzgerald-Bocarsly P', 'Feldman M', 'Curl S', 'Schnell J', 'Denny T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/classification/*immunology', '*Antigens, Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Complement System Proteins/physiology', 'Fibroblasts/*immunology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/immunology', 'Herpes Simplex/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/classification/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Phenotype', '*Receptors, Fc', 'Receptors, IgG', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1989/08/15 00:00,1989/08/15 00:01,['1989/08/15 00:00'],"['1989/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Aug 15;143(4):1318-26.,"['Department of Pathology, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark 07103.']",['CA-42093/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the basis of this finding and of the presence of truncated TCR-beta and CD3-epsilon mRNA, we are led to speculate on a possible ontogenic relationship of NK cells to the T cell differentiation pathway at stages preceding TCR gene rearrangement.","['Biondi, A', 'Allavena, P', 'Rossi, V', 'Bassan, R', 'Barbui, T', 'Champagne, E', 'Mak, T W', 'Minden, M D', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Mantovani, A']","['Biondi A', 'Allavena P', 'Rossi V', 'Bassan R', 'Barbui T', 'Champagne E', 'Mak TW', 'Minden MD', 'Rambaldi A', 'Mantovani A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/genetics', 'CD3 Complex', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA Probes', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/analysis/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*genetics/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/isolation & purification', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Aug 1;143(3):1009-14.,"['Clinica Pediatrica Universita di Milano, Ospedale S.

The concentrations of these inhibitors were chosen to permit the maintenance of cell viability for at least 48 hours, and resulted in 40-60% inhibition of total cellular RNA synthesis. No impairment of 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3-induced monocytic differentiation was observed with all inhibitors tested, and the presence of cordycepin actually enhanced differentiation. The phenotypic evidence of monocytic differentiation correlated with the increased levels of mRNA for c-fos and c-fms measured by hybridization to appropriate nick-translated cDNA probes. In contrast, nuclear run-on experiments showed the expected inhibition of transcription of these genes by the compounds used. The data suggest that interference by external agents with transcription of genes essential for a differentiation program brings into play compensatory mechanisms which permit the program to continue. Thus, differentiation appears to have a high priority among various competing intracellular pathways in 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3-treated HL 60 cells. Stabilization of messenger RNA levels evident in this study may therefore represent a general cellular mechanism for the correction of unwanted effects of xenobiotics on the cell.","['Mathew, P A', 'Ellis, L K', 'Studzinski, G P']","['Mathew PA', 'Ellis LK', 'Studzinski GP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Deoxyadenosines/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos', 'RNA, Messenger/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1989 Aug;140(2):212-8. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041400204.,"['Department of Pathology, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103.']",['CA 44722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['10.1002/jcp.1041400204 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We approached this problem and report here on a profound X-ray repair deficiency of DS cells. With a colorimetric viability assay we observed an UV sensitivity of DS fibroblasts at doses beyond 14 Jm-2 but no significant X-ray sensitivity. By the nucleoid sedimentation technique, a deficient restoration of nucleoids in DS cells after X-ray irradiation was demonstrated. The same features apply for cells, which contain an overexpressed Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD-1) gene.

These can be assayed by using indicator E sensitized by human IgG (EA-human IgG) or mouse IgG1, (EA-mouse IgG1), respectively. On mouse macrophages, Fc gamma RI is sensitive to trypsin, whereas Fc gamma RII is trypsin resistant. We studied the effects of the proteolytic enzymes pronase and trypsin on human monocyte Fc gamma R. Neither enzyme caused a decrease in rosetting mediated by monocyte Fc gamma RI. Human Fc gamma RII is polymorphic, and monocytes interact either strongly or weakly with mouse IgG1. The interaction of low responder monocytes with mouse IgG1 was dramatically increased (to the level exhibited by high responder monocytes) by protease treatment. The effects of proteases on Fc gamma RII were investigated in more detail by using monocytes from which Fc gamma RI was selectively modulated by using immobilized immune complexes. Proteolysis of such modulated monocytes induced an increased interaction with EA-human IgG. Fc gamma RII appears to mediate this interaction. This conclusion is supported by the observation that after proteolysis, the Fc gamma RII-mediated binding of EA-mouse IgG1 becomes susceptible to inhibition by (monomeric) human IgG. To quantify the effect of proteolytic enzymes on Fc gamma RII, we performed binding studies with cell line K562, that expresses only Fc gamma RII. A significant increase in Ka of Fc gamma RII for dimeric human IgG complexes was observed when K562 cells were treated with protease. To elucidate the mechanism of this enhancement of Ka by proteolysis, we performed immunoprecipitation studies. Neither m.w., nor IEF pattern of Fc gamma RII were influenced by proteolysis. Moreover, the expression of Fc gamma RII was not affected by proteolysis as evidenced by immunofluorescence studies and Scatchard analysis, and neither were Fc gamma RI or Fc gamma RIII induced. We conclude that proteolysis increases the affinity of Fc gamma RII for human IgG, and speculate that such a proteolysis-induced change may also occur in vivo, e.g., at inflammatory sites.","['van de Winkel, J G', 'van Ommen, R', 'Huizinga, T W', 'de Raad, M A', 'Tuijnman, W B', 'Groenen, P J', 'Capel, P J', 'Koene, R A', 'Tax, W J']","['van de Winkel JG', 'van Ommen R', 'Huizinga TW', 'de Raad MA', 'Tuijnman WB', 'Groenen PJ', 'Capel PJ', 'Koene RA', 'Tax WJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['*Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, Differentiation/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Cell Line', 'Erythrocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Immunoglobulin G/*metabolism', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', '*Peptide Hydrolases', 'Receptors, Fc/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgG', 'Rosette Formation']",1989/07/15 00:00,1989/07/15 00:01,['1989/07/15 00:00'],"['1989/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Jul 15;143(2):571-8.,"['Department of Medicine, University Hospital Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In I83 cells activated by a 1-h pulse of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, the BSF-MP6-dependent DNA synthesis was strongly enhanced by 50-100 U/ml of recombinant IL 4. Recombinant IL 2 stimulation was necessary only when a suboptimal dose of BSF-MP6 was used. The differentiation was also markedly enhanced by IL 4 as measured by quantitation of IgM secretion both at the population (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses of the supernatant) and single-cell level (enzyme-linked immunospot technique), by morphological examination of the maturation stage and flow cytometric analysis of differentiation-associated surface antigens (CD11c, FMC7, PCA-1 and CD38). No Ig isotype switch was found. In contrast, DNA synthesis and differentiation of I83 cells, activated by Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain I (SAC) and co-stimulated with BSF-MP6 plus IL 2, were strongly inhibited by IL 4, both when it was added simultaneously with SAC or after 2 days of SAC exposure. Analysis of the cell-cycle progression of SAC and BSF-MP6 plus IL 2 and IL 4-stimulated cells by acridine orange staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis demonstrated an arrest of a minor cell population in G0 and a block of the transition of G1 cells to S phase. Neither the enhancing nor the inhibitory effect of IL 4 on the proliferation and differentiation of I83 cells was an indirect effect via IL 4-induced activation of contaminating T cells, monocytes or natural killer cells, as shown by experiments where these cell types were depleted by FACS sorting. Furthermore the expression of CD23 and CD25 was not inhibited by IL 4.

This study explores the role of GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) in the control of these biochemical and functional responses. We report that incubating RBL-2H3 cells for 4 h with 10 microM mycophenolic acid (MPA), an inhibitor of de novo GTP synthesis, reduces GTP levels by over 60% and causes an average reduction of 50% in Ag-stimulated serotonin release. This inhibition of secretion is associated with a 50% decrease in the rate of 45Ca2+ influx in MPA-treated cells. In contrast, Ag-stimulated inositol trisphosphate production is only slightly reduced, indicating that the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C can be activated by Ag in GTP-depleted cells. The membrane responses to IgE receptor cross-linking are unaffected by incubating cells with MPA. Exogenous guanine or guanosine protects the GTP pools in MPA-treated cells and permits normal ion transport and secretory responses to Ag; adenine does not. These results implicate a guanine nucleotide-binding protein in the control of IgE receptor-dependent signal transduction in RBL-2H3 cells. This protein may particularly control the Ca2+ influx pathway that is essential for secretion.","['Wilson, B S', 'Deanin, G G', 'Standefer, J C', 'Vanderjagt, D', 'Oliver, J M']","['Wilson BS', 'Deanin GG', 'Standefer JC', 'Vanderjagt D', 'Oliver JM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*physiology', 'Basophils/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotides/*metabolism', 'Hydrolysis', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Leukemia', 'Microtubules/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mycophenolic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*physiology', 'Receptors, IgE']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Jul 1;143(1):259-65.,"['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque 87131.']","['ES03338-06/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM37202/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study showed that MELC between donor and recipient was the most predictive parameter for the occurrence of GVHD.

IFN-alpha receptor expression was studied by the binding of radioiodinated IFN-alpha to peripheral blood malignant B-cells from 20 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and to blood cells from 5 healthy donors. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells from all 20 patients displayed high affinity IFN-alpha receptors [mean Kd, 62 +/- 9 (SE) pM] ranging between 110 and 850 binding sites/cell [mean, 416 +/- 51]. Nonmalignant mononuclear blood cells showed similar binding data (411 +/- 105 binding sites/cell; Kd 66 +/- 20 pM). Receptor expression did not correlate with the degree of blast transformation or with induction of 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase.

Genetic markers present on the mini-MoMLV DNA enable integration events to be detected, and the recombinants recovered, by selection in Escherichia coli. Integration, which occurs at heterogeneous locations in the target DNA, is absolutely dependent on the presence of a source of viral proteins and a divalent cation in the reaction mixture. The fidelity of the integration reaction was confirmed by sequencing the junctions between the integrated MoMLV DNA and adjacent lambda DNA sequence.

With the use of an in vitro immunoglobulin production system with mitogen, the patient's T lymphocytes enhanced the differentiation of B cells, both from the patient and from a normal adult, into immunoglobulin E-producing cells. Therefore it may be speculated that T cells functioning as immunoglobulin E-specific helpers were transformed to leukemia cells by human T-lymphotropic virus type I. Continuous antigen stimulation of the patient's atopic diathesis also may be a factor.","['Kobayashi, H', 'Yasuda, H', 'Ando, M', 'Oguma, S', 'Fukaya, T', 'Ohkawara, A', 'Ishizaka, A']","['Kobayashi H', 'Yasuda H', 'Ando M', 'Oguma S', 'Fukaya T', 'Ohkawara A', 'Ishizaka A']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Dermatitis, Exfoliative/complications', 'Humans', 'Hypergammaglobulinemia/*complications', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/complications/*immunology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/physiology']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 1989 May;20(5 Pt 2):967-72. doi: 10.1016/s0190-9622(89)70121-3.,"['Department of Dermatology, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",,,"['S0190-9622(89)70121-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0190-9622(89)70121-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The present studies examined the mechanisms responsible for the regulation of c-fms gene expression during human monocytic differentiation. Levels of c-fms mRNA were undetectable in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells, while 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced monocytic differentiation of these cells was associated with the appearance of these transcripts. Run-on transcription assays demonstrated that the c-fms gene was transcriptionally active in uninduced HL-60 cells and that the rate of transcription was unchanged after TPA treatment. These findings suggested that c-fms mRNA levels in HL-60 cells are controlled by posttranscriptional mechanisms. The half-life of c-fms transcripts in TPA-induced HL-60 cells was found to be at least 6 h, while inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide (CHX) decreased this half-life to 4 h. Moreover, inhibition of protein synthesis was associated with decreases in c-fms mRNA levels and a block in the induction of c-fms transcripts by TPA. These findings indicated that the c-fms transcript is stabilized by a labile protein. In contrast to HL-60 cells, c-fms mRNA is constitutively expressed in resting human monocytes and is down-regulated by treatment of these cells with TPA. Run-on assays demonstrated that TPA-induced downregulation of c-fms mRNA levels in monocytes occurred at the posttranscriptional level. Moreover, the results demonstrate that levels of c-fms mRNA are regulated posttranscriptionally by a labile protein. In this regard, the half-life of the c-fms transcript was 6.1 h in monocytes, while treatment of these cells with CHX decreased the half-life to 30 min. Furthermore, this effect of CHX occurred in the absence of changes in the rate of c-fms gene transcription. Together, these findings indicate that c-fms gene expression is regulated at a posttranscriptional level both in HL-60 cells induced to differentiate along the monocytic lineage and in human monocytes. The findings also indicate that levels of c-fms mRNA are regulated by the synthesis of a labile protein which is involved in stabilization of the c-fms transcript.","['Weber, B', 'Horiguchi, J', 'Luebbers, R', 'Sherman, M', 'Kufe, D']","['Weber B', 'Horiguchi J', 'Luebbers R', 'Sherman M', 'Kufe D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/genetics', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1989 Feb;9(2):769-75. doi: 10.1128/mcb.9.2.769-775.1989.,"['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['CA34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC362654,['10.1128/mcb.9.2.769-775.1989 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The restriction patterns of rearrangement were clearly distinct between T and B ALL and use of one V delta probe showed that rearrangement of the V delta IDP2 gene segment which is also productively rearranged in the Peer cell line, occurred frequently in T-ALL but never in B lineage ALL. Studies of WT31 and delta TCS1 antibody reactivity showed that at least 4 of 13 CD3+ T-ALL cases expressed the delta protein. CD4 and/or CD8 Ag expression were observed in some of the gamma delta expressing T-ALL. These data show that particular TCR-delta gene rearrangements occur in neoplastic early B cells and that the combinatorial diversity of TCR-delta rearrangements in T cells is higher than initially expected.

At greater than or equal to 25 micrograms/ml, PF4 inhibited megakaryocyte colony formation approximately 80% in unstimulated cultures, and approximately 58% in cultures containing recombinant human IL 3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Because PF4 (25 micrograms/ml) had no effect on either myeloid or erythroid colony formation lineage specificity of this effect was suggested. A synthetic COOH-terminal PF4 peptide of 24, but not 13 residues, also inhibited megakaryocyte colony formation, whereas a synthetic 18-residue beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) peptide and native beta-TG had no such effect when assayed at similar concentrations. The mechanism of PF4-mediated inhibition was investigated. First, we enumerated total cell number, and examined cell maturation in control colonies (n = 200) and colonies (n = 100) that arose in PF4-containing cultures. Total cells per colony did not differ dramatically in the two groups (6.1 +/- 3.0 vs. 4.2 +/- 1.6, respectively), but the numbers of mature large cells per colony was significantly decreased in the presence of PF4 when compared with controls (1.6 +/- 1.5 vs. 3.9 +/- 2.3; P less than 0.001). Second, by using the human leukemia cell line HEL as a model for primitive megakaryocytic cells, we studied the effect of PF4 on cell doubling time, on the expression of both growth-regulated (H3, p53, c-myc,and c-myb), and non-growth-regulated (beta 2-microglobulin) genes. At high concentrations of native PF4 (50 micrograms/ml), no effect on cell doubling time, or H3 or p53 expression was discerned. In contrast, c-myc and c-myb were both upregulated. These results suggested the PF4 inhibited colony formation by impeding cell maturation, as opposed to cell proliferation, perhaps by inducing expression of c-myc and c-myb. The ability of PF4 to inhibit a normal cell maturation function was then tested. Megakaryocytes were incubated in synthetic PF4, or beta-TG peptides for 18 h and effect on Factor V steady-state mRNA levels was determined in 600 individual cells by in situ hybridization. beta-TG peptide had no effect on FV mRNA levels, whereas a approximately 60% decrease in expression of Factor V mRNA was found in megakaryocytes exposed to greater than or equal 100 ng/ml synthetic COOH-terminal PF4 peptide. Accordingly, PF4 modulates megakaryocyte maturation in vitro, and may function as a negative autocrine regulator of human megakaryocytopoiesis.","['Gewirtz, A M', 'Calabretta, B', 'Rucinski, B', 'Niewiarowski, S', 'Xu, W Y']","['Gewirtz AM', 'Calabretta B', 'Rucinski B', 'Niewiarowski S', 'Xu WY']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (beta-Thromboglobulin)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects/*physiology', 'Peptide Fragments/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Platelet Factor 4/*physiology', 'Protein Conformation', 'beta-Thromboglobulin/pharmacology']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1989 May;83(5):1477-86. doi: 10.1172/JCI114041.,"['Department of Medicine, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19140.']","['CA-01324/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36896/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-46782/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC303850,['10.1172/JCI114041 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The leukemic blood T cells demonstrated a poor response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA). A defect in IL 2 receptor expression was evident in PHA-stimulated leukemic blood T cells. Of interest was the observation that PHA stimulated the induction of a novel CD3+, CD4-, CD8+ T cell subset from patient's CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ leukemic blood T cells. These PHA-induced CD3+, CD4-, CD8+ T cell subsets produced an elevated proliferative response to PHA and concanavalin A, had a helper cell function for IgM synthesis and produced highly elevated amounts of IL 2.","['Raziuddin, S', 'Assaf, H M', 'Teklu, B']","['Raziuddin S', 'Assaf HM', 'Teklu B']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'CD3 Complex', 'CD8 Antigens', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*classification/immunology']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1989 Mar;19(3):469-74. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830190309.,"['Department of Immunology, King Saud University, College of Medicine, Abha, Saudi Arabia.']",,,['10.1002/eji.1830190309 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

A monoclonal clone (designated as 3A2) out of a total of 13 different antibody-secreting cell lines was found to secrete IgG1 class antibodies, which inhibited more than 70% of the binding of radio-iodinated myeloma IgG2a protein to P388D1 cells. The 3A2 Fab fragments bound specifically to P388D1 cells at 4 degrees C with a KD of 1.9 x 10(-8) M and Bmax of 2.9 x 10(5) per cell. This Fab fragment also specifically bound to Fc gamma 2a receptor (R)-positive T cell line (S49) with a KD of 4.4 x 10(-9) M and a Bmax of 1.0 x 10(4) but did not bind to Fc gamma 2a-negative S49 variant cell line, cyc-. The flow cytometric analysis with the use of fluorescein-isothiocyanate-tagged 3A2 F(ab')2 also showed that this antibody binds to Fc gamma 2aR-positive cells, P388D1 and S49, but not to Fc gamma 2aR-negative cells, cyc-. Monomeric and heat-aggregated IgG2a (13-fold molar excess) inhibited the binding of the radioiodinated 3A2 F(ab')2 to P388D1 cells by 70 and 49%, respectively, whereas the inhibition by monomeric and heat-aggregated IgG2b was 17 and 39%, respectively; 3A2 F(ab')2 (100-fold molar excess) inhibited the binding of IgG2a and IgG2b to P388D1 cells by 90 and 24%, respectively, whereas the inhibition of binding of these IgG to S49 cells was 79 and 49%, respectively. Western blotting analysis showed that 3A2 antibody recognizes a major protein (Mr = 100,000) and a minor component (Mr = 80,000) separated by SDS-PAGE of P388D1 or S49 cell lysates under nonreducing condition, whereas under reducing condition, this antibody recognized a major protein (Mr = 50,000) and two additional minor components (Mr = 40,000 and 35,000). Fc gamma 2aR may thus exist at the cell surface as a disulfide linked dimer of a subunit of Mr of 50,000, which could be partially degraded during the isolation to smaller fragments of 40,000 and 35,000 Mr peptides which are still held together by interchain disulfide bond.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Kagami, M', 'Funatsu, Y', 'Suzuki, T']","['Kagami M', 'Funatsu Y', 'Suzuki T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Detergents)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*immunology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/*immunology', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Detergents', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hybridomas/analysis', 'Leukemia P388/enzymology/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Macrophages/*analysis/enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Receptors, Fc/*immunology', 'Receptors, IgG']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1989 Apr;45(4):311-21. doi: 10.1002/jlb.45.4.311.,"['Department of Microbiology, Molecular Genetics, and Immunology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City 66103.']","['AI22742/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35977/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['10.1002/jlb.45.4.311 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In CD3- T-ALL derived from immature T cells, V gamma genes more proximal to J gamma were frequently rearranged; V gamma 8, V gamma 9, V gamma 10, and V gamma 11 were used in 19 of 24 rearrangements. In contrast, CD3+ T-ALL derived from a more mature stage of T cell ontogeny, showed a high frequency of rearrangements involving V gamma genes distal to J gamma; V gamma 2, V gamma 3, V gamma 4, and V gamma 5 were used in 17 of 25 rearrangements. In B-precursor ALL, no notable bias of V gamma gene usage was observed. This probably reflects the possibility that TCR genes may not rearrange according to a T cell hierarchy when under control of a B cell gene program. Furthermore, deletions of those V gamma genes located 3' to rearranged V gamma genes were observed in all patients analyzed. This supports the theory that loop deletion is a major mechanism for TCR-gamma gene rearrangement.","['Hara, J', 'Benedict, S H', 'Yumura, K', 'Ha-Kawa, K', 'Gelfand, E W']","['Hara J', 'Benedict SH', 'Yumura K', 'Ha-Kawa K', 'Gelfand EW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'CD3 Complex', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1989 Apr;83(4):1277-83. doi: 10.1172/JCI114012.,"['Department of Pediatrics, National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine, Denver, Colorado 80206.']",['GM-40767091/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC303818,['10.1172/JCI114012 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Defective interleukin-2 production by T-helper and natural killer cells.,591-7,"Even though they possess normal to increased numbers of circulating natural killer (NK) cells, patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) have a functional NK-cell deficiency which is restorable in vitro in the presence of recombinant IL-2. We therefore measured the level of IL-2 production by both T-helper and NK cells from CML patients as compared to normal controls using PHA-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMs) as well as FACS-sorted CD4+ (OKT4+) lymphoid cells and FACS-sorted CD16+ (B73.1+) lymphoid cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CML patients demonstrated markedly defective IL-2 production as compared to normal controls (4.0 +/- 1.6 and 5.9 +/- 1.4 units/ml after 24 hr of 5 and 10 micrograms/ml PHA stimulation as compared with 40.7 +/- 10.3 and 69.3 +/- 15.1 units/ml for normal subjects). In addition to the decreased relative percentage of CD4+ (OKT4+) lymphoid cells in CML patients, FACS-sorted CD4+ (OKT4+) cells also demonstrated a significant defect in IL-2 production, (10.8 +/- 3.6 units/ml as compared to 39.0 +/- 5.8 units/ml after 24 hr stimulation with 10 micrograms/ml PHA). FACS-sorted CD16+ (B73.1+) lymphoid cells from CML patients also demonstrated significantly decreased IL-2 production after 24 hr incubation with increasing concentrations of PHA or with the NK-sensitive target K562 as compared to normal controls. Defective IL-2 production by PBMs, CD4+ (OKT4+), and CD16+ (B73.1+) cells from CML patients was also evident after 48 hr of PHA stimulation. Although the percentages of both T4+2H4+ and T4+4B4+ subsets are significantly decreased in CML patients, CML patients have normal ratios of T4+4B4+/T4+2H4+ subsets as compared to normal controls. These and previous results support the hypothesis that decreased IL-2 production by both T-helper and NK cells from CML patients may be mechanistically related to the observed NK-cell immunodeficiency in CML patients.","['Chang, W C', 'Fujimiya, Y', 'Casteel, N', 'Pattengale, P']","['Chang WC', 'Fujimiya Y', 'Casteel N', 'Pattengale P']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*immunology', 'Interleukin-2/analysis/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/drug effects/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology']",1989/04/15 00:00,1989/04/15 00:01,['1989/04/15 00:00'],"['1989/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1989 Apr 15;43(4):591-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910430410.,"[""Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, CA 90027.""]",,,['10.1002/ijc.2910430410 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The Ig molecules secreted by these hybrid-hybridomas were fractionated by ion-exchange chromatography, and fractions containing monovalent CD3 antibodies were tested for complement-mediated lysis of T cells. Two monovalent CD3 antibodies with mixed heavy chain isotypes were very poor in lysis but, in contrast, a monovalent antibody possessing two identical rat gamma 2b heavy chains but two non-identical light chains was found to be more lytic with human complement than the parental bivalent CD3 antibody. The difference in lysis was not readily explicable in terms of a difference in complement activation at the level of C1q binding or cell-associated C3. A highly purified batch of this lytic monovalent CD3 antibody was prepared in a form suitable for in vivo therapy. In a preliminary clinical study in one patient with a T lymphoma in leukemic phase this monovalent CD3 antibody was found to be very effective in depleting CD3+ tumor cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. The cells in the peripheral blood were completely cleared and there was no evidence for antigenic modulation. In addition the antibody was able to reverse cell-mediated kidney rejection in three kidney graft patients. These results suggest that monovalent antibody may be effective in vivo as well as in vitro and that a fuller clinical evaluation is justified.","['Clark, M', 'Bindon, C', 'Dyer, M', 'Friend, P', 'Hale, G', 'Cobbold, S', 'Calne, R', 'Waldmann, H']","['Clark M', 'Bindon C', 'Dyer M', 'Friend P', 'Hale G', 'Cobbold S', 'Calne R', 'Waldmann H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/biosynthesis', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*physiology/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/immunology/*physiology/therapeutic use', 'CD3 Complex', 'Complement Activation', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas/analysis', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1989 Feb;19(2):381-8. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830190224.,"['Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, GB.']",,,['10.1002/eji.1830190224 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Intracytoplasmic immunofluorescence studies showed that the cells invariably contained the cytokine. Endogenous labeling studies demonstrated that acute myeloid leukemia cells produced either only the 33-kDa propeptide or both the propeptide and the 17-kDa mature form of IL-1 beta. The 33-kDa propeptide IL-1 alpha was always produced but was less frequently released. Involvement of IL-1 in leukemic cell growth was investigated using two antibodies specific for IL-1 subtypes, which inhibited spontaneous cell proliferation in the six cases studied. After acid treatment of the cells, a surface receptor for IL-1 could be demonstrated, which mediated 125I-labeled IL-1-specific uptake by leukemic cells. Furthermore, recombinant IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta induced significant cell proliferation in 10 of 12 cases. The above findings were uncorrelated with the cytologic type (French-American-British classification) of leukemia. Our studies suggest that IL-1 may act as an autocrine growth factor in most cases of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Cozzolino, F', 'Rubartelli, A', 'Aldinucci, D', 'Sitia, R', 'Torcia, M', 'Shaw, A', 'Di Guglielmo, R']","['Cozzolino F', 'Rubartelli A', 'Aldinucci D', 'Sitia R', 'Torcia M', 'Shaw A', 'Di Guglielmo R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/*drug effects']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Apr;86(7):2369-73. doi: 10.1073/pnas.86.7.2369.,"['Istituto di Clinica Medica IV, Universita di Firenze, Italy.']",,PMC286914,['10.1073/pnas.86.7.2369 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Up-regulation by the inhibitors of phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase.,2457-63,"The mechanisms of Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis of immune complexes were investigated by the use of a murine macrophage-like cell line (P388D1) and murine peritoneal resident macrophages. About 40 to 80% of P388D1 cells phagocytosed SRBC coated with IgG2a subclass anti-SRBC mAb (EA2a) within 60 min, whereas only 10 to 20% of the cells phagocytosed EA2b during the same period. The treatment of P388D1 cells with inhibitors of phospholipase A2 (p-bromophenacylbromide, EGTA, or dexamethasone) or of cyclooxygenase (indomethacin or aspirin) significantly promoted the Fc gamma 2bR-mediated phagocytosis of EA2b, but did not affect the Fc gamma 2aR-mediated phagocytosis of EA2a. These results suggest that the activation of phospholipase A2 activity associated with Fc gamma 2bR may lead to the inhibition of phagocytosis of EA2b. This inhibition appeared to be due to the blockade of the interaction of Fc gamma 2bR with various cytoskeletal components, because the association of Fc gamma 2bR and these cytoskeletal components, which could be eliminated by cytochalasin D, was found to be increased by the inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity.","['Yamada, A', 'Suzuki, T']","['Yamada A', 'Suzuki T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Heterophile)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', 'EC 3.1.- (Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Heterophile/physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*physiology', '*Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/physiology', 'Leukemia P388/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Macrophages/immunology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Peritoneal Cavity', '*Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Phospholipases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phospholipases A/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Receptors, Fc/*physiology', 'Receptors, IgG', 'Rosette Formation']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Apr 1;142(7):2457-63.,"['Department of Microbiology, Molecular Genetics and Immunology, University of Kansas Medical Center 66103.']","['AI 22742/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 35977/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Structure and alternative mRNA splicing patterns.,5912-5,"We have isolated and characterized the gene coding for the alpha subunit of the rat mast cell high affinity IgE receptor. The gene comprises five exons and four introns and spans approximately 6.6 kilobases. The leader sequence is encoded by two exons, the second of which is only 21 base pairs long. The third and fourth exons each code for repeating immunoglobulin-like extracellular domains. A hydrophobic transmembrane domain and positively charged cytoplasmic tail are encoded by a single final exon. The sequence of the 5'-flanking region was determined, and the major transcription initiation site was mapped. The structure of the gene suggests that two minor species of RNA produced by rat basophilic leukemia cells are due to alternative splicing. In one case, the small second exon is removed entirely, and, in the other, 163 base pairs at the 3' end of the fourth exon are removed. The latter species of RNA suggests the possibility of a secreted form of the alpha chain of the receptor. A third variant species of RNA, lacking a leader sequence, may be due to use of an alternative transcription initiation site.","['Tepler, I', 'Shimizu, A', 'Leder, P']","['Tepler I', 'Shimizu A', 'Leder P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*genetics/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', '*Genes', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1989/04/05 00:00,1989/04/05 00:01,['1989/04/05 00:00'],"['1989/04/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/05 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Apr 5;264(10):5912-5.,"['Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['K12DK01401/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,['S0021-9258(18)83636-5 [pii]'],,"['GENBANK/J04622', 'GENBANK/M25334', 'GENBANK/M25335']",,,,,,,,,,

The general importance of glutathione in cytoprotection was confirmed by showing that murine L1210 cells were more sensitive to the lethal effects of HPD plus red light after being treated with buthionine sulfoximine. The specific role of Se-dependent glutathione peroxidase was investigated by using L1210 cells that were grown in Se-deficient media. Glutathione peroxidase activity of such cells was typically less than 5% of that exhibited by Se-replete cells. When examined by means of dye exclusion or clonogenic assay, Se-deficient cells were dramatically more sensitive to HPD-mediated photokilling than normal counterparts. Impaired metabolism of hydrogen peroxide was ruled out as a possible cause of enhanced photokilling, since added catalase had no protective effect on Se-deficient cells. Iodometric analysis of lipid extracts from photooxidized cells indicated a significantly greater rate of LOOH accumulation as a result of Se depletion. Moreover, when depleted cells were incubated in the dark after a short period of photo-peroxidation, LOOH decay was markedly slower than in controls. Similar results were obtained with human CaSki cells derived from cervical carcinoma. It is apparent from these results that lipid peroxidation plays an important role in tumor cell eradication by HPD/phototherapy, and that glutathione peroxidase serves as a natural protectant against photokilling by catalyzing the reduction of LOOHs.","['Thomas, J P', 'Girotti, A W']","['Thomas JP', 'Girotti AW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Hematoporphyrins)', '1982-67-8 (Methionine Sulfoximine)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '68335-15-9 (Hematoporphyrin Derivative)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Glutathione/physiology', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/*physiology', 'Hematoporphyrin Derivative', 'Hematoporphyrins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', '*Lipid Peroxidation', 'Methionine Sulfoximine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Mice', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Selenium/deficiency']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Apr 1;49(7):1682-6.,"['Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In ILL/MZL, therapy modalities were not uniform and the short follow-up time precluded firm conclusions on prognosis. Immunohistology demonstrated that ILL/MZL diagnosed by adequate morphologic criteria is a fairly homogeneous entity, also sharing most of its consistent immunological features with low-grade NHL.

Specific binding of the ligand was observed in cells of two human erythroleukemia cell lines, K562 and HEL. However, only negligible binding was seen in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells and L-1210 murine leukemia cells. Scatchard analyses revealed a curvilinear plot which indicated the existence of two classes of binding sites in these cells. The Kd and Bmax values of the high and low affinity bindings in HEL cells were 2.4 nM and 24 fmol/10(6) cells, and 58 nM and 360 fmol/10(6) cells, respectively. These values in K562 cells were 2.8 nM and 16 fmol/10(6) cells, and 18 nM and 46 fmol/10(6) cells, respectively. The addition of 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to the cultures of K562 and HEL cells caused a concentration- and time-dependent increase in the binding activity. TPA at 10(-8) M increased the Bmax values of both high and low affinity bindings approximately 3 times without significant change in their Kd values and these increases were inhibited by the addition of actinomycin D. Both classes of the binding in cells of each cell line were specifically displaced by several TXA2/prostaglandin (PG) H2 analogues, although the relative specificities to the analogues were different in the two classes. These results suggest that both HEL and K562 cells express the TXA2 receptor on their cell surface and TPA strongly induces this expression in these cells.","['Nakajima, M', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Ushikubi, F', 'Okuma, M', 'Fujiwara, M', 'Narumiya, S']","['Nakajima M', 'Yamamoto M', 'Ushikubi F', 'Okuma M', 'Fujiwara M', 'Narumiya S']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Prostaglandin Endoperoxides, Synthetic)', '0 (Prostaglandins H)', '0 (Receptors, Prostaglandin)', '0 (Receptors, Thromboxane)', '112966-96-8 (S 145)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '42935-17-1 (Prostaglandin H2)', '57576-52-0 (Thromboxane A2)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds/metabolism', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Prostaglandin Endoperoxides, Synthetic/metabolism', 'Prostaglandin H2', 'Prostaglandins H/metabolism', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Thromboxane', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Thromboxane A2/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/02/15 00:00,1989/02/15 00:01,['1989/02/15 00:00'],"['1989/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1989 Feb 15;158(3):958-65. doi: 10.1016/0006-291x(89)92815-5.,"['Department of Pharmacology, Kyoto University Faculty of Medicine, Japan.']",,,"['0006-291X(89)92815-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-291x(89)92815-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Effector cells showed differential levels of tumor cell colony inhibition, but no MHC-non-restricted lysis of normal HPC was observed. Pre-stimulation of normal HPC by culturing on established stromal layers had no effect. Cell-mediated lysis of HPC only occurred by Ag-specific MHC-restricted lysis by CTL, or by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In cell mixing experiments, irradiated tumor cells, but not normal bone marrow cells inhibited tumor cell lysis. Furthermore, cloned effector lymphocytes were able to specifically eliminate malignant cells from tumor contaminated bone marrow without damaging normal HPC. When fresh leukemic cells were used as targets, growth of acute myeloblastic leukemia colonies was inhibited after incubation with several cytotoxic effector clones, whereas chronic myeloid leukemia precursor cells showed limited sensitivity to MHC-non-restricted cytolysis.

We investigated at the level of ligand-receptor interaction the question whether heterogeneity of receptor number or affinity might contribute to primary or secondary treatment failures in CML. We therefore analyzed IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha receptor expression and regulation during treatment with recombinant IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha in 15 patients with advanced CML. We found no difference in number or affinity of constitutively expressed IFN-gamma receptors (mean 1,100) and, on average, a 30% reduction of IFN-alpha receptors (mean 750) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) of patients with chronic or accelerated CML as compared to mature granulocytes and/or bone marrow cells of healthy controls, which express on average 1,050 and 1,100 IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha receptors, respectively. While IFN-gamma receptor expression on PBMNC is not influenced upon treatment with rIFN-gamma, there is a substantial downregulation of IFN-alpha receptors in the course of rIFN-alpha therapy. Our data also show a differential pattern of receptor downregulation between patients achieving complete hematologic remission (CHR) (4 out of 12) compared with patients with partial hematologic remission (PHR) and non-responders. We conclude that differences in IFN receptor number cannot explain primary or secondary treatment failures. However, the differential ligand induced downregulation of IFN-alpha receptors in patients achieving CHR compared to those with PHR or non-responders suggest a prospective value of IFN-alpha receptor determination.","['Bartsch, H H', 'Pfizenmaier, K', 'Hanusch, A', 'Scheurich, P', 'Ucer, U', 'Nagel, G A']","['Bartsch HH', 'Pfizenmaier K', 'Hanusch A', 'Scheurich P', 'Ucer U', 'Nagel GA']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon-gamma/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interferon']",1989/02/15 00:00,1989/02/15 00:01,['1989/02/15 00:00'],"['1989/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1989 Feb 15;43(2):235-40. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910430211.,"['Department of Medicine, University of Gottingen, FRG.']",,,['10.1002/ijc.2910430211 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Although both chemotactic peptides and lipid mediators enhance neutrophil adherence in vitro and in vivo, the mechanism(s) involved in the interaction between circulating neutrophils and microvascular endothelial cells is still not completely understood. In a microtiter well adherence assay, the chemotactic peptides, FMLP and C5a, and the lipid mediators, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and platelet activating factor (PAF), enhanced human neutrophil adherence to cultured human microvascular endothelial cells as well as to human umbilical vein endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner with a rapid time course. This stimulated adhesive interaction between neutrophils and cultured human endothelial cells was dependent on the expression of the Mac-1, LFA-1, p150,95 glycoprotein family on the neutrophil surface since neutrophils from patients with leukocyte adhesion deficiency, lacking surface expression of the adhesive glycoproteins, exhibited markedly diminished adherence to human endothelial cells in response to stimulation with chemotactic factors compared to normal control neutrophils. All four mediators enhanced expression of the glycoprotein family on the surface of normal neutrophils as determined by flow cytofluorimetry using a monoclonal antibody (TS1/18) to the glycoprotein common beta subunit. In addition, TS1/18 inhibited up to 100% the adherence of normal neutrophils to endothelial cells stimulated by maximal concentrations of FMLP, C5a, LTB4, or PAF. Moreover, HL-60 cells, human promyelocytic leukemia cells, neither increased glycoprotein surface expression nor adherence in response to stimulation. Thus, peptide and lipid mediators of the acute inflammatory response appear to enhance adherence of circulating neutrophils to the microvascular endothelium by a mechanism dependent on expression of the Mac-1, LFA-1, p150,95 glycoprotein family on the neutrophil surface.","['Tonnesen, M G', 'Anderson, D C', 'Springer, T A', 'Knedler, A', 'Avdi, N', 'Henson, P M']","['Tonnesen MG', 'Anderson DC', 'Springer TA', 'Knedler A', 'Avdi N', 'Henson PM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Integrin alphaXbeta2)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Receptors, Complement 3b)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemotactic Factors/*pharmacology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Integrin alphaXbeta2', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', '*Lipid Metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Microcirculation', 'Neutrophils/*cytology', 'Receptors, Complement/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Complement 3b']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1989 Feb;83(2):637-46. doi: 10.1172/JCI113928.,"['Department of Pediatrics, National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine, Denver, Colorado 80206.']","['HL-28510/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-34063/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-36577/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC303725,['10.1172/JCI113928 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

When multivalent allergens bind to the receptor-bound IgE, the consequent aggregation of the receptors leads to the release of mediators responsible for allergic symptoms. In rodents Fc epsilon RI is a tetrameric complex of non-covalently attached subunits: one IgE-binding alpha subunit, one beta subunit and a dimer of disulphide-linked gamma subunits. Complementary DNA encoding the alpha and the beta subunits has recently been isolated, but expression of IgE-binding by transfected cells has not yet been achieved. Here we report the cloning of cDNA for the gamma subunit, and propose a model for the alpha beta gamma 2 tetramer which accounts for many of the structural features of the receptor. The rodent receptor on the surface of COS 7 cells was expressed only when the cDNAs for all three subunits were cotransfected.

The most striking inhibitions are that of GARFT by (6R,S)-H4HPteGlu4-6 with IC50 values from 1.3 to 0.3 microM. Both diastereomers, (6R)-H4HPteGlu6 and (6S)-H4HPteGlu6, inhibit GARFT activity. In Manca cell extracts, the (6S) form is more potent than the (6R) form whereas in the murine system the reverse is true. The (6R,S)-H4HPteGlu polyglutamates are weak inhibitors of human AICARFT (IC50, 6-10 microM). Polyglutamates of HPteGlu, however, are more inhibitory to AICARFT, with HPteGlu4-6 having IC50 values close to 2 microM. Polyglutamates of HPteGlu and of H4HPteGlu are weaker inhibitors of thymidylate synthase (IC50, 8 microM for HPteGlu5-6 and greater than 20 microM for H4HPteGlu1-5). Polyglutamates of HPteGlu and of H4HPteGlu are poor inhibitors of SHMT (IC50, greater than 20 microM). Manca cell growth is inhibited 50% by HPteGlu and (6R,S)-5-methyl-H4HPteGlu at 6 and 8 microM, respectively. Both of these effects are reversed by 0.1 mM inosine. Trimetrexate at a subinhibitory concentration, 10 nM, antagonizes growth inhibition by HPteGlu, raising the IC50 from 6 to 64 microM, but enhances inhibition by (6R,S)-5-methyl-H4HPteGlu, lowering the IC50 from 8 to 5 microM.

It is found in a spectrum of tumor lines but it is absent or occurs minimally in normal tissues. Hepatomas incorporate up to 20-30% of labeled pyridoxine into the novel product. Its structure was tentatively identified as adenosine-N6-methyl, propylthioether-N-pyridoximine-5'-PO4. However, results of tests on the incorporation of labeled precursors into the novel product by 3B3 hybridoma or HL-60 cells support an N6-diethylthioether bridge linking the adenosyl and pyridoxyl moieties. The synthesis of adenosine-N6-methyl, propylthioether-N-pyridoxamine is reported in this paper. The mass spectrum of this analog is similar to that of the tumor product as seen by its fragmentation in further support of the structure of the tumor product. Whether the latter may be part of tumor RNA is questionable.

Experiments were conducted with normal P388 cells in Fischer's medium and under conditions in which the esterase-mediated activation was modified by pretreating cells with the irreversible esterase inhibitor paraoxon and by adding acetylcholinesterase to the medium. Inhibition of intracellular esterase had a much greater effect on activity than did addition of enzyme to medium. These experiments provided data that were used to assess the utility of kinetic models as a means to gain a more detailed understanding of the cytotoxicity process in cell culture. Growth rate inhibition was related to the amount of intracellular alkylation resulting from formation of metabolic intermediates and their subsequent chemical reaction to form methyldiazonium ion and methylation products by using kinetic rate laws and measured rate constants. The model is applicable to systems that form unstable metabolites that can, in part, partition between the cell volume and incubation medium. When growth rate inhibition effects were related to cumulative intracellular alkylation [P], the ED50 values were the same for all three agents and for three previously reported chemically activated methylating agents, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, streptozotocin, and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, which are also thought to act through the methyldiazonium ion. This observation is consistent with a growth rate inhibition effect of the methyldiazonium ion that reflects the intrinsic activity of this species that is independent of the precursor molecule.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Weinkam, R J', 'Plakunov, I']","['Weinkam RJ', 'Plakunov I']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Cholinesterase Inhibitors)', '56856-83-8 (methyl(acetoxymethyl)nitrosamine)', '592-62-1 (Methylazoxymethanol Acetate)', '615-53-2 (Nitrosomethylurethane)', 'EC 3.1.1.7 (Acetylcholinesterase)', 'M43H21IO8R (Dimethylnitrosamine)', 'Q9CX8P80JW (Paraoxon)']",IM,"['Acetylcholinesterase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cholinesterase Inhibitors', 'Dimethylnitrosamine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism/pathology', 'Methylazoxymethanol Acetate/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Nitrosomethylurethane/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Paraoxon/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 1989 Sep-Oct;2(5):288-94. doi: 10.1021/tx00011a004.,"['Drug Metabolism Department, Allergan, Inc., Irvine, California 92715.']","['CA-23168/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-26381/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['10.1021/tx00011a004 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Although Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and its contribution to Ca2+ signaling in many cell types is well documented, relatively little is known regarding the role and mechanism of Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane. We have investigated mitogen-triggered Ca2+ signaling in individual cells of the human T-leukemia-derived line, Jurkat, using fura-2 imaging and patch-clamp recording techniques. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA), a mitogenic lectin, induces repetitive [Ca2+]i oscillations in these cells peaking at micromolar levels with a period of 90-120 s. The oscillations depend critically upon Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane, as they are rapidly terminated by removal of extracellular Ca2+, addition of Ca(2+)-channel blockers such as Ni2+ or Cd2+, or membrane depolarization. Whole-cell and perforated-patch recording methods were combined with fura-2 measurements to identify the mitogen-activated Ca2+ conductance involved in this response. A small, highly selective Ca2+ conductance becomes activated spontaneously in whole-cell recordings and in response to PHA in perforated-patch experiments. This conductance has properties consistent with a role in T-cell activation, including activation by PHA, lack of voltage-dependent gating, inhibition by Ni2+ or Cd2+, and regulation by intracellular Ca2+. Moreover, a tight temporal correlation between oscillations of Ca2+ conductance and [Ca2+]i suggests a role for the membrane Ca2+ conductance in generating [Ca2+]i oscillations in activated T cells.","['Lewis, R S', 'Cahalan, M D']","['Lewis RS', 'Cahalan MD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Regul,Cell regulation,9005331,"['0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytosol/drug effects/metabolism', 'Electrochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Phytohemagglutinins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/immunology/metabolism']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Regul. 1989 Nov;1(1):99-112. doi: 10.1091/mbc.1.1.99.,"['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, California College of Medicine, University of California, Irvine 92717.']","['GM-41514/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-14609/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC361429,['10.1091/mbc.1.1.99 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Study using a 5'D probe lying 20 kb upstream of IgH D region genes was useful to distinguish diversity(D)-joining(J) recombination(DJ) from variable(V)-DJ recombination(VDJ). Indeed, IgH gene structures determined by 5'D study well correlated to those recognized by DJ or VDJ transcripts. IgH gene rearrangements of B precursor cell ALL showed developmentally restricted gene recombination; DJ/DJ genotype in the most immature stage and VDJ/VDJ genotype in the relatively mature stage. B precursor cell ALL with simultaneous rearrangements were frequently found in relatively mature cells, i.e., CD20 expressing cells on their surface. Furthermore, most of such dual genotypic ALL showed that at least one allele of IgH genes was VDJ recombination. This finding suggests that dual genotype was the incidental product by a putative common recombinase during the process of VH gene rearrangements. Moreover, since IgH gene rearrangements of acute unclassified leukemia with dual genotype were DQ52 genotype, which indicates abortive gene rearrangements, it was also thought that dual genotype occurred due to the pluripotentiality of the stem cell.","['Miwa, H', 'Kita, K', 'Nosaka, T', 'Kawakami, K', 'Ikeda, T', 'Shirakawa, S']","['Miwa H', 'Kita K', 'Nosaka T', 'Kawakami K', 'Ikeda T', 'Shirakawa S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Nihon Ketsueki Gakkai Zasshi,Nihon Ketsueki Gakkai zasshi : journal of Japan Haematological Society,2984803R,,IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nihon Ketsueki Gakkai Zasshi. 1989 Dec;52(8):1442-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease is characterized by a high incidence of oral complications at diagnosis and during subsequent treatment. Oral complications can be divided in three groups. Primary lesions are induced by the infiltration of the oral structures by malignant cells: gingival infiltration and infiltration of bony oral structures. Secondary lesions are the result of the myelophthisic character of the disease. This group contains symptoms of anemia, increased bleeding tendency and increased susceptibility to infections. Tertiary lesions are induced by the antileukemic treatment patients receive. Direct and indirect cytotoxic effects can be distinguished. This article reviews the different oral manifestations, describes the most prominent characteristics of the different oral symptoms and demonstrates the importance of early and correct recognition of these symptoms for the oncologist. This can be important for diagnosis of the disease, but also for prevention and treatment of complications during the subsequent treatment. Dentists and stomatologists can contribute to a better prognosis and a reduction of morbidity and mortality of this disease.","['Vinckier, F', 'Declerck, D']","['Vinckier F', 'Declerck D']",['dut'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Belgium,Acta Stomatol Belg,Acta stomatologica Belgica,0421026,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Jaw Diseases/etiology', 'Mouth Diseases/*etiology', 'Mouth Mucosa/drug effects', 'Opportunistic Infections/complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Stomatitis/etiology']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Stomatol Belg. 1989 Oct;86(3):219-26.,,,,,,,,Orale symptomatologie bij leukemische kinderen en hun diagnostische waarde.,21,,,,,,,

Using this assay we were able to divide monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies generated using a single IgG1 lambda paraprotein as the immunogen into three distinct groups. Seven antibodies detected determinants which were expressed only by the immunogen. The remaining seven antibodies all reacted with normal serum immunoglobulin. Four antibodies reacted with ""public"" idiotopes which were strongly expressed by serum immunoglobulin, and three antibodies reacted with ""restricted public"" idiotopes which were only weakly expressed by serum immunoglobulin. This last group may be of significant interest as agents for the immunotherapy of B-cell malignancies. The conservation of expression of these idiotopes in many individual sera suggests that they have a physiological role in immune regulation and would therefore be excellent targets for immunotherapy of B-cell tumours while their quantitatively low expression by circulating immunoglobulin is unlikely to interfere with tumour cell specific binding in vivo.","['Cachia, P G', 'Pepper, D S', 'Dewar, A E', 'Krajewski, A S']","['Cachia PG', 'Pepper DS', 'Dewar AE', 'Krajewski AS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Scotland,J Clin Lab Immunol,Journal of clinical & laboratory immunology,7808987,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', '*Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*analysis', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Mice']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Lab Immunol. 1989 Apr;28(4):195-200.,"['Department of Pathology, University of Edinburgh.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, trials to date have not shown efficacy of IVIG in preventing sepsis in burn patients. The ease of administration and efficacy of IVIG in preventing respiratory symptoms in hypogammaglobulinemic patients has suggested that many other patients presenting with sinusitis and asthma, recurrent bronchitis, and other chronic chest symptoms might also benefit from IVIG and that they should be worked up for IgG subclass or specific antibody deficiencies. Side effects of IVIG administration are generally minor and may be prevented by slow administration and/or pretreatment with aspirin or Benadryl. The only contraindication to IVIG treatment is anaphylactic sensitivity to IgA, which is extremely rare.

However, there was no significant difference in time to complete crusting between the two treatments. In herpes zoster, acyclovir significantly shortened the time from the onset of the skin lesions to complete crusting. A slight raise of GOT in two cases was reported.

DNA polymerase inhibitors such as cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) and aphidicolin elicited comparative inhibition of DNA biosynthesis in both parental and ADR-resistant tumor cells. However, ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors such as hydroxyurea (HU) and caracemide were collaterally more sensitive to P388/R cells. Inosine diglycolaldehyde (Inox) was ineffective in showing such a response. Pretreatment with HU significantly increased intracellular ADR levels and inhibition of RNA biosynthesis by ADR in P388/R cells while, in P388/S cells, sequential or concurrent treatment with HU did not enhance intracellular ADR levels. Mechanisms underlying such an effect, implications due to reduced intracellular ATP levels in drug-resistant cells, and the possible utility of using ribonucleotide reductase as a target in drug-resistant tumors for the therapeutic benefit are discussed.","['Satyamoorthy, K', 'Deshpande, S S', 'Chitnis, M P']","['Satyamoorthy K', 'Deshpande SS', 'Chitnis MP']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', '4613T5ZY7G (inosine dialdehyde)', '5A614L51CT (Inosine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase II)', 'H74F6J185A (caracemide)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Aphidicolin', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA Polymerase II/antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Diterpenes/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Hydroxyurea/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Inosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neoplasma. 1989;36(6):673-83.,"['Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many evaluations conducted on an international basis have demonstrated that initial expectations were not met and that the test lacked sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value to be accepted as a screening and diagnostic tool. In our evaluation we have collected plasma from healthy subjects, from patients with various kinds of cancer at different stages of evolution and therapy, and from patients suffering from a variety of pathologies, including benign tumors. In accordance with Chmurny et al., we observed that the linewidth index (LWI) is precise and reproducible when care is taken in the handling and storage of samples and in the fasting of subjects. After finding no predictive value to the test, we have reanalyzed the spectra and studied the variations of the ratio defined by the methylene signal area over the methyl signal area. This ratio is significantly increased in cancer. Furthermore, it offers a better separation of statistical populations permitting a more precise discrimination between cancer, other pathologies and controls. We have also found that malignant tumors arising from mesenchyma (sarcoma, leukemia, lymphoma) induce less important variations in the CH2/CH3 ratio than adenocarcinoma or glioma, when such differences cannot be documented using the LWI. These observations are particularly interesting since they might bring new information on the metabolic modifications of the LWI and the CH2/CH3 ratio might reflect the embryologic origin of the tumors and raise the issue of the heterogeneity of cancer disease.","['Vion-Dury, J', 'Sciaky, M', 'Confort-Gouny, S', 'Kriat, M', 'Favre, R', 'Grisoli, F', 'Harle, J R', 'Fontanarava, E', 'Mongin, M', 'Carcassonne, Y']","['Vion-Dury J', 'Sciaky M', 'Confort-Gouny S', 'Kriat M', 'Favre R', 'Grisoli F', 'Harle JR', 'Fontanarava E', 'Mongin M', 'Carcassonne Y', 'et al.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,C R Acad Sci III,"Comptes rendus de l'Academie des sciences.

DESIGN: Postal questionnaire and interview. SETTING: Leukaemia unit of oncology hospital. PATIENTS: Consecutive series of 46 English speaking women who had developed ovarian failure after total body irradiation and bone marrow transplantation as treatment for leukaemia. RESULTS: Of the 36 responders, 33 reported some symptoms, vaginal dryness being the most common (29). This profoundly affected sexual function. Although 22 women had had sexual intercourse within six months after treatment, 16 were less interested in and 18 experienced difficulties with sexual intercourse. Anxieties about sterility, femininity, and appearance were common and reduced self confidence. Almost half reported that they had changed their social habits and restricted their social activities. Treatment seemed effective in abolishing symptoms in 24 women, but vaginal dryness remained a problem in three. Two women failed to respond and intercourse remained impossible.

On the basis of the doubling time and cell cycle distribution for logarithmically growing L1210 cells, a synchronization protocol was devised involving a temporal sequence of two 12-h exposures to aphidicolin, separated by an 6-h interval in drug-free medium. After the second aphidicolin treatment, resuspension of cells into drug-free medium resulted in the rapid onset of DNA synthesis as assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation and DNA fluorescence with flow cytometry. By 6 h after aphidicolin removal, the cells progressed into the G2-M phase and cell division was initiated. DNA synthesis was minimal during this time and remained low through 9 h when the majority of the cells were in G1 phase. Only low levels of cytotoxicity were observed when L1210 cells were treated with aphidicolin in this fashion. The levels of both thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase were relatively constant during cell cycle transit, following release from the aphidicolin blockade. Similarly, the levels of the corresponding mRNA transcripts for these enzymes, measured by Northern blot hybridizations, remained essentially unchanged through most of the cell cycle, increasing approximately twofold only as the cells entered G1 phase. Whereas intracellular dihydrofolate reductase catalytic activity was relatively unchanged throughout the cell cycle, as reflected in the metabolism of [3H]folic acid to reduced folate forms, a marked increase in in situ thymidylate synthase activity occurred during S phase that was tightly linked to the rate of DNA synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Matherly, L H', 'Schuetz, J D', 'Westin, E', 'Goldman, I D']","['Matherly LH', 'Schuetz JD', 'Westin E', 'Goldman ID']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,"['0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase II)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aphidicolin', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cytological Techniques', 'DNA Polymerase II/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Thymidylate Synthase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 1989 Nov 1;182(2):338-45. doi: 10.1016/0003-2697(89)90605-2.,"['Developmental Therapeutics Program, Michigan Cancer Foundation, Detroit 48201.']","['CA-09340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HLBI-07110/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0003-2697(89)90605-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0003-2697(89)90605-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Ouabain affects RVD only after long preincubation and furosemide or phloretin have hardly any effect on this process.

After culture with IL-2 for 1 or 2 weeks, less than 40% of the lymphocytes weakly reacted with FO-120, whereas strongly positive cells were detected in more than 70% of cells in half the T-cell lines established from preleukemic state of adult T-cell leukemia (pre-ATL) and all of ATL derived T-cell lines. All in vivo specimens of non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphomas, except for one case of T-cell lymphoma were also strongly positive. In addition, the extent of the antibody reactivity correlated with the histopathological grade of malignancy in B-cell lymphoma. The reactivity to most AILD-IBL lesions overlapped with that to T-lymphomas, and could be distinguished from that to reactive lesions.

None of these cell lines had ever been exposed to any anticancer agent in vitro except K562/ADM.

A nuclear protein, DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha), was selected as a marker for proliferative cells, and Leu3a molecule as a cell-surface antigen phenotype marker of the cells. The procedure involved the simultaneous use of fluorescein-conjugated anti-pol alpha antibody, developed by us, and commercially available phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-Leu3a antibody. The optimal fixative for both proteins was phosphate-buffered 2% paraformaldehyde. The pol alpha-positive population in logarythmically growing MOLT 4 cells was estimated, by flow cytometry, to be ca. 95%. A sharp flow cytometry histogram with a strong pol alpha-linked fluorescence was observed. On the other hand, the pol alpha-positive population in the saturated culture was ca. 70%, with weaker pol alpha-linked fluorescence. Thus, the population of pol alpha-positive cells and the amount of pol alpha in cells was dependent on the cell density of the culture. In contrast, ca. 90% Leu3a-positive populations with similar flow cytometry histograms were seen in either growing or saturated states, suggesting that expression of Leu3a was independent of cell density. The flow cytometric method using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-pol alpha antibody is useful for detecting proliferative fractions of free tumor cells, such as leukemic cells. Furthermore, analysis of the phenotype of the proliferative or non-proliferative cells became easier by simultaneous labeling with antibodies against pol alpha and phenotype-specific proteins.","['Shibata, M', 'Hirono, Y', 'Takahashi, M', 'Kaneda, T']","['Shibata M', 'Hirono Y', 'Takahashi M', 'Kaneda T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['CD4 Antigens/*analysis/immunology', 'Cell Division', 'DNA Polymerase II/*analysis/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*immunology/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1989 Nov;80(11):1083-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1989.tb02263.x.,"['Clinical Research Institute, Nagoya National Hospital.']",,PMC5917917,['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1989.tb02263.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventy (49.0%) out of 143 HTLV-I healthy carriers were found to be positive for antibody against p40tax antigen and the follow-up samples at two-year intervals revealed constant reactivity by ELISA in each carrier. The onset of antibody production was delayed 4 to 12 weeks as compared with anti-HTLV-I in primary infection cases. The anti-p40tax-positive rate (90%) in HAM patients was significantly higher than that of healthy carriers, acute and chronic ATL patients and their family members. Furthermore, HAM patients and a few healthy carriers showed high reactivities by ELISA. Children from mothers with anti-p40tax showed a higher anti-HTLV-I-positive rate than that of children from mothers without anti-p40tax (54.5% versus 12.5%). Two men without anti-p40tax and one female with low anti-p40tax developed ATL during follow-up studies. These results suggest that HTLV-I carriers could be divided into 2 or 3 sub-populations according to antibody response to p40tax. A smaller population with anti-p40tax, especially a high antibody reactivity, could have a high risk of developing HAM and of transmission from mother to child.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 130, 596-602]. In order to clarify its mechanism of action in intact cells, the inhibitory properties of AOAP on the growth and polyamine metabolism of L1210 cells were compared with those seen in a variant subline (D-R cells) which overproduces ODC. As little as 20 microM-AOAP completely blocked proliferation of L1210 cells, and this effect was reversed by the concomitant addition of exogenous putrescine or spermidine. Growth of D-R cells was not affected by AOAP at concentrations up to 0.5 mM. There was no difference in the uptake of AOAP between the L1210 and the D-R cells. Exposure of L1210 or D-R cells to AOAP greatly decreased ODC activity in undialysed cell extracts, but did not decrease AdoMetDC. Activities of both enzymes were increased severalfold by AOAP treatment when activity was measured in dialysed extracts. Treatment with AOAP depleted intracellular putrescine and spermidine contents of L1210 cells, while inducing a massive accumulation of decarboxylated AdoMet. The 8-fold higher putrescine pool present in untreated D-R cells was depleted in a dose-dependent manner by AOAP, but a significant decrease in spermidine and accumulation of decarboxylated AdoMet required 10 times higher drug concentrations, and the changes were much less dramatic than in L1210 cells. These results indicate that in L1210 cells AOAP behaves primarily as a reversible inhibitor of ODC.","['Poulin, R', 'Secrist, J A 3rd', 'Pegg, A E']","['Poulin R', 'Secrist JA 3rd', 'Pegg AE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Propylamines)', '98532-00-4 (1-aminooxy-3-aminopropane)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'EC 4.1.1.50 (Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Eflornithine/pharmacology', 'Kidney/drug effects/enzymology', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/metabolism', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors', 'Polyamines/*metabolism', 'Propylamines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1989 Oct 1;263(1):215-21. doi: 10.1042/bj2630215.,"['Department of Physiology, Milton S.

The radiolabeled proteins comigrate on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with the two pertussis toxin substrates present in HL-60 membranes, alpha i2 and alpha i3. The effect of the chemotactic peptide is blocked by treatment of intact HL-60 cells with pertussis toxin. Peptide mapping studies using Staphylococcus aureus protease V8 reveal that the two radiolabeled proteins are structurally distinct. Thus, the agonist-activated formyl peptide receptor functionally interacts with two distinct pertussis toxin substrates, most likely with Gi2 and Gi3. As the third Gi protein, Gi1, appears to be absent from both HL-60 cells and from systems that clearly reveal hormonal inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, the results strongly suggest that primary structure alone does not suffice to determine which effector mechanism is regulated by a given Gi-protein.","['Gierschik, P', 'Sidiropoulos, D', 'Jakobs, K H']","['Gierschik P', 'Sidiropoulos D', 'Jakobs KH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '20762-30-5 (Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cholera Toxin/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'NAD/metabolism', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/drug effects/*physiology', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",1989/12/25 00:00,1989/12/25 00:01,['1989/12/25 00:00'],"['1989/12/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/25 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Dec 25;264(36):21470-3.,"['Pharmakologisches Institut, Universitat Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany.']",,,['S0021-9258(20)88206-4 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, when donors were divided into age groups, there were increasing numbers of IF-positive/PA-positive donors with age. Among the PA-positive donors in the 50-64 age group, 65.9% were IF-positive compared to 16.0% in the 16-19 age group. The serological specificities of the IF-negative/PA-positive specimens were tested by using a newly developed PA inhibition (PAI) test. The HTLV-I specificity of the PAI test was confirmed by the observation that agglutinations with anti-HTLV-I p19 and gp21 monoclonal antibodies as well as IF-positive sera were specifically inhibited with HTLV-I preparations or HTLV-I-positive cell extracts and not with HTLV-I-negative cell extracts. Sixty of the 104 specimens collected randomly from the IF-negative/PA-positive donors were PAI-positive. The majority (80%) of such PAI-positive sera showed more than two bands of HTLV-I gag-encoded polypeptide, p19, p24, p28 and p53 on Western blotting. Some of the PAI-positive sera were also positive by enzyme immunoassay. These results indicate that at least some of the IF-negative/PA-positive donors possess HTLV-I-specific antibody and may be potential HTLV-I carriers who will become IF-positive at a later age.","['Kwon, K W', 'Ikeda, H', 'Yano, M', 'Sekiguchi, S']","['Kwon KW', 'Ikeda H', 'Yano M', 'Sekiguchi S']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Agglutination Tests', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', '*Blood Donors', 'Carrier State/*microbiology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HTLV-I Infections/*microbiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Middle Aged', 'Serologic Tests']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1989 Sep;80(9):833-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1989.tb01723.x.,"['Hokkaido Red Cross Blood Center, Sapporo.']",,PMC5917853,['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1989.tb01723.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Histochemical analysis demonstrated that incubation of cells in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 induced varying degrees of monocytic differentiation, while incubation in the presence of retinoic acid (RA) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) induced granulocytic differentiation. The differentiation induced by PMA, RA, and to a lesser extent DMSO, was accompanied by the induction of plasminogen activator inhibitor expression. mRNA analysis of control and PMA-induced cultures revealed the induction of a 2-kb message in treated cells which hybridized with a PAI-2-specific oligonucleotide probe. This is consistent with the literature concerning the expression of PAI by macrophages and granulocytes. No hybridization was detected with a PAI-1 specific probe. Expression of PAI by cells of hematopoietic origin appears to be associated with differentiation or stimulation of committed cells. Furthermore, PAI-2 expression by HL-60 cells is not restricted to one specific hematopoietic lineage. Since other cells of hematopoietic origin such as platelets express PAI-1, future studies using pluripotential cell lines could provide information on the initial events of lineage commitment and gene expression.","['Arndt, A D', 'Gohill, J', 'Rankin, K', 'Houwen, B', 'Hart, D A']","['Arndt AD', 'Gohill J', 'Rankin K', 'Houwen B', 'Hart DA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Plasminogen Inactivators)', '0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Plasminogen Inactivators', 'Pregnancy Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1989 Dec;185(2):473-81. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(89)90316-9.,"['Joint Injury and Diseases Research Group, University of Calgary Health Sciences Centre, Alberta, Canada.']",,,['10.1016/0014-4827(89)90316-9 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, 3AB appears to lack specificity for the synthetase, and the use of excessive concentrations of the inhibitor may adversely affect the potential responsiveness of cells to DNA-damaging agents. Here we address the concentration dependency of the cellular impact of 3AB alone by using flow cytometry to analyze the cell cycle phase-dependent, anti-proliferative effects of 3AB on mouse L1210 cells together with fluctuations in RNA (predominantly ribosomal) levels. We report that 3AB, at cytostatic concentrations, does not block cells in G2 committed to mitosis but imposes an immediate G1 and S phase arrest. Eventually cells arrested in G1 and S phase can reenter cycle but become irreversibly blocked in G2 and are incapable either of progression to mitosis or of the reinitiation of DNA synthesis when cytokinesis is blocked by colcemid exposure. 3AB exposure rapidly reduced RNA levels in all phases of the cell cycle with recovery from depletion apparent only at nontoxic concentrations (5 mM). The responses of a 3AB-resistant subline, capable of sustained culture growth in a normally cytostatic concentration of inhibitor (25 mM), suggest a close association between the sensitivity to RNA depletion and cell cycle arrest.","['Smith, P J', 'Watson, J V', 'Shall, S']","['Smith PJ', 'Watson JV', 'Shall S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '8J365YF1YH (3-aminobenzamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', '*Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'RNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'RNA, Ribosomal/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1989 Dec;185(2):353-62. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(89)90305-4.,"['MRC Clinical Oncology and Radiotherapeutics Unit, MRC Centre, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",,,['10.1016/0014-4827(89)90305-4 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In all three patients, the mucosal infiltrate consisted of ""centrocyte-like"" (CCL) cells forming lymphoepithelial lesions and plasma cells. In one patient, the mucosal infiltrate was strikingly follicular. Immunohistochemistry showed alpha 1 heavy chain, but no light chain, in the perinuclear space and cytoplasm of the CCL cells and in the plasma cells. In two patients, the plasma cells (but not the CCL cells) also contained alpha 2 heavy chain. In the case showing a follicular pattern, the extrafollicular CCL cells and most of the cells within the mucosal follicles expressed alpha 1 heavy chain, but a minor and variable population of cells expressed polytypic IgM. The dendritic reticulum cells stained for alpha 1 (but not alpha 2) heavy chain, mu chain, and both light chains. In all cases, the CCL cells did not stain for common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia antigen (CALLA); in the follicles, CALLA negative cells displaced a residual CALLA-positive population to the periphery and merged with the CALLA negative cells outside the follicles. These findings confirm the homology between IPSID and low-grade B-cell ""Western"" lymphomas arising in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue; they suggest that the follicular pattern sometimes seen in these lymphomas is caused by selective colonization of reactive follicles by CCL tumor cells.","['Isaacson, P G', 'Dogan, A', 'Price, S K', 'Spencer, J']","['Isaacson PG', 'Dogan A', 'Price SK', 'Spencer J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunoproliferative Small Intestinal Disease/immunology/*pathology', 'Jejunum/cytology/pathology', 'Male', 'Plasma Cells/immunology']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 1989 Dec;13(12):1023-33. doi: 10.1097/00000478-198912000-00004.,"['Department of Histopathology, University College and Middlesex School of Medicine, London, England.']",,,['10.1097/00000478-198912000-00004 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The average count of CFU-Meg colonies formed from the bone marrow of CML patients was 5.5 times that of normal controls. Spontaneous CFU-Meg colonies were grown in seven of eight CML patients, but in none of five controls. Colony formation by CFU-Meg in CML as well as normal bone marrow was suppressed by the two preparations of IFN in a dose dependent fashion. Their suppressive influence on colonies from CFU-Meg was comparable between CML and normal bone marrow at lower concentrations, but was less marked for CML than normal bone marrow at higher concentrations. The formation of CFU-Meg colonies from CML bone marrow was more severely suppressed by IFN-gamma than IFN-alpha-2b. Depletion of either T lymphocytes or adherent cells from the CML bone marrow cells diminished the suppressive effects of IFN-gamma, but had no influence on the effects of IFN-alpha-2b.","['Tanabe, Y', 'Dan, K', 'Kuriya, S', 'Nomura, T']","['Tanabe Y', 'Dan K', 'Kuriya S', 'Nomura T']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/*drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1989 Oct;30(10):1800-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The possibility of mother to child transmission of HTLV-1 was studied. Our epidemiological investigation disclosed that almost all mothers of HTLV-1 carrier children were positive for anti-HTLV-1 antibody and children born from carrier mothers showed statistically higher positive rate for anti-HTLV-1 antibody than control groups. A large number of HTLV-1 positive lymphocytes were detected in the milk from carrier mother, but not in the cord blood from newborn babies delivered from carrier mothers. We inoculated the fresh milk collected from carrier mothers into the oral cavity of a common marmoset to prove the oral infection. The marmoset was found to be seroconverted and viral antigen expression was detected in short term cultures of its peripheral T lymphocytes. These results suggest that we can prevent the transmission of HTLV-1 by prohibiting the breast-fed [corrected] by carrier mother. We have so far followed up 55 children born from carrier mothers but fed with compound milk only. None of the children in this group became a carrier of HTLV-1, whereas breast-fed group was found to have higher incidence of sero-positivity for HTLV-1. Therefore the trial prevention of HTLV-1 transmission is now undertaken in Nagasaki district.","['Ikeda, S', 'Kinoshita, K', 'Amagasaki, T', 'Momita, S', 'Soda, H', 'Ito, M', 'Kanda, T', 'Tachibana, K', 'Doi, H', 'Tsuji, Y']","['Ikeda S', 'Kinoshita K', 'Amagasaki T', 'Momita S', 'Soda H', 'Ito M', 'Kanda T', 'Tachibana K', 'Doi H', 'Tsuji Y', 'et al.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Breast Feeding', 'Callitrichinae', 'Carrier State', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/analysis', 'HTLV-I Infections/prevention & control/*transmission', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Pregnancy', '*Pregnancy Complications, Infectious']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1989 Oct;30(10):1732-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human myelocytic-erythrocytic K562 cells and murine Friend erythroleukemia (FELC) and T-cell lymphoma Eb-Esb cells were stimulated to synthesize and accumulate porphyrins. K562 cells accumulated high amounts of protoporphyrin by stimulation with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) plus sodium butyrate or hemin. For Friend and Eb-Ebs cells ALA was an adequate stimulator. The high-metastatic Esb lymphoma cells accumulated comparatively more porphyrin than the low-metastatic Eb cell line. Maximal porphyrin accumulation produced mortality rates of more than 99% after 10 min of photoactivation of the three leukemic lines. Thymidine incorporation was inhibited by the photodynamic effect depending on porphyrin concentration. These results confirm the photodynamic ability of endogenous porphyrins to inactivate cancer cells of different origins.","['Malik, Z', 'Ehrenberg, B', 'Faraggi, A']","['Malik Z', 'Ehrenberg B', 'Faraggi A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,J Photochem Photobiol B,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

The 40-kDa protein proved to be the alpha-subunit of Gi serving as the substrate of pertussis toxin, islet-activating protein (IAP). No radioactivity was incorporated into this protein in membranes isolated from HL-60 cells that had been exposed to IAP. Gi-alpha purified from bovine brain and reconstituted into IAP-treated cell membranes was ADP-ribosylated by CT plus fMLP. Gi-alpha was ADP-ribosylated by IAP, but not by CT plus fMLP, in membranes from cells that had been pretreated with CT plus fMLP. When membrane Gi-alpha [32P]ADP-ribosylated by CT plus fMLP or IAP was digested with trypsin, the radiolabeled fragments arising from the two proteins were different from each other. These results suggest that CT ADP-ribosylates Gi-alpha in intact cells when coupled fMLP receptors are stimulated and that the sites modified by two toxins are not identical. CT-induced and fMLP-supported ADP-ribosylation of Gi-alpha was favored by Mg2+ and allow concentrations of GTP or its analogues but suppressed by GDP. The ADP-ribosylation did not occur at all, even in the presence of ADP-ribosylation factor that supported CT-induced modification of Gs, in phospholipid vesicles containing crude membrane extract in which Gi was functionally coupled to stimulated fMLP receptors. Thus, Gi activated via coupled receptors is the real substrate of CT-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. This reaction may depend on additional factor(s) that are too labile to survive the process of membrane extraction.","['Iiri, T', 'Tohkin, M', 'Morishima, N', 'Ohoka, Y', 'Ui, M', 'Katada, T']","['Iiri T', 'Tohkin M', 'Morishima N', 'Ohoka Y', 'Ui M', 'Katada T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adenylate Cyclase Toxin)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '20762-30-5 (Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ADP-Ribosylation Factors)']",IM,"['ADP-Ribosylation Factors', 'Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/*metabolism', '*Adenylate Cyclase Toxin', 'Animals', 'Brain/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cholera Toxin/*pharmacology', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotides/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Membrane Proteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', '*Pertussis Toxin', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*physiology', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/*metabolism/pharmacology']",1989/12/15 00:00,1989/12/15 00:01,['1989/12/15 00:00'],"['1989/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Dec 15;264(35):21394-400.,"['Department of Life Science, Faculty of Science, Tokyo Institute of Technology Yokohama, Japan.']",,,['S0021-9258(19)30093-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased values were observed with respect to normal age-matched controls (mean +/- S.E.M. 603 U/ml +/- 81 vs. 315 U/ml +/- 31, respectively; P less than 0.0001). This increase was observed in all stages of the disease, excluding stage 0 (mean 277 U/ml +/- 45). A general trend pointing to lower values overall in patients with less invasive disease was observed. In fact, the rank correlation test showed that the serum levels of s-CD8 correlate significantly with the WBC counts, the CD4/CD8 ratio, and also with the levels of serum immunoglobulins. On the contrary, no correlation was observed between s-CD8 levels and the absolute number of circulating CD8+ cells in individual cases. Therefore, the increase of s-CD8 is unlikely to be a mere expression of the increase of the CD8 cell number, but seems related to an increase of the activation phenomena involving the CD8+ T cell subset.","['Semenzato, G', 'Siviero, F', 'Vinante, F', 'Zambello, R', 'Trentin, L', 'Agostini, C', 'Adami, F', 'Vincenzi, C', 'Zanotti, R', 'Zuppini, B']","['Semenzato G', 'Siviero F', 'Vinante F', 'Zambello R', 'Trentin L', 'Agostini C', 'Adami F', 'Vincenzi C', 'Zanotti R', 'Zuppini B', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol,European journal of cancer & clinical oncology,8112045,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*blood', 'CD8 Antigens', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Solubility']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol. 1989 Nov;25(11):1577-81. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(89)90300-3.,"['Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Clinical Medicine, Italy.']",,,['10.1016/0277-5379(89)90300-3 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

A study of survival of patients with multiple myeloma in Finland.,1069-72,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients with multiple myeloma treated in three consecutive clinical trials of chemotherapy of the Finnish Leukaemia Group during 1979-85 had a more favourable prognosis than both patients treated in the trial area before the trials and those treated in the rest of Finland. DESIGN: Comparison of the time trend in survival of patients living in the trial area with that of patients living in the rest of Finland. SETTING: Trial area covered 17 of the 21 main hospital districts in Finland (serving more than two thirds of patients with multiple myeloma). PATIENTS: 663 Men and 690 women in the trial area and 318 men and 307 women in the reference area aged under 71 in whom multiple myeloma was diagnosed during 1959-85. In the trial area the disease was diagnosed in 455 men and 493 women in 1959-78 and in 208 men and 197 women in 1979-85; in the reference area it was diagnosed in 234 men and 227 women in 1959-78 and in 84 men and 80 women in 1979-85. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Five year cumulative relative survival rates during 1959-85, annual relative survival rates in the first seven years of follow up during 1979-85, and fitted annual relative survival rates in the first five years of follow up during 1959-85. RESULTS: During the first two years of follow up the annual relative survival rates did not differ between the two areas, but in the next five years of follow up patients in the trial area did better than those in the reference area. For cases diagnosed in 1979-85 the difference in the five year cumulative relative survival rates between patients in the trial area and those in the reference area was 10%, those in the trial area doing better. Generalised proportional hazards regression analysis of the first five years of follow up showed that the patients in the trial area had a survival advantage over those in the reference area. The model with the best fit included year of follow up, time of diagnosis, the joint effect of year of follow up and time of diagnosis, and the joint effect of area and time of diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The patients in the trial area benefited from the clinical trials, which suggests that the use of a treatment protocol improves the end results of treatment. In other words, the results favour a systematic treatment schedule in preference to a schedule determined by the free choice of a clinician.","['Karjalainen, S', 'Palva, I']","['Karjalainen S', 'Palva I']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",1989/10/28 00:00,1989/10/28 00:01,['1989/10/28 00:00'],"['1989/10/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/28 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/28 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,BMJ. 1989 Oct 28;299(6707):1069-72. doi: 10.1136/bmj.299.6707.1069.,"['Finnish Cancer Registry, Helsinki.']",,PMC1837961,['10.1136/bmj.299.6707.1069 [doi]'],,,"['BMJ. 1990 Jan 6;300(6716):48-9.

Molecular investigation revealed a breakpoint on chromosome 22 within the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) similar to that found in Ph+ cases. After BMT, from an HLA-identical sister, successful engraftment (46,XX) was accompanied by evidence of a residual host cell population with further evolution (del(7)(q22)) and persistence of the bcr+ clone. Acute myeloid leukaemia, detected 5 months later, was associated with predominance of the clone 46XY,t(1;9),inv(3q),del(7)(q22) which failed to respond to treatment and the patient died 6.5 months after BMT. This case indicates that BMT, after the acquisition of additional chromosomal change in accelerated phase, may fail owing to persistence of the leukaemic clone. In addition the BMT conditioning regimen may produce further abnormalities which confer drug resistance on the persisting clone, which can emerge as an intractable myeloid blast crisis.","['Secker-Walker, L M', 'Cooke, H M', 'Browett, P J', 'Norton, J D', 'Kitchen, C', 'Prentice, A G', 'Prentice, H G']","['Secker-Walker LM', 'Cooke HM', 'Browett PJ', 'Norton JD', 'Kitchen C', 'Prentice AG', 'Prentice HG']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/surgery', 'Male', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1989;82(4):205-9. doi: 10.1159/000205378.,"['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK.']",['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,['10.1159/000205378 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In a stepwise logistic regression analysis, a T-cell phenotype in addition to high grade histology and pleural involvement demonstrated a statistically significant correlation with decreased response rate, when the analysis did not include patients with ATLL. Analysis by means of the Cox proportional hazards model disclosed that the T-cell phenotype retained a statistically significant correlation with survival after adjustments for other prognostic factors, whether the study included the patients with ATLL or not. The decreased response rate and survival of Japanese patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in comparison with those reported in Western countries seem to be due to increased intrusion of T-cell lymphomas.

The analysis of the sN risk as a function of the length of follow-up, by calculating the actuarial risk and the hazard function plot, provides important information on the natural history of sN appearing in CLL. The actuarial risk of sN at 5 years was 9.7% or 6.9%, respectively, according to whether we did or did not consider cases of cutaneous carcinomas. The smoothed hazard function showed a pattern of decreasing rate over the first year, a rise to 3.0% by the third year, and no increasing risk later in the follow-up. This trend was associated with a high incidence of sNs synchronous with CLL, and with a clustering of sNs among patients who died early, before reaching median survival. In addition, the early appearance of the sN risk is analogous to the renal transplant experience and suggests that sNs may result from impaired immune surveillance.","['Molica, S', 'Alberti, A']","['Molica S', 'Alberti A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*epidemiology']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1989 Sep-Oct;74(5):481-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pineal gland also synthesizes serotonin, but as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of melatonin. The first enzymic step in the biosynthesis of serotonin is the hydroxylation of L-tryptophan catalyzed by tryptophan 5-monooxygenase. The 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (L-5HTP) formed is then decarboxylated to serotonin. Since the second step is catalyzed by non-specific aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, whether or not a given cell has the capacity to synthesize serotonin depends on the existence of tryptophan monooxygenase, and regulation of the serotonin biosynthesis is achieved mainly by modulating the activity of the first step enzyme. The activity of tryptophan monooxygenase was detected in extracts of the mouse stomach and intestines, although this activity was as low as approximately 1/20 of that in similar extract of the mouse brainstem. The upper small intestine and colon had a higher level of activity than other parts, and in the upper small intestine the enzyme was found to reside primarily in enterochromaffin cells of the mucosa. The intestinal tryptophan monooxygenase shared a common antigenic character with the enzyme from murine mastocytoma and was immunologically different from the brain enzyme. The enzymic properties were also similar to those of mastocytoma tryptophan monooxygenase which requires loosely-bound functional iron (Fe2+) for the activity. It seemed likely that the activity of tryptophan monooxygenase in paraneurons such as mastocytoma and enterochromaffin cells depends on available ferrous iron, and is therefore regulated, at least in part, by the cytosolic level of chelatable iron.","['Hasegawa, H', 'Kobayashi, T', 'Inoue, F', 'Ichiyama, A']","['Hasegawa H', 'Kobayashi T', 'Inoue F', 'Ichiyama A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Arch Histol Cytol,Archives of histology and cytology,8806082,"['0 (Biogenic Amines)', '0 (Catecholamines)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)', 'EC 1.14.16.4 (Tryptophan Hydroxylase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biogenic Amines/*metabolism', 'Brain/cytology/metabolism', 'Catecholamines/metabolism', 'Digestive System/enzymology', 'Endocrine Glands/cytology/*metabolism', 'Intestinal Mucosa/cytology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Lung/cytology/metabolism', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Neurons, Afferent/cytology/*metabolism', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Tryptophan/metabolism', 'Tryptophan Hydroxylase/metabolism']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Histol Cytol. 1989;52 Suppl:69-74. doi: 10.1679/aohc.52.suppl_69.,"['Department of Biochemistry, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Japan.']",,,['10.1679/aohc.52.suppl_69 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Since many of the MMA type had the same organic side chain at the 7-position as previously prepared MMC analogues it was of interest to see if the biological effects of MMCs could predict for those of MMAs. Using the P388 leukemia model it was possible to compare the activity of 27 matched pairs and the potency of 24 pairs. It was found that antitumor effects did not correlate but that MMAs were significantly more potent than MMCs. These findings were duplicated in tests of 7 pairs against subcutaneously implanted B16 melanoma. We conclude that any MMA derivative would have a high likelihood of being more potent than its MMC equivalent but that its antitumor effects must be independently determined since they cannot be predicted from the results with MMC analogs.,"['Bradner, W T', 'Remers, W A', 'Vyas, D M']","['Bradner WT', 'Remers WA', 'Vyas DM']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Mitomycins)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Melanoma, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mitomycin', 'Mitomycins/*therapeutic use', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1989 Jul-Aug;9(4):1095-9.,"['Pharmaceutical Research and Development Division, Bristol-Myers Company, Syracuse NY 13221-4755.']",,,,,,,,16,,,,,,,

When applied individually, IFN gamma and the drugs inhibited in a dose-dependent manner HL60 cell colony formation in semisolid culture. Moreover, IFN gamma or the cytotoxic drugs dose-dependently reduced the colony formation of CGL progenitor cell in agar. When added in combination, IFN gamma potentiated synergistically the inhibitory action of 5-FU in both systems. The most pronounced potentiation was detected at concentrations of 0.5 microgram/ml 5-FU and 50 U/ml IFN gamma. On the contrary, the antiproliferative effect of Ara-C was enhanced only subadditively when combined with IFN gamma. In view of the present findings, which are supported by new evidence from the literature, the use of 5-FU in leukemia should be reconsidered.

We observed instances of arterial thrombosis in two studies of breast cancer involving multiagent chemotherapy for stages II and III disease. Our purpose in this study was to determine the incidence of this complication and whether it appeared to be related to the chemotherapy or was a random event. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Episodes of arterial thrombotic events were identified from record reviews of 1,014 assessable patients with breast cancer entered on two Cancer and Leukemia Group B protocols. Details of the kind of arterial event, when it occurred, the outcome, and the occurrence of metastases were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirteen (1.3%) patients had an arterial thrombosis: six (5.3%) of 113 patients with stage III disease and seven (0.8%) of 901 patients with stage II disease. Four of these patients had a peripheral arterial thrombosis and nine had strokes (four were fatal). All these events occurred while the patients were receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Only one additional arterial event (a stroke approximately four years later) has occurred in this patient group after chemotherapy was completed. CONCLUSION: Arterial thrombosis is also associated with multiagent chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. The mechanism is unknown.","['Wall, J G', 'Weiss, R B', 'Norton, L', 'Perloff, M', 'Rice, M A', 'Korzun, A H', 'Wood, W C']","['Wall JG', 'Weiss RB', 'Norton L', 'Perloff M', 'Rice MA', 'Korzun AH', 'Wood WC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)', '9JU12S4YFY (Fluoxymesterone)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'CAFVP protocol', 'CMFVP protocol', 'TAVH protocol']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Arterial Occlusive Diseases/epidemiology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders/epidemiology', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Doxorubicin', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil', 'Fluoxymesterone', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone', 'Thiotepa', 'Thrombosis/*chemically induced/complications/epidemiology', 'Vinblastine', 'Vincristine']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1989 Nov;87(5):501-4. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9343(89)80604-7.,"['Section of Medical Oncology, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, D.C. 20307.']","['CA 04457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 12011/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 26806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,"['S0002-9343(89)80604-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9343(89)80604-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Transient CAT expression from these constructs in several types of cells was employed to examine the role of the promoter sequence in the regulation of DQ beta gene expression. The DQ beta constructs drove CAT expression in Raji cells (human Burkitt lymphoma cells) to at least 25-fold or 50-fold higher levels than in Hela cells (human cervical carcinoma cells) or Jurkat cells (human T-leukemia cells), respectively. A short promoter sequence of -160 bp containing the conserved X and Y sequences was sufficient for expression in Raji cells, and deletion to -106 bp which interrupted the X sequence abolished the expression. Sequences further upstream to -160 bp as far as -2500 bp which included an Ig-like octamer appeared to have no effect on expression in Raji cells. Thus, the promoter up to -160 bp has all of the sequences required for B cell specific expression of CAT in this assay. CAT expression from the 5' deletion constructs introduced into RJ2.2.5 and 6.1.6 cells (class II-negative mutant B cells lines) was also examined.

Aphidicolin.,557-64,"Irradiated L51 78Y-S cells (LY-S) were characterized by an exponential survival curve and the potentiation effect of split--dose irradiation. Previously we showed [13] that in LY-S cells the reduction of DNA replicative synthesis rate affected the balance between the fixation and repair of sublethal damage (SLD) and of potentially lethal damage (PLD) in favor of repair. We report here that a block of DNA synthesis by aphidicolin (APC), an inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha, was sufficient to protect LY-S cells from fixation of PLD and SLD induced by X-rays. Treatment with APC 0.5 micrograms/ml for 2 h, efficiently inhibited DNA replication (95%) with minimal effect on survival. Inhibition of DNA synthesis by combined irradiation and APC was not significantly different from APC treatment alone. The level of protection by APC was dependent on the length of time between irradiation and APC application. An opposite effect was observed when the drug treatment had proceeded irradiation: The killing effect of X-ray increased. The effect of aphidicolin treatment remained even after removal of APC and was dependent on the drug concentration and time between drug removal and irradiation. These results are interpreted as indicating that X-ray damage was fixed in LY-S cells, because of their lack of ability to maintain the nucleotide pool balance, and that fixation took place during progression through the cell cycle.","['Kapiszewska, M', 'Lange, C S']","['Kapiszewska M', 'Lange CS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aphidicolin', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*radiation effects', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L5178/genetics', 'Mice', 'Radiation Tolerance/*drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/*radiation effects']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neoplasma. 1989;36(5):557-64.,"['Institute of Molecular Biology, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Report of 16 cases and review of the literature.",321-35,"This review underscores the diversity of the clinical manifestations and hematopathological features of gamma heavy chain disease based on the detailed report of 16 patients evaluated in our chemical department, the analysis of 12 cases diagnosed in our laboratory, and the study of 81 cases previously reported. This condition is defined by the presence in the serum of immunoglobulin molecules composed of deleted gamma heavy chains devoid of light chains. The production by the monoclonal B cells of these peculiar proteins appears to result from multiple defects (deletions, insertions, and mutations) in both heavy and light chain genes leading to abnormal mRNA splicing. Gamma heavy chain disease is currently underdiagnosed. The diagnosis established by immunoelectrophoresis using specific antisera combined, in some instances, with the immunoselection procedure, can easily be missed on serum electrophoretic patterns: a narrow abnormal band suggestive of a monoclonal component was found in only 10 of our 28 cases. The amount of heavy chain disease protein in urine ranges from trace to 20 g/day and is usually moderate. Gamma heavy chain disease most often presents as a lymphoproliferative disorder featured by lymphadenopathies, splenomegaly, and constitutional symptoms. Extra-hematopoietic tumor localizations, such as cutaneous or subcutaneous involvement or thyroid tumor, may occur. Autoimmune disorders, notably rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenic purpura, are frequent (26% of cases). There is no specific histological pattern. The most frequent is a pleomorphic malignant lymphoplasmacytic proliferation mainly seen in bone marrow and lymph nodes. Some cases present with a predominantly plasmacytic proliferation or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Other patients are affected with non-Hodgkin lymphoma of various morphologic types. Immunocytologic studies showed that a gamma heavy chain disease protein may occur in the context of a double monoclonal lymphoproliferative process or in various B or T cell malignancies that are not directly involved in the production of the abnormal immunoglobulin. In some patients, the histologic appearance of the enlarged lymphoid organs showed only a moderate lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of uncertain malignancy. More important, some patients showed no evidence of an underlying lymphoproliferative disorder after several years of follow-up. The clinical course of gamma heavy chain disease varies from an asymptomatic state to a rapidly progressive malignancy. The choice of therapy should entirely rely on the underlying clinicopathologic features, without taking into account the presence of the abnormal protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Fermand, J P', 'Brouet, J C', 'Danon, F', 'Seligmann, M']","['Fermand JP', 'Brouet JC', 'Danon F', 'Seligmann M']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,['0 (Immunoglobulin gamma-Chains)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Heavy Chain Disease/blood/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoelectrophoresis', 'Immunoglobulin gamma-Chains/analysis', 'Lymphoid Tissue/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 1989 Nov;68(6):321-35.,"['Department of Immunohematology, INSERM U 108, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",,,,,,,,100,,,,,,,

Both types of clones differentiated with interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) and dexamethasone, whereas the D-factor/LIF resistant clone, but not the D-factor/LIF susceptible clone, was induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to differentiate to mature macrophages.

Appropriate non-treated controls were also included. Numerous tumors were observed in many organs including the hematopoietic system, digestive tract, nervous system, Zymbal's gland (auditory sebaceous glands) and peritoneal mesothelium. However, no tumor-enhancing effects of beraprost sodium were observed. In contrast, the groups treated with PNU demonstrated increased development of tumors in the tongue, forestomach, large intestine and Zymbal's gland. These results thus indicate that beraprost sodium is not capable of modulating the development of MNU-induced tumors.","['Kurata, Y', 'Hagiwara, A', 'Tamano, S', 'Shibata, M', 'Tanaka, H', 'Yamada, M', 'Ito, H', 'Fukushima, S']","['Kurata Y', 'Hagiwara A', 'Tamano S', 'Shibata M', 'Tanaka H', 'Yamada M', 'Ito H', 'Fukushima S']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,J Toxicol Sci,The Journal of toxicological sciences,7805798,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '35E3NJJ4O6 (beraprost)', '684-93-5 (Methylnitrosourea)', '816-57-9 (propylnitrosourea)', 'DCR9Z582X0 (Epoprostenol)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Carcinogens', 'Digestive System Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Drug Synergism', 'Epoprostenol', 'Leukemia, Experimental/chemically induced', 'Male', '*Methylnitrosourea', 'Nervous System Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Nitrosourea Compounds', 'Peritoneal Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Sebaceous Gland Neoplasms/chemically induced']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Toxicol Sci. 1989 Aug;14 Suppl 1:1-39. doi: 10.2131/jts.14.supplementi_1.,"['Daiyu-kai Institute of Medical Science, Aichi, Japan.']",,,['10.2131/jts.14.supplementi_1 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

These results may suggest the possible role of activation of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in VP-16-induced nucleotide pool changes and subsequent interphase death.","['Tanizawa, A', 'Kubota, M', 'Hashimoto, H', 'Shimizu, T', 'Takimoto, T', 'Kitoh, T', 'Akiyama, Y', 'Mikawa, H']","['Tanizawa A', 'Kubota M', 'Hashimoto H', 'Shimizu T', 'Takimoto T', 'Kitoh T', 'Akiyama Y', 'Mikawa H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Nucleoside Diphosphate Sugars)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (poly(ADP)-ribosylated proteins)', '26656-46-2 (Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8J365YF1YH (3-aminobenzamide)', 'C137DTR5RG (Theophylline)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interphase/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nucleoside Diphosphate Sugars/*biosynthesis', 'Nucleotides/*metabolism', 'Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Theophylline/pharmacology', 'Thymidine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1989 Nov;185(1):237-46. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(89)90052-9.,"['Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto University, Japan.']",,,"['0014-4827(89)90052-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(89)90052-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormalities affecting chromosome 11, which is believed to be the site of the TK gene, were not observed in cells from UC colonies. Abnormalities affecting chromosome 11 were observed only in cells from sigma-TFTr colonies irrespective of whether they were spontaneous (5/15 colonies) or induced by HYC (4/15 colonies). Overall, 30% (9/30) of sigma-TFTr colonies had cells with an abnormal chromosome 11 and 10% (3/30) had abnormalities affecting other chromosomes. Abnormalities affecting chromosome 11 were not observed in cells from lambda-TFTr colonies (0/30 colonies). The observation of only 30% of sigma-TFTr colonies with chromosome damage affecting chromosome 11 indicates that other mechanisms, in addition to chromosome damage at the level of resolution used in this study (i.e., 200-300 chromosome bands). contribute to small TFTr colony size.","['Blazak, W F', 'Los, F J', 'Rudd, C J', 'Caspary, W J']","['Blazak WF', 'Los FJ', 'Rudd CJ', 'Caspary WJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Mutagens)', '2BXX5EVN2A (Hycanthone)', '30922-68-0 (hycanthone methanesulfonate)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'RMW9V5RW38 (Trifluridine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/toxicity', 'Hycanthone/analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Leukemia L5178/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests', '*Mutagens', 'Mutation', 'Thymidine', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Trifluridine/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1989 Oct;224(2):197-208. doi: 10.1016/0165-1218(89)90156-0.,"['Cellular and Genetic Toxicology Department, SRI International, Menlo Park, CA 94025.']",,,"['0165-1218(89)90156-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1218(89)90156-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The leukocyte count was 20,100/microliters with 70% segmented neutrophils and 12% band forms. A myelogram showed marked myeloid hyperplasia and plasmacytosis (5.9%). Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase score, serum lysozyme and vitamin B12 levels were elevated. Cytogenetic analysis of the marrow aspirate showed normal karyotype, with no Philadelphia chromosome. Total serum protein (TP) was 7.5 g/dl with increased beta-globulin (23.5%), identified as monoclonal IgA kappa (3.3 g/dl) on immunoelectrophoresis. No activity of G-CSF was detected in the serum. A retrospective study revealed that the beta-globulin level was normal (6.3%, TP 6.9 g/dl) in 1980 and that it was slightly increased (11.6%, TP 7.0 g/dl) without leukocytosis (5,900/microliter) in 1981.

The leukocyte count was 18.1 x 10(9)/l with 72% abnormal cells. Neither anemia nor thrombocytopenia was present. Many abnormal cells and erythroblasts were seen in the bone marrow. These abnormal cells had irregular nuclei but no granules in the cytoplasm.

The patient was diagnosed as having T-CLL with mild autoimmune hemolysis and was followed without treatment. Seven months later, the leukemia cells of peripheral blood increased to 62.6 X 10(9)/l and the frank autoimmune hemolytic anemia developed. After prednisolone, vincristine and cyclophosphamide were administered, leukemia cells of blood decreased. Anemia with reticulocytopenia, however, persisted and direct Coombs test became negative. In the bone marrow at that time, many neutrophils and megakaryocytes besides leukemia cells were preserved, but erythroblasts were hardly seen, namely a pattern of red cell hypoplasia was observed. The patient deteriorated rapidly and died 26 months after initial recognition of lymphocytosis. When complement was added, the patient's serum obtained during red cell hypoplasia but not during autoimmune hemolysis inhibited BFU-E and CFU-GM in in vitro colony assays.

The UVC sensitivity is related to the excision repair ability. Benzamide (Bz), an inhibitor of adenosine diphosphoribosyl transferase (ADPRT), does not modify the lethal effect of UVC radiation in L5178Y-R cells, whereas it sensitizes L5178Y-S cells. The content of NAD+ after irradiation decreases only in the latter cells and this decrease can be prevented by 2 mM Bz treatment. In agreement with the survival data, in L5178Y-R cells neither the proportion of abnormal cells nor the frequency of chromatid aberration are affected by 2 mM Bz treatment, in contrast with L5178Y-S cells. Bz slightly reverses inhibition of 3H-thymidine incorporation only in L5178Y-S cells, but it does not affect the proportions of cells in the different phases of the cell cycle in either cell strain after UVC exposure. These data could be taken as an indirect indication of the involvement of ADPRT in DNA repair in UVC-irradiated L5178Y-S cells.

Vitamin D therefore is not strictly a vitamin. A deficiency of vitamin D ultimately results in osteomalacia in adults and rickets in children, and provision of sunlight or small oral doses of the vitamin can cure this bone condition. There are, however, many less common conditions in which small doses of the vitamin are ineffective, whereas larger doses of vitamin D can achieve healing of the bone disease. These conditions are collectively called vitamin D-resistant diseases and include hypoparathyroidism, genetic and acquired hypophosphataemic osteomalacias, renal osteodystrophy, vitamin D-dependent rickets, and the osteomalacia associated with liver disease and intestinal malabsorption. Unfortunately, large doses of vitamin D continue to be prescribed for a wide variety of diseases in which there is little scientific evidence of their efficacy. The benefits and dangers of high doses of vitamin D are discussed and the problems arising from inappropriate or poorly supervised treatment with vitamin D presented. The serum concentration of the active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D is increased in certain disease states, and the pathophysiology of some these diseases are presented. The exciting developments in tumour differentiation and the role of high doses of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D for the control of leukaemia and other blood and skin diseases are discussed.","['Davies, M']",['Davies M'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Canada,Int J Vitam Nutr Res Suppl,International journal for vitamin and nutrition research.

Cellulitis at onset was seen in 35% of the episodes. Most sites of infection did not become apparent until one to three days after the onset of fever, probably because of depressed inflammatory response associated with severe granulocytopenia.

Interleukin-1 (IL-1) was not detected by co-mitogenic thymocyte assays of crude supernates. Isoelectrofocusing of concentrated medium showed that all biologically active IL-1 migrated at a pH of 6.8-7.2, indicating that the major secreted form was IL-1 beta. Double antibody ELISA confirmed the presence of IL-1 beta, but failed to detect IL-1 alpha in isofocused fractions. Although it appeared that THP-1 cells do not secrete IL-1 alpha; an inhibitor of thymocyte response to IL-1 was present in conditioned medium, migrated in an acidic pH range and masked the expression of biologically active rIL-1 alpha and rIL-1 beta. In contrast, IL-1 alpha was detected using a cell blotting assay. This technique permitted visualization of subpicogram levels of IL-1 when secreted by cells attached to an immunoblotting paper. Cell blotting showed that a greater proportion of attached cells incubated for 24 h in medium containing mezerein and IFN-gamma secreted IL-1 than cells in control medium. In conclusion, the amount of immunoreactive or biologically active IL-1 alpha secreted by stimulated THP-1 cells appeared to be much lower than that reported for human peripheral blood monocytes.","['Gaffney, E V', 'Stoner, C R', 'Lingenfelter, S E', 'Wagner, L A']","['Gaffney EV', 'Stoner CR', 'Lingenfelter SE', 'Wagner LA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Terpenes)', '34807-41-5 (mezerein)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['*Diterpenes', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Terpenes/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1989 Sep 1;122(2):211-8. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(89)90266-4.,"['Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park 16802.']","['CA44677/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45143/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0022-1759(89)90266-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(89)90266-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore conducted a retrospective study on the presence of HIV-1 antibodies among 91 acute leukemia patients diagnosed between 1978 and 1985, before the onset of routine tests for HIV-1 contamination of blood products. The transfusion requirement (platelet units, red blood cell concentrates) involved almost 7,000 donors. We did not find any case of seropositivity in patients transfused with units from the donor pool. The only case of HIV-1 seropositivity was due to a bone marrow transplant donor, retrospectively found to be HIV-1 seropositive. These results differ from the American data previously cited. This is probably due both to differences in diffusion of the HIV-1 infection in the two countries and to differences in the selection of the two donor populations.

The octanol:phosphate buffered saline partition coefficient of thiotepa was 2.4 +/- 0.1 (n = 8). With this value, the permeability coefficient (P) for thiotepa was estimated to be between 2.8 X 10(-4) and 1.81 X 10(-3) cm/s and the half-life of accumulation of thiotepa by L1210 cells was estimated to be 0.063-0.40 s. Thiotepa accumulation by cells was measured after incubation of cell with [14C]thiotepa and subsequent harvesting of cells by centrifugation through silicone fluid. Thiotepa accumulation by L1210 cells was biphasic. The initial phase was rapid essentially complete by 10 s. The amount of cell-associated 14C increased linearly with increasing extracellular concentrations of thiotepa or with increasing size of the cell pellet. The absolute amount of cell-associated 14C was consistent with that expected if the [14C]thiotepa had been evenly distributed in the incubation medium and a volume equal to that of the cell pellet had been sampled and counted. This rapid phase of thiotepa accumulation was not slowed when cells were incubated on ice. The second phase of [14C]thiotepa accumulation occurred at a rate much slower than that of the initial phase. This slower phase of drug accumulation was linear for at least 5 h. The rate of 14C accumulation increased progressively over a range of extracellular thiotepa concentrations between 5 and 100 nmol/ml and could not be saturated under acceptable tissue culture conditions. The slower rate of 14C accumulation was ablated by incubation cells on ice and was reduced by 30-50% in the presence of 1 mM sodium azide or 2,4-dinitrophenol. The slow rate of accumulation of 14C reflected summation of a relatively stable or constant amount of exchangeable 14C an an amount of nonexchangeable 14C which increased linearly from almost undetectable levels at the start of the experiment to amounts approximately equal to those of exchangeable radioactivity after 5 h. The initial association of [14C]thiotepa with both human and avian RBCs was also very rapid. Avian RBCs also exhibited a slow rate of 14C accumulation which was linear for at least 5 h which was 15-20% that of L1210 cells.

Like the phorbol ester 12-0-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA), bryostatin 1 activates protein kinase C (PKC), which plays a central role in the phosphatidylinositol signal transduction pathway. The effects of bryostatin 1 alone and in combination with TPA or with the calcium mobilizing ionophore A23187 were assessed by morphological appearance, cell adherence and aggregation, RNA and DNA synthesis, and immunoglobulin (Ig) production. While eight of nine B-CLL cultures remained proliferatively inert, bryostatin 1 could effectively trigger activation and differentiation of B-CLL cells in all cases as inferred by the induction of morphological changes, RNA synthesis, and monotypic Ig production. Addition of calcium ionophore A23187 to bryostatin 1-exposed cells resulted in significantly increased values for RNA synthesis and Ig production and in the acquisition of plasmacytoid morphology. Bryostatin 1 and the dual signal of bryostatin 1 plus A23187 mimicked the stimulatory action of TPA and the combination of TPA plus A23187, respectively. Overall, bryostatin 1 was less active than equivalent concentrations of TPA. This lesser efficacy may, however, reflect a quantitative rather than qualitative difference. Bryostatin 1 partially antagonized TPA-mediated effects on B-CLL cells suggesting different modes of action by the two activators. These studies indicate that bryostatin 1 has effective differentiation-inducing properties on B-CLL cells that can differentiation-inducing properties on B-CLL cells that can be accentuated by a calcium ionophore.","['Drexler, H G', 'Gignac, S M', 'Jones, R A', 'Scott, C S', 'Pettit, G R', 'Hoffbrand, A V']","['Drexler HG', 'Gignac SM', 'Jones RA', 'Scott CS', 'Pettit GR', 'Hoffbrand AV']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Bryostatins', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Aggregation/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/biosynthesis', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology/drug effects']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1989 Oct;74(5):1747-57.,"['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, Hampstead, London.']",['CA-16049-07-12/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['S0006-4971(20)75691-0 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This translocation deregulates bcl-2 gene expression by placing it into immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IgH). We have recently reported a case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL 1446) carrying a unique bcl-2 gene rearrangement with the immunoglobulin lambda light chain (Ig lambda) gene. This juxtaposition of the bcl-2 and Ig lambda genes resembles a variant chromosome translocation in Burkitt's lymphoma, although karyotype data of CLL 1446 is not available. In this paper, we completed the structural analysis of the bcl-2/Ig lambda gene rearrangement in CLL 1446 by cloning the corresponding partner of the rearrangement. This revealed that the juxtaposition of the bcl-2 and Ig lambda genes is a result of a reciprocal chromosome translocation between chromosomes 18 and 22 with deletions of 2 and 15 bp, respectively. Although a conserved immunoglobulin recombination signal (7mer-9mer) was absent around the breakpoint on chromosome 18, nonamer-like sequence was recognized within the deleted region at the breakpoint on chromosome 22. No extranucleotide was associated with both joining sites of the t(18;22) translocation. This is in sharp contrast to the t(14;18) translocation involving IgH locus in which the presence of extranucleotides is common and correlates well with the presence and absence of extranucleotides on V-(D)-J joining of IgH and light chain (L) genes, respectively. The data together suggest that the mechanism responsible for the physiological rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes is involved in this translocation.","['Adachi, M', 'Tsujimoto, Y']","['Adachi M', 'Tsujimoto Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'DNA/analysis', 'Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1989 Sep;4(9):1073-5.,"['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Investigation of serial plasma samples in 7 patients who received deoxycoformycin (DCF) and 11 patients treated with interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) showed a normalization of sCD8 levels and a decrease of sIL2R concentrations in those patients who showed hematological improvement. Normalization of sIL2R was, however, only observed in patients with complete remission. Our observation indicates that splenectomy might cause a reduction of the activation of suppressor/cytotoxic cells in patients with HCL.

The following results were obtained: 1. Cultured broth of P. aeruginosa was detected most sensitively by this assay followed by sonicated soluble antigen, washed bacterial fluid and heated soluble antigen of P. aeruginosa. The lower limit of detection was approximately 2.3 X 10(4) cfu/ml of P. aeruginosa (NC-5 strain) (containing 22.2 ng/ml of protein) in cultured broth. 2. By this assay, all serotypes of P. aeruginosa and some strains of Family Pseudomonadaceae (RNA group I) were detected, but no cross reaction was noticed to other species of bacteria (24 species, 268 strains). 3. The serum antigen in the experimental sepsis of P. aeruginosa or murine experimental pneumonia was detected when at least approximately 10(3) cfu/ml of P. aeruginosa was present in serum or BALF. But the antigen was detected from concentrated urine even under the concentration of 10(2) cfu/ml in sepsis. 4. P. aeruginosa antigens in sputum of patients with chronic respiratory tract infection was also detected. There was a significant difference between absorbance value of sputum in non-infected patients (group 1) and one in infected patients by P. aeruginosa (group 3) (p less than 0.01). And there was a strong correlation between absorbance value of sputum in Group 3 and number of P. aeruginosa. In 22 of 33 sputa (66.7%) with P. aeruginosa infection as verified by conventional culture methods, the antigen was detected in sputum. In a patient of P. aeruginosa pneumonia with acute leukemia, the antigen was detectable from sputum and one of the series of concentrated urine. It is concluded that the detection of P. aeruginosa antigen in sputum and urine by ELISA is a helpful aid to diagnose P. aeruginosa infection.","['Doutsu, Y']",['Doutsu Y'],['jpn'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Kansenshogaku Zasshi,Kansenshogaku zasshi.

The culture supernatants contained significant levels of IL-1 which were consistently higher than those in the cell cultures stimulated with an optimal concentration of LPS. This finding extends to a macrophage cell line, P388D1, and peritoneal exudate cells stimulated with starch in vivo. However, the level of IL-1 produced was significantly reduced when the cells were preincubated with a lymphokine preparation (supernatant of Con A-stimulated rat spleen cells). The level of IL-1 produced seems to be directly correlated with the degree of parasitization of the macrophages. A similar and dose-dependent reduction in IL-1 production by infected macrophages could also be obtained when the cells were preincubated with IFN-gamma. This finding is in direct contrast to that of visceral leishmaniasis in which peritoneal macrophages from BALB/c mice infected with Leishmania donovani not only fail to produce IL-1 but also lose the capacity to produce IL-1. This apparent discrepancy is discussed in terms of a possible difference in the induction of cell-mediated immunity between the two leishmanial diseases.","['Cillari, E', 'Dieli, M', 'Maltese, E', 'Milano, S', 'Salerno, A', 'Liew, F Y']","['Cillari E', 'Dieli M', 'Maltese E', 'Milano S', 'Salerno A', 'Liew FY']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (concanavalin A-induced helper factors)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Leishmania tropica/immunology', 'Leishmaniasis/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*metabolism/parasitology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1989/09/15 00:00,1989/09/15 00:01,['1989/09/15 00:00'],"['1989/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Sep 15;143(6):2001-5.,"['Institute of General Pathology, University of Palermo, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By itself, TNF causes ML-1 to differentiate along the monocytic pathway. The cells exhibit an increase in Fc receptors and acquire the morphological characteristics of maturing phenotype. They remain viable and continue to proliferate (at greater than or equal to 50% of the control growth rate) even with 10(2)-10(4) units/ml TNF. IFN alone has similar effects, causing an increase in Fc receptors but little cytotoxicity. In contrast to either cytokine alone, the combination of TNF plus IFN causes a cessation of proliferation and extensive cell death. Cytotoxicity occurs in a synergistic fashion; it requires the simultaneous presence of both cytokines, occurring with concurrent but not sequential exposure. These different responses, differentiation (TNF alone) and cytotoxicity (TNF + IFN), occur with a similar range of doses (approximately 10(2)-10(4) units/ml) and in a similar time frame (beginning on day 2). In other cell types, IFN can augment either the differentiation-inducing or the cytotoxic effect of TNF.

The commonly used criteria for the diagnosis, except for the level of the increase in platelet count, are usually those fixed by the Polycythemia Vera Study Group. The average age of onset is around 60 years, both sexes being affected. The symptoms frequently present at diagnosis are related to microcirculatory disturbances (palms, soles, fingers). Neurological symptoms are often observed. Thrombotic complications of the large vessels are less frequent. Haemorrhagic problems are present in about 30% of patients. Bleeding time is normal in most cases, whereas platelet aggregation abnormalities are frequently found. Nil adrenaline aggregation is the most discriminative test. The clinical course is characterized by long intervals without any symptoms; thromboembolic or haemorrhagic episodes can, however, occur, mainly in uncontrolled ET. Development of terminal acute leukaemia has been reported in 34 cases. The expression of the influence of the treatments, 32P or alkylating agents, is very strong. The treatment of ET has to take in consideration the difficult compromise between balancing the necessity of preventing complications and the effects of drug toxicity. The use of recombinant alpha-interferon has recently been proposed and is under investigation. The pathogenesis of thrombocytosis in ET seems to involve an expansion in the megakaryocyte progenitor cell pool. Platelet membrane glycoprotein abnormalities and defective glycosylation of thrombospondin have been shown. Numerous other platelet abnormalities, including decreased alpha-adrenergic receptors, loss of PGD2 receptors and increased Fc receptors, have been reported. Arachidonic metabolism seems to be abnormal and lipoxygenase is defective. Most of the platelet abnormalities seem to be the result of intrinsic defects at the level of an abnormal clone of megakaryocytes. However, causal relationships between the platelet abnormalities and bleeding or thrombosis are not yet clearly demonstrated.","['Tobelem, G']",['Tobelem G'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)']",IM,"['Arachidonic Acid', 'Arachidonic Acids/metabolism', 'Blood Platelets/metabolism', 'Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Humans', '*Thrombocythemia, Essential/diagnosis/physiopathology/therapy', 'Thrombosis/etiology']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1989 Jul;2(3):719-28. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(89)80040-x.,,,,['10.1016/s0950-3536(89)80040-x [doi]'],,,,,45,,,,,,,

Using arachidonic acid (AA) as substrate, enzymes rates declined at high substrate concentrations (greater than 25 microM) and were associated with pronounced lag phases. The concentrations of AA at which apparent substrate inhibition and lag phases were observed were comparable with those at which AA induced emulsion formation in aqueous media. No evidence for substrate inhibition or lag phases was observed using eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a more soluble substrate which did not induce emulsion formation at concentrations up to 100 microM. Reactions catalysed by RBL-1 5-lipoxygenase terminated before exhaustion of substrate. AA and EPA induced time-dependent enzyme inactivation at concentrations 100-fold lower than their apparent Km values for the enzyme. The ability of several fatty acids to induce time-dependent inactivation was directly proportional to their substrate potency. We conclude that apparent substrate inhibition is a consequence of a change from monomeric to micellar substrate which has a lower affinity for the enzyme and that premature termination of the enzyme reactions is a consequence of product-induced enzyme inactivation.","['McMillan, R M', 'Masters, D J', 'Vickers, V C', 'Dicken, M P', 'Jacobs, V N']","['McMillan RM', 'Masters DJ', 'Vickers VC', 'Dicken MP', 'Jacobs VN']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Arachidonate Lipoxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/*metabolism', 'Arachidonate Lipoxygenases/*metabolism', 'Arachidonic Acid', 'Arachidonic Acids/metabolism', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Solubility', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/09/25 00:00,1989/09/25 00:01,['1989/09/25 00:00'],"['1989/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1989 Sep 25;1005(2):170-6. doi: 10.1016/0005-2760(89)90183-5.,"['Bioscience Department I, ICI Pharmaceuticals, Macclesfield, U.K.']",,,"['0005-2760(89)90183-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2760(89)90183-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

FACS analysis showed that low H-2 expressing YAC-1 markedly increased H-2 Kk, Dd and beta-2 microglobulin (beta 2m) induction on the cell surface after intracerebral (i.c.) passage, while there was no change in phenotypical expression of both A. H-2- and beta 2m-. Southern and Northern blot analyses revealed that the enhancement of H-2 class I expression in YAC-1 was due to transcriptional control of H-2 DNA genes. beta 2m- was confirmed to lack beta 2m- gene, causing cell surface H-2 negative expression. Immunoprecipitation method showed that, despite increase in mRNA of the H-2 gene, A. H-2- disclosed no class I H-2 expression because of the incapability of intracellular association of polypeptides between H-2 and beta 2m in the post-translational level. The H-2 class I expression on YAC-1 cells could also be induced by interferon gamma (IFN) in a dose-dependent manner in the range of 1 to 100 U/ml. At 100 U/ml, the H-2 inducing effect, regulated at the transcriptional level, was comparable to that observed after i.c. passage. In contrast, the A.

Nineteen patients were subsequently treated with chemotherapy and 17 with transplantation. Cost accounting began with induction chemotherapy and extended over a five-year period. Costs were estimated by means of a resource-based, multivariate prediction model. The transplantation and chemotherapy groups had virtually equivalent use of resources (hospital days, laboratory tests, blood products, and radiologic and operative procedures) over five years, except for a 10-fold increase in the use of the intensive care unit for the patients who underwent transplantation (P less than 0.001). The total costs over five years were estimated at $193,000 per patient for transplantation and $136,000 per patient for chemotherapy (P = 0.02). At five years, the costs per year of life saved (""life-year"") were nearly equal ($62,500 per life-year for transplantation vs. $64,000 per life-year for chemotherapy) because of the better rate of disease-free survival in patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation.

These monoclonal antibody cocktails were drug conjugated and administered intravenously. Seventeen out of twenty-four patients had reactions to the administration of Adriamycin immunoconjugates, but these were tolerable in all but two patients. Fever, chills, pruritus and skin rash were by far the most common transitory reactions. All were well controlled with premedication. In several patients it was demonstrated that there was limited antigenic drift among various biopsies within the same patient over time. Up to 1 gram of Adriamycin and up to 5 grams of monoclonal antibody were administered. The limiting factor appeared to be a variable dissociation of active Adriamycin from the antibody which unpredictably caused hemopoietic depression. Similar findings were noted in 19 patients with mitomycin-C conjugates. Thrombocytopenia at a 60mg dose of mitomycin-C in this schedule was dose limiting. Preliminary serological evidence suggests that the development of an IgM antibody which is specific against the mouse monoclonal antibody has the specificity and sensitivity to predict clinical reactions. These antibodies were quantitatively less in mitomycin-C patients. Selected patients were re-treated. One patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia had re-treatment on three occasions and demonstrated regression of peripheral lymph nodes. Two patients with breast carcinoma had definite improvement in ulcerating skin lesions and two patients with tongue carcinoma had shrinkage of their lesions. No responses were seen with mitomycin-C conjugates but binding was noted to tumors and colon with likely drug induced colitis seen after colon binding. This study demonstrates the feasibility and illustrates technical considerations in preparing drug immunoconjugate cocktails for patients with refractory malignancies. Cocktail formulation and antibody delivery was accomplished. The major technical hurdle appears to be the selection of effective conjugation methods that can be used to optimally bind drugs to monoclonal antibodies for targeted cancer therapy.","['Oldham, R K', 'Lewis, M', 'Orr, D W', 'Liao, S K', 'Ogden, J R', 'Hubbard, W H', 'Birch, R']","['Oldham RK', 'Lewis M', 'Orr DW', 'Liao SK', 'Ogden JR', 'Hubbard WH', 'Birch R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Biol Markers,The International journal of biological markers,8712411,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Mitomycins)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/therapy', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/therapy', 'Male', 'Melanoma/drug therapy/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mitomycin', 'Mitomycins/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Tongue Neoplasms/drug therapy/therapy']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Biol Markers. 1989 Apr-Jun;4(2):65-77.,"['Williamson Medical Center, Franklin, TN.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: The outbreak strain was characterised by five different typing methods. Surveillance of patients, staff, and environment was carried out during the outbreak and five months after control measures were introduced. SETTING: A unit with 10 beds for adults with leukaemia and patients receiving bone marrow transplants. The outbreak occurred during a trial of ciprofloxacin for empirical treatment of neutropenic fevers. INTERVENTIONS: Ciprofloxacin was withdrawn from use in the unit and daily bathing with chlorhexidine gluconate solution started. Main outcome measure--The absence of bacteraemia due to the outbreak strain for five months after control measures. RESULTS: During the study 49 patients developed 21 episodes of bacteraemia due to the outbreak strain, which was ciprofloxacin resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration greater than or equal to 128 mg/l), susceptible to phage 155 A9C, and SII biotype and had characteristic immunoblot and DNA fingerprint features. There was a high amount of colonisation of patients but not staff with this strain, which was also wide spread in the environment. The control measures led to rapid resolution of the outbreak and disappearance of the strain from the unit. CONCLUSIONS: In areas where coagulase negative staphylococcal infections are common doctors must be aware of the possibility of cross infection with single strain, and the availability of more discriminatory methods of typing will facilitate the identification and control of such episodes.","['Oppenheim, B A', 'Hartley, J W', 'Lee, W', 'Burnie, J P']","['Oppenheim BA', 'Hartley JW', 'Lee W', 'Burnie JP']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,"['0 (Coagulase)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)']",IM,"['Cancer Care Facilities', 'Ciprofloxacin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Coagulase', 'Cross Infection/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Disease Outbreaks/*prevention & control', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Hospital Units', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Neutropenia/drug therapy', 'Sepsis/*microbiology', 'Staphylococcal Infections/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Staphylococcus/drug effects/enzymology/*isolation & purification']",1989/07/29 00:00,1989/07/29 00:01,['1989/07/29 00:00'],"['1989/07/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/29 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,BMJ. 1989 Jul 29;299(6694):294-7. doi: 10.1136/bmj.299.6694.294.,"['Department of Microbiology, Withington Hospital, Manchester.']",,PMC1837150,['10.1136/bmj.299.6694.294 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

During the period since Hinley Point began operations--that is, 1964-86--there were 19 cases in the area compared with 10.4 expected from national rates, giving a standardised registration ratio of 1.82 (95% confidence interval 1.10 to 2.85). The incidence in the rest of Somerset was also high, however (standardised registration ratio 1.18; 95% confidence interval 0.98 to 1.41), and the high rate around Hinkley Point may simply have been reflecting the high local incidence (ratio of the two standardised registration ratio's 1.54; 95% confidence interval 0.90 to 2.52). Analysis of predetermined five year periods showed that the excess cases in the Hinkley Point area were concentrated in the 10 years 1964-73 after commissioning of the station, at a time when rates in the rest of Somerset were close to the national average. In particular the nine cases occurring in the five years 1969-73 were about four times the number expected from national rates (standardised registration ratio 3.96; 95% confidence interval 1.81 to 7.52).

In the five years 1959-63 (that is, before Hinkley Point was commissioned) rates throughout Somerset (including the Hinkley Point area) were higher than the national rate.

DESIGN: Blind assessment of patients having chemotherapy and subsequent comparison with the first suitable patients matched for age and sex who were attending the clinic during the same period after having completed treatment. Controls were obtained the following year by taking the first suitable patients attending a routine dermatology outpatient clinic who matched the study groups for age and sex. SETTING: Referrals to a paediatric oncology clinic and a dermatology clinic at two city hospitals. PATIENTS: The group receiving chemotherapy comprised all 32 patients with acute lymphatic leukaemia, lymphoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma who were attending the paediatric oncology clinic on two mornings a week during October 1987 to March 1988. The group who had completed treatment comprised 32 patients who were attending for follow up during the same period and who matched the first group for age and sex. Thirty two other patients attending the dermatology outpatient clinic with unrelated skin conditions served as controls. END POINT: Definite increase in numbers of moles on children after a course of chemotherapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Moles were counted by one observer on defined areas of the body and divided into those less than 3 mm and greater than or equal to 3 mm diameter. Patients receiving chemotherapy had a similar number of moles to the control group. By contrast patients who had completed chemotherapy had significant increases both in moles less than 3 mm and greater than or equal to 3 mm and in the total number of moles. These patients were more likely to have moles on acral sites. CONCLUSIONS: Children with substantially increased numbers of moles (benign melanocytic naevi) after successful chemotherapy for malignancy may have an increased risk of melanoma.

In addition, IL-2 in vitro promotes the release of cytokines including gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which also possess antileukemic activity and can enhance granulocyte function. To determine if IL-2 infusion induces release of gamma-IFN and TNF in vivo in sufficient quantity to mediate these effects, we have measured serum levels of these cytokines and secretion by lymphocytes obtained from patients receiving this cytokine in a phase 1 trial. Serum gamma-IFN was undetectable pre-IL-2 and increased to 1.5 to 17 U/mL during IL-2 infusion (P less than .05). Culture of patient lymphocytes for 48 hours produced 1.2 U gamma-IFN/2 x 10(6) cells/mL pre-IL-2 rising to 50 U/2 x 10(6) cells/mL when the lymphocytes were obtained during therapy (P less than .05). Lymphocyte subset analysis showed that both CD3+ and CD16+ cells secreted gamma-IFN in response to IL-2. TNF secretion by lymphocytes also rose during IL-2 infusion from a mean of 5 U/mL to 14.4 U/mL (P less than .01) although no rise was seen in serum levels. The material secreted by IL-2-stimulated lymphocytes is bioactive as addition of supernatants from lymphocytes obtained during IL-2 therapy to cultures of myeloid blasts significantly inhibited clonogenic growth. IL-2-induced secretion of these cytokines mediated this inhibition as it could be partially blocked by either anti-gamma-IFN or anti-TNF antibodies. Preincubation of granulocytes with the same supernatants produced enhanced oxidative metabolism, measured by chemiluminescence in response to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP). This effect also could be partially abrogated by anti-gamma-IFN and anti-TNF antibodies. Therefore, secondary cytokine secretion may boost granulocyte function and contribute to the antileukemic effects of IL-2 infusion in patients following bone marrow transplantation or chemotherapy.","['Heslop, H E', 'Gottlieb, D J', 'Bianchi, A C', 'Meager, A', 'Prentice, H G', 'Mehta, A B', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Brenner, M K']","['Heslop HE', 'Gottlieb DJ', 'Bianchi AC', 'Meager A', 'Prentice HG', 'Mehta AB', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Brenner MK']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/biosynthesis/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell-Free System', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Interleukin-2/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/surgery/*therapy', 'Lymphocytes/classification/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/surgery/*therapy', 'Phenotype', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis/blood']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1989 Sep;74(4):1374-80.,"['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, London, England.']",,,['S0006-4971(20)82590-7 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

After addition of 10 or 1 ng/mL phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) to K562 cells, a marked decrease in enzymatic activity is observed in the medium. However, when t-PA antigen rather than activity is measured, an increased amount is found in the medium under these conditions. PMA also induces secretion of the two inhibitors of plasminogen activator: plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI-2). This accounts for the decrease in total enzymatic activity under conditions when production of t-PA antigen is increased. A study of the time course of induction revealed that the synthesis of plasminogen activator occurred before that of its inhibitors. Low concentrations of PMA (0.1 ng/mL) induce t-PA antigen primarily and not the inhibitors. This results in an increase in total enzymatic activity, with 94% of the secreted activity being t-PA. Thus, the secretion of plasminogen activators and their inhibitors can be manipulated in certain leukemic cells by inducers such as PMA.","['Oliver, L J', 'Keeton, M', 'Wilson, E L']","['Oliver LJ', 'Keeton M', 'Wilson EL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Plasminogen Inactivators)', 'EC 3.4.21.68 (Tissue Plasminogen Activator)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Plasminogen Inactivators', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tissue Plasminogen Activator/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1989 Sep;74(4):1321-7.,"['Department of Cell Biology, New York University Medical Center 10016.']",['CA 23753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['S0006-4971(20)82582-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients with non-small-cell-lung cancer (SCLC) were at stage III, while those with SCLC and mesothelioma had limited disease. Five out of eight presented with limited disease at onset. The median age was low; lung cancer occurred predominantly in young adults, of whom all but one were smokers. Three patients could not be treated; four died while on treatment because of progression of the neoplasia and one died of an overdose. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was diagnosed in five patients. The immunophenotype was always Burkitt-like (L3), and acute myeloblastic leukaemia (M2) was diagnosed in one. Of the central nervous system (CNS) tumours, two cases of glioblastoma and one of medulloblastoma were described. Two cases of young adults with multiple myeloma and two cases of colorectal carcinoma were also reported. One case of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, one anorectal carcinoma, one oral carcinoma, one pancreatic carcinoma, one thymoma, one kidney carcinoma, one malignant melanoma and thyroid carcinoma were also found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Monfardini, S', 'Vaccher, E', 'Pizzocaro, G', 'Stellini, R', 'Sinicco, A', 'Sabbatani, S', 'Marangolo, M', 'Zagni, R', 'Clerici, M', 'Foa, R']","['Monfardini S', 'Vaccher E', 'Pizzocaro G', 'Stellini R', 'Sinicco A', 'Sabbatani S', 'Marangolo M', 'Zagni R', 'Clerici M', 'Foa R', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,AIDS,"AIDS (London, England)",8710219,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*complications', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Testicular Neoplasms/etiology', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/etiology']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,AIDS. 1989 Jul;3(7):449-52. doi: 10.1097/00002030-198907000-00008.,"['Italian Cooperative Group on AIDS-Related Tumours, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, Pordenone, Italy.']",,,['10.1097/00002030-198907000-00008 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used Moloney murine leukemia virus-based vectors expressing human HPRT, firefly luciferase (luc), and Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase (lacZ) as reporter genes, and the human HPRT and the transposon Tn5 neomycin resistance (neo) gene as selectable markers. All vectors, whether single or double gene, yielded both stable and unstable clones. Stability of the proviruses was dependent on a number of factors, including the nature of the infected cell, the reporter gene, the integration site of the provirus, the relative positions of the component genes in multigene vectors, and the presence or absence of selection pressure. Selection pressure was helpful, but not universally effective, in maintaining provirus structural and functional integrity. Reporter gene expression from an internal promoter was likely to be unstable with or without selection for an upstream, LTR-driven neo gene. In some clones, loss of proviral gene expression was accompanied by deletions, while other inactive clones retained an apparently intact provirus. In the latter clones, treatment with 5-azacytidine failed to reactivate the reporter genes, but superinfection with helper virus resulted in the reappearance of transmissible vector, indicating a reversible epigenetic mechanism for proviral shutdown. The design of effective retroviral vectors and their possible use in vivo will require further characterization of these determinants of provirus stability.","['Xu, L', 'Yee, J K', 'Wolff, J A', 'Friedmann, T']","['Xu L', 'Yee JK', 'Wolff JA', 'Friedmann T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Viral', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/genetics', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Plasmids', 'Time Factors', 'Virus Replication', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1989 Aug;171(2):331-41. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(89)90600-4.,"['Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093.']","['HD00669/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD20034/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,['10.1016/0042-6822(89)90600-4 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We noted that a VH gene of the restricted human fetal repertoire, designated 51p1, potentially could encode the VH region of two human IgM rheumatoid factor proteins. These rheumatoid factors share a cross-reactive idiotype (CRI) defined by reactivity with G6, a murine monoclonal antibody that recognizes an antibody heavy chain determinant present on many human IgM autoantibodies, particularly rheumatoid factors. Recently, we found that the G6 CRI also is expressed frequently by neoplastic CD5 (Leu1) B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma. However, neoplastic CD5-negative B cells from patients with lymphomas of follicular center cell origin rarely express this CRI. Here, we report that G6-reactive leukemic cells from two unrelated CLL patients express a VH gene that shares greater than 99% homology with a rearranged VH gene previously isolated from the leukemic cell DNA of another CLL patient and that is identical to VH 51p1. Using the polymerase chain reaction, we find that this VH gene is rearranged, and presumably expressed, in the genomic DNA of all examined cases of G6-reactive CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Thus these data indicate that the autoantibody-associated G6 CRI is a serologic marker for a conserved and developmentally restricted VH1 gene that is expressed at high frequency in CD5 B-cell malignancies and early B-cell ontogeny.","['Kipps, T J', 'Tomhave, E', 'Pratt, L F', 'Duffy, S', 'Chen, P P', 'Carson, D A']","['Kipps TJ', 'Tomhave E', 'Pratt LF', 'Duffy S', 'Chen PP', 'Carson DA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Amplification', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Aug;86(15):5913-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.86.15.5913.,"['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, La Jolla, CA 92037.']","['AG04100/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AR25443/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR38475/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC297741,['10.1073/pnas.86.15.5913 [doi]'],,"['GENBANK/M24668', 'GENBANK/M24669', 'GENBANK/M24670']",,,,,,,,,,

The factor, named cytotoxic (killer) T cell activating factor (KAF), is an acidic protein of 70,000 to 100,000 dalton molecular size. Peripheral blood leukocytes from two patients, bearing epithelioid sarcoma or malignant schwannoma, were cultured for 7 days with individual autologous tumor to induce CTL directed to the corresponding tumor. Monocyte-depleted peripheral leukocytes generated lesser CTL activity than the monocyte-containing leukocyte population. However, the KAF was able to replace the monocyte function. The KAF acted at the CTL generation phase as well as the effector phase. The KAF-activated killer cells possessed CD4-8+ surface phenotype. The CTL killed autologous tumor or other unrelated tumor cell lines only when they shared some of the HLA class I antigens. It was also demonstrated that the KAF does not activate killer cells without proper antigenic stimuli, because the KAF-augmented CTL possess specificity against autologous tumor or other HLA-A or -B matched tumor cell lines. The therapeutic applicability of human KAF for anti-tumor CTL therapy against autologous tumor is discussed.","['Maeda, N', 'Hamasato, S', 'Miyazawa, H', 'Takata, M', 'Yamamoto, H', 'Fujimoto, S']","['Maeda N', 'Hamasato S', 'Miyazawa H', 'Takata M', 'Yamamoto H', 'Fujimoto S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'CD8 Antigens', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Neurilemmoma/immunology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Sarcoma/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1989 Jun;80(6):537-45. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1989.tb01673.x.,"['Department of Immunology, Kochi Medical School.']",,PMC5917804,['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1989.tb01673.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Of these, increased synthesis of a 40-kDa/pI 5.9 cytoplasmic protein was the most prominent and reproducible. Most of these proteins appear to be specific for a defined step of differentiation, since they are not found in other B cell leukemias upon IFN-gamma treatment. Others appear to be tissue specific, since they are not induced in fibroblasts nor in T cells. In addition, synthesis of some of the induced proteins appeared to require rapid transcription of new mRNA, because actinomycin D markedly inhibited their formation when added immediately before IFN-gamma. In keeping with this finding, in vitro translation of mRNA from IFN-gamma-treated L1210 cells into a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, followed by analysis of the labeled proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, revealed the appearance of at least seven proteins. Taken as a whole, these results demonstrate that in leukemic pre-B cells IFN-gamma induces the transcriptional activation of genes coding for cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, some of which could be employed as specific cell activation markers.","['Franco, A', 'Fizzotti, M', 'Gariglio, M', 'Gribaudo, G', 'Cavallo, G', 'Landolfo, S']","['Franco A', 'Fizzotti M', 'Gariglio M', 'Gribaudo G', 'Cavallo G', 'Landolfo S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Isoelectric Point', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*physiopathology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1989 Jul;19(7):1171-6. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830190703.,"['Institute of Microbiology, University of Torino, Italy.']",,,['10.1002/eji.1830190703 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we have investigated the neutral amino acid transport in M1 cells and in those treated with lipopolysaccharide. In M1 cells serine, alanine and proline were taken up mainly by Na+-dependent transport systems, and leucine was largely transported by a Na+-independent system. By treating the cells with lipopolysaccharide, the activities of the Na+-dependent systems markedly decreased, whereas the activity of the Na+-independent system was little affected. The amino acid concentrations in the cells and the culture medium were measured. As a whole, the intracellular to extracellular distribution ratios for neutral amino acids that are preferred substrates for Na+-dependent systems were decreased on lipopolysaccharide treatment, whereas those for amino acids that are mainly transported by a Na+-independent system were slightly increased.

Biologically derived LXA4 (3 nM) isolated from RBL-1 incubations contracted a rat tail artery preparation to 12% of the maximum induced by phenylephrine (0.125 microM), whereas LXA4 standard (3 nM) elicited 17.6% of the maximum contraction. These results indicate that RBL-1 cells can utilize exogenous 15-HPETE to generate biologically active lipoxins. Further, the yield and isomers of lipoxins can be modified by different agonists.","['Ng, C F', 'Lam, B K', 'Pritchard, K A Jr', 'Stemerman, M B', 'Hejny, P', 'Wong, P Y']","['Ng CF', 'Lam BK', 'Pritchard KA Jr', 'Stemerman MB', 'Hejny P', 'Wong PY']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids)', '0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (Lipid Peroxides)', '0 (Lipoxins)', '0 (lipoxin A4)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '67675-14-3 (15-hydroperoxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid)', '92950-25-9 (lipoxin B4)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids/*biosynthesis', 'Leukotrienes/metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxides/metabolism', '*Lipoxins', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/08/22 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1989/08/22 00:00'],"['1989/08/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1989/08/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1989 Aug 22;1004(3):332-6. doi: 10.1016/0005-2760(89)90081-7.,"['Department of Pharmacology, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595.']","['HL-25316/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-33742/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0005-2760(89)90081-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2760(89)90081-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The specificity of cellular staining by indirect immunoperoxidase was confirmed in the majority of cases by an ELISA assay using secreted idiotypic immunoglobulin. In a few cases weak cellular binding by the panel antibodies could not be confirmed as specific for immunoglobulin. Four monoclonal antibodies specific for lambda chain determinants reacted with 5-29% of lambda expressing CLLs but the significance of this is uncertain as the antibodies may be recognizing one of the commoner V lambda subgroups. Two antibodies, which are only weakly reactive with normal serum immunoglobulin, detected heavy chain associated idiotopes which were expressed by 7% and 14% of CLL cases. One of these antibodies detects an idiotope which was expressed significantly more frequently by CLL associated immunoglobulin than by a panel of paraproteins. Such preferentially expressed idiotopes may be useful in investigating the biology of this disorder as well as providing attractive targets for immunotherapy.","['Cachia, P G', 'Dewar, A E', 'Krajewski, A S', 'Stockdill, G', 'Walker, L C', 'Habeshaw, J A']","['Cachia PG', 'Dewar AE', 'Krajewski AS', 'Stockdill G', 'Walker LC', 'Habeshaw JA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (Paraproteins)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*analysis', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology/therapy', 'Paraproteins/analysis']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1989 Jun;72(2):150-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1989.tb07675.x.,"['Department of Pathology, University of Edinburgh.']",,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1989.tb07675.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This article describes an automated assay for measuring the microbial inhibitory activity of transferrin in serum and its use in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and in normal controls. The assay measured the ability of heat-inactivated serum to inhibit the growth of an antibiotic-resistant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The serum dilutions were prepared in a special low iron chemically defined broth. An inhibition index, the reciprocal of the serum dilution producing 50% inhibition of bacterial growth when compared with the growth in broth alone, was determined. The results showed the serum from the patients with leukemia had a significantly lower inhibition index than that of controls (16 +/- 11 vs. 35 +/- 13, P less than 0.01). In addition, they had higher serum iron levels (162 +/- 65 vs. 75 +/- 27, P less than 0.01), lower serum transferrin levels (231 +/- 65 vs. 309 +/- 71, P less than 0.01), and higher percentage saturation of transferrin with iron (59 +/- 21 vs. 20 +/- 8, P less than 0.01) than did controls.

DCF had little activity even at 100 microM on any of the cell lines, while Ara-A had an obvious inhibitory effect on them, especially on non-T,non-B cell lines at 10 microM or less. Lymphoid cell lines were apparently more sensitive to the combined use of Ara-A and DCF than myeloid cell lines. DCF potentiated the antiproliferative activity of Ara-A not only in T-cell lines with high adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity, but also in some other cell lines with low ADA activity. DCF was stable in the culture medium, but Ara-A in the medium containing cultured cells was rapidly inactivated. DCF completely inhibited the inactivation of Ara-A in the medium containing P12/ICH or NALM-6, but not in the medium containing Daudi. This suggests that there is some unknown mechanism(s) of inactivation of Ara-A other than ADA in Daudi, which was insensitive to Ara-A in the presence of 1 microM DCF. The capacity of DCF to inhibit degradation of Ara-A in the medium containing these cultured cells correlated with the level of Ara-A sensitivity potentiated by DCF. In all seven T-cell lines, seven of the nine B-cell lines, all five non-T,non-B cell lines, and only three of nine myeloid cell lines, the IC50 value for Ara-A decreased to 5 microM or less in the presence of 1 microM DCF.

This was detectable in normal B cells within a few hours of culture and fully developed by 24-48 hr. It was inhibited by the presence of cyclosporin A. The responding, motile cells also increased in size. These findings suggest that B lymphocytes acquire locomotor capacity early in growth, as the cells move from G0 to G1. IL-4 or IFN-gamma had no direct effect in polarizing lymphocytes in a short-term (30-min) assay, thus they do not behave like chemotactic factors.

Evidence that the low-agonist-affinity receptor interacts with and activates the G-protein.,97-105,"In neutrophils and several other phagocytic cell types, a pertussis- and cholera-toxin-sensitive form of the guanine-nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein) Gp couples receptors for N-formylmethionine-containing chemotactic peptides to stimulation of phospholipase C. Using membranes of myeloid differentiated HL 60 cells, we have examined the role of Mg2+ and guanine nucleotides in regulating (a) the interaction of the formyl-peptide receptor with the chemotactic agonist N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMet-Leu-Phe) and (b) the receptor-mediated activation of Gp. Mg2+ markedly enhanced the number of receptors with high affinity for the radiolabeled oligopeptide fMet-Leu-[3H]Phe. At the same time, Mg2+ largely increased the potency of guanosine-5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate, but not of GDP or guanosine-5'-(2-O-thio)diphosphate, to inhibit binding of the peptide. Comparison of the potency of Mg2+ in eliciting these two effects and analysis of the specificities of the relevant divalent cation sites revealed that Mg2+ interacts with at least two independent sites on the receptor-Gp complex. One site is specific for Mg2+ and exhibits affinity in the micromolar range, the other site interacts with millimolar concentrations of several divalent cations in a non-selective fashion. It is suggested that the former site is located on Gp and that interaction of Mg2+ with this site is necessary for the receptor-mediated G-protein activation, whereas interaction of divalent cations with the latter site is necessary for high affinity agonist binding. The regulation of the formyl-peptide receptor binding properties by guanine nucleotides is independent of Gp activation, since inhibition of peptide binding is achieved by addition of both guanine nucleoside diphosphates and triphosphates and is readily seen both in the presence and in the absence of Mg2+. The latter finding, together with the observation that, at micromolar concentrations of Mg2+, high-affinity GTPase activity is stimulated by fMet-Leu-Phe primarily via low affinity receptors, suggests that, contrary to widely held opinions, (a) divalent cations are not required for a functional receptor--G-protein interaction and (b) high-affinity agonist binding is not a prerequisite for the receptor-mediated activation of the G-protein.","['Gierschik, P', 'Steisslinger, M', 'Sidiropoulos, D', 'Herrmann, E', 'Jakobs, K H']","['Gierschik P', 'Steisslinger M', 'Sidiropoulos D', 'Herrmann E', 'Jakobs KH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",IM,"['Binding Sites/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Guanine Nucleotides/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/enzymology/metabolism', 'Magnesium/*pharmacology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/metabolism', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Phosphates/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism']",1989/07/15 00:00,1989/07/15 00:01,['1989/07/15 00:00'],"['1989/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1989 Jul 15;183(1):97-105. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb14901.x.,"['Pharmakologisches Institut, Universitat Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany.']",,,['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb14901.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic cell populations classified as belonging to the B lineage according to their surface antigenic patterns revealed increasing expression of mRNA for the IgM heavy chain (mu mRNA) in a maturation-dependent fashion, which was not correlated to rearrangement of the immunoglobulin mu chain gene--only 66% of the leukemias with rearranged mu gene also transcribed it. TCR mRNA was detected in B-antigen positive leukemic cells. High levels of both TCR and mu mRNA expression in all cells of some of these leukemias allowed the conclusion that these cells simultaneously transcribed the genes for T and B cell antigen receptors. TCR mRNA was also found in what are considered relatively mature B leukemias, lineage cross-over on the mRNA level being observed at a frequency of 23% (five of 22 cases), comparable with that of ""inappropriate"" receptor gene rearrangement.

We also reexamined testicular biopsy specimens, obtained at the time of the cessation of chemotherapy, for the presence of germ cells. Germ-cell damage, indicated by marked elevations in the plasma level of follicle-stimulating hormone (P less than 0.001 for the comparison with normal children), was evident in both sexes and was confirmed in the boys by the absence of germ cells in the testicular biopsy specimens and by the small size of the testes for pubic-hair stage. Only 44 percent of the pubertal girls had measurable plasma inhibin levels, as compared with more than 93 percent of normal pubertal girls. Although plasma sex-steroid levels were normal, the secretion of luteinizing hormone in response to stimulation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone was elevated in the pubertal children (P less than 0.01 for the comparison with normal controls)--a finding that suggests compensation for decreased gonadal function. Despite clear evidence of gonadal damage, girls had early menarche at a mean age (+/- SD) of 11.95 +/- 0.91 years, as compared with the Australian standard of 12.98 +/- 1.11 years (P less than 0.01). Thus, in girls, puberty was early despite primary gonadal damage. Thirteen of 23 boys reached puberty at a mean age of 12.36 +/- 0.73 years. We conclude that treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia may lead to primary gonadal damage in both sexes, regardless of the age at treatment, but that the secondary characteristics of puberty develop at a normal age or, in girls, relatively early.","['Quigley, C', 'Cowell, C', 'Jimenez, M', 'Burger, H', 'Kirk, J', 'Bergin, M', 'Stevens, M', 'Simpson, J', 'Silink, M']","['Quigley C', 'Cowell C', 'Jimenez M', 'Burger H', 'Kirk J', 'Bergin M', 'Stevens M', 'Simpson J', 'Silink M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Pituitary Hormone-Releasing Hormones)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Inhibins/blood', 'Luteinizing Hormone/blood', 'Male', 'Ovary/*physiopathology', 'Pituitary Hormone-Releasing Hormones/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Puberty/*physiology', 'Testis/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Time Factors']",1989/07/20 00:00,1989/07/20 00:01,['1989/07/20 00:00'],"['1989/07/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/20 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1989 Jul 20;321(3):143-51. doi: 10.1056/NEJM198907203210303.,"['Institute of Endocrinology, Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, Camperdown, Australia.']",,,['10.1056/NEJM198907203210303 [doi]'],,,['N Engl J Med. 1989 Jul 20;321(3):185-7.

We cloned the breakpoints of the t(11;14)(p15;q11) in a CD3-negative T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (RPMI 8402) in order to identify new genes potentially involved in T-cell neoplasia. An extensive comparison of both breakpoints and their germ line counterparts indicated that an inadvertant recombinase-mediated break at chromosome segment 11p15 recombined with the delta T-cell receptor at 14q11. The derivative 11 breakpoint resembles a coding joint in which 11p15 rather than a variable region was introduced 5' to a D delta 1 D delta 2 J delta 1 intermediate rearrangement. Conversely, the derivative 14 breakpoint corresponds to a signal joint between the 5' heptamer-spacer-nonamer recombinational signal of D delta 1 and an isolated heptamer at 11p15. Multiple, apparently distinct transcripts were found flanking both breakpoints of 8402. RNAs of 3.5, 4.4, 1.4, and 8.0 kilobases originating from either side of the derivative 14 breakpoint were highly expressed in 8402 compared with other cells. This suggests that this translocation deregulated multiple genes and provides the opportunity to assess any multifactorial contribution they may have to malignancy. We cloned and sequenced several cDNAs representing the 1.4-kilobase transcript (termed Ttg-1 [T-cell translocation gene 1]) from an 8402 library.

For this purpose we established a subclone (JPX-9) of Jurkat cells that was stably transfected with an expression plasmid containing the p40tax gene, whose expression is definitely dependent on heavy-metal ions. Expression of the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain in JPX-9 cells was induced in response to the induction of p40tax expression, as has been demonstrated by others in transient transfection experiments with Jurkat cells. In addition, we found that significant enhancement of expression of the nuclear proto-oncogene c-fos was closely associated with expression of p40tax. Continous enhancement in the level of c-fos mRNA was observed in the presence of p40tax. In contrast, mRNA levels of other nuclear proto-oncogenes (c-myc, c-myb, and c-jun) were not appreciably effected by the expression of p40tax. These results suggest that (i) in addition to the interleukin-2-interleukin-2 receptor system, cellular genes such as c-fos, which regulate normal T-cell growth, are also activated directly or indirectly by p40tax and (ii) p40tax-induced modulation of gene expression plays a crucial role in T-cell transformation by HTLV-I.","['Nagata, K', 'Ohtani, K', 'Nakamura, M', 'Sugamura, K']","['Nagata K', 'Ohtani K', 'Nakamura M', 'Sugamura K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'HTLV-I Antigens/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Plasmids', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Aug;63(8):3220-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.8.3220-3226.1989.,"['Department of Microbiology, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.']",,PMC250891,['10.1128/JVI.63.8.3220-3226.1989 [doi]'],,,,,,,['NASA: 89311607'],,,,,

In cattle and other species, major genes that control humoral and cellular immune responses to a variety of antigens have been mapped to a chromosomal region known as the major histocompatibility complex. However, resistance or susceptibility to viral, bacterial, and parasitic diseases in noninbred species is often a complex phenotype, with age, stress, and physiologic status all being important factors in the outcome of infection. This paper reviews the function of major histocompatibility complex gene products and the relationship between polymorphism of these genes and infectious diseases. A discussion of strategies for detecting immune response genes and disease associations is presented, with particular reference to the problems and advantages of working with cattle. The present knowledge of the bovine major histocompatibility complex and its relationship to immune responsiveness and disease resistance are also reviewed, with special consideration given to enzootic bovine leukosis because of the significant relationship between alleles of the bovine lymphocyte antigen system and resistance or susceptibility to subclinical progression of bovine leukemia virus infection.

Sonicated unilamellar liposomes were coated with B3 and HBJ127 mouse, mAbs, which recognize a rat and a homologous human cell proliferation-associated surface antigen, gp125, respectively, and then adriamycin was entrapped in the liposomes by means of transmembrane Na+/K+ gradients using valinomycin. These CIL selectively bound with relevant target tumor cells bearing the corresponding gp125 antigen, such as BC47 rat bladder cancer, FTL-13 rat thymic lymphoma, T24 human bladder cancer and Molt-4 human leukemia cells, although the binding capacities of the CIL to bladder cancer cells were relatively larger than those to lymphoma cells in both rat and human systems. This difference in the target cell binding was found to be attributable to the amount of gp125 antigen expressed on each target tumor cell, as determined by a Scatchard plot analysis. In accordance with the target cell binding capacities of CIL preparations, the CIL displayed much higher cytotoxic activity to bladder cancers than to lymphomas in both rat and human systems. In conjuction with our previous finding that gp125 antigen is expressed on tumor cells but not on resting normal cells, these findings indicate that CIL composed of anti-gp125 mAb will be useful for tumor therapy and that the antitumor efficacy is dependent upon the extent of the antigen expression on target tumor cells.","['Tanaka, T', 'Suzuki, S', 'Masuko, T', 'Hashimoto, Y']","['Tanaka T', 'Suzuki S', 'Masuko T', 'Hashimoto Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*administration & dosage', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Liposomes', 'Lymphoma/immunology/therapy', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/immunology', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/immunology/therapy']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1989 Apr;80(4):380-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1989.tb02323.x.,"['Department of Hygienic Chemistry, Tohoku University, Sendai.']",,PMC5917737,['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1989.tb02323.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

All of 9 T-ALL/LBL cases, of which 4 cases have neither beta nor gamma gene rearrangement, had a new rearranged band of TcR delta locus. Ten of 16 B-lineage ALL/LBL had rearranged band(s) or deletion of TcR delta locus. The rearranged bands were recognized in 2 cases of AILD and 1 case of T-cell lymphoma. All cases of adult T-cell leukemias/lymphomas, 4 of AILD, 4 of T-cell lymphoma, and 8 of Hodgkin's disease had deleted TcR delta locus. Heterogeneous findings of TcR delta locus analysis were observed in AILD, T-cell lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. In 16 cases with TcR delta rearrangement, the J delta 1 region was frequently used and the J delta 2 region was rearranged in one AILD. It is suspected that J delta 3 was used in one T-ALL/LBL. There was no correlation between the phenotypic pattern of CD3, CD4, CD8 in T-cell disorders and the rearrangement of the TcR delta gene. These findings suggest that the newly identified TcR delta chain gene rearranges at a very early stage of T-cell ontogeny; prior to the other TcR genes and perhaps at almost the same stage with CD7 expression. The TcR delta gene is useful in assessing clonality for the most immature T-cell neoplasms not showing rearrangement of the other TcR genes. This gene is not lineage specific; however, when used in conjunction with immunoglobulin heavy chain gene, it may be a useful tool to distinguish lymphoid lineage of ALL/LBL.","['Kimura, N', 'Takihara, Y', 'Akiyoshi, T', 'Yoshida, T', 'Ohshima, K', 'Kawara, T', 'Hisano, S', 'Kozuru, M', 'Okumura, M', 'Kikuchi, M']","['Kimura N', 'Takihara Y', 'Akiyoshi T', 'Yoshida T', 'Ohshima K', 'Kawara T', 'Hisano S', 'Kozuru M', 'Okumura M', 'Kikuchi M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin delta-Chains)']",IM,"['*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Hodgkin Disease/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblastic Lymphadenopathy/genetics/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin delta-Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*genetics/immunology']",1989/08/15 00:00,1989/08/15 00:01,['1989/08/15 00:00'],"['1989/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Aug 15;49(16):4488-92.,"['First Department of Internal Medicine Fukuoka University School of Medicine, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The anticancer properties of these esters have been compared with those of DFMO and MAP as a function of the dose, the route of administration, and the stage of the lewis lung carcinoma development in mice. The two esters, administered i.p. shortly after cell inoculation at one-fifth the dose of DFMO, prolonged the survival of mice-bearing leukemia to the same extent as DFMO and MAP. When administered orally to leukemia-bearing mice the two esters were equipotent at prolonging survival. The methyl ester appears, however, to be slightly, but not significantly, more effective than the ethyl ester against leukemia when given i.p., maximum prolongation of the mice survival (79%) occurring at 0.5 g/kg methyl ester every 12 h. The two esters achieve at one-sixth to one-twelfth the dose, antitumor effects similar to DFMO in the Lewis lung carcinoma model, the ethyl ester being slightly, but not significantly, more effective than the methyl ester when administered orally. Moreover, the ethyl ester causes greater reduction of tumor growth than DFMO (P less than 0.05) and MAP (P less than 0.01) in this model. Inhibition of tumor growth is correlated with spermidine depletion and an increase of decarboxylated-S-adenosylmethionine, the aminopropyl donor in the spermidine and spermine synthase reactions. All ODC inhibitors, however, lose most of their antitumor properties when administered at late stage of Lewis lung carcinoma development. Finally, this study demonstrates the advantage of using prodrugs of delta-MFMO, an inhibitor of ODC, since they possess longer duration of action, higher potency, and in some cases better antitumor efficiency than the parent direct inhibitor of ODC. Moreover, and as already noticed for DFMO or MAP, no sign of overt toxicity is caused by the highest effective antitumor doses of the esters.","['Claverie, N', 'Mamont, P S']","['Claverie N', 'Mamont PS']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Alkynes)', '0 (Diamines)', '0 (Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', '81645-70-7 (6-heptyne-2,5-diamine)', '96681-91-3 (2-(fluoromethyl)dehydroornithine methyl ester)', '97501-15-0 (2-(fluoromethyl)dehydroornithine ethyl ester)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Alkynes', 'Animals', 'Diamines/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Eflornithine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', '*Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors', 'Prodrugs/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",1989/08/15 00:00,1989/08/15 00:01,['1989/08/15 00:00'],"['1989/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Aug 15;49(16):4466-71.,"['Merrell Dow Research Institute, Strasbourg, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently established that swainsonine (SW), an inhibitor of mannosidase II during N-linked glycoprotein processing, augmented mitogen-induced mononuclear leukocyte IL-2 receptor expression and IL-2-induced proliferation. The objective of the present investigation was to examine the effect of SW on lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell induction. Human mononuclear leukocytes were treated with various concentrations of SW (0.1-10 micrograms/ml) and IL-2 (1-100 units/ml) for up to 72 h. SW augmented IL-2-induced LAK activity directed against human lung carcinoma, melanoma, and leukemia cells 2-3-fold. LAK activity generated in the presence of SW at suboptimal doses of IL-2 (10 units/ml) was similar to that observed with higher concentrations of IL-2 (100 units/ml) alone. SW treatment alone or in combination with IL-2 increased the percentage of IL-2 receptor-positive cells. Furthermore, pretreatment with SW subsequently enhanced IL-2-induced lymphocyte proliferation. SW-treated mononuclear leukocytes exhibited an increase in high-mannose type glycoproteins based upon [3H]mannose labeling, susceptibility to alpha-mannosidase, and binding to concanavalin A-Sepharose. These results indicate that modulators of glycoprotein processing may be useful in lowering the concentrations of IL-2 required for LAK induction and maintenance.","['Bowlin, T L', 'McKown, B J', 'Kang, M S', 'Sunkara, P S']","['Bowlin TL', 'McKown BJ', 'Kang MS', 'Sunkara PS']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Glycopeptides)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Mannosidases)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)', 'RSY4RK37KQ (Swainsonine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Glycopeptides/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Mannose/metabolism', 'Mannosidases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Swainsonine']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Aug 1;49(15):4109-13.,"['Merrell Dow Research Institute, Cincinnati, Ohio 45215.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phosphorylation by tyrosine protein kinases.,191-5,"The octapeptide E-E-K-E-Y-H-A-E, corresponding to the amino acid sequence 841-845 of EGF receptor, whose tyrosine-845 is homologous to the main phosphorylation site of pp60v-src, has been synthesized together with seven shorter peptides encompassing variable segments around the tyrosine residue. The peptides have been employed as model substrates for inspecting the local structural determinants of three tyrosine protein kinases (TPKs), namely; TPK-IIB and TPK-III, isolated from lymphoid cells (Eur. J. Biochem. 172, 451-457 (1988] and the TPK encoded by the oncogene of Abelson murine leukemia virus. The phosphorylation order with the different peptide substrates is variable depending on the TPK used: in particular, the lysine residue at position -2 relative to tyrosine proved especially harmful with TPK-IIB, the peptides K-E-Y-H and K-E-Y-H-A-E being very poor substrates compared with their shorter derivatives devoid of the N-terminal lysine (E-Y-H and E-Y-H-A-E, respectively). Conversely, such a basic residue is well tolerated by the other two TPKs. The negative effect of the N-terminal lysine on TPK-IIB-catalyzed phosphorylation is accounted for by an increase of Km and can be overcome by the presence of additional glutamic acid(s) on that side. On the other hand, the C-terminal acidic doublet Ala-Glu specifically impairs the phosphorylation efficiency of abl-TPK, by lowering the Vmax value, the heptapeptide E-K-E-Y-H-A-E being much less readily phosphorylated than E-K-E-Y-H. Collectively, these results would indicate that the site specificity of tyrosine protein kinases results from the balance of positive and negative determinants whose influence on the catalytic activity of the individual enzymes can differ greatly.","['Cola, C', 'Brunati, A M', 'Borin, G', 'Ruzza, P', 'Calderan, A', 'De Castiglione, R', 'Pinna, L A']","['Cola C', 'Brunati AM', 'Borin G', 'Ruzza P', 'Calderan A', 'De Castiglione R', 'Pinna LA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src))']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'ErbB Receptors/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src)', 'Peptide Fragments/chemical synthesis/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",1989/07/11 00:00,1989/07/11 00:01,['1989/07/11 00:00'],"['1989/07/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/11 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1989 Jul 11;1012(2):191-5. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(89)90095-5.,"['Dipartimento di Chimica Biologica, Universita di Padova, Italy.']",,,"['0167-4889(89)90095-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(89)90095-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We, therefore, investigated the influence of LGL from controls and B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients (B-CLL) on control B cell proliferation to costimulation with the F(ab')2 fragment of goat antihuman mu and B cell growth factor (BCGF). Purified LGL (greater than 90% by morphology) from control and B-CLL peripheral blood were added in various concentrations to purified control B cells and incubated with anti-mu and BCGF for 3 days. [3H]-thymidine uptake of B cells was then measured. There was no proliferation of control or CLL LGL alone to the costimulatory signals of the F(ab')2 fragments of goat antihuman mu chain and BCGF. Addition of control LGL to equal numbers of control B cells did not blunt control B cell responsiveness to BCGF (with control LGL 8,649 +/- 298 cpm vs. control B cells alone 8,336 +/- 556 cpm, mean +/- SEM). When control LGL were increased to 10:1 LGL:B cell ratio, the maximal inhibition by control LGL of control B cell proliferative response to BCGF was 23%. In contrast, addition of CLL LGL at a 1:1 LGL:B cell ratio resulted in marked impairment of the control B cell proliferative response to BCGF (with CLL LGL 3,586 +/- 954 cpm vs. control B cells alone 8,649 +/- 298 cpm). Inhibition by CLL LGL occurred in a cell-concentration-dependent manner. No difference in CLL LGL's inhibitory effect on either resting or activated control B cell responsiveness to BCGF was noted. Inhibition of de novo protein synthesis (by cycloheximide inhibition) of CLL LGL did impair CLL LGL's inhibitory capacity for BCGF-induced B cell proliferation. A possible explanation for these findings includes the possibility that a subgroup of LGL with B cell suppressive activity may have expanded as a host response to the B cell leukemia or as part of the disordered cell regulation in B-CLL.","['Perri, R T', 'Kay, N E']","['Perri RT', 'Kay NE']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Interleukins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinemia/pathology', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Cell Division', 'Granulocytes/pathology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/physiology', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/physiology', 'Interleukin-4', 'Interleukins/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology/*physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Reference Values']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1989 Jul;31(3):166-72. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830310305.,"['Department of Medicine, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55417.']",,,['10.1002/ajh.2830310305 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We thus conclude that PMNC retain their ability to migrate after [111In]oxine labeling and that these cells traffic to involved lymph nodes of some, but not all hematologic malignancies.","['Muller, C', 'Zielinski, C C', 'Linkesch, W', 'Ludwig, H', 'Sinzinger, H']","['Muller C', 'Zielinski CC', 'Linkesch W', 'Ludwig H', 'Sinzinger H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,"['0 (Hydroxyquinolines)', '0 (Indium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '14514-42-2 (indium oxine)', '5UTX5635HP (Oxyquinoline)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Movement', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Hydroxyquinolines', '*Indium Radioisotopes', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnostic imaging', 'Lymph Nodes/diagnostic imaging', 'Lymphocyte Activation', '*Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Lymphoma/*diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Organometallic Compounds', '*Oxyquinoline/analogs & derivatives', 'Radionuclide Imaging']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Nucl Med. 1989 Jun;30(6):1005-11.,"['Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Vienna, Austria.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, V mutation has been established as a major mechanism of tumor escape from anti-Id immunotherapy. We cloned and sequenced the expressed Ig H and L chain V regions from a case of B acute lymphoblastic leukemia in order to evaluate B cell stages associated with V region mutation, and to determine which tumors would be better suited to Id directed immunotherapy. A consensus VH and V lambda sequence representing tumor at diagnosis was obtained by conventional cDNA cloning in lambda gt10 from a heterohybridoma. Primers which flanked both V regions were used in a modified polymerase chain reaction to generate multiple independent sequences from tumor cells harvested at relapse. In order to exclude mutations due to infidelity of the amplification procedure, single cDNA templates of known sequence were also amplified. The polymerase chain reaction proved to be an effective procedure to obtain multiple clones, but replication in M13 was associated with a low rate of base misincorporation. The results indicate that there is no evidence for biologically significant ongoing mutation in this t(8;14) B cell tumor when comparing sequences at diagnosis and relapse. Thus, V somatic mutation may be restricted to a discrete B cell stage whose malignant counterpart is follicular lymphoma.","['Carroll, W L', 'Yu, M', 'Link, M P', 'Korsmeyer, S J']","['Carroll WL', 'Yu M', 'Link MP', 'Korsmeyer SJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Taq Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology', 'Clone Cells/analysis', 'DNA/isolation & purification', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells/*analysis', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Taq Polymerase']",1989/07/15 00:00,1989/07/15 00:01,['1989/07/15 00:00'],"['1989/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Jul 15;143(2):692-8.,"['Edward Mallinckrodt Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.']",,,,,"['GENBANK/M28136', 'GENBANK/M28137']",,,,,,,,,,

We observed strongly increased secretion of several proteins into the culture media of K562 cells within a few hours of TPA treatment. Two of the major secreted polypeptides were identified by immunoprecipitation from media of metabolically labeled cultures as the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) and the type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1). Maximal amounts of PAI-1 mRNA and secretion of PAI-1 polypeptides were observed after 24 hr of TPA treatment and PAI-1 persisted at elevated levels for several days. The induction of PAI-1 mRNA was dependent on de novo protein synthesis. Uninduced and induced cells secreted urokinase plasminogen activator in its single-chain proenzyme form (pro-u-PA), which was cleaved extracellularly to the active two-chain form as shown by pulse-chase labeling experiments. Upon TPA induction, the secretion of u-PA polypeptides increased severalfold, and there was a transient accumulation of pro-u-PA in the culture medium. However, this did not lead to increased u-PA activity in the cultures, since active u-PA was removed by complex formation with the large excess of coinduced PAI-1. Induction of u-PA mRNA was biphasic: The first peak of about tenfold increase in steady-state u-PA mRNA at 3 hr was followed by a steep decline to the baseline level at 12 hr, and a second, slower accumulation of u-PA mRNA occurred over the next few days. The biphasic accumulation of u-PA mRNA was also reflected in u-PA protein synthesis. We conclude that concerted changes in favor of a nonproteolytic extracellular environment occur in TPA-induced K562 cultures undergoing megakaryoblastoid differentiation. These changes include excessive secretion of TIMP and inhibition of the induced u-PA by the simultaneous accumulation of PAI-1.","['Alitalo, R', 'Andersson, L C', 'Tapiovaara, H', 'Sistonen, L', 'Vaheri, A', 'Stephens, R']","['Alitalo R', 'Andersson LC', 'Tapiovaara H', 'Sistonen L', 'Vaheri A', 'Stephens R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Plasminogen Inactivators)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/analysis/metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Peptide Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Plasminogen Activators/metabolism', 'Plasminogen Inactivators', 'Precipitin Tests', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*metabolism', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/*metabolism']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1989 Jul;140(1):119-30. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041400115.,"['Transplantation Laboratory, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",,,['10.1002/jcp.1041400115 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

RNA synthesis and phenotypic changes after PMA plus A23187 stimulation indicate that CLL B cells from (10) different individuals are similarly able to undergo the G0 to the G1 phase transition and express surface activation antigens. In contrast, they are variable in the capacity to show DNA synthesis, which occurred in only six out of 10 cases. Even in the presence of BCGF (10%, v/v) or IL-2 (50 U/ml) four out of nine CLL B cells activated with PMA plus A23187 or PMA alone were still unable to proliferate although they were induced to express CD23, 4F2, CD25 and OKT9 antigens by PMA plus A23187. However, PMA plus A23187 induced IgM secretion which increased further in response to IL-2 even in the absence of DNA synthesis. Moreover, in other CLL B cell populations, the unresponsiveness to growth factors upon co-stimulation with Ig ligands (Seph-PA) may simply reflect a defective signalling via sIg cross-linking which can be circumvented by PMA plus A23187 stimulation.

All eight patients had responded clinically to splenectomy either alone or in combination with alpha-2b-interferon (alpha-IFN) therapy. For each sample, cytofluorimetric analysis showed distinct, and in six cases multiple, heavy chain isotypes. After short-term culture in the presence of alpha-IFN or gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN), samples from four patients displayed characteristic changes in surface immunoglobulin (sIg) expression. When compared with untreated cells, cells co-cultured with alpha-IFN or gamma-IFN showed in four and three patients, respectively, changes that were consistent with a shift to the more mature stage in B-cell ontogeny. However, in parallel with the changes in the sIg isotypes, treatment with IFN did not induce the appearance of cIg nor did the staining patterns for moAb to CD5, CD19, CD20, and CD22 antigens indicate the induction of terminal maturation. These data suggest that hairy cell leukemia (HCL), a neoplasm of ""mature"" B-cells, is potentially susceptible to maturation stimuli. Based on these findings, it might be of interest to examine whether co-factors, which have proved to play a role in HCL (e.g., B-cell growth factor [BCGF]), are capable of further enhancing IFN-induced differentiation.","['Gressler, V H', 'Weinkauff, R E', 'Franklin, W A', 'Golomb, H M']","['Gressler VH', 'Weinkauff RE', 'Franklin WA', 'Golomb HM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1989/07/15 00:00,1989/07/15 00:01,['1989/07/15 00:00'],"['1989/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1989 Jul 15;64(2):374-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19890715)64:2<374::aid-cncr2820640206>3.0.co;2-q.,"['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL 60637.']",,,['10.1002/1097-0142(19890715)64:2<374::aid-cncr2820640206>3.0.co;2-q [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Study of the relationship between the shortening fraction-constraint and the systolic shortening fraction-diameter of the left ventricle].,167-75,"Cardiotoxicity is the main obstacle to the use of high-dosage adriamycin in chemotherapy. It is difficult to decide whether or not treatment should be continued when the cardiac function -- irrespective of the method by which it is evaluated -- is at the lower limit of normality. Some authors consider that chemotherapy can be pursued as long as the shortening fraction of the echocardiographic diameter remains within normal limits in relation to the end-systolic constraint. We have established the limits of normality of this relationship before chemotherapy in 53 patients with normal cardiovascular system. We conclude that the end-systolic constraint essentially depends on the end-systolic diameter, so that the results provided by the study of the shortening fraction end-systolic constraint relationship are qualitatively the same as those of the shortening fraction-end-systolic diameter relationship, which is much easier to obtain. It seems to us that the criteria of cardiotoxicity after administration of adriamycin 300 mg/m2 are: (1) shortening fraction lower than 25 p. 100; (2) ventricular dilatation (end-systolic diameter greater than 40 mm) without associated valve disease; (3) reduction of the shortening fraction (whatever its value) in relation to the end-systolic diameter by more than 2 standard deviations on the regression slope of the correlation; (4) more than 25 p. 100 reduction of the shortening fraction after administration of adriamycin 300 mg/m2, betraying a high sensitivity to the cardiotoxic effects of the drug.

Multiple but identical alterations of these genes were found, including: the deletion of one and rearrangement of the other immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain allele; the rearrangement of one kappa and one lambda light chain allele; and the rearrangement of one T cell receptor (TCR) beta allele. Restriction mapping of the Ig heavy chain locus indicated that rearrangement of the retained allele produced a JH-C gamma 4 fusion product by an isotype switch mechanism. The 14q+ chromosome [t(14q32;?)] present in both cell cultures derived either from translocation 5' (telomeric) to the rearranged JH allele or 3' (centromeric) to the deleted Ig heavy chain allele and did not involve detectable rearrangement of the c-myc, bcl 1, or bcl 2 oncogenes. No differences in the immunophenotype were found between the L428 and L428KSA cells: both expressed leukocyte activation antigens and some determinants associated with myelomonocytic cells but no lymphoid markers. It is postulated that these phenotypic characteristics derived from secondary genetic events/differentiative reprogramming which produced extinction of primary lymphoid characters, including terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) essential to generation of the Ig and TCR gene rearrangements, and expression of an incomplete set of myelomonocytic markers.","['Athan, E S', 'Paietta, E', 'Papenhausen, P R', 'Augenlicht, L', 'Wiernik, P H', 'Gallagher, R E']","['Athan ES', 'Paietta E', 'Papenhausen PR', 'Augenlicht L', 'Wiernik PH', 'Gallagher RE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Probes', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Genetic Markers', '*Genetic Variation', 'Hodgkin Disease/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/analysis']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Jul;3(7):505-10.,"['Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY 10467.']",['P30CA13330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the antitumor immune response the CD4+:CD8+ T cell ratio decreased significantly and specifically in the restimulated sponges. Depletion of CD8+ but not CD4+ T cells from the tumor immune mice before restimulation significantly reduced the delayed-type hypersensitivity-like response and totally blocked the generation of tumor-specific CTL activity in situ.

The efficacy of lipoamino acids (an ornithine-containing lipid and a serine-containing lipid) in activating C3H/HeSlc mouse peritoneal exudate macrophages was compared with that of bacterial lipopolysaccharide, because the two types of substances were expected to exhibit similar biological activities and physiological functions on the basis of their structural similarities. Actually, the lipoamino acids, as well as lipopolysaccharide, strongly activated the macrophages to generate the immunoregulatory substances prostaglandin E2 and interleukin-1, but their effect on the induction of L929 cell cytolytic factor (a possible tumor necrosis factor), another immunoregulatory substance, was weaker than that of lipopolysaccharide. The effect of lipoamino acids on the cytotoxicity of macrophages for EL-4 leukemia cells was very weak. However, all of these activities, as far as tested, were strongly enhanced by synergistic action with gamma interferon. Only the serine-containing lipid killed both C3H/HeSlc and C3H/HeJ macrophages to almost the same degree as endotoxin killed C3H/HeSlc macrophages. On the other hand, lethal toxicity for mice was not found with either the ornithine-containing lipid or the serine-containing lipid, even when 7 mg of compound was injected into a mouse. These studies suggest that the lipoamino acids are nontoxic characteristic immunoactivators.","['Kawai, Y', 'Akagawa, K']","['Kawai Y', 'Akagawa K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Killer Factors, Yeast)', '0 (Lipid A)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (ornithine containing aminolipid)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Dinoprostone/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis', 'Killer Factors, Yeast', 'L Cells', 'Lipid A/*physiology/toxicity', '*Lipids/physiology/toxicity', 'Macrophage Activation/*drug effects', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', '*Ornithine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/physiology/toxicity', '*Serine/physiology/toxicity']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Infect Immun. 1989 Jul;57(7):2086-91. doi: 10.1128/iai.57.7.2086-2091.1989.,"['Department of Bacteriology, National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Japan.']",,PMC313845,['10.1128/iai.57.7.2086-2091.1989 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

During a 9-month period 78 consecutive febrile episodes occurred in 46 patients who were examined daily. On day 1, before antibiotic treatment was started, members of the normal flora were found in 83%, Candida spp. in 72%, Enterobacteriaceae in 29%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 8%, Staphylococcus aureus in 14%, coagulase-negative staphylococci in 26% and enterococci in 17% of the febrile episodes. During the subsequent antibiotic treatment, the prevalence of members of the normal oral flora was markedly reduced from day 1 (83%) to day 7 (6%), and the normal flora was replaced by potentially pathogenic microorganisms. A rise was found in the prevalences of Candida spp. (from 72 to 92%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (from 26 to 49%) from day 1 to day 4. The prevalences of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa showed no day-to-day changes, and were not different in patients hospitalized for more or less than 24 h prior to inclusion into the study, suggesting that their detection was not due to acquisition during hospitalization or antibiotic treatment.

In lymphoblastic leukemias, there are two molecular subtypes of the Ph1 chromosome, one with a rearrangement of the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) of the BCR gene, producing the same 8.5-kilobase BCR-ABL fusion mRNA seen in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and the other, without a bcr rearrangement, producing a 7.0-kilobase BCR-ABL fusion mRNA that is seen only in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We studied the molecular subtype of the Ph1 chromosome in 11 cases of Ph1-positive ALL, including 2 with a previous diagnosis of CML, using a sensitive method to analyze the mRNA species based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We observed unexpected heterogeneity in BCR-ABL mRNA in this population; in particular, 1 of 6 bcr-rearranged cases and 1 of 5 bcr-unrearranged cases contained none of the known fusion mRNA species, while 1 of the bcr-rearranged cases contained both. This latter case is particularly interesting because it suggests that the acquisition of an additional BCR-ABL fusion species may be a mechanism of disease progression. We conclude that the PCR gives additional information about the Ph1 chromosome gene products that cannot be obtained by genomic analysis, but that it cannot be used as the sole means of detection of this chromosomal abnormality in ALL because of the high incidence of false negative results.","['Hooberman, A L', 'Carrino, J J', 'Leibowitz, D', 'Rowley, J D', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Arlin, Z A', 'Westbrook, C A']","['Hooberman AL', 'Carrino JJ', 'Leibowitz D', 'Rowley JD', 'Le Beau MM', 'Arlin ZA', 'Westbrook CA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', '*Gene Amplification', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/*genetics', 'Reference Values']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Jun;86(11):4259-63. doi: 10.1073/pnas.86.11.4259.,"['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL 60637.']","['CA 42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 44028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 44700-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC287430,['10.1073/pnas.86.11.4259 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The corresponding (6R,S)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro (4, 5) and 7,8-dihydro (31, 32) derivatives were prepared by catalytic hydrogenation. (6S)-11-Deazatetrahydrohomofolate was prepared from 29 by enzymatic reduction. Compounds 29 and 30 had little effect (IC50 greater than 2 x 10(-5) M) on Lactobacillus casei glycinamide ribonucleotide (GAR) formyltransferase but (6R,S)-11-deazatetrahydrohomofolate (4) is a potent inhibitor of this enzyme (IC50 = 5 x 10(-8) M). It is at least 100 times more inhibitory than 33, the 6S compound, indicating that the 6R component of the mixture having the unnatural configuration at C6 (34) is responsible for the potent inhibition. Compound 4 is a much weaker inhibitor of murine (L1210) and human (MOLT-4) leukemia cell GAR formyltransferases (IC50 greater than 1 x 10(-5) M). (6R,S)-11-Deaza-10-methyltetrahydrohomofolate (5) (IC50 = 1.1 x 10(-5) is 200 times weaker than 4 against L. casei GAR formyltransferase. However, 11-deaza-10-methyldihydrohomofolate (32) is more inhibitory (IC50 = 5.5 x 10(-7) M) than 5 or 30. None of the compounds showed inhibition of L. casei aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) formyltransferase, dihydrofolate reductase, or thymidylate synthase. The dihydro derivatives 31 and 32 are 5% as active as dihydrofolate as substrates for L. casei dihydrofolate reductase.

Activation by phorbol esters, diglyceride, and calcium ionophore via protein kinase- independent mechanisms.",9069-76,"It has recently been demonstrated that the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe activates phospholipase D (PLD) in dimethyl sulfoxide-differentiated HL-60 granulocytes to produce phosphatidic acid (PA) and, in the presence of ethanol, phosphatidylethanol (PEt) (Pai, J.-K., Siegel, M. I., Egan, R. W., and Billah, M. M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 12472-12477). We now report that biologically active phorbol esters, a cell-permeable diacylglycerol, 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG), and calcium ionophore A23187 are also potent inducers of PLD in these HL-60 granulocytes. HL-60 granulocytes have been selectively labeled in 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (alkyl-PC) with 32P by incubating the cells with alkyl-[32P]lyso-phosphatidylcholine (PC). When these labeled cells are treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, OAG, or A23187, alkyl-[32P]PA is formed. Because cellular ATP has not been labeled with 32P, the formation of alkyl-[32P]PA conclusively demonstrates PLD activation by these agents. In the presence of 0.5% ethanol, phorbol esters, OAG, and A23187 also induce formation of alkyl-[32P]PEt, demonstrating that the activated PLD catalyzes transphosphatidylation between the phosphatidyl moiety of the alkyl-[32P]PC and ethanol. Formation of alkyl-[32P]PA and alkyl-[32P]PEt in response to these various agents occurs in a time- and dose-dependent manner and exhibits differential Ca2+ requirements. Based on experiments with both [3H]alkyl-PC and alkyl-[32P]PC, it is concluded that alkyl-PA and alkyl-PEt formed in response to PMA, OAG, or A23187 are derived exclusively from PLD action on alkyl-PC. Furthermore, subthreshold concentrations of PMA (0.5-2.0 nM) or OAG (1.0-25 microM) combined with subthreshold levels of A23187 (15-60 nM) induce the formation of alkyl-[32P]PA and alkyl-[32P]PEt, suggesting that receptor-mediated activation of PLD might involve cooperative interactions between Ca2+ and diglyceride. Although PLD is activated by agents that also activate protein kinase C, the protein kinase C inhibitor, K252a, inhibits PMA-induced protein phosphorylation but causes only partial inhibition of PLD activation. We conclude that phorbol esters, OAG, and A23187 activate PLD in HL-60 granulocytes via protein kinase-independent as well as protein kinase-dependent mechanisms.","['Billah, M M', 'Pai, J K', 'Mullmann, T J', 'Egan, R W', 'Siegel, M I']","['Billah MM', 'Pai JK', 'Mullmann TJ', 'Egan RW', 'Siegel MI']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Glycerides)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '86390-77-4 (1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.- (Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Calcimycin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Diglycerides/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glycerides/*pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/*pharmacology', 'Phospholipase D/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1989/05/25 00:00,1989/05/25 00:01,['1989/05/25 00:00'],"['1989/05/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/25 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 May 25;264(15):9069-76.,"['Department of Allergy and Inflammation, Schering-Plough Corporation, Bloomfield, New Jersey 07003.']",,,['S0021-9258(18)81903-2 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The highest incidence of ds-RNA excess (greater than 30%) was observed in patients with acute leukemia (75%), while those displaying it in complete remission phase were 20-25% and in relapse about 80%. A high incidence was also noted in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in blastic crisis (100%) and in patients with multiple myeloma with heavy tumor stage myeloma (78%).

We report that recombinant human TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma are also able to induce functional and morphological maturation in fresh myeloid leukemic cells in vitro. Assessing suspension cultures containing cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (11 patients) or myeloid blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (5 patients), it was found that recombinant human TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma significantly enhanced the number of cells reducing nitroblue tetrazolium, as compared to control cultures containing no cytokine (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.001, respectively). Cells from responders showed alterations characteristic of monocyte/macrophage differentiation, adherence to plastic surfaces, development of positive staining for alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase, typical morphology, and expression of cell surface antigens detected by the monoclonal antibodies Mo-1, Mo-2, and My-4. Both cytokines decreased the number of viable cells, the number of blast cells, and the number of cluster-forming units in suspension culture, suggesting inhibitory actions on the growth capacity of leukemic cells. Compared to the maximum effects of either factor alone, the combination of recombinant human TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma significantly increased the extent of growth inhibition and cell adherence but did not result in further increases in nitroblue tetrazolium reduction. The presence of Auer rods in IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha differentiation-induced macrophages with cells from a patient with M5 acute myeloid leukemia demonstrates that these cytokines can induce differentiation of a leukemic clone in primary cells from patients with leukemia.","['Geissler, K', 'Tricot, G', 'Leemhuis, T', 'Walker, E', 'Broxmeyer, H E']","['Geissler K', 'Tricot G', 'Leemhuis T', 'Walker E', 'Broxmeyer HE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Jun 1;49(11):3057-62.,"['Department of Medicine (Hematology/Oncology), Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46223.']","['CA 36464/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 36740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among a series of fifteen polyamines and polyamine analogs, the most potent inducers of SSAT activity in cultured L1210 cells were found to be N1,N8-bis(ethyl)spermidine (BES) and N1,N12-bis(ethyl)spermine (BESm). Over a 24-hr exposure at 10 microM, enzyme activity rose 13- and 16-fold with BES and BESm, respectively, compared to 2- to 3-fold with the anticancer agent, methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone). The increase in enzyme activity by BESm began rapidly and continued steadily with time so that by 48 hr it increased to about twenty times control. By inhibitor studies, the increase was found to be due to elevated protein synthesis predominantly at the level of translation and to an apparent prolongation of enzyme half-life related to enzyme stabilization. Among the analogs, the structural requirements for maximum enzyme induction were found to be critically dependent on aminopropyl moieties and on the presence, size and location of the alkyl groups. By structure-function comparisons, it was deduced that the known abilities of BES and BESm to regulate ornithine and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activities or to inhibit cell growth occur independently of their effects on SSAT activity in L1210 cells.","['Libby, P R', 'Bergeron, R J', 'Porter, C W']","['Libby PR', 'Bergeron RJ', 'Porter CW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Polyamines)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.57 (diamine N-acetyltransferase)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/*biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Eflornithine/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Polyamines/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1989 May 1;38(9):1435-42. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(89)90182-2.,"['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']","['CA-22153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-25438/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-37606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0006-2952(89)90182-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(89)90182-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study the cellular effects of AMA were characterized for the first time in cultured L1210 leukaemia cells. At the approximate IC50 (concn. giving 50% inhibition; 100 microM), AMA decreased spermidine and spermine by more than 80% at 48 h while increasing putrescine more than 10-fold. As an indication of enzyme specificity, growth inhibition was fully prevented with exogenous spermidine. When compared with the irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), at similar growth-inhibitory concentrations, AMA was less cytotoxic, as determined by colony-formation efficiency. In combination with AMA, DFMO eliminated the rise in putrescine and decreased growth in an additive manner. The near-total depletion of intracellular polyamine pools achieved with the drug combination provided an opportunity to examine the relative abilities of individual polyamines to support growth and viability. Of the three exogenously supplied polyamines, only spermidine fully sustained cell growth and viability at control values during incubations totalling 120 h. By contrast, spermine supported growth at 23% of control and viability at 8%. Putrescine was similarly ineffective, supporting growth at 13% of control and viability at 7%. The data indicate that, in L1210 cells, spermidine is apparently the preferred polyamine in growth-related functions and is capable of fully supporting cell growth by itself. However, because spermine and putrescine can also support growth to some extent, maximum interference with growth and viability is best achieved by strategies which deplete all three polyamine pools.","['Kramer, D L', 'Khomutov, R M', 'Bukin, Y V', 'Khomutov, A R', 'Porter, C W']","['Kramer DL', 'Khomutov RM', 'Bukin YV', 'Khomutov AR', 'Porter CW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Polyamines)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', ""84981-49-7 (S-(5'-deoxyadenosyl-5')-S-methylthioethylhydroxylamine)"", 'EC 4.1.1.- (Carboxy-Lyases)', 'EC 4.1.1.50 (Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Carboxy-Lyases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Deoxyadenosines/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Eflornithine/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Polyamines/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Putrescine/metabolism', 'Spermidine/metabolism', 'Spermine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",1989/04/15 00:00,1989/04/15 00:01,['1989/04/15 00:00'],"['1989/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1989 Apr 15;259(2):325-31. doi: 10.1042/bj2590325.,"['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']","['CA-22153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-24538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1138514,['10.1042/bj2590325 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The DR and DQ molecules were characterized by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) of the specific immunoprecipitates from biosynthetically labeled cells. DR, DQ specific probes were used to characterize the class II transcripts of the corresponding genes. The data obtained with immunofluorescence disclosed two distinct patterns of HLA class II expression leading to two cell surface phenotypes: (DR+DQ+) and (DR+DQ-). In all cases the cells expressed normal amounts of HLA-DR gene products in terms of mRNA. DR cell surface determinants were present in more than 80% of cells in every sample. By 2-D gel analysis DR proteins disclosed the normal classical pattern associating the alpha, beta, and invariant chain gamma with normal level of biosynthesis for alpha and gamma but decreased biosynthesis for one of the beta gene products. Moreover, the three chains demonstrated defect in glycosylation process. In half of the cases studied the cells lacked DQ molecules at the cell surface. DQ alpha and DQ beta transcripts were detected in all cases, although the amount was extremely low in one case. DQ proteins were variable in the DQ+ phenotype and absent in the DQ- one. Interestingly, TPA and rIFN gamma treatment could restore normal glycosylation process of the DR isotype and increase biosynthesis of DQ alpha and beta chains. Those combined results support the view that transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and posttranslational mechanisms underlie the heterogeneity of class II expression observed in CLL. Moreover, 2-D gel analysis may be an invaluable tool for the analysis of the biosynthetic process of class II molecules.","['Kraiba, R', 'Loiseau, P', 'Faille, A', 'Poirier, O', 'Piatier-Tonneau, D', 'Degos, L', 'Abita, J P', 'Charron, D']","['Kraiba R', 'Loiseau P', 'Faille A', 'Poirier O', 'Piatier-Tonneau D', 'Degos L', 'Abita JP', 'Charron D']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (HLA-DQ Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'HLA-DQ Antigens/*analysis', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 May;3(5):386-93.,"['Unite INSERM 204, Cinetique des Populations Cellulaires en Hematologie et Cancerologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Ficoll-Isopaque isolated and T cell-depleted ALL bone marrow samples, IL2 (two cases), IL3 (four cases), and GM-CSF (one case) infrequently stimulated DNA synthesis measured by 3H-thymidine (TdR) uptake, and the other recombinant growth factors completely failed to do so. In repeat experiments with ALL blasts purified by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), IL2, IL3, and GM-CSF responses could not be reproduced, suggesting that nonleukemic contaminant cells, and not the ALL blasts, had been stimulated by these factors. Cocktails containing combinations of IL1-IL4 and IL6 also lacked proliferation inducing potency. Depending on the purity of the incubated ALL cell samples, an impure preparation of B cell growth factors that has been reported to contain a highly effective stimulatory activity for precursor B ALL cells induced proliferation of residual normal cells as well as the ALL cells, as was evident from combined analysis of DNA synthesis and karyotyping. Exposure of the ALL blasts to artificial activators of protein kinase C and Ca2+ mobilization resulted in significant rises in 3H-TdR uptake, suggesting that these intracellular compounds are involved in transducing signals that upregulate proliferation. Although it remains possible that some of the human recombinant growth factors promote the growth of precursor B ALL cells in combination with other stimuli, a dominant role in the regulation of proliferation of these cells cannot be attributed to any of these cytokines at the present time.","['Touw, I', 'Groot-Loonen, J', 'Broeders, L', 'van Agthoven, T', 'Hahlen, K', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Touw I', 'Groot-Loonen J', 'Broeders L', 'van Agthoven T', 'Hahlen K', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Lowenberg B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 May;3(5):356-62.,"['Dr. Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this study was to identify the M phi metabolite(s) that induce these injuries. The stable products of the L-arginine pathway, NO2- and NO3-, were incapable of causing cytostasis under coculture conditions. However, NO2- became cytostatic upon mild acidification, which favors its transformation into nitrogen oxides of greater reactivity. This suggested that NO. (and/or NO2), recently identified as an M phi metabolite of L-arginine, could be a mediator. Authentic NO. caused cytostasis and respiratory inhibition in L1210 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The mitochondrial lesions caused by NO. were confined to complex 1 and 2, a pattern of injury identical to that seen after coculture with activated M phi. Inclusion of NO. scavenger systems prevented cytostasis from developing in M phi-L1210 cocultures. Thus, M phi-generated NO. can account for L-arginine-dependent cytostasis and respiratory inhibition.","['Stuehr, D J', 'Nathan, C F']","['Stuehr DJ', 'Nathan CF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Myoglobin)', '0 (Nitrates)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'S7G510RUBH (Nitrogen Dioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arginine/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Free Radicals', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', '*Leukemia L1210/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myoglobin/metabolism', 'Nitrates/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Nitrogen Dioxide/metabolism', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1989 May 1;169(5):1543-55. doi: 10.1084/jem.169.5.1543.,"['Beatrice and Samuel A.

Though the consistency of these abnormal findings in patients with Ph-positive leukaemia is strong evidence for their pathogenetic role, there are still many unanswered questions.","['Goldman, J M']",['Goldman JM'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis/genetics/pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/ultrastructure', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/physiology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1989 Jan;4 Suppl 1:129-30.,"['Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London.']",,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,

A new bcr-abl mRNA is expressed in these cases. We have developed a modified polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of this mRNA. The method is extremely sensitive, reliable, and relatively fast. The analysis of peripheral blood or bone marrow cells from CML patients treated with chemotherapy shows that the two possible mRNAs are expressed in various combinations. Our results show that even after myeloablative therapy for bone marrow transplantation bcr-abl mRNAs are still expressed. Further studies, however, are necessary to determine the clinical relevance of a small number of persisting cells expressing the bcr-abl mRNA.","['Lange, W', 'Snyder, D S', 'Castro, R', 'Rossi, J J', 'Blume, K G']","['Lange W', 'Snyder DS', 'Castro R', 'Rossi JJ', 'Blume KG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Blood Cells/physiology', 'Bone Marrow/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1989 May 1;73(6):1735-41.,"['Stanford University School of Medicine, CA.']",['CA 33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['S0006-4971(20)78984-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Using Northern blot analysis, total cellular RNA was prepared from cells harvested at different time points and hybridized with DNA clones specific for the protooncogenes c-fos and c-myc. While untreated control cells lacked detectable amounts of messenger RNA (mRNA), increase in the level of c-fos mRNA was noted as early as 0.5 h after exposure to the inducers. Peaks of c-fos and c-myc transcript accumulation were seen at 1 h and 4 h after induction, respectively. The most effective inducer was double stimulation with TPA plus A23187. The kinetics of c-fos and c-myc mRNA accumulation in B-CLL appear to be similar to those reported for normal lymphocytes that have been either activated by physiologic external stimuli or by direct activators of protein kinase C and calcium flux (such as TPA and A23187). No direct link between oncogene expression and proliferation or differentiation parameters could be established. These results document that expression of c-fos and c-myc genes, which are among the earliest events following stimulation of the protein kinase signal transduction pathway, can be successfully induced in B-CLL cells. The data provide further evidence for the hypothesis that signal transmission downstream of protein kinase C is intact in B-CLL.","['Drexler, H G', 'Janssen, J W', 'Brenner, M K', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Bartram, C R']","['Drexler HG', 'Janssen JW', 'Brenner MK', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Bartram CR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1989 May 1;73(6):1656-63.,"['Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, Department of Haematology, London, England.']",,,['S0006-4971(20)78972-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,
