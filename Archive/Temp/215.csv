This randomized study evaluated the effect of warfarin with chemotherapy and radiation therapy in limited-stage SCLC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive warfarin or no warfarin. All patients received three cycles of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide (ACE). Cycles 4 and 5 (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide [PCE]) were given concurrently with radiation therapy. Three cycles of ACE were given after chemoradiation therapy, but were discontinued due to a high rate of pulmonary toxicity. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in response rates, survival, failure-free survival, disease-free survival, or patterns of relapse between the warfarin-treated and control groups. In patients treated according to the initial design, an increase in failure-free survival seen with warfarin treatment approached significance (P = .07). Preamendment results, while not significant, did not have superimposable treatment survival curves. A landmark analysis at 8 months showed a median survival time after the landmark for complete responders of 33 months with warfarin treatment compared with < or = 13.75 months for complete or partial responders not treated with warfarin (P = .05). Differences between the complete responders in this preamendment population were not significant (P = .103). CONCLUSION: Warfarin does not appear to improve outcome significantly in limited-stage SCLC. However, the differences in some variables between populations before the protocol amendment correspond to the favorable effects of anticoagulants observed in previous studies.","['Maurer, L H', 'Herndon, J E 2nd', 'Hollis, D R', 'Aisner, J', 'Carey, R W', 'Skarin, A T', 'Perry, M C', 'Eaton, W L', 'Zacharski, L L', 'Hammond, S', 'Green, M R']","['Maurer LH', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Hollis DR', 'Aisner J', 'Carey RW', 'Skarin AT', 'Perry MC', 'Eaton WL', 'Zacharski LL', 'Hammond S', 'Green MR']","['Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH 03756, USA.

A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of octreotide in the management of diarrhea in patients with GVHD after allogeneic BMT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients entered the study. Patients received either peripheral-blood stem cells (n = 13) or bone marrow (n = 8). Seven patients had grade 4, 13 grade 3, and one grade 2 GVHD. Intravenous (I.V.) octreotide 500 microg every 8 hours for 7 days was administered. Octreotide treatment was discontinued if no response was observed after 7 days or for grade 4 toxicity. RESULTS: Fifteen (71%) of 21 treated patients had a complete response within 7 days of the initiation of octreotide; three (14%) had a partial response and three (14%) failed to respond to treatment. Toxicities were minimal; hyperglycemia was seen in four patients and one patient developed a partial ileus. Octreotide was discontinued and the ileus resolved within 48 hours. CONCLUSION: If initiated early in the course of GI GVHD, octreotide appears to be an effective, well-tolerated agent in reducing severe voluminous diarrhea. Octreotide should be discontinued within 24 hours after the resolution of diarrhea to avoid the development of ileus. Because no additional reduction in the volume of diarrhea occurred after 7 days of therapy, continuation of the drug beyond this time is not cost effective.","['Ippoliti, C', 'Champlin, R', 'Bugazia, N', 'Przepiorka, D', 'Neumann, J', 'Giralt, S', 'Khouri, I', 'Gajewski, J']","['Ippoliti C', 'Champlin R', 'Bugazia N', 'Przepiorka D', 'Neumann J', 'Giralt S', 'Khouri I', 'Gajewski J']","['Department of Hematology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA. cippolit@notes.mdacc.tmc.edu']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Gastrointestinal Agents)', 'RWM8CCW8GP (Octreotide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Diarrhea/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*complications', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/chemically induced', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Octreotide/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/11/18 00:00,1997/11/18 00:01,['1997/11/18 00:00'],"['1997/11/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.11.3350 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 Nov;15(11):3350-4. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.11.3350.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty patients presented with Hodgkin's disease and a mediastinal mass greater than one third the greatest chest diameter on chest radiograph. Patients were staged and treated with MOPP alternated with ABVD chemotherapy for a total of six cycles. Patients then received 10 Gy mantle-field radiation therapy delivered to the original extent of disease followed by 25 to 35 Gy to the residual abnormalities. RESULTS: The complete response (CR) rate was 89%. With a median follow-up duration of 10 years, disease-free survival of the complete responders is 78% at 15 years and overall survival is 75% at 15 years. For patients with stage I or II disease, disease-free survival was 76% at 15 years and overall survival was 79%; for those with stage III or IV disease, disease-free survival was 82% at 15 years and overall survival was 64%. Age, stage, sex, B symptoms, number of extranodal sites, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and platelet count did not influence treatment outcome. Treatment-related pneumonitis was noted in 16% of patients (fatal in one), mainly in those older than age 35 years who received total doses of radiation therapy greater than 42 Gy. Fertility is more often preserved with MOPP/ABVD therapy than with MOPP chemotherapy and there appears to be less pulmonary and cardiac disease than with ABVD chemotherapy. Two patients have developed second solid tumors within radiation ports and one relapsed patient developed acute leukemia after MOPP salvage therapy. CONCLUSION: MOPP/ABVD followed by mantle-field radiation therapy is an effective treatment for all stages of Hodgkin's disease that present with a large mediastinal mass. Our data suggest that the large mediastinal mass is a more dominant determinant of prognosis than Ann Arbor stage or other clinical prognostic factors.","['Longo, D L', 'Glatstein, E', 'Duffey, P L', 'Young, R C', 'Ihde, D C', 'Bastian, A W', 'Wilson, W H', 'Wittes, R E', 'Jaffe, E S', 'Hubbard, S M', 'DeVita, V T Jr']","['Longo DL', 'Glatstein E', 'Duffey PL', 'Young RC', 'Ihde DC', 'Bastian AW', 'Wilson WH', 'Wittes RE', 'Jaffe ES', 'Hubbard SM', 'DeVita VT Jr']","['Medicine Branch, Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ABVD protocol', 'MOPP protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/administration & dosage', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Prospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1997/11/18 19:04,2001/03/28 10:01,['1997/11/18 19:04'],"['1997/11/18 19:04 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1997/11/18 19:04 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.11.3338 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 Nov;15(11):3338-46. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.11.3338.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the tumorigenicity in lymphoid tissues, a series of HTLV-I pX transgenic rats (lck-pX rats) which expressed the pX gene under control of lymphocyte specific protein tyrosine kinase (p56 lck) gene type 1 promoter was produced. In some lines of lck-pX rats, pX mRNA was expressed selectively in the thymus, lymph nodes and spleen as expected. However, pX mRNA expression was also detected in other tissues from other lines of lck-pX rats. Thymic tumor with epithelial markers developed in lck-pX rats as early as 8 weeks of age and high expression of pX mRNA was detected in the tumor tissue.

We recently reported that a wide spectrum of collagen vascular diseases, including inflammatory arthropathy resembling rheumatoid arthritis, myocarditis, dermatitis, necrotizing arteritis, myositis and sialoadenitis similar to Sjogren's syndrome, developed in the transgenic rat carrying HTLV-I env-pX region under the control of its own long terminal repeat (env-pX rat). To investigate the pathogenetic role of these diseases, cell surface molecules and functions of lymphocytes from env-pX rats were examined in this study. In env-pX rats with diseases, not only infiltrating lymphocytes in the inflammatory sites but also peripheral lymphocytes expressed a large number of co-stimulating molecules such as CD80/86 and ICAM-1, compared with those of normal rats or rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis or myosin-induced myocarditis. Moreover, the expression of CD80/86 and ICAM-1 was already up-regulated on the surface of peripheral lymphocytes in env-pX rat before developing any diseases. Lymphocytes, taken from env-pX rats immunized with myosin in vivo, showed significantly higher cellular response against myosin in vitro than those of normal rats. Lymphocytes from env-pX rats also showed the hyper-reactivity to the stimulation by super-antigens, but no significant difference of the usage of T cell receptor V beta was found compared with those of normal rats. These results suggest that the env-pX transgene may induce the high expression of CD80/86 and ICAM-1 on the lymphocytes and the resulting hyper-immune responsiveness in env-pX rats.","['Nakamaru, Y']",['Nakamaru Y'],"['Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['jpn'],,['Journal Article'],Japan,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi,[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science,17410290R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (Cd86 protein, rat)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'B7-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'Collagen Diseases/*etiology', '*Genes, Viral', '*Genes, env', '*Genes, pX', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Myosins/immunology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Up-Regulation']",1997/11/18 00:00,1997/11/18 00:01,['1997/11/18 00:00'],"['1997/11/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/18 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi. 1997 Sep;72(5):529-44.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we compare the potential of Tc and natural killer (NK) cells of mice deficient in both gzmA and B (gzmAxB-/-) with those from single knockout mice deficient in gzmA (-/-), gzmB (-/-), or perforin (-/-) to induce nuclear damage and lysis in target cells. With the exception of perforin-/-, all in vitro- and ex vivo-derived Tc and NK cell populations from the mutant strains induced 51Cr-release in target cells at levels and with kinetics similar to those of normal mice. This contrasts with their capacity to induce apoptotic nuclear damage in target cells. In gzmAxB-/- mice, Tc/NK-mediated target cell DNA fragmentation was not observed, even after extended incubation periods (10 h), but was normal in gzmA-deficient and only impaired in gzmB-deficient mice in short-term (2-4 h), but not long-term (4-10 h), nucleolytic assays. This suggests that gzmA and B are critical for Tc/NK granule- mediated nucleolysis, with gzmB being the main contributor, while target cell lysis is due solely to perforin and independent of both proteases.","['Simon, M M', 'Hausmann, M', 'Tran, T', 'Ebnet, K', 'Tschopp, J', 'ThaHla, R', 'Mullbacher, A']","['Simon MM', 'Hausmann M', 'Tran T', 'Ebnet K', 'Tschopp J', 'ThaHla R', 'Mullbacher A']","['Max-Planck-Institut fur Immunbiology, Freiburg, Germany. simon@immunbiol.mpg.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Gzmb protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*enzymology/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Female', 'Granzymes', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Lymphoma', 'Male', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*enzymology/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/12/31 00:00,1997/12/31 00:01,['1997/12/31 00:00'],"['1997/12/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/12/31 00:01 [medline]', '1997/12/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.186.10.1781 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1997 Nov 17;186(10):1781-6. doi: 10.1084/jem.186.10.1781.,,PMC2199142,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differentiation is inhibited by cAMP analogues and the adenyl cyclase-stimulating agent forskolin. We found that these drugs prevented the late down-regulation of c-myb which is known to be critical for MEL cell differentiation. Since the increase in c-myb mRNA levels was due to increased mRNA transcription, we examined the transcription factors NF-kappaB and AP-1 which have been implicated in the regulation of c-myb expression. Binding of MEL cell nuclear proteins to a NF-kappaB recognition sequence in c-myb intron I was strongly induced by 8-Br-cAMP or forskolin; induction was delayed and correlated with the up-regulation of c-myb. The cAMP-induced NF-kappaB complex contained p50 and RelB; in co-transfection assays, p50 and RelB transactivated a reporter construct containing the c-myb intronic NF-kappaB site upstream of a minimal promoter. 8-Br-cAMP and forskolin also increased the DNA binding activity of AP-1 complexes containing JunB, JunD and c-Fos in MEL cells which could cooperate with NF-kappaB. We conclude that inhibition of MEL cell differentiation by pharmacological doses of cAMP can be explained by the up-regulation of c-myb which is mediated, at least in part, by NF-kappaB p50/RelB heterodimers.","['Suhasini, M', 'Reddy, C D', 'Reddy, E P', 'DiDonato, J A', 'Pilz, R B']","['Suhasini M', 'Reddy CD', 'Reddy EP', 'DiDonato JA', 'Pilz RB']","['Department of Medicine and Cancer Centre, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Genes, Reporter', '*Introns', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', '*Oncogenes', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/11/15 00:00,1997/11/15 00:01,['1997/11/15 00:00'],"['1997/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201530 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1997 Oct 9;15(15):1859-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201530.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary mechanism for bone destruction in patients with myeloma and lymphoma is increased osteoclastic bone resorption. In patients with multiple myeloma, new bone formation is also inhibited. Mediators including lymphotoxin, interleukin-1beta, parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP), and interleukin-6, produced by the myeloma cells or by marrow stromal cells in response to myeloma cells, have been implicated as osteoclast-activating factors (OAF) in multiple myeloma. However, most studies to identify OAF produced by myeloma cells have been inconclusive. METHODS: To try to identify the OAF produced by myeloma cells, we developed an in vivo model of human myeloma bone disease using the ARH-77 myeloma cell line transplanted into severe combined immunodeficiency mice. RESULTS: We found that a novel cytokine(s) may be responsible for bone destruction. Interleukin-1 and PTHrP mediate bone destruction in patients with ATL. These factors can be detected in media conditioned by ATL cells or by lymphocytes infected with HTLV-1. Furthermore, serum PTHrP levels are increased in ATL patients. In patients with Hodgkin's disease or other types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1,25-(OH)2D3 or PTHrP is produced by the lymphoma cells and mediates bone destruction. Chemotherapy or resection of the lymphoma decreases 1,25-(OH)2D3 levels and hypercalcemia in these patients. CONCLUSION: Thus, OAF produced locally by the tumor or the marrow microenvironment play an important role in the bone destruction seen in patients with hematologic malignancies.","['Roodman, G D']",['Roodman GD'],"['Department of Medicine/Hematology, Audie Murphy Veterans Administration Hospital, San Antonio, Texas 78284, USA.']",['eng'],['CA 69136-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Resorption/*etiology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/*etiology', 'Interleukin-1/*physiology', 'Interleukin-6/*physiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*complications/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Osteoblasts/physiology', 'Osteolysis/etiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/physiology']",1997/11/15 13:26,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/11/15 13:26'],"['1997/11/15 13:26 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/11/15 13:26 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19971015)80:8+<1557::AID-CNCR5>3.0.CO;2-H [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19971015)80:8+<1557::aid-cncr5>3.3.co;2-k [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1997 Oct 15;80(8 Suppl):1557-63. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19971015)80:8+<1557::aid-cncr5>3.3.co;2-k.,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From retrospective analysis of sera from a clinically well-defined Canadian series of 170 PBC patients included into a 24-month therapeutic trial of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), we report the prevalence of these ANA and their dynamics in the course of the disease. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), anti-Sp100 autoantibodies were shown in 35 (21%) patients. Thirty-three patients (19%) had autoantibodies against PML as determined by indirect immunostaining of cells overexpressing PML. Altogether, anti-nuclear dot autoantibodies were present in 25% of the 170 PBC patients. Their occurrence correlated with an unfavorable disease course, because these patients progressed significantly more frequently from early stages (I/II) to late stages (III/IV) within the 24-month observation period (P < .05). During the course of the disease, the autoantibody levels against the Sp100 full-length protein remained nearly constant in all 35 positive patients. However, 9 patients showed remarkable changes in Sp100 epitope recognition as revealed by ELISA and immunoblotting. When the occurrence of these changes and the treatment of the patients were compared retrospectively, it became evident that 8 of the 9 patients had received UDCA (42% of all Sp100-positive patients treated with UDCA). These findings indicate subtle changes of the Sp100 epitope recognition pattern during the natural course of the disease and its induction or acceleration by UDCA treatment. This implies that UDCA can modulate immunoglobulin (Ig) expression not only quantitatively, but also qualitatively.","['Zuchner, D', 'Sternsdorf, T', 'Szostecki, C', 'Heathcote, E J', 'Cauch-Dudek, K', 'Will, H']","['Zuchner D', 'Sternsdorf T', 'Szostecki C', 'Heathcote EJ', 'Cauch-Dudek K', 'Will H']","['Heinrich-Pette-Institut fur experimentelle Virologie und Immunologie an der Universitat Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Autoantibodies/analysis/*immunology', 'Autoantigens/*immunology', 'Cell Nucleus/immunology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Liver Cirrhosis, Biliary/*immunology/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*immunology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*immunology', 'Organelles/immunology', 'Prevalence']",1997/11/15 00:00,1997/11/15 00:01,['1997/11/15 00:00'],"['1997/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0270913997004734 [pii]', '10.1002/hep.510260506 [doi]']",ppublish,Hepatology. 1997 Nov;26(5):1123-30. doi: 10.1002/hep.510260506.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We collaborated in a worldwide overview of all clinical trials in which patients with CML were randomly assigned to receive either IFN alpha as the main drug or standard chemotherapy. Trials were identified by electronic and hand searching of the medical literature and databases and by personal contact. Individual patient data were available for each of 1554 patients who had been randomly assigned to treatment in seven trials (German, Italian, British, French, Japanese, and ""Benelux""). Intention-to-treat stratified logrank survival analyses were performed, reporting two-sided P values. RESULTS: Almost all of the patients in these trials had disease with the Philadelphia chromosome abnormality. Among those who did, the regimens that involved IFN alpha produced a statistically significantly better survival than those involving either hydroxyurea (P = .001) or busulfan (P = .00007) alone. The 5-year survival rates were 57% with IFN alpha and 42% with chemotherapy, with an absolute difference of 15% (standard deviation = 3%; P<.00001).

Immunocytochemical and cytochemical labelings of these proteins were used to reveal r-chromatin in situ and to investigate its spatial organization within NORs by confocal microscopy and by electron tomography. For each labeling, confocal microscopy revealed small and large double-spotted NORs and crescent-shaped NORs. Their internal three-dimensional (3D) organization was studied by using electron tomography on specifically silver-stained NORs. The 3D reconstructions allow us to conclude that the argyrophilic NOR proteins are grouped as a fiber of 60-80 nm in diameter that constitutes either one part of a turn or two or three turns of a helix within small and large double-spotted NORs, respectively. Within crescent-shaped NORs, virtual slices reveal that the fiber constitutes several longitudinally twisted loops, grouped as two helical 250- to 300-nm coils, each centered on a nonargyrophilic axis of condensed chromatin.

An overview.,1-7,"Anthracyclines are widely used and effective antineoplastic drugs. Although active against a wide variety of solid tumours and haematological malignancies, their clinical use is hindered by tumour resistance and toxicity to healthy tissue. Modification of the general anthracycline ring structure results in analogues with different but overlapping antitumour and tolerability profiles. Activity of the anthracyclines is related to topoisomerase II inhibition, which occurs as a result of anthracycline intercalation between adjacent DNA base pairs. Production of hydroxyl free radicals is associated with antitumour effects and toxicity to healthy tissues. Myocardial tissue is particularly susceptible to free radical damage. Development of tumour cell resistance to anthracyclines involves a number of mechanisms, including P-glycoprotein-mediated resistance. The classical dose-limiting adverse effects of this class of drugs are acute myelosuppression and cumulative dose-related cardiotoxicity. Anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy is often irreversible and may lead to clinical congestive heart failure. Other toxicities of the anthracyclines, including stomatitis, nausea and vomiting, alopecia and 'radiation recall' reactions, are generally reversible. Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity may be reduced or prevented by an administration schedule that produces low peak plasma drug concentrations. Administration of dexrazoxane also provides cardioprotection. Dose intensification of anthracyclines may partly overcome resistance but is associated with reduced tolerability. Liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin or daunorubicin alters the pharmacokinetic properties of the drugs. Increased distribution in tumours, prolonged circulation and reduced free drug concentrations in plasma may increase antitumour activity and improve the tolerability of the anthracyclines.","['Hortobagyi, G N']",['Hortobagyi GN'],"['University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/11/15 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00003495-199700544-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs. 1997;54 Suppl 4:1-7. doi: 10.2165/00003495-199700544-00003.,53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since it can be produced by glia and other nonneural cells, LIF is a candidate target-derived differentiation factor as well as an injury-response factor. We here provide evidence that LIF can be produced by neurons and can act on the neurons that produce it. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay detects LIF mRNA in rat sympathetic neuron cultures, and in situ hybridization combined with MAP2 immunocytochemistry indicates that most of the cells expressing LIF mRNA are, in fact, neurons. The neuronal lysate as well as the conditioned medium contains proteins that are specifically recognized by anti-LIF antibodies, and these antibodies also specifically stain the cultured neurons. In addition, concentrated sympathetic neuron conditioned medium can mimic the effects of LIF, and incubation of high-density sympathetic neuron cultures with anti-LIF antibodies reduces basal expression levels of LIF target genes such as particular neuropeptides, indicating that the endogenously produced cytokine is acting on the neurons under these conditions. Since we show that LIF transcript is expressed in sympathetic and sensory neurons in vivo as well, LIF could act in an autocrine fashion under a variety of physiological conditions.","['Cheng, J G', 'Patterson, P H']","['Cheng JG', 'Patterson PH']","['Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena 91125, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Neurosci,Molecular and cellular neurosciences,9100095,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autocrine Communication/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Neurons/metabolism/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion/cytology/*physiology']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/11/15 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1044-7431(97)90635-7 [pii]', '10.1006/mcne.1997.0635 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Neurosci. 1997;9(5-6):372-80. doi: 10.1006/mcne.1997.0635.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we further characterized the RB interior cleavage process in human leukemia cells treated with the anticancer agent etoposide. We found that the RB interior cleavage activity was much more sensitive to two specific tetrapeptide caspase inhibitors, YVAD-CMK and DEVD-FMK, than the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage activity, suggesting that two distinct caspases are involved in these processes. Several Asp residues are located in amino acids 341-421 of RB protein, and cleavage of any one of these sites by a caspase would generate a p48, which contains the amino terminus, and a p68 fragment, which contains the A/B pocket and the carboxyl terminus. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that the p48 and p68 fragments had selective binding affinity to different RB antibodies and that the p48 was found only in the low-salt-extracted cytoplasmic fraction, while the p68 was only in the nuclear fraction, of the apoptotic cells. However, the nuclear binding partner of the p68 RB fragment is not the transcription factor E2F-1 since a specific E2F-1 antibody coimmunoprecipitated only the unphosphorylated form of RB, but not the p68 fragment. Lastly, we confirmed that RB also underwent dephosphorylation and carboxyl terminal cleavage during apoptosis, as we and others reported previously.","['Fattman, C L', 'An, B', 'Dou, Q P']","['Fattman CL', 'An B', 'Dou QP']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['1 R55 AG/OD13300-01/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AG 13300/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (N-acetyl-tyrosyl-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl chloromethyl ketone)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factor DP1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Asparagine/metabolism', '*Carrier Proteins', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'E2F Transcription Factors', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Peptide Fragments/analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1', 'Transcription Factor DP1', 'Transcription Factors/analysis']",1997/11/15 13:23,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/11/15 13:23'],"['1997/11/15 13:23 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/11/15 13:23 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4644(19971201)67:3<399::AID-JCB11>3.0.CO;2-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1997 Dec 1;67(3):399-408.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has been difficult to study because of the lack of isoform-specific inhibitors. Based on the use of the Group VI Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) inhibitor bromoenol lactone (BEL), we previously suggested a role for the iPLA2 in mediating phospholipid fatty acid turnover (Balsinde, J., Bianco, I. D., Ackermann, E. J., Conde-Frieboes, K., and Dennis, E. A. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92: 8527-8531). We have now further evaluated the role of the iPLA2 in phospholipid remodeling by using antisense RNA technology. We show herein that inhibition of iPLA2 expression by a specific antisense oligonucleotide decreases both the steady-state levels of lysophosphatidylcholine and the capacity of the cell to incorporate arachidonic acid into membrane phospholipids. These effects correlate with a decrease in both iPLA2 activity and protein in the antisense-treated cells. Collectively these data provide further evidence that the iPLA2 plays a major role in regulating phospholipid fatty acyl turnover in P388D1 macrophages. In stark contrast, experiments with activated cells confirmed that the iPLA2 does not play a significant role in receptor-coupled arachidonate mobilization in these cells, as manifested by the lack of an effect of the iPLA2 antisense oligonucleotide on PAF-stimulated arachidonate release.","['Balsinde, J', 'Balboa, M A', 'Dennis, E A']","['Balsinde J', 'Balboa MA', 'Dennis EA']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093-0601, USA.']",['eng'],"['GM 20501/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HD 26171/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Pyrones)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '88070-98-8 (6-(bromomethylene)tetrahydro-3-(1-naphthaleneyl)-2H-pyran-2-one)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonic Acid/*metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Membrane Lipids/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Naphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Phospholipases A/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Phospholipids/*metabolism', 'Pyrones/pharmacology']",1997/11/20 00:00,1997/11/20 00:01,['1997/11/20 00:00'],"['1997/11/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/20 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.46.29317 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)50888-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Nov 14;272(46):29317-21. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.46.29317.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the GATA-1 protein in K562 nuclear extracts binds to this motif. Cotransfection of the enhancer containing reporter construct with a GATA-1 expression vector showed that GATA-1 transactivated this enhancer, increasing the CAT reporter activity 10-15-fold. Similar analysis of the c-Myb motif by cotransfection with the enhancer CAT reporter construct and a c-Myb expression vector showed that c-Myb transactivated the enhancer by 5-fold.

The presence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and androgen receptor (AR) have revealed in breast carcinomas, but they have not been correlated to the bcl-2 protein expression and DNA fragmentation markers. We evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of bcl-2 protein and hormonal receptors (ER, PR, AR) and differentiation grade in 37 infiltrating ductal carcinomas of the breast for which frozen tissues were available for DNA extraction. The immunohistochemical reaction for bcl-2 was considered positive if more than 50% of neoplastic cells had intense cytoplasmic staining, whereas for steroid receptor evaluation Battifora's criteria were used. The DNA was extracted according to the phenol-chloroform procedure and used for bcl-2 gene rearrangement study of the major breakpoint region (Southern blot) and for membrane-based end-labeling using digoxigenin-labeled nucleotides and E. coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment). The results were quantified by three different observers. Low-grade carcinomas were positive for bcl-2 protein (27/28, 96.4%) and ER (15/28, 53.6%), whereas the remaining neoplasms were negative for bcl-2 (9/9, 100.0%) and ER (8/9, 53.6%) (p < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were revealed at the bcl-2, PR and AR comparisons. The Southern blot analysis for bcl-2 major breakpoint region showed neither rearrangement nor genetic amplification (densitometric study). Only the membrane-based end-labeling of DNA fragments showed correlation with bcl-2 protein and ER expressions: all except one bcl-2-negative tumor and two bcl-2-positive tumors had positive labeling using 7 pg of DNA at dot blot analysis (p < 0.002). The bcl-2 protein expression would allow both proliferation and cell progression by blocking apoptosis in well-differentiated, ER-positive breast carcinomas. In these neoplasms, DNA fragmentation as a molecular marker of apoptosis was prevented by bcl-2 expression.","['Diaz-Cano, S J', 'Garcia-Moliner, M', 'Carney, W', 'Wolfe, H J']","['Diaz-Cano SJ', 'Garcia-Moliner M', 'Carney W', 'Wolfe HJ']","['Department of Pathology, Tufts University-New England Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Diagn Mol Pathol,"Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B",9204924,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/*metabolism/pathology', '*DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Androgen/metabolism', 'Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism', 'Receptors, Progesterone/metabolism', 'Receptors, Steroid/*metabolism']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00019606-199708000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Mol Pathol. 1997 Aug;6(4):199-208. doi: 10.1097/00019606-199708000-00004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To prevent graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD), they were administered postgrafting immunosuppression with a short course of intermittent methotrexate with daily cyclosporine for no more than 11 days. Customarily, we have given cyclosporine for 180 days after transplant. In the current study, we asked whether cyclosporine could be stopped earlier without affecting the risk of chronic GVHD. By day 60, patients who never had acute GVHD, or whose acute GVHD had resolved, were randomized to have cyclosporine stopped (n = 52) or continued for the usual 180 days (n = 51). Results were analyzed with a median follow-up of 9.3 years after transplant, and showed that patients in whom cyclosporine was discontinued on day 60 had a significantly more rapid onset (p = 0.001), but not a significantly higher overall incidence of chronic GVHD than those in whom the drug was stopped on day 180 (43 vs. 54%; p = 0.26). Transplant-related mortality was comparable among patients without preceding acute GVHD, regardless of when cyclosporine was discontinued (11% for both study arms). However, transplant-related mortality appeared to increase among patients with preceding acute GVHD in whom cyclosporine was stopped by day 60 (38 vs. 17%). Results suggest that cyclosporine can safely be discontinued early in patients who never had evidence of acute GVHD, while those with preceding acute GVHD would benefit from a longer course of the drug. Because of the relatively small sample sizes, these results would best be treated as promising preliminary findings that should be confirmed in larger randomized studies.","['Storb, R', 'Leisenring, W', 'Anasetti, C', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Deeg, H J', 'Doney, K', 'Martin, P', 'Sullivan, K M', 'Witherspoon, R', 'Pettinger, M', 'Bensinger, W', 'Buckner, C D', 'Clift, R', 'Flowers, M E', 'Hansen, J A', 'Pepe, M', 'Chauncey, T', 'Sanders, J', 'Thomas, E D']","['Storb R', 'Leisenring W', 'Anasetti C', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Deeg HJ', 'Doney K', 'Martin P', 'Sullivan KM', 'Witherspoon R', 'Pettinger M', 'Bensinger W', 'Buckner CD', 'Clift R', 'Flowers ME', 'Hansen JA', 'Pepe M', 'Chauncey T', 'Sanders J', 'Thomas ED']","['Divisions of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center; Seattle, WA 98104, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Cyclosporine/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Karnofsky Performance Status', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Failure']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 1997 Oct;3(4):194-201.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of the p190 bcr-abl protein product is specifically inhibited as demonstrated by Western blot analysis. Cell growth of the Sup-B15 cells is completely inhibited by anti-p190 RZs over four days in culture. Anti-p210 RZs have no significant effect on bcr-abl protein expression or cell growth by Sup-B15 cells.

Although a skin test was negative to Cyt at the concentration of 4 micrograms/ml, we decided on placebo-controlled administration of the drug. The Cyt was well tolerated, and urine values of N-methylhistamine showed no important variations throughout this period compared to those during the placebo administration. Skin tests carried out 14 days after the study were positive at the concentration of 4 micrograms/ml. The history of different episodes of allergic reactions to Cyt, the last one being the most severe, indicated the possible participation of an immediate hypersensitivity phenomenon, but because no studies had been carried out initially, we could not establish the presence of IgE antibodies. These results indicate that good tolerance existed after the control administration procedure. The long interval, 3 years, between the allergic episode and our protocol and the appearance of a positive skin test 14 days after the protocol indicated that the subject had lost sensitivity and become resensitized after the controlled administration procedure.","['Blanca, M', 'Torres, M J', 'Giron, M', 'Corzo, J L', 'Martinez-Valverde, A']","['Blanca M', 'Torres MJ', 'Giron M', 'Corzo JL', 'Martinez-Valverde A']","['Paediatric Department, Regional Hospital, Malaga, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Denmark,Allergy,Allergy,7804028,"['0 (Methylhistamines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'Y7QR253130 (N-methylhistamine)']",IM,"['Anaphylaxis/*chemically induced', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/*immunology/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Methylhistamines/analysis/urine', 'Skin Tests']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1398-9995.1997.tb02422.x [doi]'],ppublish,Allergy. 1997 Oct;52(10):1009-11. doi: 10.1111/j.1398-9995.1997.tb02422.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several recombinant DNA factors that alter neutrophil proliferation and function, and are characterised by their ability to stimulate colony formation of myeloid progenitors in vitro, have been shown to alter clinical sequelae associated with neutropenia in vivo. Two of these factors, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), have been approved by the US FDA. One other factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), is approved as indicated therapy in Japan. The clinical effects of these agents are compared in this review. Results of clinical trials suggest that the efficacy of G-CSF is greatest when used as an agent to enhance circulation of stem cells and pre-colony-forming progenitor cells. It is also an effective agent in reducing the duration of neutropenia following dose-intensive chemotherapy, thereby leading to a reduction in the incidence of febrile neutropenia. Similar observations were made with GM-CSF, although toxicity with the latter agent appears to be moderately greater than that observed with G-CSF. Functional activity of GM-CSF is broader than that of G-CSF, in that macrophages are affected by GM-CSF. As a result, some data suggest that GM-CSF may be more applicable to patients with a high risk of infection. There is a suggestion that M-CSF assists neutrophil recovery, although this effect may be indirect, via the induction of other cytokines. The predominant effect of M-CSF appears to be enhancement of macrophage and monocyte function, which may reduce the severity and duration of fungal infection.","['Nemunaitis, J']",['Nemunaitis J'],"['Physician Reliance Network, Inc., Dallas, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,"['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Mycoses/*drug therapy']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00003495-199754050-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs. 1997 Nov;54(5):709-29. doi: 10.2165/00003495-199754050-00004.,231,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biological and clinical considerations. Part 1. Myelodysplasias and the acute leukemias.,231-40,"The different therapeutic options that may be employed in the treatment of elderly patients with acute leukemias and myelodysplastic states are considered following an analysis of certain biological features, that have been investigated by cytochemical, cytogenetic and cytokinetic techniques, immunophenotyping, and studies on G-6-PD isoenzymes. These studies imply that in the elderly the pattern of hematological malignancies and the lack of response to conventional treatment derive from intrinsic biological differences between these pathological states in older and younger patients. Treatment in elderly patients has ranged from palliative treatment to intensive chemotherapy, often with disappointing results in both cases. Palliative treatment does not induce remissions, and median survival is short. On the other hand, elderly patients do not tolerate well both induction and post-remission therapy due to the degree of toxicity and the effects of drug-induced pancytopenia. In this scenario, in vitro drug-sensitivity testing and karyotyping assume increasing importance, because they may predict which patients are likely to benefit from intensive therapy. In both acute leukemias and myelodysplasias, treatment ideally should be designed case by case, according to the hematological, clinical and biological features.","['Quaglino, D', 'Furia, N', 'Di Leonardo, G', 'Limoncelli, P', 'Campitelli, A']","['Quaglino D', 'Furia N', 'Di Leonardo G', 'Limoncelli P', 'Campitelli A']","[""Department of Internal Medicine, University of L'Aquila, Italy.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Aging (Milano),"Aging (Milan, Italy)",9102503,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF03341826 [doi]'],ppublish,Aging (Milano). 1997 Aug;9(4):231-40. doi: 10.1007/BF03341826.,56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ins(1,4,6)P3 and Ins(1,3,6)P3 were weak agonists in rat basophilic leukaemic cells (RBL cells), which possess predominantly subtype II receptors, with respective potencies of 1/200 and less than 1/500 that of Ins(1,4,5)P3 [the EC50 values were 0.2, 45 and more than 100 microM for Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(1,4,6)P3 and Ins(1,3,6)P3 respectively]. Similar rank order potencies were also evaluated for the displacement of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 bound to RBL cell membranes by these regioisomers. However, they caused Ca2+ release from GH3 rat pituitary cells possessing predominantly subtype I receptors more potently; Ins(1,4,6)P3 and Ins(1,3,6)P3 evoked release at respective concentrations of only one-third and one-twentieth that of Ins(1,4,5)P3 (the EC50 values were 0.4, 1.2 and 8 microM for Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(1,4,6)P3 and Ins(1,3,6)P3 respectively).

To determine if normal hematopoietic progenitors could be targets of infection, CD34+ primary human bone marrow cells, stimulated to differentiate along myelomonocytic lineages, were incubated with the HGE agent. Immature marrow progenitors and, remarkably, not only granulocytic but also CD14+ monocytic cells from these cultures supported replication of the HGE agent, suggesting that all are potential targets of infection in vivo. Infection of bone marrow progenitors may contribute to the hematologic manifestations of HGE.

Apoptosis induced by DXR in oocytes is blocked by sphingosine-1-phosphate, an inhibitor of ceramide-promoted cell death. Oocytes from Bax-deficient, but not p53-null, female mice display complete resistance to DXR-induced apoptosis in vivo and in vitro.

Immunohistochemical staining using monoclonal antibodies against TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 showed that megakaryocytes and platelets were positive for both TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, confirming that they are rich sources of TIMPs. TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 stimulated the proliferation of bone marrow fibroblasts, although their effect was less potent than that of TGF-beta and PDGF.

Fludarabine (9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoradenine, F-ara-A) is a potent inducer of apoptosis in CLL cells. This study aimed to determine whether F-ara-A-induced apoptosis might be related to Bcl-2 modifications and to evaluate in vitro/in vivo correlations. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from eight B-CLL and four leukaemic MCL were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of F-ara-A +/- methylprednisolone (MP). F-ara-A down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2 in 5/12 cases. mRNA down-regulation was maximal at 48 h; protein down-regulation was prominent after 48 h. Both events were dose-dependent. The amount of apoptosis was significantly higher in the samples treated with F-ara-A than in those exposed to MP alone.

We describe the in vitro effect of a truncated form of Mpl ligand, recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (rHuMGDF), on megakaryopoiesis in bone marrow from normal subjects and patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). We used both semi-solid and suspension culture techniques to assess the effect of pegylated (PEG) rHuMGDF on megakaryocyte colony growth (CFU-Mk) and on the production of CD61+ cells in 7d suspension cultures. PEG rHuMGDF increased CFU-Mk growth and CD61+ cell production in a dose-dependent fashion in all normal marrows tested. Normal CFU-Mk growth was increased threefold with the addition of 10 ng/ml PEG rHuMGDF to cultures and CD61+ cells were increased 8-10-fold by the same dose. Although increased CFU-Mk growth was only seen in 1/10 AML and 6/16 MDS marrows, CD61+ cell numbers in suspension culture were increased in 9/13 AML and 12/15 MDS samples, responses ranged from very limited to normal magnitude. There was no correlation between platelet count and CFU-Mk number, CD61+ cell number or response to PEG rHuMGDF. We did not find any increased CFU-GM colony or cluster growth in response to PEG rHuMGDF and the CD61+ cells produced in suspension culture had features of megakaryocytic differentiation. These data suggest that PEG rHuMGDF can enhance megakaryocyte proliferation in some patients with MDS and AML, and may have a role in the treatment of thrombocytopenia in these patients.","['Adams, J A', 'Liu Yin, J A', 'Brereton, M L', 'Briggs, M', 'Burgess, R', 'Hyde, K']","['Adams JA', 'Liu Yin JA', 'Brereton ML', 'Briggs M', 'Burgess R', 'Hyde K']","['University Department of Haematology, Manchester Royal Infirmary.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (polyethylene glycol-recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development', 'factor)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cells/pathology', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.3543166.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Oct;99(1):139-46. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.3543166.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This method detects a rearranged IgH gene from a single B lymphocyte which may or may not represent the neoplastic B-cell population. We therefore performed multiple snPCR (three to five) experiments on the same CSF sample, postulating that the detection of a band of the same size and sequence in different PCR runs was highly indicative of a clonal population. 17 consecutive cases with a differential diagnosis of primary (PCNSL) (n=10) or secondary (SCNSL) (n=7) CNS lymphoma or leukaemia were investigated by the new strategy. The clonal nature of the B-cell population was confirmed in 3/10 of suspected PCNSL, and in six other cases the PCR study was indicative of reactive lymphocytosis. One case revealed a clonal B-cell population in the clinical context of an autoimmune disorder. Evidence of clonal B-cell population was found in 4/7 of suspected SCNSL. In one of these cases the detected band and its sequence proved identical to that of the primary nodal lymphoma. We believe that the evaluation of B-cell clonality in CSF requires multiple snPCR amplification on the same sample to compare the size of the products and, if necessary, the DNA sequences to ascertain the diagnosis of malignancy in equivocal cytologic and clinical findings.","['Galoin, S', 'Daste, G', 'Apoil, P A', 'Chollet, F', 'Roda, D', 'Blancher, A', 'Delsol, G', 'Chittal, S', 'al Saati, T']","['Galoin S', 'Daste G', 'Apoil PA', 'Chollet F', 'Roda D', 'Blancher A', 'Delsol G', 'Chittal S', 'al Saati T']","['Department of Pathology and CIGH/CNRS, CHU-Purpan, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/cerebrospinal fluid/*diagnosis', 'Lymphocytosis/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/cerebrospinal fluid/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/cerebrospinal fluid/*diagnosis', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.3423153.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Oct;99(1):122-30. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.3423153.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We then selected 14 of these PCB ALLs for DJH (DJ joining of the IgH) characterization. These joining regions showed homology-directed recombination and lack of N regions, indicating absence of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) activity during their rearrangement. Most leukaemias with a DJH rearrangement without N region have no, or only one, nucleotide in the joining regions of their Vdelta2-Ddelta3 rearrangements. The N regions of the TCR delta rearrangements displayed 'age-specific' differences: in children younger than 3 years of age the N regions were shorter than in those older than 3 years, and the rearrangements frequently contained complete segments. We conclude that the Vdelta2-Ddelta3 rearrangement in childhood PCB ALLs is an early event following DJH rearrangement and that it occurs shortly before or after the first hit, leading to malignant transformation.","['Schneider, M', 'Panzer, S', 'Stolz, F', 'Fischer, S', 'Gadner, H', 'Panzer-Grumayer, E R']","['Schneider M', 'Panzer S', 'Stolz F', 'Fischer S', 'Gadner H', 'Panzer-Grumayer ER']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St Anna Children's Hospital, University of Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.3653179.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Oct;99(1):115-21. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.3653179.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such a loss of genetic material suggests the presence of a tumour suppressor gene which plays an important role in growth regulation or in the differentiation of haemopoietic stem cells. To substantiate this hypothesis and to determine more precisely the chromosomal location of this putative gene, we applied a deletion mapping strategy based on the detection of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at specific genomic loci in tumour cells. 13 polymorphic markers were used to screen DNA samples from 20 children with ALL. LOHs at 12p12.3 were observed in almost 50% of informative B-cell precursor ALL patients analysed. This is one of the most frequent genetic alterations found in this disease. A common region of LOH was delimited by the markers D12S89 (distal) and D12S358 (proximal), separated by a genetic interval of approximately 3 cM. We refined the position of the putative 12p tumour suppressor gene to a physical interval of <1.3 Mb, a crucial step towards the identification of candidate genes.

We have investigated the prognostic value of MDR 1 expression in relation to other patient characteristics with respect to response and survival. One hundred and thirty patients aged 0-88 years were treated for de novo AML with standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy. MDR 1 expression was determined by immunocytochemistry. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify prognostic factors for reaching complete remission (CR) and for overall survival from diagnosis, in order to compare MDR 1 with known prognostic factors. Univariate analysis showed that higher MDR 1 expression was an adverse prognostic factor for CR (P<0.001), as was higher age (P<0.001) and unfavourable karyotype (P<0.01). These factors were also negative prognostic factors for overall survival (P<0.001, P<0.05 and P<0.005, respectively).

This study was designed to investigate the presence and frequency of minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients with AML or MDS (n=35) and numerical abnormalities of chromosomes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 17 and 18 in clinical remission by using a combination of fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) and labelling with bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR). The technique enables the detection of as few as three leukaemic cells in 10(5) normal cells. MRD was detected in 33/35 patients in complete remission (CR). 16 patients relapsed (8/11 with monosomy 7, 4/17 with trisomy 8, and 4/7 with other cytogenetic abnormalities) after a median of 4.8 months (range 3-13). Levels of MRD (P=0.007) and proliferation index (P=0.011) were significantly higher in patients with monosomy 7 than in patients with trisomy 8 or other cytogenetic abnormalities. The percentage of cells in S-phase, the number of abnormal cells and cytogenetic class were related to time to relapse (P=0.001) with S-phase being the single most important prognostic factor (P=0.0001). We conclude that the combination of FACS/FISH/BUdR, which determines the number, phenotype and proliferation rate of very rare leukaemic cells in patients with AML or MDS in clinical remission, provides information that is useful in the identification of patients with high and low likelihood of relapse.","['Engel, H', 'Goodacre, A', 'Keyhani, A', 'Jiang, S', 'Van, N T', 'Kimmel, M', 'Sanchez-Williams, G', 'Andreeff, M']","['Engel H', 'Goodacre A', 'Keyhani A', 'Jiang S', 'Van NT', 'Kimmel M', 'Sanchez-Williams G', 'Andreeff M']","['Department of Hematology, The University of Texas M.

HLA-identical sibling transplants almost always produce remission, and only about 20% of patients relapse post-transplant.

The chemotherapy cohort included 344 adults < 50 years of age treated on consecutive trials of the Italian Cooperative Study Group on CML between 1973 and 1986. The transplant cohort included 89 patients reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry who relapsed after an HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplant carried out between 1978 and 1992. Survivals in the two groups were compared using Cox proportional hazards regression to adjust for prognostic variables. Median survival was 65 months in the chemotherapy cohort and 86 months in the transplant cohort. The 7-year probability (95% confidence interval) of survival was 34% (28-39%) in the chemotherapy cohort and 57% (43-70%) in the transplant cohort (P=0003). There was no difference in survival of patients relapsing after T-cell depleted and non-T-cell-depleted transplants.

This finding suggested that IL-6 is necessary for the induction of hCRP. However, injection of IL-6 did not induce the hCRP gene. Thus, the induction of hCRP by IL-6 seems to require an additional cofactor. Therefore, we screened different cytokines for their activity in IL-6 +/+ and IL-6 -/- mice. Surprisingly, interleukin-1beta, as well as oncostatin M or leukaemia inhibitory factor, led to an induction of hCRP in both genetic backgrounds. These results indicate an IL-6-dependent and -independent regulation of hCRP.

Lawrence's fellows of the 1940s, traces the development of the knowledge of polycythemia vera from Vaquez, who wrote the first description of this disease, and Osler, who recognized it as ""a new clinical entity,"" through John H. Lawrence and the use of 32P as a treatment for polycythemia vera, to the formation of French and Italian polycythemia study groups. In particular, the history of polycythemia vera after the Second World War, and its more recent history, can be traced through the development of an algorithm for evaluating an elevated hematocrit and the development of the first (O1) protocol of the Polycythemia Vera Study Group (PVSG), a randomized trial of the efficacy of 32P, chlorambucil, and phlebotomy for treating polycythemia vera. It was in 1948, only 9 years after the first use of 32P for treating polycythemia vera, that Byron Hall reported the occurrence of acute leukemia following this use of the isotope. This led to the formation of the PVSG. After completing enrollment of patients in the first protocol of the PVSG, an attempt to find a replacement for 32P as a myelosuppressive agent led to the testing of hydroxyurea as a putative non-leukemogenic drug for this purpose. However, the use of hydroxyurea for treating polycythemia vera is coming into question, as is the ability to maintain patients with phlebotomy alone. The PVSG as such no longer exists as an operational group; its files are maintained at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. However, the French group created for the study of polycythemia vera has had a consensus conference, and the Italian group has developed a low-dose aspirin protocol for treating the disease.","['Berlin, N I', 'Wasserman, L R']","['Berlin NI', 'Wasserman LR']","['Sylvester Cancer Center and the Department of Medicine, University of Miami, Florida, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Lab Clin Med,The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,0375375,"['0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Aspirin/history/therapeutic use', 'Blood Volume', 'Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic/history', 'Female', 'Hematocrit', 'History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/history/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Phlebotomy/history', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes/history/therapeutic use', 'Polycythemia Vera/diagnosis/*history/mortality/therapy']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2143(97)90035-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-2143(97)90035-4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Lab Clin Med. 1997 Oct;130(4):365-73. doi: 10.1016/s0022-2143(97)90035-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Supernatant transduction of CD34+ cells (mean purity 97%) in fibronectin-coated tissue culture flasks resulted in 5.5-45% (mean 26%) transduced cells expressing deltaLNGFR (LNGFR+ cells). After transduction, more than 65% of the transduced cells remained CD34+. Compared with control (mock- and nontransduced) CD34+ cells, transduction did not decrease the cloning efficiency of CD34+ cells. Immunomagnetic selection of the transduced cells with a monoclonal anti-LNGFR antibody resulted in >90% LNGFR+ cells. Further phenotypic characterization of these highly enriched LNGFR+ cells indicated that the majority co-expressed the CD34 and CD38 antigens. These results show that transduced cells expressing an ectopic cell-surface protein can be rapidly and conveniently quantitated and characterized by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis and fast and efficiently enriched by immunoadhesion using magnetic beads.

In the present study we investigated expression and regulation of the human LIF promoter in HEC-1B endometrial adenocarcinoma cells using a luciferase reporter plasmid bearing a 666 bp promoter fragment (h666LIF-Luc) in transient transfection assays. HEC-1B cells were first shown by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to be able to produce endogenous LIF mRNA. The LIF promoter was efficiently transcribed in HEC-1B cells, showing much higher levels of basal activity than in the previously studied Jurkat T-lymphoma cells and SKUT-1B uterine mesodermal tumour cells. The activity of the LIF promoter was stimulated in HEC-1B cells by a combination of phorbol ester (TPA) and ionomycin, which we had previously found to strongly induce its activity in Jurkat T-lymphoma cells. We next studied the effect of progestin (medroxyprogesterone acetate; MPA) on the LIF promoter activity in HEC-1B cells. The LIF promoter was not stimulated by MPA treatment in the presence of transfected progesterone receptor B (PR-B) expression vector in HEC-1B cells, while we had previously described its induction by MPA in SKUT-1B cells.

We studied the combination of the alkylating agent nitrogen mustard (NM; concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 1.25 microg/mL) and etoposide (VP-16; constant dose of 20 microg/mL), and the conventional cyclophosphamide (Cy)-derivative mafosfamide (concentrations: 20-175 microg/mL). THE AIMS OF OUR STUDY WERE: 1) To compare the toxicity of the purging protocols on bone marrow (BM) and circulating trilineage precursors collected from normal donors after priming with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or after complete remission (CR) consolidation chemotherapy and G-CSF (leukemic patients); 2) to demonstrate the survival of very primitive hematopoietic progenitors (LTC-IC) in the peripheral blood (PB) and the BM after pharmacological treatment; and 3) to evaluate the antineoplastic efficacy of purging protocols on PBSC collections using 3 well-established leukemic cell lines. Our results demonstrated that the toxicity on BM and PB progenitor cells could be correlated with the complete killing of committed granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GMs) and erythroid precursors (BFU-Es), a condition reached at the concentration of 1.5 microg/mL of NM (in addition to 20 microg/mL of VP-16) and 175 microg/mL of mafosfamide. Notably, early and late megakaryocyte progenitor cells (CFU-MKs and BFU-MKs, respectively) showed higher sensitivity to NM/VP-16, but not to mafosfamide, than did CFU-GMs and BFU-Es. The dose of NM capable of inhibiting 95% of CFU-MKs and BFU-MKs (ID95) was 0.75 microg/mL. After incubation with the same dose of NM, the recovery of CFU-GMs and BFU-Es was 20 +/- 8% SD and 25 +/- 10% SD, respectively (p < 0.05). Long-term liquid cultures showed the recovery of primitive hematopoietic cells after incubation with the highest concentrations of NM/VP-16 and mafosfamide, with no significant differences between PB and BM samples. Under the same experimental conditions, we observed a more than 5-log reduction of contaminating leukemic cell lines (i.e., K-562, KG-1, and HL-60). In conclusion, we demonstrated that NM/VP-16 and mafosfamide purging agents are capable of killing leukemic cell lines that contaminate leukapheresis products from patients with AML, whereas an acceptable proportion of primitive LTC-IC is spared. Moreover, despite the different kinetic and functional profile of mobilized and steady-state BM progenitors, we did not observe any difference in toxicity of antineoplastic agents on hematopoietic cells at different levels of differentiation. These data suggest that pharmacological strategies developed for eliminating minimal residual disease (MRD) from BM autografts can be effectively and safely applied to circulating stem cell harvests.","['Motta, M R', 'Mangianti, S', 'Rizzi, S', 'Ratta, M', 'Campanini, E', 'Fortuna, A', 'Fogli, M', 'Tura, S', 'Lemoli, R M']","['Motta MR', 'Mangianti S', 'Rizzi S', 'Ratta M', 'Campanini E', 'Fortuna A', 'Fogli M', 'Tura S', 'Lemoli RM']","['Institute of Hematology and Oncology, University of Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Etoposide/*administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mechlorethamine/*administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*drug therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1997 Nov;25(12):1261-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SCF synergizes with specific lineage factors in promoting the proliferation of primitive hematopoietic progenitors, and has been administered to expand the pool of these progenitors in cancer patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy. SCF and its c-kit receptor are expressed by some tumor cells, including myeloid leukemia, breast carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, melanoma, gynecological tumors, and testicular germ cell tumors. Previous studies of SCF in neuroblastoma have produced conflicting conclusions. To explore the role of SCF in neuroblastoma, we studied five neuroblastoma lines (IMR-5, SK-N-SH, SK-N-BE, AF8, and SJ-N-KP) and the neuroepithelioma line CHP-100. All lines expressed mRNA for c-kit and c-kit protein at low intensity as measured by flow cytometry, and secreted SCF in medium culture as shown by ELISA. Exogenous SCF did not modify 3H thymidine uptake in the neuroblastoma and neuroepithelioma cell lines. After 6 days' culture in the presence of anti-c-kit, the number of viable neuroblastoma cells was significantly lower than the control, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase assay showed a substantial increase of apoptotic cells: The percentage of positive cells was 1-3% in the control lines, whereas in the presence of anti c-kit it varied from 29% of SK-N-BE to 92% of CHP-100. After 9 days' culture in the presence of anti-c-kit, no viable cells were detectable.

CD21 also serves as a receptor of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). We evaluated the mechanism of CD21 induction on HTLV-I-infected T cells and its clinical significance in the leukemogenesis of adult T cell leukemia (ATL). CD21 induction was detected at very low levels in T cell lines (Jurkat and CEM cells), and in non- or low-Tax-producing HTLV-I-infected T cell lines (Oh13T, S1T, and Su9T01 cells). In contrast, marked induction of CD21 was detected in high-Tax-producing HTLV-I-infected T cell lines (K3T, F6T, and MT-2). A Jurkat T cell clone stably transfected with tax-expressing cDNA expressed a significant amount of CD21 on the cell surface. These results strongly suggest that HTLV-I Tax induces CD21 on T cells. On two-color analysis, CD21 expression was detected in CD4+ T cells of the primary ATL cells from a subset of patients, suggesting that EBV infection may be associated with the leukemogenesis of ATL, at least in part.

The LRP gene has recently been mapped to chromosome 16, close to the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) gene. Seventy-seven samples from 67 patients with AML were examined for expression of LRP, MRP, and multidrug resistance (MDR1) mRNA using a semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Results were compared with 29 normal samples (11 normal peripheral blood and 18 normal bone marrow). Thirty-three patients with untreated AML were evaluable for response to chemotherapy. Levels of LRP, but not of MRP or MDR1 mRNA, were significantly higher in eight patients who failed to achieve complete remission (CR) compared with 25 patients who achieved CR (p = 0.033). A positive correlation was demonstrated between LRP and MRP (R = 0.368, p = 0.001) and between MRP and MDR1 mRNA levels (R = 0.301, p = 0.01) in the 77 clinical samples analyzed. In AML samples, a significant difference in MDR1 mRNA levels was found between presentation (47 samples) and relapse (30 samples) (p = 0.031). No significant difference was seen in LRP mRNA levels between these two groups or in eight patients studied sequentially at both presentation and relapse. Thirteen samples (10 at presentation, 3 at relapse) were analyzed for LRP protein expression by flow cytometry. Eight (5 at presentation, 3 at relapse) displayed greater than 10% positive cells (range 15-86%).

We have examined the production and function of PRL on the Jurkat human T-leukemic cell line, which does not constitutively produce IL-2. The majority of Jurkat cells expressed PRL receptor (R) under standard culture conditions, whereas appearance of the alpha chain of the IL-2-R required PHA-PMA stimulation, as did IL-2 synthesis. Western blotting revealed a predominant band at 23.5 kDa and a weaker band at 25.5 kDa in both Jurkat cell lysates and human (h) pituitary PRL. Metabolic labeling of the cell lysates with 35S-methionine and immunoprecipitation with an antiserum against hPRL showed that both forms of PRL are actively synthesized by the Jurkat cell line. PRL released in the medium was biologically active in the rat Nb2 lymphoma mitogenic assay. Depletion of medium PRL with two polyclonal anti-hPRL antisera inhibited the growth of Jurkat cells in a dose-dependent manner, as evaluated by cell number and 3H-TdR uptake. Purified pituitary or recombinant hPRL at a wide range of concentrations had no significant effect on their growth, but reversed the blocking activity of the anti-hPRL antibody. Recombinant IL-2 had no effect on the antibody-induced growth inhibition. Taken as a whole, these results demonstrate that PRL can act as an autocrine T cell growth factor independently of IL-2 and are the first evidence of its involvement in human leukemic growth and possibly in leukemic transformation.","['Matera, L', 'Cutufia, M', 'Geuna, M', 'Contarini, M', 'Buttiglieri, S', 'Galin, S', 'Fazzari, A', 'Cavaliere, C']","['Matera L', 'Cutufia M', 'Geuna M', 'Contarini M', 'Buttiglieri S', 'Galin S', 'Fazzari A', 'Cavaliere C']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Turin, Italy. matera@molinette.unito.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Neuroimmunol,Journal of neuroimmunology,8109498,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Prolactin)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Growth Substances/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Jurkat Cells/metabolism/pathology/*physiology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Prolactin/biosynthesis/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Prolactin/biosynthesis']",1997/11/14 00:23,2000/06/01 09:00,['1997/11/14 00:23'],"['1997/11/14 00:23 [pubmed]', '2000/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:23 [entrez]']","['S0165-5728(97)00096-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-5728(97)00096-9 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neuroimmunol. 1997 Oct;79(1):12-21. doi: 10.1016/s0165-5728(97)00096-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under these conditions, the substrate is degraded with formation of two distinct patterns of the hydrolysis by-products: in one pattern, similar amounts of Tyr and Tyr-Gly are formed; in the other, only Tyr-Gly can be measured. Kinetic data suggest that soluble proteolyses are released by these cells, and that either dipeptidylaminopeptidases alone, or both aminopeptidases and dipeptidylaminopeptidases are involved in substrate hydrolysis. This alternation of hydrolysis patterns appears consistent with existing data on the heterogeneity of K562 cells. In contrast with these results, chromatographic separation of the soluble enzymes indicates the release of all three classes of proteolyses known to hydrolyze enkephalins: aminopeptidases, dipeptidylaminopeptidases and dipeptidylcarboxypeptidases. In cells induced to differentiate by treatment with butyric acid, substrate hydrolysis is increased, and the pattern of the enzymes released is modified. In these cells, variations in both total proteolytic activity, and ratio between the three enzyme classes mentioned above are only minor, while the ratio between the different enzyme species within each class is greatly modified. Data obtained suggest that the expression of soluble enzymes is modified by differentiation.

We here demonstrate 2 cases: i) A serum with high-titered HLA antibodies (100% panel reactivity in the LCT, titer between 4,000 and 12,000), and ii) Serum with a high-titered anti-HPA-1a (titer in the MAIPA assay 1,000). In both cases, it can be demonstrated that these antibodies led to unspecific reactions. In the 1st case, they interfered with the diagnosis of additional platelet-specific antibodies. Only the use of HLA-compatible platelets allowed a correct identification. On the other hand, in the high-titered anti-HPA-1a unspecific reactions were seen with the glycoproteins Ib/IX, Ia/IIa, and beta 2-microglobulin, leading to misinterpretations. These examples demonstrate that, in the test conditions as described, a correct diagnosis of high-titered sera might only be achieved by using compatible HLA or HPA cells.","['Agildere, A', 'Wernet, D', 'Schnaidt, M']","['Agildere A', 'Wernet D', 'Schnaidt M']","['Abteilung fur Transfusionsmedizin, Universitatsklinik Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Beitr Infusionsther Transfusionsmed,Beitrage zur Infusionstherapie und Transfusionsmedizin = Contributions to infusion therapy and transfusion medicine,9442459,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Isoantibodies)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity/immunology', 'Blood Group Incompatibility/blood/diagnosis', 'Blood Platelets/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Isoantibodies/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Beitr Infusionsther Transfusionsmed. 1997;34:190-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of these mutations also abolish or severely impair the transactivation function of Tax. Ninety percent of the rex gene, which encodes the viral regulator of mRNA splicing (Rex), overlaps with the tax gene. In this paper, we report that four previously described point mutations in tax that abolished CTL recognition and activity did not alter either the dimerisation function or the ability to export viral mRNA of the corresponding Rex proteins. Rex proteins containing two other amino acid changes were likewise functional. However, five Rex deletion mutants, predominantly but not exclusively found in HAM/TSP patients, had all lost these functions. We conclude that, although the Tax protein is subject to strong CTL-mediated selection, there are stronger functional constraints on amino acid variation in Rex. This may limit the variation in the tax/rex nucleotide sequence which results in immune evasion.","['Smith, R E', 'Niewiesk, S', 'Booth, S', 'Bangham, C R', 'Daenke, S']","['Smith RE', 'Niewiesk S', 'Booth S', 'Bangham CR', 'Daenke S']","['Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 9DU, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', '*Genes, pX', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/virology']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(97)98789-4 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1997.8789 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1997 Oct 27;237(2):397-403. doi: 10.1006/viro.1997.8789.,,,,,,,['Copyright 1997 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,

Seven different groups of BLV provirus variants were found on the basis of restriction fragment length polymorphism. Three BLV provirus variant groups and five additionally sequenced BLV isolates showed a high similarity to BLV provirus isolates from other geographical areas. The variation in nucleotide sequence of the five BLV isolates compared with nine previously sequenced BLV isolates ranged up to 5. 3%. While BLV provirus variant groups A, C, D, E, F, and G were clearly related to agar-gel immunodiffusion test (AGID)- and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-positive animals, BLV provirus variant group B was solely found in permanent AGID- and ELISA-negative or in transient ELISA-positive animals.

Here we directly address the functional significance of IL-2Ralpha expression in HTLV-I transformed cell lines by using an endoplasmic reticulum-targeted single-chain antibody to inhibit the cell surface expression of IL-2Ralpha. Using constitutive and tetracycline-repressible systems to express the ER-targeted antibody against IL-2Ralpha, we have reduced cell surface expression of IL-2Ralpha by more that 2 logs of mean fluorescence intensity to virtually undetectable levels in the IL-2-independent HTLV-I-transformed cell lines C8166-45 and HUT102. No toxicity was associated with the intracellular retention of IL-2Ralpha, and the growth rate of the IL-2Ralpha-negative cells was in each case comparable to that of the parental cell line.

Five of 12 LCH patients had alterations in the TNF-alpha promoter DNA sequence. None were found in the IFN-gamma gene promoter.

The polymorphism at -308 but not the other TNF-alpha promoter mutations caused a 3-fold to 7-fold increased production of the luciferase reporter gene.

Yet, because of somatic growth and the duration of survival, a low level of myocardial damage may ultimately be of more consequence in children than in adults. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated the utility of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) blood levels (CARDIAC T ELISA Troponin T, Boehringer Mannheim Corp) in 51 consecutively sampled patients from 1 day to 34 years of age (median=5.7 years) undergoing cardiovascular (n=19) or noncardiovascular (n=17) surgery or who received doxorubicin for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n=15). Minimum detectable cTnT elevations were 0.03 ng/mL. cTnT was measurable in children of all ages with myocyte damage. In patients who underwent cardiovascular surgery, a correlation was noted between a score of increasing surgical severity and the mean level of postoperative cTnT (r=.79, P<.0001). Postoperative cTnT levels were elevated in children who completed cardiovascular surgery with an open chest compared with those with a closed chest (P=.0083). In addition, cTnT levels before cardiovascular surgery predicted postoperative survival (P=.007). cTnT elevations were observed after initial doxorubicin therapy for ALL. The magnitude of elevation predicted left ventricular dilatation (r=.80 when variables were treated as continuous, P=.003) and wall thinning (r=.61, P=.044) 9 months later. CONCLUSIONS: Elevations of blood cTnT in children relate to the severity of myocardial damage and predict subsequent subclinical and clinical cardiac morbidity and mortality.","['Lipshultz, S E', 'Rifai, N', 'Sallan, S E', 'Lipsitz, S R', 'Dalton, V', 'Sacks, D B', 'Ottlinger, M E']","['Lipshultz SE', 'Rifai N', 'Sallan SE', 'Lipsitz SR', 'Dalton V', 'Sacks DB', 'Ottlinger ME']","[""Department of Cardiology, Children's Hospital, Boston, Mass, USA. slipshultz@cc.urmc.rochester.edu""]",['eng'],"['CA34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HR96041/HR/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Circulation,Circulation,0147763,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Troponin)', '0 (Troponin T)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cardiac Surgical Procedures/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Electrocardiography', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Heart/drug effects', 'Heart Diseases/*blood/chemically induced/complications/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Myocardium/*metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Troponin/*blood', 'Troponin T', 'Ventricular Function, Left']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1161/01.cir.96.8.2641 [doi]'],ppublish,Circulation. 1997 Oct 21;96(8):2641-8. doi: 10.1161/01.cir.96.8.2641.,,,,['Circulation. 1997 Oct 21;96(8):2496-7.

L5178Y cells were heat-shocked for either 24 min at 43 degrees C or 30 min at 45 degrees C, while HeLa cells were given only the latter treatment. The degree of heat-induced excess nuclear protein correlated with cell death in HeLa cells but not in L5178Y cells. This difference suggests that the mechanism of cell death differs between these cell lines. With L5178Y cells the main mode of death after treatment at 43 degrees C was apoptosis with little progression of cells through the cell cycle. However, after treatment at 45 degrees C these cells died by necrosis without progressing through the cell cycle. HeLa cells were found to die by a mechanism other than apoptosis after significant progression of cells through the cell cycle and perturbation of the normal distribution of cells in the phases of the cell cycle (specifically, the fraction of cells in S and G2 phase increased 50% and 30%, respectively, prior to the occurrence of measurable cell death). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the response to injury which has the potential to be lethal varies between different cell types, and results in the induction of different pathways leading to cell death.","['VanderWaal, R', 'Malyapa, R S', 'Higashikubo, R', 'Roti Roti, J L']","['VanderWaal R', 'Malyapa RS', 'Higashikubo R', 'Roti Roti JL']","['Section of Cancer Biology, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63108, USA.']",['eng'],['CA43198/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', '*Cell Survival', 'HeLa Cells/*physiology', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', '*Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L5178/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Necrosis', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1997 Nov;148(5):455-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Attempts to avoid GVHD are associated with an increased risk of relapse, probably because the graft-versus-leukemia effect is also abrogated. It was recently suggested that a high frequency of host-specific donor helper T cell precursors (HTLp) might be predictive of significant aGVHD (grade > or = II). METHODS: We retrospectively studied the frequency of HTLp by means of simplified limiting-dilution analysis to determine its predictive value for aGVHD and relapse. Pre-bone marrow transplantation, host-specific donor HLTp frequencies were analyzed in 32 patients who had received marrow from HLA-identical siblings for hematological malignancies, in terms of aGVHD and relapse. RESULTS: HTLp frequencies were significantly higher in patients who had aGVHD > or = grade II (n=14) than in those without aGVHD (n=18) (P=0.007). Patients who relapsed (n=13) had significantly lower HTLp frequencies than those who did not relapse (n=19) (P<0.0001). The probabilities of relapse (Kaplan-Meier method) when the HTLp frequency was higher and lower than 1/200,000 were 0% and 88%, respectively (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The definition of HTLp cut-off values predictive of aGVHD and relapse should contribute to donor selection and could open the way to protocols adapting immunomodulation to the likely risk of aGVHD and relapse.","['Lachance, S', 'Le Gouvello, S', 'Roudot, F', 'Kuentz, M', 'Bernaudin, F', 'Beaujean, F', 'Bierling, P', 'Cordonnier, C', 'Farcet, J P', 'Vernant, J P']","['Lachance S', 'Le Gouvello S', 'Roudot F', 'Kuentz M', 'Bernaudin F', 'Beaujean F', 'Bierling P', 'Cordonnier C', 'Farcet JP', 'Vernant JP']","['Unite de Greffe de Moelle et Centre de Transfusion Sanguine, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, Val-de-Marne, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens/*blood', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Stem Cells/*cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*cytology', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-199710270-00012 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1997 Oct 27;64(8):1147-52. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199710270-00012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because current GVHD treatment regimens such as cyclosporine and methotrexate are only partially effective, there is a need for new immunosuppressive drugs for the treatment of this condition. METHODS: A recently developed immunosuppressive drug, mycophenolate mofetil (MM), was tested in a fully mismatched (C57BL/6 donors to BALB/c recipients) murine model of acute GVHD after bone marrow transplantation. RESULTS: A dose regimen of 30 mg/kg/day given by oral gavage and begun at 1 day before transplant had no positive effect on survival and was found to retard the rate of marrow engraftment as measured by absolute blood neutrophil counts. In all subsequent experiments, treatment was begun on day 5 after transplant. Three different doses (30, 60, and 90 mg/kg/day) were tested, but no significant improvement in mean survival time (MST) was observed for the first two doses (P=0.412 and 0.100, respectively). The highest dose (90 mg/kg/day) reduced MST (P=0.059), and no further dose increases were attempted. MM in combination with cyclosporine also failed to improve MST compared with animals treated with cyclosporine alone or controls. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MM given orally is not effective in this murine model of GVHD and may not have a role in the treatment and prevention of acute GVHD arising from bone marrow transplantation in the clinical setting.","['van Leeuwen, L', 'Guiffre, A K', 'Sewell, W A', 'Vos, B J', 'Rainer, S', 'Atkinson, K']","['van Leeuwen L', 'Guiffre AK', 'Sewell WA', 'Vos BJ', 'Rainer S', 'Atkinson K']","[""Department of Haematology, St. Vincent's Hospital Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology/mortality', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mycophenolic Acid/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-199710270-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1997 Oct 27;64(8):1097-101. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199710270-00002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, following therapy with interferon-alpha 2b (IFN), these micromegakaryocytes occur less frequently. The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether the reappearance of normal megakaryocytes may be associated also with a reduction of the bcr/abl-positive cell clone. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) technique in combination with immunomorphometry (CD61) was performed on trephine biopsies. A total of 311 CD61-positive megakaryocytes, including precursors and atypical microforms, were evaluated in pre-treatment specimens derived from 11 patients with Ph1+ CML. A specific fusion site marking the bcr/abl translocation was found in 87% of megakaryocytes which showed a size of 169 +/- 35 microns2. In untreated patients, atypical microforms (size 200 microns2) were observed in 66% of the total megakaryocytic population. Following IFN therapy 369 megakaryocytes could be analysed in sequential examinations and were found to display a significant decrease (63%) in positive fusion signals. In addition there was also a significant enhancement in average size (252 +/- 66 microns2) reflecting a reduction in the number of micromegakaryocytes (43%). These findings were particularly conspicuous in three patients with a major to complete cytogenetic remission. CONCLUSIONS: A normalization of megakaryocyte size following IFN therapy in CML is significantly associated with a loss of the bcr/abl translocation site and therefore indicates a (partial) recovery of normal haematopoiesis.","['Thiele, J', 'Schmitz, B', 'Gross, H', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Niederle, N', 'Leder, L D', 'Fischer, R']","['Thiele J', 'Schmitz B', 'Gross H', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Niederle N', 'Leder LD', 'Fischer R']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2559.1997.2480853.x [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 1997 Sep;31(3):215-21. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2559.1997.2480853.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A variety of methods, ranging from direct DNA delivery to infection with recombinant viruses containing foreign genes, have been developed, but they all have some major limitations that restrict their utility. We have described a human lentiviral (HIV)-based vector that can transduce non-dividing cells in vitro and deliver genes in vivo. With this vector, expression of transgenes in the brain has been detected for more than six months--the longest period tested so far. Because lentiviral vectors are pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSVG; ref. 8), they can transduce a broad range of tissues and cell types. We now describe the ability of lentiviral vectors to introduce genes directly into liver and muscle. Sustained expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP), used as a surrogate for therapeutic protein, can be observed for more than 22 weeks in the liver. Similar long-term expression (more than eight weeks) was observed in transduced muscle. In contrast, little or no GFP could be detected in liver or muscle transduced with the Moloney murine leukaemia virus (M-MLV), a prototypic retroviral based vector. At a minimum, 3-4% of the total liver tissue was transduced by a single injection of 1-3 x 10(7) infectious units (I.U.) of recombinant HIV vector. Furthermore, no inflammation of recruitment of lymphocytes could be detected at the site of injection. Animals previously transduced with a lentiviral vector can be efficiently re-infected with lentiviral vectors. Additionally, we show that the requirement for lentiviral accessory proteins to establish efficient transduction in vivo is tissue dependent.","['Kafri, T', 'Blomer, U', 'Peterson, D A', 'Gage, F H', 'Verma, I M']","['Kafri T', 'Blomer U', 'Peterson DA', 'Gage FH', 'Verma IM']","['Laboratory of Genetics, Salk Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],['AG08514/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,"['0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/virology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Female', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics/*pharmacology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HIV/genetics', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/virology', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Liver/immunology/*virology', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Muscles/immunology/*virology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Rats, Nude', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/ng1197-314 [doi]'],ppublish,Nat Genet. 1997 Nov;17(3):314-7. doi: 10.1038/ng1197-314.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, in multiple myeloma (MM), incidental reports have indicated the existence of a graft-versus-myeloma effect (GVM) induced by allo-reactive T cells. We performed a retrospective study in a larger group of MM patients to characterize better the effect, prognostic factors, and toxicity of this new treatment modality. Thirteen patients with relapsed MM after allo-BMT were studied. Patients received a total of 29 DLI with T-cell doses ranging from 1 x 10(6)/kg to 33 x 10(7)/kg. Repetitive courses, sometimes with escalated cell doses, were undertaken in case of no response to or relapse after DLI. Eight of 13 patients responded: 4 patients achieved a partial remission and 4 patients achieved a complete remission. Dose escalation was effective in 3 patients. The time to response was median 6 weeks (range, 4 to 10 weeks). Major toxicities were secondary to acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which occurred in 66% and 56% of all patients and in 87% and 85% of the responders, respectively. Two responding patients developed fatal BM aplasia. The only prognostic factors for response were a T-cell dose greater than 1 x 10(8)/kg and the occurrence of GVHD. Seven of nine patients developing acute GVHD responded, as compared with only 1 response in the 4 patients without GVHD and 6 of 7 patients with chronic GVHD responded, whereas no response was observed in the 5 patients without chronic GVHD. DLI are effective in a high percentage of patients with relapsed MM after allo-BMT, although it is associated with a high treatment-related toxicity. The dose of T cells used may be important in determining the GVM effect, with the highest probability of response after infusion of more than 1 x 10(8) T cells. Because the optimal individual dose may vary, patient-adapted therapy consisting of repeated infusions with escalating dose of donor leukocytes until maximum response is achieved may therefore be preferable.","['Lokhorst, H M', 'Schattenberg, A', 'Cornelissen, J J', 'Thomas, L L', 'Verdonck, L F']","['Lokhorst HM', 'Schattenberg A', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Thomas LL', 'Verdonck LF']","['Department of Haematology, University Hospital Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', '*Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55068-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Nov 15;90(10):4206-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously described JKB, a human ALL cell line, that contains homozygous deletion of the p16 gene. Because ectopic expression of p16 suppresses cell growth, we created a temperature sensitive p16 mutant to develop a system for inducible p16 function in human ALL. JKB cells were transfected either with a p16 gene mutated at position 119 (E119G) to confer temperature sensitivity (JKB p16MT) or with control vector. The percentage of cells in G1 phase was similar in JKB control cells or in JKB p16MT cells cultured at restrictive conditions (40 degrees C). However, with lowering of temperature from 40 degrees C to permissive conditions (31 degrees C), the percentage of JKB p16MT cells in G1 phase and binding of p16 to CDK4 and CDK6 increased, with associated decreases in CDK4 and CDK6 kinase activities, and dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRB). Culture of JKB p16MT cells at 31 degrees C for >/=3 days irreversibly inhibited growth. Moreover, JKB p16MT cells cultured under these permissive conditions showed a less transformed morphology and more differentiated phenotype than did these cells cultured under restrictive temperatures. Finally, dexamethasone (Dex) induced apoptosis of JKB p16MT cells cultured at 40 degrees C, but did not trigger death of these cells cultured at 31 degrees C. These results suggest that deletion of p16 gene in JKB human ALL cells is associated with dysregulated growth of less differentiated tumor cells, which nonetheless remain susceptible to apoptosis triggered by Dex.","['Urashima, M', 'DeCaprio, J A', 'Chauhan, D', 'Teoh, G', 'Ogata, A', 'Treon, S P', 'Hoshi, Y', 'Anderson, K C']","['Urashima M', 'DeCaprio JA', 'Chauhan D', 'Teoh G', 'Ogata A', 'Treon SP', 'Hoshi Y', 'Anderson KC']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.']",['eng'],['CA 50947/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genes, p16', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55056-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Nov 15;90(10):4106-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In multiple myeloma (MM), the most consistent chromosomal abnormality is the 14q+ marker, which originates in one third of cases through a t(11; 14)(q13; q32) chromosomal translocation; in the remaining cases, the identity of the partner chromosomes has not been well established. We used a Southern blot approach based on the linkage analysis of the joining (J) and the constant (C) mu, alpha, and gamma regions to detect cases bearing IGH switch-mediated chromosomal translocations. We evaluated DNA of 88 nonkaryotyped patients with MM (78 cases) or plasma cell leukemia (PCL) (10 cases) and found the presence of ""illegitimate"" rearranged IGH fragments (no comigration between the J and C regions) in 21 cases. To confirm this analysis, we cloned the illegitimate rearranged fragments from three samples, and the molecular and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses indicated the presence of chromosomal translocations juxtaposing a switch IGH region to sequences from chromosomes 11q13 (one PCL case) or 4p16.3 (two MM cases). Interestingly, the breakpoints on 4p16.3 occurred about 14 kb apart in a genomic region located approximately 50 kb centromeric to the fibroblast growth-factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. Moreover, Southern blot analysis using 4p16.3 genomic probes detected a rearrangement in an additional MM tumor. FISH analysis of the MM-derived KMS-11 cell line, reported to be associated with a t(4; 14)(p16.3; q32), showed that the FGFR3 gene was translocated on 14q32. High levels of FGFR3 mRNA expression were observed in the cloned MM tumors and KMS-11 cell line, but not in the cases that were apparently negative for this lesion. Furthermore, a point mutation at codon 373 in the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 gene resulting in an amino acid substitution (Tyr --> Cys) was detected in the KMS-11 cell line. These findings indicate that the t(4; 14)(p16.3; q32) represents a novel, recurrent chromosomal translocation in MM, and suggest that the FGFR3 gene may be the target of this abnormality and thus contribute to tumorigenesis in MM.","['Richelda, R', 'Ronchetti, D', 'Baldini, L', 'Cro, L', 'Viggiano, L', 'Marzella, R', 'Rocchi, M', 'Otsuki, T', 'Lombardi, L', 'Maiolo, A T', 'Neri, A']","['Richelda R', 'Ronchetti D', 'Baldini L', 'Cro L', 'Viggiano L', 'Marzella R', 'Rocchi M', 'Otsuki T', 'Lombardi L', 'Maiolo AT', 'Neri A']","['Laboratorio di Ematologia Sperimentale e Genetica Molecolare, Servizio di Ematologia, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Ospedale Maggiore IRCCS, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55051-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Nov 15;90(10):4062-70.,,,,['Blood. 1998 Oct 15;92(8):2987-9.

In animal studies that examined the effect of folate deficiency on malignancies, conflicting results have been reported. In some studies, folate deficiency increased the development and growth of malignant tumors; in others, it decreased the development and growth of malignancies. We examined the effect of transient folate deficiency on the development of leukemia in mice infected with the anemia-inducing strain of Friend leukemia virus. Friend virus disease can be considered as a model for human acute leukemias that are preceded by a preleukemic period. These include leukemias that develop in patients who received previous chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, as well as patients with chronic granulocytic leukemia or myelodysplasia. Folate deficiency around the time of Friend virus-infection delayed the onset but increased the incidence of leukemia. The rates of rearrangement of the Spi-1 (PU.1 ) oncogene by provirus integration and alteration of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene were the same in leukemia cell lines derived from folate-deficient mice as they were in cell lines from control mice. These results indicate that folate deficiency did not exert its enhancement of leukemogenesis through changes in either Spi-1 or p53, even though these two genes have been found to be the most frequently altered ones in Friend virus-induced leukemias. Our results suggest that folate deficiency may enhance the development of acute leukemia in patients who are at high risk for this disease.","['Koury, M J', 'Park, D J', 'Martincic, D', 'Horne, D W', 'Kravtsov, V', 'Whitlock, J A', 'del Pilar Aguinaga, M', 'Kopsombut, P']","['Koury MJ', 'Park DJ', 'Martincic D', 'Horne DW', 'Kravtsov V', 'Whitlock JA', 'del Pilar Aguinaga M', 'Kopsombut P']","['Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University and Nashville Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, Nashville, TN 37232-6305, USA.']",['eng'],['DK-32189/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Animals', 'Folic Acid Deficiency/*complications/physiopathology', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*etiology/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae Infections/*metabolism/*physiopathology/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*metabolism/*physiopathology']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55050-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Nov 15;90(10):4054-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunocytochemical labeling of the wild-type PML protein with the PG-M3 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) directed against the amino terminal portion of the human PML gene product, produces a characteristic nuclear speckled pattern that is due to localization of the protein into discrete dots (5 to 20 per nucleus), named PML nuclear bodies. The architecture of PML nuclear bodies appears to be disrupted in APL cells that bear the t(15; 17), thus resulting in a change of the nuclear staining pattern from speckled (wild-type PML protein) to microgranular (PML-RARalpha fusion protein). To assess whether the PG-M3 MoAb could assist in the diagnosis of APL (M3), bone marrow and/or peripheral blood samples from 100 cases of acute nonlymphoid leukemias of different subtypes were blindly immunostained with the PG-M3 MoAb, using the immunoalkaline phosphatase (APAAP) or immunofluorescence technique as detection system. Notably, the abnormal (micropunctate) pattern of the PML/RARalpha fusion protein (usually >/=50 small granules/per nucleus) was observed in APL (M3) samples, but not in other types of acute nonlymphoid leukemias. Immunocytochemical labeling with PG-M3 was particularly useful in the diagnosis of microgranular variant of APL (M3V) (three cases misdiagnosed as M4 and M5), and also to exclude a morphologic misdiagnosis of APL (six of 78 cases). In all cases investigated, immunocytochemical results were in agreement with those of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for PML/RARalpha. Because the epitope identified by PG-M3 is located in the aminoterminal portion of PML (AA 37 to 51), the antibody was suitable for recognizing APL cases characterized by breakpoint occurring at different sites of PML (bcr 1, bcr 2 and bcr 3). In conclusion, immunocytochemical labeling with PG-M3 represents a rapid, sensitive, and highly-specific test for the diagnosis of APL that bears the t(15; 17). This should allow an easy and correct diagnosis of this subtype of acute leukemia to any laboratory provided with a minimal equipment for immunocytochemistry work.","['Falini, B', 'Flenghi, L', 'Fagioli, M', 'Lo Coco, F', 'Cordone, I', 'Diverio, D', 'Pasqualucci, L', 'Biondi, A', 'Riganelli, D', 'Orleth, A', 'Liso, A', 'Martelli, M F', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Pileri, S']","['Falini B', 'Flenghi L', 'Fagioli M', 'Lo Coco F', 'Cordone I', 'Diverio D', 'Pasqualucci L', 'Biondi A', 'Riganelli D', 'Orleth A', 'Liso A', 'Martelli MF', 'Pelicci PG', 'Pileri S']","['Institutes of Hematology and Internal Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', '*Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*immunology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55049-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Nov 15;90(10):4046-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the results for 79 patients with MDS/sAML transplanted with autologous marrow in first complete remission (CR). Within the total group of 79, a cohort of 55 patients for whom the duration of first CR was known were compared with a matched control group of 110 patients with de novo AML. The 2-year survival, disease-free survival (DFS), and relapse rates for the 79 patients transplanted in first CR were 39%, 34%, and 64%, respectively. The relapse risk was greater than 55% for all stages and all disease categories. Patients younger than 40 years had a significantly (P = .04) better DFS (39%) than patients older than 40 years (25%). The DFS at 2 years was 28% for the cohort of 55 patients transplanted for MDS/sAML and 51% for those transplanted for de novo AML (P = .025). Relapse rates were 69% for patients with MDS/sAML and 40% for those with de novo AML (P = .007). ABMT for MDS or secondary leukemia results in a lower DFS when compared with similarly treated patients with de novo AML due to a higher relapse rate. The DFS of 28% for these patients suggests that autotransplantation may be a valuable therapy for this disease. The low treatment-related mortality rate of less than 10% supports the view that sufficient numbers of hematopoietic stem cells are present in patients with MDS to allow adequate repopulation after autologous stem-cell transplantation.","['De Witte, T', 'Van Biezen, A', 'Hermans, J', 'Labopin, M', 'Runde, V', 'Or, R', 'Meloni, G', 'Mauri, S B', 'Carella, A', 'Apperley, J', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Laporte, J P']","['De Witte T', 'Van Biezen A', 'Hermans J', 'Labopin M', 'Runde V', 'Or R', 'Meloni G', 'Mauri SB', 'Carella A', 'Apperley J', 'Gratwohl A', 'Laporte JP']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55026-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Nov 15;90(10):3853-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median age was 34 years (range, 16 to 56 years). Thirty-nine were transplanted in first complete remission and 13 in first partial remission after conventional therapy. Conditioning regimens consisted of total body irradiation (TBI) administered as a single fraction 750 cGy in 3 patients and in fractionated doses for a total of 1,200 cGy in 44 patients, in combination with 60 mg/kg etoposide and 100 mg/kg cyclophosphamide. Five patients with prior radiotherapy received 450 mg/m2 carmustine instead of TBI. Stem cell sources were either bone marrow and/or peripheral blood. No in vitro purging was used. All patients engrafted. Two SNCCL patients died of venoocclusive disease at 25 days and acute leukemia at 27 months posttransplantation. There were six relapses at 1.5 to 12.8 months posttransplantation. At a median follow-up of 44 months (range, 1 to 113 months), the estimated 3-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for all patients was 84% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70% to 92%) and 82% (95% CI, 68% to 91%), respectively.

The 3-year OS and DFS for SNCCL patients were identical at 60% (95% CI, 30% to 84%).

Both prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and iloprost increased cyclic AMP (cAMP) in HEL cells, but modulated [Ca2+]i by different mechanisms. Iloprost (10(-9) to 10(-6) M) had no effect on basal [Ca2+]i, but greatly potentiated the increase in [Ca2+]i produced by thrombin. This effect was mimicked by cholera toxin and other Gs-coupled receptors, and involved calcium influx since iloprost had no effect on [Ca2+]i in cells incubated in Ca2+-free buffer. Furthermore, iloprost did not increase the generation of baseline or thrombin-induced inositol phosphates at these concentrations. In contrast, PGE1 (10(-7) to 10(-5) M), but not iloprost, increased basal [Ca2+]i through a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism that involved stimulation of inositol phosphate generation and mobilization of intracellular calcium. The order of potencies of other prostaglandins that increased [Ca2+]i was not consistent with known IP, EP, DP, FP, or TP receptors. 11-Deoxy-16,16-dimethyl PGE2 was the most potent of the analogs tested (EC50 = 28 nM). In summary, at least two prostaglandin receptors are functionally coupled to intracellular calcium in HEL cells: a putative IP receptor coupled to Gs proteins that increases cAMP and enhances calcium influx, and a novel prostanoid receptor that evokes calcium mobilization through stimulation of phospholipase C by a pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway.","['Feoktistov, I', 'Breyer, R M', 'Biaggioni, I']","['Feoktistov I', 'Breyer RM', 'Biaggioni I']","['Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 32732-2195, U.S.A.']",['eng'],"['R55HL55596/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00095/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Epoprostenol)', '0 (Receptors, Prostaglandin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)', 'JED5K35YGL (Iloprost)', 'M790V82VAC (16,16-Dimethylprostaglandin E2)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['16,16-Dimethylprostaglandin E2/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Alprostadil/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iloprost/pharmacology', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Epoprostenol', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thrombin/administration & dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(97)00288-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00288-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1997 Oct 15;54(8):917-26. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00288-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is now established that protein kinase Cbeta (PKCbeta) plays a critical role in HL-60 cell maturation to a monocyte/macrophage phenotype. In the present study, we investigated the importance of PKCbeta levels and activation in 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated differentiation of HL-60 cells. Cell differentiation promoted by 1,25-(OH)2D3 at 48 hr was 39 +/- 3% (mean +/- SEM) nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) positive and at 72 hr it was 35 +/- 2% NBT positive and 70% CD14 positive. Thus, promotion of cell differentiation by 20 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment was maximal at 48-72 hr. When PKCbeta levels and cell differentiation were assayed at 72 hr, treatment with 20 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3 for the initial 6 hr increased PKCbeta levels by 175% but had little effect on cell differentiation (7 +/- 2% NBT positive; 11% CD14 positive). The effect of ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, on PKCbeta levels and cell differentiation also was examined. Alone, 5 microM ionomycin promoted few cells (3% CD14 positive) to differentiate. In contrast, cells treated with 5 microM ionomycin for 66 hr after a 6-hr pretreatment with 20 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3 resulted in 34 +/- 5% NBT positive cells and 73% CD14 positive cells. Quantitatively, this induction of differentiation was identical to that observed in cultures continuously treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 (35 +/- 2% NBT positive; 70% CD14 positive). Therefore, ionomycin seemed to replace the requirement for the continuous presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3. Chelerythrine chloride (3 microM), a specific PKC inhibitor, blocked differentiation promoted by 1,25-(OH)2D3 alone (82 +/- 2% inhibition) or in sequence with ionomycin (86 +/- 3% inhibition). Taken together, our data show that the capacity of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to both increase PKCbeta levels and activate PKC is utilized to promote HL-60 cell differentiation. These data further suggest that 1,25-(OH)2D3 has a genomic action to increase PKCbeta levels and also a nongenomic action requiring its continuous presence to promote HL-60 cell differentiation.","['Pan, Q', 'Granger, J', ""O'Connell, T D"", 'Somerman, M J', 'Simpson, R U']","['Pan Q', 'Granger J', ""O'Connell TD"", 'Somerman MJ', 'Simpson RU']","['Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109-0632, U.S.A.']",['eng'],"['DE 10337/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07767/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Respiratory Burst']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295297002864 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00286-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1997 Oct 15;54(8):909-15. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00286-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dietary supplementation with selenium has been reported to produce a decrease in the incidence of some cancers in humans. Thioredoxin reductase (TR) is a newly discovered homodimeric selenocysteine (SeCys)-containing protein that catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of the redox protein thioredoxin (Trx). Trx is overexpressed by a number of human tumors, and experimental studies have shown that Trx contributes to the growth and to the transformed phenotype of some human cancer cells. Thus, TR, by reducing Trx, could play a role in regulating the growth of normal and cancer cells. We have investigated mechanisms by which selenium, in the form of sodium selenite, added to serum-free growth medium regulates TR activity in cancer cell lines. Selenium caused a dose-dependent increase in cellular TR activity. The increase in TR activity produced by 1 microM Se compared to medium with no added selenium was: for MCF-7 breast cancer cells, 37-fold; for HT-29 colon cancer cells, 19-fold; and for A549 lung cancer cells, 8-fold. In contrast, Jurkat and HL-60 leukemia cells showed no increase in TR activity. The half-life of the time course of induction of TR in HT-29 cells after adding selenium was 10 h. The increase in TR activity was accompanied by an increase in TR protein levels up to 3-fold and an increase in the specific activity of the enzyme of 5-32-fold, depending on the cell line. Studies using 75Se showed that the amount of selenium incorporated into TR increased with increasing selenium concentration up to a ratio of 1 selenium per TR monomer. There was an increase in TR mRNA levels of 2-5-fold at 1 microM selenium and an increase in the stability of TR mRNA with a half-life for degradation of 21 h compared to 10 h in the absence of selenium. Trx mRNA and protein levels and Trx mRNA stability were not affected by selenium. The results of the study show that the increase in TR activity caused by selenium is specific and due to several effects, including an increase in the stability of TR mRNA leading to increased TR mRNA levels, an increase in TR protein, but predominantly to an increase in the specific activity of TR associated with increased incorporation of selenium into the enzyme.","['Gallegos, A', 'Berggren, M', 'Gasdaska, J R', 'Powis, G']","['Gallegos A', 'Berggren M', 'Gasdaska JR', 'Powis G']","['Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson 85724-5024, USA.']",['eng'],['CA48725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', 'EC 1.8.1.9 (Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase)', 'HIW548RQ3W (Sodium Selenite)']",IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Sodium Selenite/*pharmacology', 'Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Thioredoxins/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1997 Nov 1;57(21):4965-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we addressed the question of whether different receptors and counter-receptors may be expressed on malignant B lymphocytes from chronic B-cell malignancies. Using flow cytometry and reverse transcription PCR analyses, the expression of molecules belonging to the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) and tumor necrosis factor ligand (TNFL) families, as well as the expression of CD80 and CD86 molecules, was analyzed in normal B cells and in different chronic lymphoproliferative disorders of B-cell type, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia (HCL), and HCL variant. Different patterns of expression of TNFR and TNFL superfamily molecules were demonstrated among B-cell malignancies. In particular, CD40 was commonly observed on all B cells (both tumor and normal), whereas its ligand (CD40L), which is usually undetectable on resting normal B lymphocytes, was expressed in CLL and HCL but not in other chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. CD27 was not shown in normal B cells, although it was present in all malignancies and with particularly high density in mantle cell lymphoma. CD70 was widely distributed on tumor B lymphocytes, but not on the CD5+ normal counterpart. CD30 was strongly expressed in HCL variant and weakly in B-cell CLL, whereas its ligand showed a wide pattern of expression, including all neoplastic and normal B cells. TNFR II (CD120b) and CD80 were distributed on neoplastic B cells from all groups, usually at an intermediate to high degree of intensity, whereas the CD86 molecule was present at lower intensity than CD80. Finally, reverse transcription PCR analysis confirmed the presence of CD40L, CD30, and CD30L mRNAs in those B cells expressing the corresponding membrane-bound proteins at low density. Our data indicate that TNFR and TNFL molecules are of use clinically both in differentiating B-cell malignancies from the normal counterpart (i.e., CD27, CD70, CD40L, CD30, and CD80) and in defining different chronic B-cell disorders (i.e., CD40L, CD27, and CD30). Interestingly, the observation that several receptors and their ligands (i.e., CD40/CD40L, CD30/CD30L, and CD27/CD70) can be expressed on the same cell suggests that these molecules play a role in initiating and maintaining the neoplastic process by mediating B-T and B-B interactions.","['Trentin, L', 'Zambello, R', 'Sancetta, R', 'Facco, M', 'Cerutti, A', 'Perin, A', 'Siviero, M', 'Basso, U', 'Bortolin, M', 'Adami, F', 'Agostini, C', 'Semenzato, G']","['Trentin L', 'Zambello R', 'Sancetta R', 'Facco M', 'Cerutti A', 'Perin A', 'Siviero M', 'Basso U', 'Bortolin M', 'Adami F', 'Agostini C', 'Semenzato G']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Padua University School of Medicine, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*chemistry', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/analysis']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1997 Nov 1;57(21):4940-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we report that 13cRA inhibited proliferation and induced cell death of peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from four patients with acute adult T-cell leukemia but not of mitogen- or interleukin 2-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HTLV-I-negative healthy donors. Because HTLV-I-infected lymphocytes are susceptible to oxidative stress, we examined the role of the intracellular redox state in 13cRA-induced cell death using a HTLV-I-positive T-cell line, ATL2, as a model. 13cRA induced apoptosis in ATL2 cells within 48 h in a dose-dependent manner. The ability of 13cRA to induce apoptosis was more potent than that of all-trans-retinoic acid. Apoptosis induction by 13cRA was significantly enhanced by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), which decreased the levels of intracellular reduced glutathione, although 13cRA by itself did not alter them, suggesting that intracellular reduced glutathione may modulate 13cRA-induced apoptosis. In addition, flow cytometric analysis revealed that 13cRA increased intracellular peroxides in 24 h and that the addition of BSO further enhanced them. Although N-acetylcysteine had only a marginal effect, pretreatment with catalase markedly inhibited 13cRA-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that peroxide generation, ie., oxidative stress, may play a crucial role in the induction of apoptosis by 13cRA and further demonstrate that combined treatment with 13cRA and BSO induces apoptosis of HTLV-I-positive lymphocytes even more potently.","['Furuke, K', 'Sasada, T', 'Ueda-Taniguchi, Y', 'Yamauchi, A', 'Inamoto, T', 'Yamaoka, Y', 'Masutani, H', 'Yodoi, J']","['Furuke K', 'Sasada T', 'Ueda-Taniguchi Y', 'Yamauchi A', 'Inamoto T', 'Yamaoka Y', 'Masutani H', 'Yodoi J']","['Department of Biological Responses, Institute for Virus Research, College of Medical Technology, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Keratolytic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EH28UP18IF (Isotretinoin)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/pharmacology', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Glutathione/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Isotretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Keratolytic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1997 Nov 1;57(21):4916-23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combining inverse PCR with long PCR, we amplified the genomic DNA regions flanking the integration sites of the HTLV-I provirus to detect clones of infected cells. Inverse long PCR revealed that increased virus load was associated with an increase of both the number of cells in each clone and the number of clones. Clonal proliferations were found in both CD4- and CD8-positive cells in a carrier and a patient with HTLV-I-associated neuropathy/tropical spastic paraparesis. These HTLV-I-infected clones persisted over several years in the same carriers, and, moreover, most of the persistent clones were CD4 positive in a HTLV-I carrier.

Because the cell-penetrating and biologically active lactone isomers predominate at acidic conditions, we have tested if low pH potentiates the cytotoxic and antitumor effects of CPT and its water-soluble derivative topotecan (TPT). In L1210 leukemia cells, rapid initial uptake of radiolabeled CPT and TPT was followed by a gradual release from cells at physiological pH 7.4, whereas high drug levels were maintained in cells at pH 6.2. Steady-state uptake levels of CPT increased proportionally, up to 5-fold, with decreasing pH of the incubating medium (from 7.4 to 6.0). With TPT, a maximum 3-fold increase was observed at pH 6.8 to 6.4. By contrast, the cellular pharmacokinetics of the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide (ETP) were independent of the ambient pH. The large increases in intracellular CPT and TPT levels caused only moderate potentiation of cytotoxicity in short-term incubations. Conditions of very low pH < or =6.2 even antagonized the cytotoxicity of the topo I and topo II inhibitors, due to inhibition of DNA synthesis by intracellular acidification. However, in clinically relevant schedules of prolonged exposures at low drug concentration, low pH potentiated the cytotoxicity of CPT and TPT by 2-3-fold. To investigate the effect of local pH in vivo, the basal interstitial pH of 6.8 of RIF-1 tumors was selectively lowered by i.p. injection of the host animals with the mitochondrial inhibitor meta-iodobenzylguanidine (32 mg/kg) and glucose (1.5 g/kg). In accordance with the pH optimum for TPT uptake at pH 6.8 to 6.4, tumor acidification had no effect on the antitumor effect of this analogue. By contrast, the intervention significantly potentiated the response of tumors to CPT. The results indicate that local pH is an important determinant of the cellular pharmacokinetics and the antitumor activity of CPT and analogues.","['Gabr, A', 'Kuin, A', 'Aalders, M', 'El-Gawly, H', 'Smets, L A']","['Gabr A', 'Kuin A', 'Aalders M', 'El-Gawly H', 'Smets LA']","['Division of Experimental Therapy, The Netherlands Cancer Institute/Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Huis, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Topotecan/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1997 Nov 1;57(21):4811-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In view of this the effect of some glucosinolates and their isothiocyanate (ITC)-derived products on in vitro cell growth was studied. We report the isolation and characterization of ITCs derived from glucosinolates by using HPLC, GC-MS, and NMR techniques. The in vitro activity of ITCs on human erythroleukemic K562 cells has been investigated by using two alternative approaches: the in situ and pre-mix methods. No differences in antiproliferative activity were found comparing the effect of ITCs produced either of these methods. In the experimental conditions used, the production of ITCs from glucosinolates is almost quantitative as confirmed by HPLC or GC-MS analysis. The ITCs' inhibitory activity on K562 cells growth is particularly evident in the cases of ITCs derived from sinigrin, progoitrin, epi-progoitrin, glucotropaeolin and glucocheirolin. Finally, the antiproliferative activity of the ITCs obtained from glucoraphenin, taken as an example, was determined on other tumor cell lines with a different origin and hystotype. Considering the antiproliferative activity found for ITCs these compounds could be considered potentially responsible for the reduction of colorectal cancer associated with diets rich in cruciferous vegetables. Further studies will be aimed at the possible application of glucosinolate-derived products as chemopreventive cancer agents.","['Leoni, O', 'Iori, R', 'Palmieri, S', 'Esposito, E', 'Menegatti, E', 'Cortesi, R', 'Nastruzzi, C']","['Leoni O', 'Iori R', 'Palmieri S', 'Esposito E', 'Menegatti E', 'Cortesi R', 'Nastruzzi C']","['Istituto Sperimentale per le Colture Industriali MiRAAF, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (Glucosinolates)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (glucoraphenin)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.1.147 (thioglucosidase)']",IM,"['Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Glucosinolates/*chemistry', 'Glycoside Hydrolases/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates/chemistry/*isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Molecular Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0968-0896(97)00112-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0968-0896(97)00112-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 1997 Sep;5(9):1799-806. doi: 10.1016/s0968-0896(97)00112-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some triterpenes were found to be more cytotoxic toward the 3 d-precultured resting cells than toward the growing cells in a fresh medium. These triterpenes are distinguished by highly selective cytotoxicity toward the starved resting cells unlike common anticancer agents. The highest selectivity was shown by betulinic acid, the ratio of its IC50 values toward the growing versus resting cells amounting to 175. It is suggested that this selective cytotoxicity is attributable to low pH (< or = 6.8) of the medium. It is noteworthy that betulinic acid is not cytotoxic at all in media of ordinary pH (> or = 7.0) even after a 48-h exposure.

However, the specificity of TdT using the avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase (ABC) method is not well documented. To address this issue, we stained paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens of 64 cases of childhood SRCTs using the ABC method with anti-TdT. For any TdT-positive tumors, an additional antibody panel for lymphoid markers was applied. Two patterns of TdT positivity were observed: (1) tumor specific, consisting of strong to moderate nuclear staining, and (2) scattered positive lymphoid cells, usually in a perivascular location and expressing T-cell markers. Analysis showed that 7 of 10 medulloblastomas stained with TdT in a tumor-specific pattern (4 cases moderately to strongly positive in 75-100% of tumor cells, 3 cases weakly to moderately positive in 25-50% of cells). Also, 1 of 19 rhabdomyosarcomas and 1 of 8 Ewing's sarcomas showed moderate to strong tumor-specific TdT staining in 100 and 10% of cells, respectively. Scattered TdT-positive lymphoid cells were observed in 27% of these 64 SRCTs.

IL-13 release was investigated when virus transformed B lymphocytes or acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) blasts were used as accessory cells during T cell activation. First, a majority of both CD4+ and CD8+ TCR alpha beta + T lymphocyte clones, derived from normal individuals and bone marrow transplant recipients, secreted IL-13 in response to a standardized mitogenic activation signal (phytohaemagglutinin + IL-2 + B lymphocyte accessory cells). The CD4+ cells showed significantly higher IL-13 levels than the CD8+ subsets. Second, when leukaemic accessory cells (more than 95% AML blasts) were used during T cell activation, IL-13 was released both during alloactivation of normal T lymphocytes and during mitogen activation of posttransplant T cells. Third, when normal T lymphocytes were stimulated with allogeneic AML blasts, addition of IL-13-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies decreased interferon gamma levels. Although addition of IL-13-neutralizing antibodies did not alter granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor secretion by allostimulating AML blasts, altered blast proliferation was detected for certain patients. Thus, most T cell clones can release IL-13, and IL-13 can modulate cytokine responses during T cell recognition of allogeneic AML cells.","['Bruserud, O', 'Pawelec, G']","['Bruserud O', 'Pawelec G']","['Medical Department, Haukeland Hospital, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'CD4 Antigens/immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-13/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phytohemagglutinins/drug effects', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/immunology', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/*metabolism']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002620050399 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1997 Oct;45(1):45-52. doi: 10.1007/s002620050399.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Role of phosphorylation in desensitization and internalization.,28726-31,"Members of the chemokine receptor family CCR5 and CXCR4 have recently been shown to be involved in the entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into target cells. Here, we investigated the regulation of CXCR4 in rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) stably transfected with wild type (Wt CXCR4) or a cytoplasmic tail deletion mutant (DeltaCyto CXCR4) of CXCR4. The ligand, stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) stimulated higher G-protein activation, inositol phosphate generation, and a more sustained calcium elevation in cells expressing DeltaCyto CXCR4 relative to Wt CXCR4. SDF-1 and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), but not a membrane permeable cAMP analog induced rapid phosphorylation as well as desensitization of Wt CXCR4. Phosphorylation of DeltaCyto CXCR4 was not detected under any of these conditions. Despite lack of receptor phosphorylation, calcium mobilization by SDF-1 in DeltaCyto CXCR4 cells was partially desensitized by prior treatment with SDF-1. Of interest, the rapid release of calcium was inhibited without affecting the sustained calcium elevation, indicating independent regulatory pathways for these processes. PMA completely inhibited phosphoinositide hydrolysis and calcium mobilization in Wt CXCR4 but only partially inhibited these responses in DeltaCyto CXCR4. cAMP also partially inhibited these responses in both Wt CXCR4 and DeltaCyto CXCR4. SDF-1, PMA, and cAMP caused phosphorylation of phospholipase Cbeta3 in Wt and DeltaCyto CXCR4 cells. Both SDF-1 as well as PMA induced rapid internalization of Wt CXCR4. SDF-1 but not PMA induced internalization of DeltaCyto CXCR4 albeit at reduced levels relative to Wt CXCR4. These results indicate that signaling and internalization of CXCR4 are regulated by receptor phosphorylation dependent and independent mechanisms. Desensitization of CXCR4 signaling, independent of receptor phosphorylation, appears to be a consequence of the phosphorylation of phospholipase Cbeta3.","['Haribabu, B', 'Richardson, R M', 'Fisher, I', 'Sozzani, S', 'Peiper, S C', 'Horuk, R', 'Ali, H', 'Snyderman, R']","['Haribabu B', 'Richardson RM', 'Fisher I', 'Sozzani S', 'Peiper SC', 'Horuk R', 'Ali H', 'Snyderman R']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.

Most of the in vitro NMT activity (60-85%) in isoosmotic cell homogenates of human lymphoblastic leukemia (i.e. CEM and MOLT-4) and cervical carcinoma (i.e. HeLa) cells was shown to be associated with the ribosomal subcellular fractions by differential centrifugation. Also found in the ribosomal fractions was a approximately 60-kDa protein that was specifically immunoblotted with an anti-human NMT (hNMT) peptide antibody. This approximately 60-kDa protein was stable in the presence of proteolytic enzyme inhibitors but was gradually converted into a approximately 46-kDa species when stored in the absence of protease inhibitors. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of the ribosomal fraction resulted in the hNMT activity sedimenting exactly coincident with the 260 nm absorption profile and exhibiting A260/A280 absorption ratios >1.8, indicating an association of NMT with putative ribosomal particle(s)/subunit(s). The subcellular targeting of hNMT was also examined by immunoblotting subcellular fractions from HeLa cells transfected with plasmids containing FLAG epitope-tagged hNMT inserts corresponding either to the originally assigned hNMT gene or to an alternative open reading frame initiated from an in-frame start site upstream from the assumed hNMT start site. Anti-FLAG immunoblotting of cells transfected with a plasmid containing the larger insert revealed FLAG-NMT primarily in the ribosomal fraction with an apparent molecular mass similar to the approximately 60-kDa native hNMT. In contrast, immunoblotting of cells transfected with a plasmid containing the smaller insert identified a approximately 50-kDa FLAG-NMT predominantly in the cytosolic fraction. An analysis of mixtures of CEM ribosomes and serial dilutions of purified recombinant FLAG-NMTs demonstrated that the approximately 60-kDa FLAG-NMT binds ribosomes with higher affinity than the approximately 50-kDa FLAG-NMT. These in vivo and in vitro subcellular targeting and recombinant expression experiments identify a native hNMT that is 10-12 kDa larger than the enzyme predicted by the originally assigned hNMT gene and which is apparently translated from an alternative up-stream start site. The data also indicate that although the unique NH2-terminal residues encoded by this larger open reading frame are not required for in vitro catalytic activity, they do provide signal(s) involved in targeting hNMT to the ribosomal subcellular fraction where cotranslational N-myristoylation occurs.","['Glover, C J', 'Hartman, K D', 'Felsted, R L']","['Glover CJ', 'Hartman KD', 'Felsted RL']","['Developmental Therapeutic Program, Division of Cancer Treatment, Diagnosis, and Centers, NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, Maryland 21702, USA. cglover@mail.ncifcrf.gov']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.97 (glycylpeptide N-tetradecanoyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acyltransferases/*chemistry', 'Base Sequence', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Ribosomes/*enzymology', 'Subcellular Fractions/enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.45.28680 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)38708-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Nov 7;272(45):28680-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.45.28680.,,,['GENBANK/AF020500'],,,,,['J Biol Chem 1998 Mar 6;273(10):5988'],,,,,,,

Tissue factor (TF), the initiator of coagulation, is found in the atherosclerotic plaque, macrophages, and human aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC). The exposure of TF during plaque rupture likely induces acute thrombosis, leading to myocardial infarction and stroke. This report demonstrates that MCP-1 induces the accumulation of TF mRNA and protein in SMC and in THP-1 myelomonocytic leukemia cells. MCP-1 also induces TF activity on the surface of human SMC. The induction of TF by MCP-1 in SMC is inhibited by pertussis toxin, suggesting that the SMC MCP-1 receptor is coupled to a Gi-protein. Chelation of intracellular calcium and inhibition of protein kinase C block the induction of TF by MCP-1, suggesting that in SMC it is mediated by activation of phospholipase C. SMC bind MCP-1 with a Kd similar to that previously reported for macrophages. However, mRNA encoding the macrophage MCP-1 receptors, CCR2A and B, is not present in SMC, indicating that they possess a distinct MCP-1 receptor. These data suggest that in addition to being a chemoattractant, MCP-1 may have a procoagulant function and raise the possibility of an autocrine pathway in which MCP-1, secreted by SMC and macrophages, induces TF activity in these same cells.","['Schecter, A D', 'Rollins, B J', 'Zhang, Y J', 'Charo, I F', 'Fallon, J T', 'Rossikhina, M', 'Giesen, P L', 'Nemerson, Y', 'Taubman, M B']","['Schecter AD', 'Rollins BJ', 'Zhang YJ', 'Charo IF', 'Fallon JT', 'Rossikhina M', 'Giesen PL', 'Nemerson Y', 'Taubman MB']","['Cardiovascular Institute, The Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['HL 54469/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL09402/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL29019/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arteriosclerosis/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokine CCL2/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thromboplastin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Thrombosis/metabolism']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.45.28568 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)38693-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Nov 7;272(45):28568-73. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.45.28568.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the yeast two-hybrid system, in vitro binding studies, and human cell culture coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we show here that a region of the HRX protein that is consistently retained in HRX leukemic fusion proteins interacts directly with SET, another protein implicated in leukemia. We have identified the binding sites on HRX for SET and show that these sequences are clustered near the A.T hooks that have been shown to bind DNA. We also show that carboxyl-terminal SET sequences, possibly the acidic tail of SET, bind to HRX. We have also found serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase activity in anti-HRX coimmunoprecipitates. Using the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid and Western blotting, the phosphatase was identified as protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A).

These results suggest that the leukemogenic effects of HRX fusion proteins may be related to interactions with SET and PP2A.","['Adler, H T', 'Nallaseth, F S', 'Walter, G', 'Tkachuk, D C']","['Adler HT', 'Nallaseth FS', 'Walter G', 'Tkachuk DC']","['Veterans Administration Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle Division, Seattle, Washington 98108, USA. hadler@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histone Chaperones', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Phosphatase 2', 'Proteins/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Zinc Fingers']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.45.28407 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)38671-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Nov 7;272(45):28407-14. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.45.28407.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent evidence has suggested that a common property shared by a number of known and suspected tumour promoters is their ability to block the process of apoptosis. Therefore, one possible mechanistic explanation for the apparent leukaemogenic effect of weak, low-frequency magnetic fields, such as emitted by power-lines and electrical appliances, would be their expression of tumour-promoting activity by interfering with the regulation of apoptosis in multipotent haemopoietic progenitor cells. In order to test this hypothesis, we have employed the well-characterized multipotential haemopoietic progenitor cell line FDCP-mix(A4). These cells are non-leukaemic and undergo apoptosis when deprived of appropriate growth factors such as Interleukin-3. We have tested a series of different regimes of weak, low-frequency magnetic fields: nulled fields, Ca2+-ion cyclotron resonance conditions at 50 Hz, and vertical 50 Hz fields of 6 microT(RMS), 1 mT(RMS) and 2 mT(RMS), exposing the cells for 2 hours, 24 hours, 4 days or 7 days under various culture conditions. We have not seen any significant alteration in apoptosis induced by any of the exposure regimes tested. We therefore conclude that the regulation of viability and apoptosis in FDCP-mix(A4) cells is not disturbed by weak magnetic fields of the magnitude and type indicated.","['Reipert, B M', 'Allan, D', 'Reipert, S', 'Dexter, T M']","['Reipert BM', 'Allan D', 'Reipert S', 'Dexter TM']","['Cancer Research Campaign Department of Physics & Instrumentation, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Christie Hospital NHS Trust, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0024320597007364 [pii]', '10.1016/s0024-3205(97)00736-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 1997;61(16):1571-82. doi: 10.1016/s0024-3205(97)00736-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is characterized by ataxia, progressive motor deterioration, and loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells. To understand the pathogenesis of SCA1, we examined the subcellular localization of wild-type human ataxin-1 (the protein encoded by the SCA1 gene) and mutant ataxin-1 in the Purkinje cells of transgenic mice. We found that ataxin-1 localizes to the nuclei of cerebellar Purkinje cells. Normal ataxin-1 localizes to several nuclear structures approximately 0.5 microm across, whereas the expanded ataxin-1 localizes to a single approximately 2-microm structure, before the onset of ataxia. Mutant ataxin-1 localizes to a single nuclear structure in affected neurons of SCA1 patients. Similarly, COS-1 cells transfected with wild-type or mutant ataxin-1 show a similar pattern of nuclear localization; with expanded ataxin-1 occurring in larger structures that are fewer in number than those of normal ataxin-1. Colocalization studies show that mutant ataxin-1 causes a specific redistribution of the nuclear matrix-associated domain containing promyelocytic leukaemia protein. Nuclear matrix preparations demonstrate that ataxin-1 associates with the nuclear matrix in Purkinje and COS cells. We therefore propose that a critical aspect of SCA1 pathogenesis involves the disruption of a nuclear matrix-associated domain.","['Skinner, P J', 'Koshy, B T', 'Cummings, C J', 'Klement, I A', 'Helin, K', 'Servadio, A', 'Zoghbi, H Y', 'Orr, H T']","['Skinner PJ', 'Koshy BT', 'Cummings CJ', 'Klement IA', 'Helin K', 'Servadio A', 'Zoghbi HY', 'Orr HT']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['38/B/Telethon/Italy', 'TGM06S01/Telethon/Italy']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (ATXN1 protein, human)', '0 (Ataxin-1)', '0 (Ataxins)', '0 (Atxn1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ataxin-1', 'Ataxins', 'Brain/metabolism/pathology', 'COS Cells', 'Glutamine/chemistry/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Nuclear Matrix/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Purkinje Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Spinocerebellar Degenerations/etiology/genetics/*pathology']",1997/11/14 00:00,2001/03/23 10:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/23 10:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/40153 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1997 Oct 30;389(6654):971-4. doi: 10.1038/40153.,,,,,,,,['Nature 1998 Jan 15;391(6664):307'],,,,,,,

Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed two populations of blasts, with about two-thirds of them showing trisomy 11. These findings suggested that the trisomic and non-trisomic clones had evolved from a clone with a common submicroscopic mutation.

Various treatment schedules, using mitoxantrone alone and in combination with other antileukemic agents, have been used in clinical trials. Complete remission (CR) rates ranged from 14 to 44% in refractory AML and from 46 to 79% in relapsed patients. Although a superiority of mitoxantrone over anthracyclines has not been clearly demonstrated in newly diagnosed patients, mitoxantrone is now recognized as a useful drug in first line therapy. The tolerability profile of mitoxantrone indicates that it offers patients an acceptable quality of life compared with standard treatment regimens, and could be a good alternative to the anthracyclines.

The purpose of this study was 2-fold: (i) to determine whether the synergy occurs in K562 human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, which, unlike CP2.0 cells, are relatively resistant to drug-induced apoptosis because they express P210(bcr-abl) and (ii) to study the underlying mechanism for the synergy if the enhancement of cytotoxicity occurs in K562 cells. When K562 cells were treated with fludarabine nucleoside and cisplatin as single agents for 4 hr, IC50 values for fludarabine and cisplatin were 3.33 and 2.28 microM, respectively, as measured by a clonogenic survival assay. The simultaneous treatment of K562 cells with the two agents resulted in synergistic cell killing as determined by median-effect analysis. Such synergistic cell killing by combined cisplatin and fludarabine could not be detected in repair-deficient human xeroderma pigmentosum cell lines. Within the range of cytotoxic concentrations, fludarabine (2.5-15 microM) and cisplatin (3-30 microM) as single agents produced no detectable internucleosomal DNA fragmentation as revealed by gel electrophoresis, nor did the combination of the two drugs induce apoptotic DNA degradation. The effects of fludarabine on the repair of cisplatin-induced DNA adducts and interstrand cross-links in K562 cells were analyzed to determine their correlation with the cytotoxic synergy. The interstrand cross-links were measured by the ethidium bromide binding fluorescence assay and quantitative Southern blotting technique. Repair of the intrastrand adducts was detected with whole-cell extracts using a cisplatin-damaged plasmid as the substrate for the in vitro repair assay. Fludarabine at clinically achievable concentrations (1.5-4.5 microM fludarabine nucleoside; 20-100 microM fludarabine triphosphate) inhibited the repair of the DNA lesions induced by cisplatin in a dose-dependent fashion in K562 cells but not in xeroderma pigmentosum cells. Cotreatment with fludarabine preferentially increased the number of interstrand cross-links induced by cisplatin in actively transcribed genes in K562 cells. These data demonstrate the DNA-repair-inhibitory effect of fludarabine and suggest that this effect may contribute to the synergistic cytotoxicity of the fludarabine/cisplatin combination that resulted in decreased clonogenic survival of apoptosis-resistant K562 cells.","['Li, L', 'Keating, M J', 'Plunkett, W', 'Yang, L Y']","['Li L', 'Keating MJ', 'Plunkett W', 'Yang LY']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas M.

The assay relies on transfection of the cells with expression vectors for the RT of the corresponding elements and PCR analysis of the DNA extracted 2-4 days post-transfection using primers bracketing the intronic domains of co-transfected reporter genes or of cellular genes. This assay revealed high levels of reverse-transcribed cDNA molecules, with the intron spliced out, with expression vectors for the LINE. Generation of cDNA molecules requires LINE ORF2, whereas ORF1 is dispensable. Deletion derivatives within the 3.8 kb LINE ORF2 allowed further delineation of the RT domain: > 0.7 kb at the 5'-end of the LINE ORF2 is dispensable for reverse transcription, consistent with this domain being an endonuclease-like domain, as well as 1 kb at the 3'-end, a putative RNase H domain. Conversely, the RT of the two retroviruses tested, Moloney murine leukemia virus and human immunodeficiency virus, failed to produce similar reverse transcripts. These experiments demonstrate a specific and high efficiency reverse transcription activity for the LINE RT, which applies to RNA with no sequence specificity, including those from cellular genes, and which might therefore be responsible for the endogenous activity that we previously detected within mammalian cells through the formation of pseudogene-like structures.","['Dhellin, O', 'Maestre, J', 'Heidmann, T']","['Dhellin O', 'Maestre J', 'Heidmann T']","['Unite de Physicochimie et Pharmacologie des Macromolecules Biologiques, CNRS URA147, Institute Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retroelements)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Complementary/*biosynthesis', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Proviruses/enzymology', 'Pseudogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*physiology', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroelements/*physiology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*physiology', 'Ribonuclease H/chemistry/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/16.21.6590 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 1997 Nov 3;16(21):6590-602. doi: 10.1093/emboj/16.21.6590.,,PMC1170263,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), the first characterized substrate of caspase-3, shares a region of homology with the large subunit of Replication Factor C (RF-C), a five-subunit complex that is part of the processive eukaryotic DNA polymerase holoenzymes. Caspase-3 cleaves PARP at a DEVD-G motif present in the 140 kDa subunit of RF-C (RFC140) and evolutionarily conserved. We show that cleavage of RFC140 during Fas-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells and lymphocytes results in generation of multiple fragments. Cleavage is inhibited by the caspase-3-like protease inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO but not the caspase-1/ICE-type protease inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CHO. In addition, recombinant caspase-3 cleaves RFC140 in vitro at least at three different sites in the C-terminal half of the protein. Using amino-terminal microsequencing of radioactive fragments, we identified three sites: DEVD723G, DLVD922S and IETD1117A. We did not detect cleavage of small subunits of RF-C of 36, 37, 38 and 40 kDa by recombinant caspase-3 or by apoptotic Jurkat cell lysates. Cleavage of RFC140 during apoptosis inactivates its function in DNA replication and generates truncated forms that further inhibit DNA replication. These results identify RFC140 as a critical target for caspase-3-like proteases and suggest that caspases could mediate cell cycle arrest.","['Rheaume, E', 'Cohen, L Y', 'Uhlmann, F', 'Lazure, C', 'Alam, A', 'Hurwitz, J', 'Sekaly, R P', 'Denis, F']","['Rheaume E', 'Cohen LY', 'Uhlmann F', 'Lazure C', 'Alam A', 'Hurwitz J', 'Sekaly RP', 'Denis F']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie, Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal, Quebec, Canada.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (BCL2-related protein A1)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MATA1 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (acetyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartal)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '143313-51-3 (L 709049)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (Replication Protein C)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Homeodomain Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology', 'Replication Protein C', '*Repressor Proteins', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/16.21.6346 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 1997 Nov 3;16(21):6346-54. doi: 10.1093/emboj/16.21.6346.,,PMC1170241,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A major impediment has been the lack of an appropriate experimental system. At present the conditions for maintaining human stem cells in vitro are not fully known. As a result within a short period the small stem cell pool is lost due to differentiation, making it difficult to examine the correlation between these cells and their function in vivo. Most of our knowledge of hematopoietic stem cells is from animal models in which purified stem cell canididates are assayed based on their functional ability to rescue lethally conditioned recipients. The permanent correction of many genetic disorders of the hematopoietic system requires efficient methods for introducing genes into stem cells in vitro. However, progress has been hindered by the absence of preclinical models that assay the repopulating capacity of primitive human cells. In addition, the development of therapy for malignant diseases also requires assays to identify the target leukemic stem cells based on their ability to initiate the disease. The recent development of methods to transplant or implant both normal and leukemic cells into immune-deficient mice provides the foundation for human stem cell assays. These models assay the repopulating capacity of primitive human cells and provide an important approach to identify and characterize human stem cells, both normal and leukemic. This review focuses on the development of functional assays for normal and leukemic human stem cells and on the new insights that these models are beginning to provide on the organization of the human stem cell hierarchy.","['Lapidot, T', 'Fajerman, Y', 'Kollet, O']","['Lapidot T', 'Fajerman Y', 'Kollet O']","['Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,J Mol Med (Berl),"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Cell Transplantation', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology', 'Mice', '*Mice, Inbred NOD', '*Mice, SCID', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Sheep/embryology', 'Stem Cells/immunology']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s001090050150 [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Med (Berl). 1997 Sep;75(9):664-73. doi: 10.1007/s001090050150.,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MZLs) were not included as a distinct entity because of insufficient experience and controversial opinions. We have studied 32 patients (M:F ratio 1.5:1; age range 25-93 years; mean age 49.6 years; median age 50 years) to determine the diagnostic criteria of primary cutaneous MZL and the relationship with other low-grade malignant PCBCLs. For comparison, three patients with immunocytoma were included in the study. Clinically, patients presented with solitary or clustered reddish or red-brown papules, nodules, and plaques, sometimes surrounded by an erythematous halo. Histopathologic sections showed nodular or diffuse infiltrates involving the dermis and subcutaneous fat. Cytomorphologically small to medium-sized cells with indented nuclei and abundant pale cytoplasm (marginal zone cells, centrocyte-like cells) predominated. In addition, scattered blasts, lymphoplasmacytoid cells, and plasma cells were observed below the epidermis and at the periphery of the infiltrates. Reactive germinal centers were present in 75% of the cases. The three cases of immunocytoma showed a more monomorphous pattern with predominance of lymphoplasmacytoid cells. The marginal zone cells showed a CD20+, CD79a+, CD5- and Bcl-2+ immunophenotype. They expressed immunoglobulin G in the majority of the cases. Staining with the monocytoid B cell-related antibody KiM1p gave positive results in all specimens with a typical intracytoplasmic granular pattern. A monoclonal distribution of immunoglobulin light chains was observed in marginal zone cells in 75% of the cases. Germinal centers, when present, were either polyclonal or negative for both kappa and lambda light chains. Monoclonal rearrangement of the JH gene was detected via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 18 of 26 investigated specimens. Analysis in 12 patients of the bcl-2/immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement using PCR yielded negative results. Lesions were treated by surgical excision followed in some patients by local radiotherapy. Systemic antibiotic therapy was administered to three patients, with good response in two. The prognosis is excellent. After a mean follow-up of 47.9 months (range 6-252; median 24) all patients are alive without signs of systemic lymphoma.

The number of reports linking early response to therapy with the ultimate outcome of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia is substantial and growing. When this study began, these experiences had yet to be comprehensively reviewed. METHODS: A comprehensive search of the published literature yielded contributory reports of 14 trials conducted in the United States and Europe. In addition, unpublished data from one Children's Cancer Group trial were made available. Outcome measures were standardized by conversion to ratios of the incidence of adverse events among poorer and better responders. RESULTS: Early response to therapy was an independent prognostic factor in each of the 15 trials, which together included more than 10,000 patients. The incidence of slower early response ranged from 2-33%, with various measures and criteria used in different trials. Patients with a slower early response were 1.5-6.1 times (median, 2.7) more likely to have an adverse event than patients with a more rapid early response, however defined. Early response maintained prognostic significance after the exclusion of induction failure and within risk strata defined by age, white blood cell count, and/or immunophenotype. Its significance was also maintained in multivariate analyses where performed. CONCLUSIONS: Early response to therapy, whether determined by evaluation of bone marrow or peripheral blood, is a consistent, independent prognostic factor in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Slower early response may serve as a useful surrogate for outcome, a more complex end point, in investigations of the cellular and molecular determinants of resistance to therapy. It may also allow early identification of a patient subpopulation for whom current therapy is less effective and alternative strategies may be justified.","['Gaynon, P S', 'Desai, A A', 'Bostrom, B C', 'Hutchinson, R J', 'Lange, B J', 'Nachman, J B', 'Reaman, G H', 'Sather, H N', 'Steinherz, P G', 'Trigg, M E', 'Tubergen, D G', 'Uckun, F M']","['Gaynon PS', 'Desai AA', 'Bostrom BC', 'Hutchinson RJ', 'Lange BJ', 'Nachman JB', 'Reaman GH', 'Sather HN', 'Steinherz PG', 'Trigg ME', 'Tubergen DG', 'Uckun FM']","[""University of Wisconsin Children's Hospital, Madison, USA.""]",['eng'],"['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/11/14 00:09,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/11/14 00:09'],"['1997/11/14 00:09 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:09 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19971101)80:9<1717::AID-CNCR4>3.0.CO;2-B [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19971101)80:9<1717::aid-cncr4>3.0.co;2-b [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1997 Nov 1;80(9):1717-26. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19971101)80:9<1717::aid-cncr4>3.0.co;2-b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate whether LIF induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and transmits signals through the JAK/STAT (indicating just another kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway in primary cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. LIF increased protein content and [3H]phenylalanine uptake in cardiomyocytes in a dose-dependent manner. LIF (10(3) U/mL) induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130, JAK1, JAK2, STAT1, and STAT3 but not Tyk2 or STAT2. LIF also induced autokinase activity of JAK1 in a time-dependent manner. Gel shift assays for interferon gamma activation site/interferon-stimulated responsive element and sis-inducible element (SIE) revealed that LIF induced dimerization of STAT1 and STAT3 and formation of sis-inducing factor complexes, which subsequently interacted with SIE in the promoter. Preincubation with anti-STAT1 and anti-STAT3 antibodies inhibited the binding of SIF complexes. In conclusion, LIF induces cardiac hypertrophy and directly stimulates the JAK/STAT pathway in cardiomyocytes.","['Kodama, H', 'Fukuda, K', 'Pan, J', 'Makino, S', 'Baba, A', 'Hori, S', 'Ogawa, S']","['Kodama H', 'Fukuda K', 'Pan J', 'Makino S', 'Baba A', 'Hori S', 'Ogawa S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Circ Res,Circulation research,0047103,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, rat)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cardiomegaly/*physiopathology', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Heart/drug effects/*physiopathology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1161/01.res.81.5.656 [doi]'],ppublish,Circ Res. 1997 Nov;81(5):656-63. doi: 10.1161/01.res.81.5.656.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evaluation included retrospective analysis of patients' records, as well as a structured interview with the two parents separately. The quality of life of the children during the terminal period was greatly influenced by their happiness at being at home. Relief of symptoms, particularly pain, was in most instances adequate. Most parents had no complaints to make afterwards. Only some of them complained of having received too little information, too little supervision and support, and insufficient preparation for the death of the child. Thus, the system of terminal care at home proved satisfactory for the child and the whole family in many different respects.

The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between serum levels of IL6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and CRP in febrile children with malignant disease, and relate these levels to aetiology of fever, presence of neutropenia and the effect of untreated malignancy. METHODS: 110 febrile episodes in 70 children with malignant disease were included. Cytokine analyses were performed with sensitive immunoradiometric methods using double monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: IL6 had a sensitivity of 74% in detecting sepsis in children with fever and malignant disease. This sensitivity was not influenced by the presence of neutropenia or newly diagnosed malignancy. A positive correlation between IL6 and the CRP levels on the following day was observed (r = .53). TNF-alpha was elevated in 22% of the episodes and mean levels were significantly higher in untreated malignancy but lower in neutropenic patients. IFN-gamma was elevated in 18% of cases and correlated strongly with mean TNF-alpha levels. CONCLUSIONS: IL6 is a sensitive and early predictor of bacterial infection in both neutropenic and non-neutropenic febrile children with malignancy. It is more sensitive than CRP in detecting sepsis, but the predictive value is too low to allow IL6 levels to influence initial treatment decisions in patients with granulocytopenia. TNF-alpha production seems to be impaired in neutropenic children and serum TNF-alpha cannot be employed as an indicator of bacterial infection.","['Abrahamsson, J', 'Pahlman, M', 'Mellander, L']","['Abrahamsson J', 'Pahlman M', 'Mellander L']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Goteborg, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Norway,Acta Paediatr,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",9205968,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'C-Reactive Protein/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fever/*blood', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interferon-gamma/blood', 'Interleukin-6/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/complications', 'Neoplasms/*blood/complications', 'Neutropenia/*blood/complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/complications', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*analysis']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1651-2227.1997.tb14807.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Paediatr. 1997 Oct;86(10):1059-64. doi: 10.1111/j.1651-2227.1997.tb14807.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One biological resistance mechanism of potential importance is the overexpression of the plasma membrane drug transporter proteins P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and multidrug resistance protein (MRP). Many studies have reported evidence for a correlation of Pgp/MDR1 expression with unfavourable prognostic features in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Failure to achieve complete remission (CR) is correlated with Pgp and the CD34+ phenotype. For MRP fewer data are available, which suggest a basal expression level in most AMLs. Another protein reported to correlate with treatment failure in AML is the lung resistance protein or major vault protein (LRP), a protein with a still unknown function. Co-expression of Pgp and LRP especially seems to define an adverse prognostic population. Further progress towards the understanding of the clinical importance of these proteins is hampered by the lack of validation of methods to determine their expression. A reliable way to measure Pgp seems to be the assessment of the active transport of fluorescent Pgp substrates, such as rhodamine 123 out of AML cells.

HSCs can be easily transduced with retroviral vectors (Moloney murine leukaemia virus = MMLV) in the mouse and expression of transferred genes can be achieved in long-term reconstituted mice. While human haematopoietic progenitor cells can be transduced with high efficiency using amphotropic MMLV retroviral vectors, and expression of the transferred gene is easily obtained in their progeny cells, it has proven problematic to transfer genes efficiently into the HSCs of humans in clinical trials. Efforts are now under way, in many laboratories, to increase the gene transfer efficiency of retroviral vectors, or alternatively, to develop new vectors that can transduce quiescent human HSCs with higher efficiency than is currently possible. This brief review will address the two main research areas that are being explored. Firstly, investigations in human haematopoiesis to gain understanding into the molecular and cellular mechanisms that control HSC behaviour in vitro and in vivo.

In addition, treatment possibilities for patients with CLL have changed as a result of the identification of prognostic factors for survival and the availability of new drugs and treatment strategies. Patients in the early clinical stages (Binet A, Rai 0) with stable disease have a probability of long survival and should not be treated unless the disease progresses. In contrast, most patients with poor prognostic features, such as an advanced clinical stage (Binet B, C; Rai III, IV), diffuse bone-marrow infiltration or rapidly increasing blood lymphocyte levels, have a median survival probability of < 5 years and require therapy. Purine analogues are highly effective. Among these, fludarabine has become the treatment of choice for patients failing standard therapies. The role of purine analogues either alone or in combination with other drugs as front-line therapy is being investigated. Certain situations (e.g. autoimmune cytopenias, hypersplenism) require special treatment approaches (e.g. corticosteroids, splenectomy). Transplants of progenitor haematopoietic cells are also increasingly performed and deserve further investigation in younger patients with poor prognostic features. As a result of these advances, symptoms palliation is no longer the only possible goal in CLL therapy; sustained remissions and even cures are likely to be obtained in the near future.","['Montserrat, E', 'Bosch, F', 'Rozman, C']","['Montserrat E', 'Bosch F', 'Rozman C']","['Postgraduate School of Haematology Farreras Valenti Department of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona Hospital Clinic, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Intern Med Suppl,Journal of internal medicine.

In the future it will be necessary for more international collaboration and a more uniform approach to treatment in order to achieve continued improvements in the survival from this disease. In children it will be necessary to focus efforts on improving treatment of relapsed patients: chemotherapy protocols in those with a first remission of > 36 months, or for the high-risk patients with a shorter first remission, new transplantation approaches directed towards enhancing the graft-versus-leukaemia effect are going to be of increasing importance.

RESULTS: After 1 month of oral treatment at a dose of 50 mg.m-2.day-1, the pharmacokinetic parameters were determined after the first i.v. administration of 1 g.m-2 (bolus dose of 0.2 g.m-2 followed by an 8-h infusion of 0.8 g.m-2) in 11 patients: systemic clearance was 23.02 1.h-1, volume of distribution was 0.75 l.kg-1, and elimination half-life was 1.64 h.

Clinically, reduction of glutamine by administration of glutaminase or the use of glutamine analogs is a common therapy for patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia. In the current study, we investigated the influence of glutamine concentrations on the human myelomonocytic cell line U937. Decreasing the glutamine concentration evoked a reduction in DNA synthesis (R2 = 0.9885, P < 0.0001), increased cell volume (P < 0.01) and the cytoplasm/nuclear ratio, and enhanced the development of vacuoles but did not influence cell viability. Culturing cells in reduced concentrations of glutamine augmented the percentage of cells expressing CD64 (Fc receptor for IgG/FcgammaRI, P < 0.01), CD11b (complement receptor type 3/CR3, P < 0.001) and CD71 (transferrin receptor, P < 0.05). The percentage of U937 cells expressing CD23 (low affinity receptor for IgE/FcepsilonRII) was increased at low concentrations of glutamine at both the protein (P < 0.01) and mRNA levels. The percentage of U937 cells phagocytizing opsonized E. coli (P < 0.001) or latex particles (P < 0.001) was enhanced by lowering the glutamine concentration. In conclusion, reducing glutamine concentration causes differentiation of the cell line U937 along the monocytic pathway.

Thirty-one studies investigated whether occupational or residential exposure to pesticides by either parents or children was related to increased risk of childhood cancer. In general, the reported relative risk estimates were modest. Risk estimates appeared to be stronger when pesticide exposure was measured in more detail. Frequent occupational exposure to pesticides or home pesticide use was more strongly associated with both childhood leukemia and brain cancer than either professional exterminations or the use of garden pesticides. Occupational pesticide exposure was also associated with increased risk of Wilms' tumor, Ewing's sarcoma, and germ cell tumors. Residence on a farm, a proxy for pesticide exposure, was associated with increased risk of a number of childhood cancers. Although increased risk of some childhood cancers in association with pesticide exposure is suggested by multiple studies, methodological limitations common to many studies restrict conclusions; these include indirect exposure classification, small sample size, and potential biases in control selection.

Since nitric oxide (NO) is a known inhibitor of smooth muscle growth, NO synthase (NOS) activity in the presence of hLIF was examined in vivo and in vitro. In rabbit aortic smooth muscle cell (SMC) culture, significant NOS activity was observed at 50 pg/ml hLIF, with maximal activity at 5 ng/ml. In the presence of the NOS inhibitor L-NAME, hLIF-induced activation of NOS was greatly decreased, however it was still 63-fold higher than in control (p < 0.05). SMC-DNA synthesis was significantly reduced (-47%) following incubation with hLIF plus L-arginine, the substrate required for NO production (p < 0.05), with no effect observed in the absence of L-arginine. Silastic cuff placement over the right carotid artery of rabbits resulted in a neointima 19.3 +/- 5.4% of total wall cross-sectional area, which was increased in the presence of L-NAME (27.0 +/- 2.0%; p < 0.05) and reduced in the presence of L-arginine (11.3 +/- 2.0%; p < 0.05). The effect of L-arginine was ameliorated by co-administration of L-NAME (16.4 +/- 1.5%). However, administration of L-NAME with hLIF had no effect on the potent inhibition of neointimal formation by hLIF (3.2 +/- 2.5 vs. 2.1 +/- 5.4%, respectively). Similarly, with hLIF administration, NOS activity in the cuffed carotid increased to 269.0 +/- 14.0% of saline-treated controls and remained significantly higher with co-administration of L-NAME (188.5 +/- 14.7%). These results indicate that hLIF causes superinduction of NO by SMC, and that it is, either partially or wholly, through this mechanism that hLIF is a potent inhibitor of neointimal formation in vivo and of smooth muscle proliferation in vitro.","['Moran, C S', 'Campbell, J H', 'Campbell, G R']","['Moran CS', 'Campbell JH', 'Campbell GR']","['Centre for Research in Vascular Biology, Department of Anatomical Sciences, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,J Vasc Res,Journal of vascular research,9206092,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'V55S2QJN2X (NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aorta, Abdominal/cytology', 'Aorta, Thoracic/cytology', 'Carotid Arteries/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Catheterization', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/*cytology/*enzymology', 'NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester/pharmacology', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/*metabolism', 'Rabbits']",1998/02/12 00:00,1998/02/12 00:01,['1998/02/12 00:00'],"['1998/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000159246 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vasc Res. 1997 Sep-Oct;34(5):378-85. doi: 10.1159/000159246.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we analyzed the structure and expression of rat LIF receptor alpha-chain (rLIFR alpha) cDNA. A full-length clone of the cDNA encoding the membrane-bound form of rLIFR alpha protein was prepared by a combination of LA-PCR and 5' RACE using DNA reverse-transcribed from total RNA isolated from the livers of day-12 and day-14 pregnant rats as templates. The nucleotide sequence of a full-length clone was determined and further confirmed by analysis of shorter DNA fragment prepared by PCR using pfu polymerase. The gene for rLIFR alpha encodes a 1093 amino acid residue protein. The rLIFR alpha protein shows a high degree of similarity to mouse and human LIF receptor alpha-chain protein (89% and 76% amino acid sequence identities, respectively). Only one molecular species of mRNA for the rLIFR alpha gene was detected in the liver and placenta. rLIFR alpha was expressed in liver of both non-pregnant and pregnant rats. The level of mRNA for the rLIFR alpha gene in placenta was maximum on day 16 of pregnancy.","['Aikawa, J', 'Ikeda-Naiki, S', 'Ohgane, J', 'Min, K S', 'Imamura, T', 'Sasai, K', 'Shiota, K', 'Ogawa, T']","['Aikawa J', 'Ikeda-Naiki S', 'Ohgane J', 'Min KS', 'Imamura T', 'Sasai K', 'Shiota K', 'Ogawa T']","['Laboratory of Synthetic Cellular Chemistry, RIKEN (the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research), Saitama, Japan. akemi@postman.riken.go.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Pfu DNA polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular/methods', 'DNA, Complementary/*genetics', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Genes/genetics', '*Growth Inhibitors', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', '*Lymphokines', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organ Specificity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",1998/02/12 00:00,1998/02/12 00:01,['1998/02/12 00:00'],"['1998/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0167-4781(97)00079-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-4781(97)00079-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1997 Sep 12;1353(3):266-76. doi: 10.1016/s0167-4781(97)00079-1.,,,['GENBANK/D86345'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Curcumin and other inhibitors of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase are thought to inhibit carcinogenesis by preventing the formation of arachidonic acid metabolites. In contrast to our expectation of a tumorigenic effect of arachidonic acid, we found that treatment of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-initiated mouse skin with very high doses of arachidonic acid twice daily, 5 days a week for 26 weeks, failed to result in tumors. We considered the possibility that some of the cancer chemopreventive effects of curcumin may be related to an effect of this compound on cellular differentiation, and we investigated the effect of curcumin on differentiation in the human promyelocytic HL-60 leukemia cell model system. Although curcumin alone had little or no effect on cellular differentiation, when it was combined with all-trans retinoic acid or 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 a synergistic effect was observed. It is possible that many dietary chemicals in fruits, vegetables, and other edible plants can prevent cancer by synergizing with endogenously produced stimulators of differentiation such as all-trans retinoic acid, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and butyrate. More research is needed to test this hypothesis. Administration of green or black tea inhibits carcinogenesis in several animal models, and tumor growth is also inhibited. Several examples were presented of chemopreventive agents that inhibit carcinogenesis in one animal model but enhance carcinogenesis in a different animal model. Greater efforts should be made to understand mechanisms of cancer chemoprevention and to determine whether a potential chemopreventive agent is useful in many experimental settings or whether it is useful in only a limited number of experimental settings.","['Conney, A H', 'Lou, Y R', 'Xie, J G', 'Osawa, T', 'Newmark, H L', 'Liu, Y', 'Chang, R L', 'Huang, M T']","['Conney AH', 'Lou YR', 'Xie JG', 'Osawa T', 'Newmark HL', 'Liu Y', 'Chang RL', 'Huang MT']","['Department of Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway 08855-0789, USA.']",['eng'],['CA49756/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Proc Soc Exp Biol Med,"Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

Similarly, differentiation of the human monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and transforming growth factor-beta strongly upregulates the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. Here, we describe an assay system for leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors which is based on the in-vitro differentiation of HL-60 and Mono Mac 6 cells. Different leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors like the nonredox type inhibitor ZM 230487, the redox type inhibitor BW A4C and the FLAP inhibitor MK886 were tested and the results were compared with an assay system based on normal human granulocytes. ZM 230487, BWA4C and MK886 showed similar potencies in these cell lines as compared to normal leukocytes.

In the present study, MLL-AF6 chimeric products found in the t(6;11)(q27;q23) translocation were analysed since AF6, a Ras-binding protein, exhibits a different subcellular localization from that of LTG9/AF9 and LTG19/ENL. Immunofluorescence staining data and cell fractionation analyses demonstrated that MLL-AF6 chimeric products localize in the nuclei despite the fact that AF6 itself localizes in the cytoplasm, confirming the importance of the nuclear localization of chimeric MLL products.

Two major types of Bcr-Abl fusion proteins have been found in human leukemia. Fusion of the N-terminal 426 amino acids of Bcr generates p190(Bcr-Abl) which is mostly found in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), whereas fusion of the N-terminal 902 or 927 amino acids of Bcr generates p210(Bcr-Abl) mostly found with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Previous studies have demonstrated that both the Bcr and the Abl functional domains contribute to the oncogenic activity of Bcr-Abl proteins. Present in both p190 and p210 is the N-terminal coiled-coil of Bcr (aa 1-63), which is shown here to be functionally replaceable with the leucine zipper of the yeast transcription factor GCN4. The ZIP-Bcr-Abl protein transforms Rat-1/myc cells, is autophosphorylated on tyrosine and localized predominantly to actin filaments. Thus, formation of homo-oligomers through either Bcr or GCN4 coiled-coil can activate the tyrosine kinase and F-actin binding functions of Abl. We also found that a Bcr-Abl fusion containing only Bcr amino acids (1-191) can efficiently transform Rat-1/myc cells. Fusion of additional Bcr sequences (aa 192-923) did not affect the transformation of Rat-1/myc cells but progressively reduced the disruptive effect on the actin cytoskeleton. In particular, the Dbl homology domain present in p210(Bcr-Abl) but not in p190(Bcr-Abl) contributes to the stabilization of actin fibers. The modulatory effect of Bcr sequences on actin structure may underlie the apparent pathogenic variations between the different Bcr-Abl fusion proteins.","['McWhirter, J R', 'Wang, J Y']","['McWhirter JR', 'Wang JY']","['Department of Biology and Center for Molecular Genetics, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0322, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA043054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA043054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Actins/ultrastructure', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoskeleton/ultrastructure', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'src Homology Domains']",1998/02/12 00:00,1998/02/12 00:01,['1998/02/12 00:00'],"['1998/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201342 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1997 Oct 2;15(14):1625-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201342.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since recombinant antibodies are increasingly being derived from phage display libraries, we have exploited phage technology to isolate, from a large combinatorial library, human antibody fragments directed against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT). We describe in this paper the in vitro and in vivo properties of a neutralizing anti-RT antibody fragment. We demonstrate that the heavy chain domain (VH-CH1) of the phage-derived antibody is able to inhibit the retroviral enzyme, in that it neutralizes the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of HIV-1 RT. The VH-CH1 antibody fragment also neutralizes the activity of RT of drug-resistant HIV-1 mutants as well as that of murine retrovirus RT. To confirm the broad reactivity of the synthetic antibody fragment, we have assessed the ability of the intracellularly expressed VH-CH1 protein to interfere with murine retroviral infection. To this end, we developed an in vivo selection procedure based on the antibody-mediated resistance to a cytotoxic retrovirus and used this selection procedure to rescue, from a heterogeneous population, cells expressing the VH-CH1 antibody fragment.

In singly spliced transcripts the leader and integrase regions were joined directly whereas in multiply spliced transcripts they were joined with an alternative exon from the protease-encoding region located between the two regions. env transcripts from three different HERV-H elements were identified: one element similar to a HERV-H consensus sequence was primarily amplified from the T-cell leukaemia cell lines and two other more defective elements were amplified from normal lymphocytes. One of these elements was shown to be a reintegrated spliced transcript where the protease and integrase regions were joined, removing most of pol but leaving gag intact. Other spliced transcripts, joining the protease region and the 3'-LTR, were also amplified. The fact that HERV-H elements with an intact env splice acceptor also use the splice sites in the protease-encoding region suggests that this unusual multiple splice pattern could have a biological function in the intact HERV-H.","['Lindeskog, M', 'Blomberg, J']","['Lindeskog M', 'Blomberg J']","['Department of Medical Microbiology, Lund University, Sweden. mats.lindeskog@mmb.lu.se']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Base Sequence', 'Endopeptidases/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, env/*genetics', '*Genes, env', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*virology', 'Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sequence Alignment']",1998/02/12 00:00,1998/02/12 00:01,['1998/02/12 00:00'],"['1998/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-78-10-2575 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1997 Oct;78 ( Pt 10):2575-85. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-78-10-2575.,,,"['GENBANK/U35031', 'GENBANK/U35032', 'GENBANK/U35033', 'GENBANK/U88895', 'GENBANK/U88896', 'GENBANK/U88897', 'GENBANK/U88898', 'GENBANK/U92816', 'GENBANK/U92817', 'GENBANK/U92818', 'GENBANK/U92819', 'GENBANK/U92820']",,,,,['J Gen Virol 1998 Jan;79(Pt 1):212'],,,,,,,

They are blast cells. There is evidence that the constitutively expressed bcr-abl tyrosine kinase might be responsible for the maintenance of the blast state of CML cells. We have studied the effect of two tyrosine kinase inhibitors, quercetin and genistein, on K562 cells. METHODS: K562 cells were treated with quercetin/genistein for a period of 72 hrs and then subjected to staining for apoptosis and erythroid differentiation and Western blotting with c-abl and phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: The IC50 value was found to be 9.2 micrograms/ml for quercetin and 11.8 micrograms/ml for genistein. Quercetin-treated cells did not show any differentiation but showed 68% apoptosis as compared to 7% in control. Genistein-treated cells showed 16% apoptosis and 15% erythroid differentiation. Quercetin reduced the level of p210 by 74% and its phosphotyrosine content by 67.6%. Genistein reduced p210 by 77.8% and its phosphotyrosine content by 16%. CONCLUSION: Both quercetin and genistein are able to down-modulate the tyrosine kinase activity of p210 as well as bring about a decrease in the content of the protein with different effects: quercetin induced apoptosis while genistein brought about both differentiation and apoptosis.","['Deora, A B', 'Miranda, M B', 'Rao, S G']","['Deora AB', 'Miranda MB', 'Rao SG']","['Chemotherapy and Stem Cell Biology Division, Tata Memorial Center, Parel, Mumbai, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Genistein/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1998/02/12 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 1997 Jul-Aug;83(4):756-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These may be endogenous, bacterial or viral, DNA or RNA. On the basis of research applications, the technique is now being translated into diagnostic practice, mainly in the areas of gene expression, infection and interphase cytogenetics. Diagnostic applications are most often based on short nucleotide sequences (oligomers) labelled with non-isotopic reporter molecules, and sites of binding may be localized by histochemical or immunohistochemical methods. The technique can be applied to routinely fixed and processed tissues; with some targets, it is even possible to obtain hybridization in autopsy material. ISH has been used to detect messenger RNA (mRNA) as a marker of gene expression, where levels of protein storage are low; for example, to confirm an endocrine tumour as the source of excess hormone production. Its application in infectious diseases has to date been mainly in viral infections, such as the typing of human papillomavirus (HPV) or the detection of Epstein-Barr virus by the presence of small nuclear RNAs (EBERs). The expression of mRNAs for histone proteins has been used to detect cells in S phase, and related methods may be applied to detect apoptotic cells. Using probes to chromosome-specific sequences, it is possible to detect aneuploidy, and to document changes in specific chromosomes, which may have prognostic significance in some tumours, such as B-cell chronic lymphatic leukaemia. Using sequence-specific probes, translocations can be identified, such as the t(11;12) of Ewing's sarcoma.

To gain a mechanistic understanding of the contributions of ICSBP to humoral and cellular immunity, we characterized the responses of control and ICSBP-/- mice to infection with influenza A (flu) and Leishmania major (L. major). Mice of both genotypes survived infections with flu, but differed markedly in the isotype distribution of antiflu antibodies. In sera of normal mice, immunoglobulin (Ig)G2a antibodies were dominant over IgG1 antibodies, a pattern indicative of a T helper cell type 1 (Th1)-driven response. In sera of ICSBP-/- mice, however, IgG1 antibodies dominated over IgG2a antibodies, a pattern indicative of a Th2-driven response. The dominance of IgG1 and IgE over IgG2a was detected in the sera of uninfected mice as well. A seeming Th2 bias of ICSBP-deficient mice was also uncovered in their inability to control infection with L. major, where resistance is known to be dependent on IL-12 and IFN-gamma as components of a Th1 response. Infected ICSBP-deficient mice developed fulminant, disseminated leishmaniasis as a result of failure to mount a Th1-mediated curative response, although T cells remained capable of secreting IFN-gamma and macrophages of producing nitric oxide. Compromised Th1 differentiation in ICSBP-/- mice could not be attributed to hyporesponsiveness of CD4(+) T cells to interleukin (IL)-12; however, the ability of uninfected and infected ICSBP-deficient mice to produce IL-12 was markedly impaired. This indicates that ICSBP is a deciding factor in Th responses governing humoral and cellular immunity through its role in regulating IL-12 expression.","['Giese, N A', 'Gabriele, L', 'Doherty, T M', 'Klinman, D M', 'Tadesse-Heath, L', 'Contursi, C', 'Epstein, S L', 'Morse, H C 3rd']","['Giese NA', 'Gabriele L', 'Doherty TM', 'Klinman DM', 'Tadesse-Heath L', 'Contursi C', 'Epstein SL', 'Morse HC 3rd']","['Laboratory of Immunopathology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-0760, USA. ngiese@atlas.niaid.nih.gov']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*immunology/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Consensus Sequence/immunology', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Influenza A virus/immunology', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors', 'Interferons/physiology', 'Interleukin-12/*biosynthesis/deficiency/metabolism', 'Leishmania major/immunology', 'Leishmaniasis, Cutaneous/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Orthomyxoviridae Infections/immunology', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Th1 Cells/cytology', 'Th2 Cells/cytology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology']",1997/11/14 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.186.9.1535 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1997 Nov 3;186(9):1535-46. doi: 10.1084/jem.186.9.1535.,,PMC2199114,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cytokines share a common signal transducer, gp130, which forms a receptor complex with the specific receptor for each cytokine. To investigate the role of gp130 in osteoclast development, we examined bone tissues in gp130-deficient and wild-type newborn mice of the ICR background. Soft x-ray radiographs and microfocus x-ray computed tomographs revealed that bone marrow cavities were present in tibiae and radii of both wild-type and gp130-deficient mice. Microfocus x-ray computed tomography and histological examination demonstrated a decrease in the amount of trabeculae at the metaphysial region in tibiae and radii of the gp130-deficient mice compared with the wild-type mice. The number ofosteoclasts in gp130-deficient mice was about double that in the wild-type mice. There were no apparent differences in the distributions of alkaline phosphatase-positive osteoblasts and the osteoid surface on the trabecular bone at the metaphysial region between the wild-type and gp130-deficient mice. The volume of mineralized trabecular bones was also decreased at mandibulae, accompanied by the increased number of osteoclasts in gp130-deficient mice compared with the wild-type and heterozygous mice. These results suggest that the formation of osteoclasts is not solely dependent on gp130 signaling, at least during fetal development. The osteoclastic bone resorption in gp130-deficient mice may be caused by the functional redundancy of bone-resorbing hormones and cytokines other than those of the IL-6 family.","['Kawasaki, K', 'Gao, Y H', 'Yokose, S', 'Kaji, Y', 'Nakamura, T', 'Suda, T', 'Yoshida, K', 'Taga, T', 'Kishimoto, T', 'Kataoka, H', 'Yuasa, T', 'Norimatsu, H', 'Yamaguchi, A']","['Kawasaki K', 'Gao YH', 'Yokose S', 'Kaji Y', 'Nakamura T', 'Suda T', 'Yoshida K', 'Taga T', 'Kishimoto T', 'Kataoka H', 'Yuasa T', 'Norimatsu H', 'Yamaguchi A']","['Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Fibula/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Gene Targeting', 'Mandible/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL/genetics', 'Osteoclasts/*pathology', 'Reference Values', 'Tibia/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.138.11.5534 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1997 Nov;138(11):4959-65. doi: 10.1210/endo.138.11.5534.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One hundred twenty consecutive patients with LM (71 females and 49 males) ranging in age from 10 to 72 years (median 42 years) were treated with involved-field radiotherapy and intraventricular chemotherapy using an Ommaya reservoir and intraventricular catheter system. The diagnosis of LM was determined by a combination of clinical presentation (114 patients); cerebrospinal fluid cytological studies (100); or neuroradiographic studies (42). Systemic tumor histological findings included breast (34 patients); non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (22); melanoma (16); primitive neuroectodermal tumors including medulloblastoma (10); glial neoplasms, leukemia, small cell lung, nonsmall cell lung, and colon (six each); prostate and kidney (three each); and gastric cancers (two). Sixteen patients, all with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, also had acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Patients received one to four (median two) chemotherapeutic drugs and underwent a total of 1110 cycles of intraventricular chemotherapy (median 10). Intraventricular chemotherapy administration and diagnostic Ommaya reservoir punctures totaled 4400, with a median of 46 per patient. Complications included aseptic/chemical meningitis (52 patients); myelosuppression due to intraventricular chemotherapy (21); catheter-related infections (nine); unidirectional catheter obstruction (six); intraventricular catheter malpositioning (two); Ommaya reservoir exposure (two); leukoencephalopathy (two); and chemotherapy-related myelopathy (one). There were no treatment-related deaths; however, seven patients (6%) required additional surgery for either catheter repositioning (two) or reservoir removal (five). Seven patients with catheter-related infections were treated successfully with intraventricular and systemic antibiotic drugs, thereby preserving the Ommaya system. The authors conclude that Ommaya reservoirs are convenient and pharmacologically rational systems for administering intraventricular chemotherapy. Overall, serious complications requiring surgery are infrequent (6%) and most often secondary to catheter infections, Ommaya reservoir exposure, or initial catheter malpositioning. In the majority of instances, catheter infections may be managed medically, as may the most common complications of intraventricular chemotherapy including aseptic meningitis (43% of patients) and myelosuppression (18%).","['Chamberlain, M C', 'Kormanik, P A', 'Barba, D']","['Chamberlain MC', 'Kormanik PA', 'Barba D']","['Department of Neurosciences, University of California at San Diego, 92093-8421, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Neurosurg,Journal of neurosurgery,0253357,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Catheters, Indwelling/adverse effects', '*Cerebral Ventricles', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*adverse effects/*instrumentation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Instillation, Drug', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*secondary', 'Meningitis/chemically induced/*etiology/microbiology', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Thiotepa/administration & dosage']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3171/jns.1997.87.5.0694 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosurg. 1997 Nov;87(5):694-9. doi: 10.3171/jns.1997.87.5.0694.,,,,['J Neurosurg. 1998 Jul;89(1):172-3.

This impact has perhaps been greatest for treatment of severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) conditions for which there were no predictably effective treatment before the availability of these growth factors, particularly r-metHuG-CSF (Filgrastim, Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA; or Lenograstim, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Milan, Italy). Based on careful studies in many countries it is now known that more than 95% of these patients will respond promptly to r-metHuG-CSF treatment with normalization of the blood neutrophil levels and reduction in the occurrence of both major and minor consequences of their severe neutropenia. The availability of this treatment will undoubtedly lead to much additional research on the mechanisms governing neutrophil production and the basic mechanisms that can cause neutropenia among patients who have SCN. Among patients who have SCN those who are diagnosed to have severe congenital neutropenia (Kostmann's syndrome) or Shwachman-Diamond syndrome are at risk of developing myelodysplasia and/or acute myelogenous leukemia. The role of r-metHuG-CSF in facilitating the risk remains to be determined. Thus, it is important that long-term evaluation of the safety and efficacy of treatment of SCN and cooperation in research on these rare conditions proceed under the auspices of an international registry monitoring the clinical outcome of patients with severe congenital neutropenia.","['Welte, K', 'Boxer, L A']","['Welte K', 'Boxer LA']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical School Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Chronic Disease', 'Contraindications', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neutropenia/congenital/pathology/*physiopathology/*therapy', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Periodicity', 'Pregnancy', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Hematol. 1997 Oct;34(4):267-78.,61,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of acetate, propionate, and butyrate separately and combined on RBL-2H3 (a rat basophilic leukemic cell type) proliferation during 24, 48, and 72 hr was examined. Also, the effect of a mixture of the three volatile fatty acids on proliferation of HeLa-155 (a human adenocarcinoma), C57 B1/6J (a mouse melanoma), and MCF-7 (human breast tumor) during 8 days was investigated. 2. Acetate and propionate per se did not present any effect on RBL-2H3 growth during 72 hr, however, when acetate and propionate were added together a significant inhibition of this cell growth was found; 18% for 48 and 37% for 72 hr. The addition of butyrate to the culture medium caused a 75% decrease in the rate of this cell growth either after 48 and 72 hr. This effect of butyrate was pronounced by acetate (86% and 90% for 48 and 72 hr, respectively), propionate (87% for 48 and 93% for 72 hr), and acetate and propionate together (76% for 48 and 92% for 72 hr). 3. Daily addition of a mixture of the short-chain fatty acids (10 mM acetate, 2 mM propionate and 1.5 mM butyrate) markedly decreased the number of cells after 8 days: 58% for RBL-2H3, 42% for HeLa-155, 91% for C57 B1/6J and 55% for MCF-7. 4. These results support the proposition that a fiber-rich diet that leads to great production of butyrate but also of propionate and acetate would be more effective to prevent the occurrence of colorectal cancer than the administration of this short-chain fatty acid given alone.","['Vecchia, M G', 'Carnelos Filho, M', 'Fellipe, C R', 'Curi, R', 'Newsholme, E A']","['Vecchia MG', 'Carnelos Filho M', 'Fellipe CR', 'Curi R', 'Newsholme EA']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Sao Paulo University, Brazil.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Gen Pharmacol,General pharmacology,7602417,"['0 (Acetates)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Propionates)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)']",IM,"['Acetates/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'Drug Synergism', 'HeLa Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Propionates/*pharmacology', 'Rats']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0306362397000220 [pii]', '10.1016/s0306-3623(97)00022-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Gen Pharmacol. 1997 Nov;29(5):725-8. doi: 10.1016/s0306-3623(97)00022-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this review is to examine the publications on this topic in light of criteria for causal inference and to discuss the possible role of bias, confounding factors, and chance. The results of this analysis reveal that there are surprisingly few epidemiologic observations supporting an increased incidence of leukemia in vehicle mechanics.

Additionally, non-cancer endpoints are also discussed with documentation of human and animal studies showing non-cancer health effects of hexavalent Cr exposure on the respiratory system, GI system, immune system, liver, and kidney. There is an emerging understanding that because hexavalent chromate is isostructural with phosphate and sulfate, it is readily taken up by the G.I. tract and penetrates to many tissues and organs throughout the body. This is supported by animal studies and experiments using human volunteers. From the epidemiological studies, there is suggestive evidence that hexavalent Cr causes increased risk of bone, prostate, lymphomas, Hodgkins, leukemia, stomach, genital, renal, and bladder cancer, reflecting the ability of hexavalent chromate to penetrate all tissues in the body.

We here report the identification of an enhancer in a functional human LIFR gene promoter and alternative promoter usage by this gene. A single transcription start site was identified in placental JEG-3 cells and a genomic clone containing 4876-nucleotide upstream sequences was found to have promoter activity in JEG-3 cells. However, in osteogenic sarcoma U-2 OS cell, Northern blot using a probe of the first exon detected in JEG-3 cells failed to detect LIFR transcripts. 5'-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) revealed an alternative first exon and a 0.6-kilobase pair (kb) 5'-flanking region possessed promoter activity in U-2 OS cells. For the 4.8-kb promoter active in placental cells, a minimal promoter was localized within -162 nucleotides. Three regions increased and one inhibited promoter activity. Subcloning of an activation region (-4876 to -3453 nucleotides) into SV40 promoter either upstream or downstream in either orientation to the luciferase reporter resulted in 10-35-fold luciferase induction, demonstrating the characteristics of an enhancer. Transfections into nine cell lines of different tissue origin indicated that the cloned promoter and enhancer in the 4.8-kb fragment was placental tissue-specific. A 226-base pair fragment (-4625 to -4400 nucleotides) was further localized as the minimal enhancer region, in which deletion of either element A (-4625 to -4581 nucleotides) or element B (-4418 to -4400 nucleotides) resulted in the loss of enhancer activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed that these two elements bind to specific nuclear proteins individually. In the middle region between element A and B, disruption of enhancer integrity also led to a loss of enhancer activity, although two SP1 and three NF-kappaB/c-Rel binding sites did not contribute to enhancer function. These results demonstrate a complex regulation of the human LIFR gene, including alternative promoter usage and tissue-specific elements at the transcription level.","['Wang, Z', 'Melmed, S']","['Wang Z', 'Melmed S']","['Cedars Sinai Research Institute-UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA.']",['eng'],['DK50238/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Placenta/metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.44.27957 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)80351-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Oct 31;272(44):27957-65. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.44.27957.,,,"['GENBANK/AF018079', 'GENBANK/U78104']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In human K562 leukemia cells, PKC alpha is important for cellular differentiation and PKC betaII is required for proliferation. In this report, we assess the role of the atypical PKC isoform PKC iota in K562 leukemia cell physiology. K562 cells were stably transfected with expression plasmids containing the cDNA for human PKC iota in sense or antisense orientation to increase or decrease cellular PKC iota levels, respectively. Overexpression or inhibition of expression of PKC iota had no significant effect on the proliferative capacity of K562 cells nor their sensitivity to phorbol myristate acetate-induced cytostasis and megakaryocytic differentiation, suggesting that PKC iota does not play a critical role in these processes. Rather, PKC iota serves to protect K562 cells against drug-induced apoptosis. K562 cells, which are resistant to most apoptotic agents, undergo apoptosis when treated with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (OA). Overexpression of PKC iota leads to increased resistance to OA-induced apoptosis whereas inhibition of PKC iota expression sensitizes cells to OA-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of the related atypical PKC zeta has no protective effect, demonstrating that the effect is isotype-specific. PKC iota also protects K562 cells against taxol-induced apoptosis, indicating that it plays a general protective role against apoptotic stimuli.

The objective of the studies presented here was to examine the influence of N-linked glycosylation on peptide structure and immunogenicity. We engineered the 233-253 sequence of gp46 of HTLV-I to contain an N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue at Asn244. Secondary structure prediction using computer algorithms indicated that this peptide may contain a beta-turn at residues 242-246. Recent work with model glycopeptides suggests that beta-turn conformation in peptides may be induced, and probably is stabilized, by the presence of even a single sugar residue. In the present study, the structures of the 233-253 peptide, SC1, and the 233-253(Asn244-GlcNAc) glycopeptide, SC2, were determined. Similar conformation was exhibited by both the glycosylated and nonglycosylated peptide displaying a beta-turn at residues 243-246 and extended-chain structure at the peptide/glycopeptide termini. Both peptides were engineered into chimeric constructs with a promiscuous T-cell epitope from measles virus and were used as immunogens in rabbits. Both chimeric peptides were highly immunogenic in rabbits, producing high-titered antibodies as early as primary + three weeks. The antibodies generated against either construct were able to bind to whole virus (ELISA) and to gp46 (radioimmunoprecipitation assay). Additionally, human sera of individuals known to be positive for HTLV-I recognized both the glycosylated and nonglycosylated constructs. It appears that the 233-253 peptide is able to adopt a conformation that mimics the structure in native gp46, and addition of a GlcNAc residue at Asn244 does not affect the conformational preference or stability of this construct; nor does glycosylation alter immunogenicity but instead appears to enhance immune recognition.","['Conrad, S F', 'Byeon, I J', 'DiGeorge, A M', 'Lairmore, M D', 'Tsai, M D', 'Kaumaya, P T']","['Conrad SF', 'Byeon IJ', 'DiGeorge AM', 'Lairmore MD', 'Tsai MD', 'Kaumaya PT']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR08299/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biomed Pept Proteins Nucleic Acids,"Biomedical peptides, proteins & nucleic acids : structure, synthesis & biological activity",9506699,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epitopes/chemistry/immunology', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/*immunology', 'Glycoproteins/chemistry/*immunology', 'Glycosylation', 'HTLV-I Antigens/chemistry/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/chemistry/*immunology', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/*immunology', 'Protein Engineering', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/chemistry/*immunology', 'Vaccination']",1995/01/01 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biomed Pept Proteins Nucleic Acids. 1995;1(2):83-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Strategies to define the conformational features of immunogenic peptides and design chimeric and multivalent constructs that mimic native viral proteins have provided the opportunity to create an effective synthetic vaccine against HTLV-I infection. An ideal peptide vaccine to be universally immunogenic must incorporate rationally designed antigenic determinants that accurately mimic the corresponding structural architecture found in native proteins and elicit relevant components of the immune system. We have recently designed and tested chimeric and beta-sheet template constructs containing HTLV-I immunodominant peptide motifs that elicit neutralizing antibody responses and overcome genetically restricted immune responses. To further illustrate putative vaccine candidates, HTLV-I env and tax proteins were analyzed using various computer-predicted correlates of protein antigenicity, secondary structural predictions, and major histocompatibility complex class I binding motifs. These approaches provide the opportunity to design synthetic peptide vaccines against HTLV-I infection that are based on structurally defined criteria, as well as test the influence of glycosylation on peptide conformation and immunogenicity.","['Lairmore, M D', 'Lal, R B', 'Kaumaya, P T']","['Lairmore MD', 'Lal RB', 'Kaumaya PT']","['Center for Retrovirus Research, College of Veterinary Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Biomed Pept Proteins Nucleic Acids,"Biomedical peptides, proteins & nucleic acids : structure, synthesis & biological activity",9506699,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry', 'Gene Products, tax/chemistry', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/*chemistry', 'Models, Immunological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/*chemistry', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*immunology']",1995/01/01 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biomed Pept Proteins Nucleic Acids. 1995;1(3):117-22.,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of HepG2 cells with CT-1 resulted in the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of both transducing receptor subunits, gp130 and LIF receptor, and this phosphorylation was completely inhibited by a neutralizing anti-gp130 mAb. Addition of CT-1 to HepG2 or H35 cell cultures induced a dose-dependent production of several acute phase proteins (haptoglobin, fibrinogen, alpha1-acid glycoprotein, alpha2-macroglobulin). Moreover, the use of a neutralizing mAb to gp130 in cultures of HepG2 cells grown in the presence of CT-1, inhibited the induction of acute phase protein secretion, indicating an absolute requirement of gp130 in the formation of a functional CT-1 receptor.

Therefore, a simple immunohistochemical analysis of BM involvement would help to identify SLVL. Combined with cytologic and immunophenotypic evaluation of marrow and blood smears, this intravascular pattern might be helpful in differentiating SLVL from hairy cell leukemia and its variant.

We examined cancer mortality from 1976 to 1991 among residents of Seveso, Italy, which was highly contaminated after an industrial accident. The area was divided into zones with decreasing exposure to dioxin (A = highest, B = lower, R = lowest). The population of a surrounding noncontaminated area was used as a reference group. Zone A was small (11,516 person-years); in that zone, we saw a moderate increase in mortality from digestive cancer among women [relative risk (RR) = 1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.5-3.5]. In zone B, we also saw excesses at digestive sites (83,610 person-years), 10 years after the accident. Women had an increased mortality from stomach cancer (RR = 2.4; 95% CI = 0.8-5.7), and men had increased mortality from rectal cancer (RR = 6.2; 95% CI = 1.7-15.9). Hematologic neoplasms were increased. The highest risks were seen in zone B for leukemia in men (RR = 3.1; 95% CI = 1.3-6.4), multiple myeloma in women (RR = 6.6; 95% CI = 1.8-16.8), and Hodgkin's disease in both genders (RR = 3.3; 95% CI = 0.4-11.9 in men; and RR = 6.5; 95% CI = 0.7-23.5 in women). Soft tissue sarcoma was elevated only among zone R males (256,408 person-years; RR = 2.1; 95% CI = 0.6-5.4).

This method is sensitive enough to detect exposure to HTLV-I before seroconversion or even before detection by PCR. We examined 12 patients with chronic progressive myelopathy and eight patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) in central Japan, where the prevalence rate of HTLV-I is between one and four percent among asymptomatic blood donors, using the IL-2 production assay.

AML samples from three patients were incubated in vitro with 100 ng/mL DT-GM-CSF for 48 hours, and AML cell kill was determined in a proliferation assay, a clonogenic assay colony-forming unit-AML (CFU-AML) and a quantitative long-term bone marrow (BM) culture ie, the leukemic-cobblestone area forming cell assay (L-CAFC). To measure an effect on cells with in vivo leukemia initiating potential DT-GM-CSF exposed AML cells were transplanted into immunodeficient mice. In two out of three samples it was shown that all AML subsets, including those with long-term abilities in vivo (severe combined immunodeficient mice) and in vitro (L-CAFC assay) were reduced in number by DT-GM-CSF. Cell kill induced by DT-GM-CSF could be prevented by coincubation with an excess of GM-CSF, demonstrating that sensitivity to DT-GM-CSF is specifically mediated by the GM-CSF receptor. Therefore, binding and internalization of GM-CSF probably occur in immature AML precursors of these two cases of AML. The third AML sample was not responsive to either GM-CSF or DT-GM-CSF. The number of committed progenitors of normal bone marrow (burst-forming unit-erythroid, colony-forming unit granulocyte- macrophage, and cobble stone area forming cell [CAFC] week 2) and also the number of cells with long-term repopulating ability, assayed as week 6 CAFC, were unchanged after exposure to DT-GM-CSF (100 ng/mL, 48 hours).

To analyze the mechanism of these chromosomal events, we used cloning, sequencing, and/or polymerase chain reaction mapping to study 15 rearrangements occurring in the MTS1 locus. We found that these breakpoints occur in two clusters (MTS1(bcralpha) and MTS1(bcrbeta) ). The three rearrangements occurring in MTS1(bcralpha) correspond to a recurrent recombination juxtaposing 5' MTS2 exon 1 and 5' MTS1 exon 1alpha sequences. Breakpoints for 10 of 12 rearrangements within MTS1(bcrbeta) are located at a polymorphic (CA) repeat, suggesting that this sequence might play a role in the clustering. For both MTS1(bcralpha) and MTS1(bcrbeta), sequence analyses and PCR mapping experiments show that the tightly clustered breakpoints are located in the vicinity of heptamers whose sequence is similar to those involved in the V(D)J recombination. Moreover, short deletions, GC-rich random nucleotide additions, and clone-specific junctional sequences are present in all cases, further suggesting that the rearrangements are due to illegitimate V(D)J recombinase activity. These data are the first demonstration that a tumor suppressor gene can be inactivated by the V(D)J recombinational mechanism. Moreover, they reinforce the view that this process, normally required for T-cell differentiation, plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of T-ALL.","['Cayuela, J M', 'Gardie, B', 'Sigaux, F']","['Cayuela JM', 'Gardie B', 'Sigaux F']","['Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U462, Centre Hayem, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*genetics', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Deletion', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/enzymology/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Multigene Family', 'VDJ Recombinases']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)56466-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Nov 1;90(9):3720-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rates of complete remission and of disease-free survival of the patients with M4 or M5 leukemia blasts with overexpressed cyclin E seemed to be low. Therefore, we suggest the necessity of a larger-scale study to elucidate the contribution of cyclin E overexpression to the phenotype and the prognosis of certain AML.","['Iida, H', 'Towatari, M', 'Tanimoto, M', 'Morishita, Y', 'Kodera, Y', 'Saito, H']","['Iida H', 'Towatari M', 'Tanimoto M', 'Morishita Y', 'Kodera Y', 'Saito H']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Cyclin E)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cyclin E/*biosynthesis', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)56464-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Nov 1;90(9):3707-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CGP57148B, a 2-phenylaminopyrimidine derivative, has been shown to selectively inhibit the tyrosine kinase of ABL and BCR-ABL. We report here that this compound selectively suppresses the growth of colony-forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) and burst-forming unit-erythroid derived from CML over a 2-logarithmic dose range with a maximal differential effect at 1.0 micromol/L. However, almost all CML colonies that grow in the presence of 1.0 micromol/L CGP57148B are BCR-ABL-positive, which may reflect the fact that residual normal clonogenic myeloid precursors are infrequent in most patients with CML. We also studied the effects of CGP57148B on hematopoietic cell lines. Proliferation was suppressed in most of the BCR-ABL-positive lines; all five BCR-ABL-negative lines were unaffected.

In this study, we investigated the involvement of protease activation in these responses using selective peptide inhibitors of the interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (ICE)/caspase family and a Ca2+-activated protease we recently implicated in thymocyte apoptosis. Apoptosis was associated with proteolytic cleavage of poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and increased caspase protease activity, and cell-permeant caspase antagonists [zVAD(OMe)fmk and Boc-D(OBzl)cmk] blocked apoptosis in response to the glucocorticoid methylprednisolone or the nucleoside analogue fludarabine, indicating that caspase activation was required for these responses. However, a peptide-based inhibitor of the Ca2+-dependent lamin protease (zAPFcmk) also completely suppressed DNA fragmentation and the cleavage of lamin B1 . Strikingly, treatment of cells with zAPFcmk alone led to characteristic PARP cleavage, depletion of the precursor forms of two ICE family proteases (CPP32 and ICH-1), and phosphatidylserine exposure, suggesting that blockade of the lamin protease led to activation of the ICE family. Our results implicate the lamin protease as a target for Ca2+ during chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in CLL lymphocytes, and they identify a novel functional interaction between the protease and members of the ICE family.","['Chandra, J', 'Gilbreath, J', 'Freireich, E J', 'Kliche, K O', 'Andreeff, M', 'Keating, M', 'McConkey, D J']","['Chandra J', 'Gilbreath J', 'Freireich EJ', 'Kliche KO', 'Andreeff M', 'Keating M', 'McConkey DJ']","['Department of Cell Biology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (lamin proteinase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 1', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)56460-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Nov 1;90(9):3673-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now report that DT388-GM-CSF induces apoptosis and inhibition of colony formation in semisolid medium in receptor positive cells, and that the induction of apoptosis correlates with GM-CSF-receptor occupancy at low ligand concentrations. Also, the induction of apoptosis correlates with the inhibition of protein synthesis and is inversely related to the amount of intracellular antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl2 and Bc1XL). Nine myeloid leukemia cells lines and four nonmyeloid leukemia cell lines were incubated with 0.7 nmol/L of 125I-GM-CSF in the presence or absence of excess cold GM-CSF and bound label measured. High affinity receptor numbers varied from 0 to 291 molecules per cell. Cells were incubated with varying concentrations of recombinant fusion toxin for 48 hours and incorporation of 3H-leucine (protein synthesis), segmentation of nuclei after DAPI staining (apoptosis), and colony formation in 0.2% agarose (clonogenicity) were measured. DT388-GM-CSF at 4 x 10(-9) mol/L inhibited colony formation 1.5 to 3.0 logs for receptor positive cell lines. Protein synthesis and apoptosis IC50s varied among cell lines from greater than 4 x 10(-9) mol/L to 3 x 10(-13) mol/L. GM-CSF-receptor occupancy at 0.7 nmol/L GM-CSF-ligand concentration correlated with the protein synthesis IC50. Similarly, the protein synthesis inhibition and apoptosis induction correlated well, except in cells overexpressing Bcl2 and BclXL, in which 25- to 150-fold inhibition of apoptosis was observed. We conclude that DT388-GM-CSF can kill acute myeloid leukemia blasts but that apoptotic sensitivities will depend on the presence of at least 100 high affinity GM-CSF receptors/cell and the absence of overexpressed antiapoptotic proteins.","['Frankel, A E', 'Hall, P D', 'Burbage, C', 'Vesely, J', 'Willingham, M', 'Bhalla, K', 'Kreitman, R J']","['Frankel AE', 'Hall PD', 'Burbage C', 'Vesely J', 'Willingham M', 'Bhalla K', 'Kreitman RJ']","['Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29401, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Diphtheria Toxin/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/11/14 00:00,1997/11/14 00:01,['1997/11/14 00:00'],"['1997/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)56458-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Nov 1;90(9):3654-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, amifostine promotes the formation and survival of primitive hematopoietic progenitors derived from myelodysplastic bone marrow (BM) specimens. To evaluate the hematological effects of amifostine, 18 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and one or more refractory cytopenias received treatment with amifostine in a Phase I/II study. Four cohorts received intravenous treatment with 100, 200, or 400 mg/m2 amifostine three times a week, or 740 mg/m2 weekly for three consecutive weeks followed by 2 weeks observation. Nonresponding patients received a second course of therapy at the next higher dose level depending upon drug tolerance. Bone marrow (BM) progenitor growth was assessed before treatment and after day 21. Diagnoses included refractory anemia (7), refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (5), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) (4), and RAEB-in transformation (RAEB-t) (2). Single- or multi-lineage hematologic responses occurred in 15 patients (83%) treated with the three-times-a-week dose schedule. Fourteen patients had a 50% or greater increase in absolute neutrophil count with amifostine treatment (range, 426 to 11,348/microL). Platelet count increased in 6 (43%) of 14 patients with thrombocytopenia (absolute increase, 16, 000 to 110,000/microL), and 5 of 15 red blood cell transfusion-dependent patients had a 50% of greater reduction in transfusion needs.

Amifostine doses less than or equal to 200 mg/m2 were well tolerated, whereas grade II nausea, vomiting, and fatigue was limiting at higher doses. Three patients with excess blasts before enrollment experienced an increase in BM blast percentage and two patients had evolution to acute leukemia that persisted after treatment withdrawal.

One problem in understanding these mechanisms is to distinguish molecular events leading to differentiation from those leading to apoptosis. We have identified a leukemic cell line, PLB-985, where RA directly induces apoptosis with no morphologic, genetic, or cell-surface marker evidence of differentiation. These cells differentiate following dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), but not RA, treatment. Two-color flow cytometry showed no alteration of the cell cycle after RA treatment, and cell-surface marker analysis of CD11a, CD11b, and CD13 showed no modulation typical of differentiating cells. RNA expression of myeloblastin and transglutaminase, genes regulated by RA-induced differentiation in NB4 cells, was unchanged by RA treatment. Instead, RA induced apoptosis, as shown by typical apoptotic morphological features, genomic DNA laddering, and positive labeling in the TUNEL assay. We found that induction of apoptosis in this model requires a different pattern of retinoid receptor binding and transcriptional activation than is seen in APL cells. As previously described, treatment with retinoid receptor-selective ligands showed that stimulation of RAR alone is sufficient to induce differentiation and apoptosis in NB4 cells, and that stimulation of RXR has no effect on the parameters analyzed. In PLB-985 cells, on the other hand, apoptosis was induced only upon costimulation of both RAR and RXR. Stimulation of either receptor alone had no effect on the cells. Consistent with these findings, bcl-2 RNA and protein levels were downregulated after stimulation of both RAR and RXR, but not with an RAR-specific ligand alone, as in NB4 cells. The expression of several other bcl-2 family members (bcl-X, ich-1, bax, bag, and bak ) and retinoid receptors (RARalpha, RXRalpha, and RXRbeta) was not affected by treatment with RAR- and/or RXR-activating retinoids; RARbeta RNA was undetectable before and after retinoid treatment. Thus, our cell model provides a useful tool in determining the genetic events mediating apoptosis as a response to RA, unobscured by events implicated in differentiation.","['Monczak, Y', 'Trudel, M', 'Lamph, W W', 'Miller, W H Jr']","['Monczak Y', 'Trudel M', 'Lamph WW', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, the Department of Pathology, Sir Mortimer B.

These viruses were also indistinguishable in their abilities to infect and replicate in DBS-FRhL cells, which are permissive for HTLV-I propagation. Immortalized T-cell lines were established after cell-free or coculture methods for infection of activated, human peripheral blood or cord blood lymphocytes with each of the cloned viruses.

The panel was composed of SupT1, J1.1, and U1.HIV cells. The latter is a promonocytic cell line, whereas the other two are T lymphocytic cell lines. J1.1 and U1.HIV cells are latently infected by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). These three cell lines were transduced with a murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based retroviral vector system. CR2 was efficiently and consistently expressed on the cell membranes, conferring enhanced susceptibility to EBV infection. The efficient expression of recombinant CR2 in cell lines of hematopoietic origin allowed for study of the interaction between EBV infection and HIV-1 gene regulation in suitable cell-culture models. The effects of EBV and HIV-1 coinfection results were cell-type dependent. In the two T lymphocytic cell lines, HIV-1 expression was rapidly and persistently down-regulated by EBV. Conversely, in the promonocytic cell line U1.HIV-CR2, HIV-1 expression was transiently enhanced by EBV. The EBV and HIV-1 coinfection result in U1.HIV-CR2 cells is potentially important, as the activation of HIV-1 gene expression in monocyte-like cells may play a crucial role in the mechanism of CD4+ T cell depletion by apoptosis. Therefore, the U1.HIV-CR2 cell line may represent a useful cell-culture system to study the synergism between EBV and HIV-1 in inducing apoptosis in primary CD4+ T cells.","['Romano, G', 'Guan, M', 'Long, W K', 'Henderson, E E']","['Romano G', 'Guan M', 'Long WK', 'Henderson EE']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19140, USA.']",['eng'],['CA65424/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Receptors, Complement 3d)']",IM,"['Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HIV Infections/virology', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/immunology/*virology', 'Receptors, Complement 3d/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*virology', 'Transfection', 'Virus Replication']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S004268229798764X [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1997.8764 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1997 Oct 13;237(1):23-32. doi: 10.1006/viro.1997.8764.,,,,,,,['Copyright 1997 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,

We also found at least two additional candidates of this gene family in the database. These genes were induced by erythropoietin and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor in certain hematopoietic cell lines. The SH2 domain and a C-terminal 40 amino acid region, designated the CIS homology domain (CH domain), are highly conserved in this family, while the N-terminal regions of these proteins share little similarity. A yeast two-hybrid assay and in vitro and in vivo binding assays revealed that in addition to JAB, CIS3 bound to the JAK2 tyrosine kinase domain (JH1), although the interaction of CIS3 with the JAK2-JH1 domain was much weaker than that of JAB. Transient expression of JAB and CIS3, but not other CISs, strongly inhibited leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-induced STAT3-reporter gene activation in 293 cells. Furthermore, constitutive overexpression of JAB and CIS3 in M1 leukemia cells prevented LIF-induced differentiation and growth arrest.

However, it is not clear whether infection occurs through lesions in the genital tract epithelium or takes place via an intact epithelium. We have carried out experiments to test the hypothesis that sexual transmission of HTLV-I is initiated by lymphocyte-mediated infection of intact genital tract epithelia. To examine this question we added either free virus or HTLV-I producing MT-2 cells to cultures of a cervix-derived epithelial cell line, MS751. Although free virus did not infect MS751 cells, MS751 cells which had been coincubated with MT-2 cells became infected. These cultures produced about 50 pg/ml of HTLV-I p24 antigen per 10(6) cells over a 24 h period on the sixth day following exposure to donor T-cells. Proviral DNA could be detected in target MS751 epithelial cells by PCR. Infection of epithelia could be blocked, in a dose-dependent manner, by the sulfated polysaccharides dextran sulfate, heparin, and fucoidan, and by the enzymes fucosidase and mannosidase, but not by a number of other agents that were tested. Since MT-2 cells were observed to attach to the epithelial monolayer, we examined the ability of agents to inhibit adhesion. Adherence was inhibited by the same agents that inhibited infection. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that sexual transmission of HTLV-I may involve lymphocyte-mediated infection of genital tract epithelia and that lymphocyte adhesion to the epithelium is a critical event in transmission of HTLV-I. We speculate that a sugar moiety on the epithelium, possibly mannose or fucose, may be involved in adhesion of T-cells to epithelial cells. As sulfated polysaccharides block both adhesion and productive infection of the epithelium, these compounds might be used as active ingredients in a vaginal formulation to help prevent HTLV-I transmission.","['Zacharopoulos, V R', 'Phillips, D M']","['Zacharopoulos VR', 'Phillips DM']","['The Population Council, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 AI37793/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Microb Pathog,Microbial pathogenesis,8606191,"['0 (Polysaccharides)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', '9042-14-2 (Dextran Sulfate)', '9072-19-9 (fucoidan)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cervix Uteri/cytology/*virology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dextran Sulfate/pharmacology', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/*virology', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/transmission', 'Heparin/pharmacology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*growth & development', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Polysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases/virology']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0882-4010(97)90151-0 [pii]', '10.1006/mpat.1997.0151 [doi]']",ppublish,Microb Pathog. 1997 Oct;23(4):225-33. doi: 10.1006/mpat.1997.0151.,,,,,,,['Copyright 1997 Academic Press Limited.'],,,,,,,,

However, unlike P-glycoprotein, which comprises two membrane-spanning domains (MSDs) and two nucleotide-binding domains, MRP contains a third NH2-proximal MSD, a feature now identified in several other ATP-binding cassette transmembrane transporters. MRP is located on chromosome 16 at band 13.1 close to the short-arm breakpoint of the pericentric inversion associated with the M4Eo subclass of acute myeloid leukemia. We have defined the intron-exon structure of MRP and characterized a number of splicing variants of MRP mRNA. The gene spans at least 200 kb. It contains 31 exons and a high proportion of class 0 introns, alternative splicing of which results in significant levels of variant transcripts that maintain the original open reading frame of MRP mRNA. Analyses of the conservation of intron-exon organization and protein primary structure suggest that the MRP-related transporters evolved from a common ancestor shared with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, by fusion with one or more genes encoding polytopic membrane proteins.","['Grant, C E', 'Kurz, E U', 'Cole, S P', 'Deeley, R G']","['Grant CE', 'Kurz EU', 'Cole SP', 'Deeley RG']","[""Cancer Research Laboratories, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, K7L 3N6, Canada.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (CFTR protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '126880-72-6 (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics', '*Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/genetics', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator/genetics', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Exons', '*Genes, MDR', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0888-7543(97)94950-8 [pii]', '10.1006/geno.1997.4950 [doi]']",ppublish,Genomics. 1997 Oct 15;45(2):368-78. doi: 10.1006/geno.1997.4950.,,,"['GENBANK/AF017145', 'GENBANK/AF022824', 'GENBANK/AF022825', 'GENBANK/AF022826', 'GENBANK/AF022827', 'GENBANK/AF022828', 'GENBANK/AF022829', 'GENBANK/AF022830', 'GENBANK/AF022831', 'GENBANK/AF022832', 'GENBANK/AF022833', 'GENBANK/AF022834', 'GENBANK/AF022835', 'GENBANK/AF022836', 'GENBANK/AF022837', 'GENBANK/AF022838', 'GENBANK/AF022839', 'GENBANK/AF022840', 'GENBANK/AF022841', 'GENBANK/AF022842', 'GENBANK/AF022843', 'GENBANK/AF022844', 'GENBANK/AF022845', 'GENBANK/AF022846', 'GENBANK/AF022847', 'GENBANK/AF022848', 'GENBANK/AF022849']",,,,['Copyright 1997 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,

However, the drug rapidly caused cell death with characteristics of apoptosis when used at concentrations of 5 mM and above. In addition, butyrate stimulated the expression of the stress-responsive heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) gene when applied at both differentiation-inducing and apoptosis-inducing concentrations. The induction of HSP70 by butyrate was inhibited by the simultaneous addition of cAMP-increasing agents (dibutyryl cAMP or the combination of forskolin plus theophylline). However, these agents did not prevent differentiation and only partially reduced apoptosis. Moreover, the DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide, which provoked U-937 cell differentiation and apoptosis with the same or greater efficiency than butyrate, failed to stimulate HSP70 expression. Finally, it was observed that cAMP-increasing agents also abrogated the induction of HSP70 and reduced the apoptosis caused by cadmium chloride, a typical inducer of the stress response. Taken together, these results indicate that HSP70 expression is not required for differentiation of promonocytic cells, as earlier proposed, and that butyrate probably triggers the stress response in these cells.","['Garcia-Bermejo, L', 'Vilaboa, N E', 'Perez, C', 'Galan, A', 'De Blas, E', 'Aller, P']","['Garcia-Bermejo L', 'Vilaboa NE', 'Perez C', 'Galan A', 'De Blas E', 'Aller P']","['Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, CSIC, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Histamine Antagonists)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'C137DTR5RG (Theophylline)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'J6K4F9V3BA (Cadmium Chloride)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cadmium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*genetics', 'Histamine Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Stress, Physiological/metabolism', 'Theophylline/pharmacology', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/enzymology']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(97)93725-3 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1997.3725 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1997 Oct 10;236(1):268-74. doi: 10.1006/excr.1997.3725.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, the part played by the retinoid X receptors (RXRs), which are members of the steroid/thyroid hormone nuclear receptor family, has not been explored. In this study, therefore, the human monoblastic leukemia cell line U937 has been used as a model system to investigate the role of one of the RXRs, RXR-alpha, in monoblast differentiation. RXR-alpha mRNA was present in untreated U937 cells, and levels increased after induction of differentiation with phorbol ester. The same was found for RXR-beta mRNA. Using plasmids containing sense or antisense RXR-alpha sequences under the control of an inducible promoter, we generated stably transfected cell lines which expressed either increased or decreased levels of RXR-alpha, respectively. The sense cell lines (U alpha S and its clonal derivative alpha G2S) showed increased sensitivity to RA, while the antisense cell lines (U alpha A and its clonal derivative alpha B5A) showed decreased sensitivity to RA, as demonstrated by growth inhibition and by regulation of an RA-responsive reporter gene. Both U alpha A and alpha B5A also failed to respond to another modulating agent, 1 alpha,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (DHCC), but only U alpha S and not alpha G2S showed an enhanced response to DHCC. The combination of RA and DHCC together inhibited growth of both sense and antisense cell lines. In addition, alpha G2S exhibited increased expression of CD11b and CD54, while alpha B5A cells showed increased expression of CD102, suggesting that RXR-alpha has a role in regulating expression of cell adhesion molecules in U937 cells.

In contrast, stimulation of phosphatidylcholine synthesis by PKC activators, known to be mediated by PKC-alpha, is widespread in mammalian cells. In this work, various cell lines exhibiting characteristic differences in their PKC systems were used to determine the role of specific PKC isozymes in the mediation of PMA effect on PtdEtn synthesis. In NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, which express high levels of PKC-alpha but none of the beta (betaI or betaII) isoforms, PMA did not stimulate PtEtn synthesis. In contrast, in Rat-6 fibroblasts overexpressing PKC-betaI, 10-100 nM PMA considerably (1.7- to 2.6-fold) enhanced PtdEtn synthesis. In wild-type or multidrug resistant MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells, which express PKC-alpha and PKC-betaII (to varying extents) but not PKC-betaI, PMA had only small or no effects on PtdEtn synthesis. In contrast, in MCF-7 cells overexpressing PKC-alpha, and as a consequence also expressing the betaI- and betaII-PKC isoforms, PMA effectively stimulated the synthesis of PtdEtn. Finally, in HL60 human leukemia cells, which contains PKC-betaII as the major PKC isoform, PMA again stimulated PtdEtn synthesis. The results establish that while stimulation of PtdEtn synthesis by PMA occurs only in selected cell lines, this phenomenon is not restricted to hepatocytes. Furthermore, the data indicate that expression of either PKC-betaI or PKC-betaII, but not PKC-alpha, correlates with the effect of PMA on PtdEtn synthesis. Overall, these observations strongly suggest that regulation of PtdEtn and PtdCho synthesis by PMA involves separate PKC isozymes, i.e., PKC-beta and PKC-alpha, respectively.","['Kiss, Z']",['Kiss Z'],"['The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, 801 16th Avenue N.E., Austin, Minnesota 55912, USA. kissx001@maroon.tc.umn.edu']",['eng'],['AA09292/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamines)', '5KV86114PT (Ethanolamine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Prkca protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Ethanolamine/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylcholines/biosynthesis', 'Phosphatidylethanolamines/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C beta', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha', 'Rats', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(97)90308-8 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1997.0308 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1997 Nov 1;347(1):37-44. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1997.0308.,,,,,,,['Copyright 1997 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,

This p30gag protein (CA41B) was approximately 30 kDa, as expected, and reacted with antibodies for p30gag purified from both murine and feline leukemia virus. This result suggested that the antigenic determinant for p30gag was well conserved in CA41B. Analysis of serum antibodies to p30gag in patients with autoimmune diseases was done by Western blotting. CA41B detected anti-p30gag antibodies in 48.3% of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, 35.0% of Sjogren's syndrome (SS) patients, and 33.3% of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) patients, whereas no anti-p30gag antibodies were found in healthy subjects. This suggested that HERV p30gag or other retroviral p30gag proteins possessing the same antigenic determinant as CA41B may play a role in these diseases. Although detection of antibodies to HERV p30gag in autoimmune diseases is indirect evidence that HERV proteins are involved, this study showed that patients with autoimmune diseases have antibodies to HERV p30gag using a recombinant HERV protein rather than synthetic peptides based on HERV or retroviral proteins of other species.","['Hishikawa, T', 'Ogasawara, H', 'Kaneko, H', 'Shirasawa, T', 'Matsuura, Y', 'Sekigawa, I', 'Takasaki, Y', 'Hashimoto, H', 'Hirose, S', 'Handa, S', 'Nagasawa, R', 'Maruyama, N']","['Hishikawa T', 'Ogasawara H', 'Kaneko H', 'Shirasawa T', 'Matsuura Y', 'Sekigawa I', 'Takasaki Y', 'Hashimoto H', 'Hirose S', 'Handa S', 'Nagasawa R', 'Maruyama N']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Juntendo University, School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Viral Immunol,Viral immunology,8801552,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood/immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/blood/*immunology/virology', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/blood/immunology', 'Mixed Connective Tissue Disease/blood/immunology', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/immunology', 'Retroviridae/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', ""Sjogren's Syndrome/blood/immunology"", 'Spodoptera/cytology']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/10/31 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/31 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/vim.1997.10.137 [doi]'],ppublish,Viral Immunol. 1997;10(3):137-47. doi: 10.1089/vim.1997.10.137.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrated the differentiation of the inducing effect of a naphthoquinone derivative, 2-chloro-3-amino-1,4-nahpthoquinone (NQCA) on the human leukemia cell line U-937. When U-937 cells were treated with NQCA for 4 days, phenotypes indicative of differentiation such as nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)-reducing activity and phagocytosis were induced. To evaluate the route of differentiation of U-937 cells induced by NQCA, we determined naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase and alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase activities. Four days treatment of U-937 cells with NQCA increased alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase activity about 63.5% but naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase was not detected. These results indicate that NQCA caused differentiation of U-937 cells into macrophage-like cells. Since protein kinase C (PKC) and protein kinase A (PKA) have important roles in cell-differentiation and proliferation, we employed a PKC inhibitor NA-382 and a PKA inhibitor H-89 to examine the effects of each kinase on the differentiation of U-937 cells. The PKC inhibitor NA-382 decreased the effect of NQCA on U-937 cells, while the PKA inhibitor H-89 did not. Also glutathione (GSH) inhibited the effect of NQCA. It is concluded that the differentiation-inducing effect of NQCA on U-937 cells may be attributed to PKC activation followed by production of free radicals.","['Kwon, H', 'Choung, S Y']","['Kwon H', 'Choung SY']","['Department of Hygienic Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, Kyoung Hee University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol,Research communications in molecular pathology and pharmacology,9437512,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '143086-33-3 (N-ethoxycarbonyl-7-oxostaurosporine)', '2797-51-5 (2-chloro-3-amino-1,4-naphthoquinone)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.- (Naphthol AS D Esterase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'M876330O56 (N-(2-(4-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Naphthol AS D Esterase/analysis', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives', '*Sulfonamides', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/10/31 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/31 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol. 1997 Aug;97(2):215-27.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report we have analyzed interaction of cellular proteins with Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of Hck. For this purpose we used various GST-Hck fusion proteins comprising a part of unique region, complete unique region and/or complete SH3 domain of Hck, and glutathione S-transferase (GST). When these fusion proteins (or GST), immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with [35S] methionine labelled cell extracts, multiple proteins which interact specifically with SH3 domain of Hck were detected by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The Hck interacting proteins could also be detected by a tandem blot binding assay in which the blot was incubated with purified fusion protein (or GST) and then the interacting proteins were identified by using antibody against GST. When a part of or complete unique domain was present along with SH3 domain, the interaction of some specific proteins was reduced several fold. These results raise the possibility of unique domain altering the properties of SH3 domain, thus modulating or restricting the interaction of SH3 domain with specific cellular proteins. This modulatory effect of unique domain was localized to 28 amino acids upstream of SH3 domain. SH3 interacting proteins were associated with serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase activities towards exogenous substrates. Most of the SH3 binding proteins were soluble in Triton X-100. Differentiation of promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 into macrophage like cells resulted in appearance of novel SH3 binding proteins. Hck was detected in the eluate of WGA-Sepharose column, suggesting that it interacts with WGA binding glycoprotein (s). A rat spleen cDNA library was screened for the SH3 binding proteins by protein interaction cloning. Sequence analysis of the clones showed the presence of proline rich regions containing PPXP motifs.","['Gouri, B S', 'Swarup, G']","['Gouri BS', 'Swarup G']","['Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Biochem Biophys,Indian journal of biochemistry & biophysics,0310774,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (HCK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Hck protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proline/chemistry', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'src Homology Domains']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/10/31 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/31 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Indian J Biochem Biophys. 1997 Feb-Apr;34(1-2):29-39.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Findings of note include a SMR (based on incidence rates) of 1.94 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 3.33) for mesothelioma, and a SMR of 1.81 (95% CI, 0.90 to 3.24) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, both among males hired before 1960. All male semiskilled operatives have a 1.6-fold increase (95% CI, 1.07 to 2.29) in motor vehicle accident deaths, with declining rates since the mid-1980s. The overall SMR for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is at unity (69 deaths), with excesses in technician and office worker subgroups. Four decedents with lymphoma (code 202.8 in 9th revision ICD) had AIDS as a secondary cause of death, suggesting the need to examine secondary causes when studying lymphopoietic conditions.

However, the AbdB-like Hox proteins from paralogs 11, 12, and 13 do not interact with Pbx1a, raising the possibility of different protein partners. The Meis1 homeobox gene has 44% identity to Pbx within the homeodomain and was identified as a common site of viral integration in myeloid leukemias arising in BXH-2 mice. These integrations result in constitutive activation of Meis1. Furthermore, the Hoxa-9 gene is frequently activated by viral integration in the same BXH-2 leukemias, suggesting a biological synergy between these two distinct classes of homeodomain proteins in causing malignant transformation. We now show that the Hoxa-9 protein physically interacts with Meis1 proteins by forming heterodimeric binding complexes on a DNA target containing a Meis1 site (TGACAG) and an AbdB-like Hox site (TTTTACGAC). Hox proteins from the other AbdB-like paralogs, Hoxa-10, Hoxa-11, Hoxd-12, and Hoxb-13, also form DNA binding complexes with Meis1b, while Hox proteins from other paralogs do not appear to interact with Meis1 proteins. DNA binding complexes formed by Meis1 with Hox proteins dissociate much more slowly than DNA complexes with Meis1 alone, suggesting that Hox proteins stabilize the interactions of Meis1 proteins with their DNA targets.","['Shen, W F', 'Montgomery, J C', 'Rozenfeld, S', 'Moskow, J J', 'Lawrence, H J', 'Buchberg, A M', 'Largman, C']","['Shen WF', 'Montgomery JC', 'Rozenfeld S', 'Moskow JJ', 'Lawrence HJ', 'Buchberg AM', 'Largman C']","['Department of Medicine, University of California VA Medical Center, San Francisco 94121, USA.']",['eng'],"['N44DK-3-2219/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA 21124/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK48642/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Abd-B proteins, Drosophila)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*classification/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding']",1997/10/29 00:00,1997/10/29 00:01,['1997/10/29 00:00'],"['1997/10/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/29 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.17.11.6448 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1997 Nov;17(11):6448-58. doi: 10.1128/MCB.17.11.6448.,,PMC232497,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although ligands for Notch proteins have been identified, the signaling cascade downstream of the receptors remains poorly understood. In human acute lymphoblastic T-cell leukemia, a chromosomal translocation damages the NOTCH1 gene. The damage apparently gives rise to a constitutively activated version of NOTCH protein. Here we show that a truncated version of NOTCH1 protein resembling that found in the leukemic cells can transform rat kidney cells in vitro. The transformation required cooperation with the E1A oncogene of adenovirus. The transforming version of NOTCH protein was located in the nucleus. In contrast, neither wild-type NOTCH protein nor a form of the truncated protein permanently anchored to the plasma membrane produced transformation in vitro. We conclude that constitutive activation of NOTCH similar to that found in human leukemia can contribute to neoplastic transformation. Transformation may require that the NOTCH protein be translocated to the nucleus. These results sustain a current view of how Notch transduces a signal from the surface of the cell to the nucleus.","['Capobianco, A J', 'Zagouras, P', 'Blaumueller, C M', 'Artavanis-Tsakonas, S', 'Bishop, J M']","['Capobianco AJ', 'Zagouras P', 'Blaumueller CM', 'Artavanis-Tsakonas S', 'Bishop JM']","['The George Williams Hooper Foundation, University of California, San Francisco, 94143-0552, USA. capo@cgl.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],['CA44338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Adenovirus E1A Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH2 protein, human)', '0 (Notch1 protein, rat)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptor, Notch2)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adenovirus E1A Proteins/genetics', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Notch1', 'Receptor, Notch2', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Transcription Factors']",1997/10/29 00:00,1997/10/29 00:01,['1997/10/29 00:00'],"['1997/10/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/29 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.17.11.6265 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1997 Nov;17(11):6265-73. doi: 10.1128/MCB.17.11.6265.,,PMC232477,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nitrobenzimidazoles were competitive with NADPH inhibitors of DT-diaphorase in menadione reductase reactions, their inhibition constant being unchanged in the presence of dicumarol and being increased in the presence of 2',5'-ADP. These data indicate that the poor reactivity of nitrobenzimidazoles and other nitroaromatics in comparison to quinones could be determined by their binding in the adenosine-phosphate binding region of the NADPH-binding site, whereas quinones bind at the nicotinamide-binding pocket at the vicinity of FAD of DT-diaphorase. The reduction of 4,5,6-trinitrobenzimidazol-2-one by DT-diaphorase most probably involves reduction of 5-nitro group to 5-nitroso or 5-hydroxylamine derivative at the initial step. A certain parallelism existed between reactivities of nitrobenzimidazoles toward DT-diaphorase and their reactivities in single-electron reduction by Anabaena ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase (EC 1.18.1.2) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae flavocytochrome b2 (EC 1.1.2.3), the latter being determined by electronic factors. However, we suppose that the relatively high reactivity of polinitrobenzimidazoles toward DT-diaphorase was due not only to electronic effects, but also to a sterical crowding of nitrogroups by each other. The toxicity of nitrobenzimidazoles to bovine leukemia virus-transformed lamb kidney fibroblasts (line FLK) with a moderate amount of DT-diaphorase (260 U/mg protein) is partly prevented by dicumarol. That points out to partial determination of nitrobenzimidazole cytotoxicity by their reduction by DT-diaphorase. Another important factor of nitrobenzimidazole toxicity to this cell line was oxidative stress, catalyzed by single-electron transferring enzymes.","['Sarlauskas, J', 'Dickancaite, E', 'Nemeikaite, A', 'Anusevicius, Z', 'Nivinskas, H', 'Segura-Aguilar, J', 'Cenas, N']","['Sarlauskas J', 'Dickancaite E', 'Nemeikaite A', 'Anusevicius Z', 'Nivinskas H', 'Segura-Aguilar J', 'Cenas N']","['Institute of Biochemistry, Vilnius, Lithuania.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Nitro Compounds)', '0 (Phenylenediamines)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', ""DD517SCM92 (N,N'-diphenyl-4-phenylenediamine)"", 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Benzimidazoles/chemical synthesis/*metabolism/*toxicity', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Kidney', 'Kinetics', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Molecular Structure', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/*metabolism', 'NADP/metabolism', 'Nitro Compounds/metabolism/toxicity', 'Phenylenediamines/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Sheep', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Substrate Specificity']",1997/10/29 00:00,1997/10/29 00:01,['1997/10/29 00:00'],"['1997/10/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/29 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['S000398619790285X [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1997.0285 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1997 Oct 15;346(2):219-29. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1997.0285.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serum and aqueous humor was collected from clinically normal, random source cats (n = 10); clinically normal, specific-pathogen free cats experimentally inoculated with Toxoplasma gondii strain ME49 and sampled sequentially for 20 months (n = 4); and client-owned cats with uveitis (n = 27). Interleukin 6 activity was measured in each sample. Client-owned cats with uveitis were also evaluated for evidence of present or prior exposure to T. gondii, feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, and feline coronaviruses. Interleukin 6 activity was non-detectable or low in serum from cats of each group. Interleukin 6 activity was not detected in aqueous humor of clinically normal cats.

Despite this, most clinicopathological research has focused on the reactivity of 12E7 in a subset of the small round cell tumors of childhood. Although TdT is widely used in the subtyping of blastic leukemias, its use in the distinction of high-grade lymphomas in paraffin sections has been limited. We collected 24 cases of LyL/ALL (13 B-cell and 11 T-cell) and 15 cases of SNCL from 1984 through 1993. We confirmed the diagnoses using morphology and analysis of immunologic data. We performed immunohistochemistry with the 12E7 antibody, TdT, bcl-2, and CD34 on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material. The patients' ages ranged from 4 to 81 years; nine of the study patients were children. Sixteen of the 24 LyL/ALLs stained with 12E7. In contrast, none of the 15 cases of SNCL reacted with this antibody (chi-square P < .0001). A larger percentage of T-cell LyL/ALLs reacted with 12E7 than did B-cell LyL/ALLs (82% v 54%). Sixteen of 20 LyL/ALLs reacted with the anti-TdT antibody, as compared with none of 11 SNCLs (chi-square P < .0001). Six LyL/ALLs were CD34 positive (of 23), and none of the SNCLs were CD34 positive (0 of 12) (chi-square P = .0519). Bcl-2-positive cases were found among both LyL/ ALLs and SNCLs, although they were more prevalent among LyL/ ALLs (92% v 25%; chi-square P < .0001). When one considers the differential diagnosis of a high-grade lymphoma/acute lymphoblastic leukemia, positive reactions with 12E7, TdT, bcl-2, and CD34 support the diagnosis of LyL/ALL over SNCL. Moreover, we present data that suggests that evaluating for TdT in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue is a more sensitive test than using either 12E7, bcl-2 or CD34 alone.","['Soslow, R A', 'Bhargava, V', 'Warnke, R A']","['Soslow RA', 'Bhargava V', 'Warnke RA']","['Department of Pathology, New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Blood Group Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (XG protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/immunology/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Blood Group Antigens/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/immunology/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/immunology/*metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/immunology/*metabolism']",1997/10/29 00:00,1997/10/29 00:01,['1997/10/29 00:00'],"['1997/10/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/29 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0046-8177(97)90254-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0046-8177(97)90254-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1997 Oct;28(10):1158-65. doi: 10.1016/s0046-8177(97)90254-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MCVs are constructed by condensing plasmid DNA containing the gene of interest with polylysine (PL), PL linked to a replication-incompetent adenovirus (endosomolytic agent), and PL linked to streptavidin for targeting with biotinylated ligands. In this report, we compare gene transfer to K562 cells by using the previously described transferrin-targeted MCV (Trans-MCV) to a novel transferrin-targeted MCV. In the novel MCV, the transferred gene (luciferase) is in the genome of recombinant replication-incompetent adenovirus (recMCV), which also acts as the endosomolytic agent. The level of luciferase gene expression was fivefold higher in K562 cells transfected with Trans-recMCV than in cells transfected with Trans-MCV. Furthermore, targeted transfection with recMCV resulted in prolonged luciferase expression that declined 14 to 20 days after transfection, in comparison with Trans-MCV, where luciferase expression declined by 4 to 8 days. Moreover, targeted transfection of K562 cells with the Trans-recMCV resulted in persistent luciferase gene expression for 6 months. Analysis of luciferase gene expression in K562 single-cell clones that were subcloned 5 weeks after transfection with Trans-recMCV showed that 35 to 50% of the single-cell clones had intermediate to high levels of luciferase gene expression that was stable for 6 months, with the remaining clones showing low or no luciferase gene expression.

Since a common pathological finding in human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated diseases is the infiltration of HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes into various organs, we have looked for the profile of adhesion molecules expressed by HTLV-1-transformed T cells. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that these cells were expressing high levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1 [CD106]), a 110-kDa member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily, first identified on endothelial cells stimulated with inflammatory cytokines. This adhesion molecule was also expressed by T cells obtained from one patient with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis but not by activated T cells isolated from one normal blood donor. The role of the viral trans-activator Tax protein in the induction of VCAM-1 was first indicated by the detection of this adhesion molecule on Jurkat T-cell clones stably expressing the tax gene. The effect of Tax on VCAM-1 gene transcription was next confirmed in JPX-9 cells, a subclone of Jurkat cells, carrying the tax sequences under the control of an inducible promoter. Furthermore, deletion and mutation analyses of the VCAM-1 promoter performed with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs revealed that Tax was trans activating the VCAM-1 promoter via two NF-kappaB sites present at bp -72 and -57 in the VCAM-1 gene promoter, with both of them being required for the Tax-induced expression of this adhesion molecule. Finally, gel mobility shift assays demonstrated the nuclear translocation of proteins specifically bound to these two NF-kappaB motifs, confirming that VCAM-1 was induced on Tax-expressing cells in a kappaB-dependent manner. Collectively, these results therefore suggest that the exclusive Tax-induced expression of VCAM-1 on T cells may represent a pivotal event in the progression of HTLV-1-associated diseases.","['Valentin, H', 'Lemasson, I', 'Hamaia, S', 'Casse, H', 'Konig, S', 'Devaux, C', 'Gazzolo, L']","['Valentin H', 'Lemasson I', 'Hamaia S', 'Casse H', 'Konig S', 'Devaux C', 'Gazzolo L']","['Immuno-Virologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire (UMR 5537), CNRS-UCB Lyon I, Faculte de Medecine Lyon-RTH, Laennec, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*virology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/*genetics']",1997/10/29 00:00,1997/10/29 00:01,['1997/10/29 00:00'],"['1997/10/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/29 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.11.8522-8530.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Nov;71(11):8522-30. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.11.8522-8530.1997.,,PMC192316,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its binding to the Rex response element (XRE) present in the 3' long terminal repeat ensures the coordinate cytoplasmic accumulation of spliced and unspliced forms of viral messengers. Consequently, synthesis of viral structural and enzymatic proteins is strictly dependent on the Rex posttranscriptional activity. Here we report that synthesis of HTLV-1 envelope glycoproteins by Jurkat T cells could be detected only when they were regulated in a Rex-independent manner. Indeed, Jurkat T cells transfected with a Rex-dependent env expression vector (encompassing both the env and pX open reading frames) do not produce significant levels of envelope glycoproteins despite the production of significant amounts of Rex protein. The analysis of levels and distribution patterns of the unspliced env and of the singly spliced tax/rex transcripts suggests that the failure in envelope glycoprotein synthesis may be ascribed to a deficiency of Rex in mediating the nucleocytoplasmic transport of unspliced env RNAs in these cells. Furthermore, despite the synthesis of regulatory proteins, HTLV-1 structural proteins were not detected in Jurkat T cells transfected with an HTLV-1 infectious provirus. Conversely, and as expected, structural proteins were produced by Jurkat cells transfected by a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infectious provirus. This phenotype appeared to be linked to a specific dysfunction of Rex, since the functionally equivalent Rev protein of HIV-1 was shown to be fully efficient in promoting the synthesis of HTLV-1 envelope glycoproteins in Jurkat cells. Therefore, it seems likely that the block to Rex function in these lymphoblastoid T cells is determined by inefficient Rex-XRE interactions. These observations suggest that the acquisition of this Rex-deficient phenotype by in vivo-infected HTLV-1 T cells may represent a critical event in the lymphoproliferation induced by this human retrovirus, leading to leukemia.","['Hamaia, S', 'Casse, H', 'Gazzolo, L', 'Duc Dodon, M']","['Hamaia S', 'Casse H', 'Gazzolo L', 'Duc Dodon M']","['Immuno-Virologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, UMR 5537, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique-Universite Claude Bernard Lyon I, Faculte de Medecine, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, env/metabolism', 'Gene Products, rex/*physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/physiology', 'Genes, rev', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/growth & development/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/*virology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Transfection', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",1997/10/29 00:00,1997/10/29 00:01,['1997/10/29 00:00'],"['1997/10/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/29 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.11.8514-8521.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Nov;71(11):8514-21. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.11.8514-8521.1997.,,PMC192315,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the molecular determinants in the MuLV Env protein cytoplasmic tail which are important for the fusion inhibition activity of the R peptide. We constructed a series of mutant MuLV env genes which express Env proteins with serial truncations, internal deletions, or amino acid substitutions in the cytoplasmic tail. To analyze their cell fusion activity, we employed a quantitative fusion assay. We found that truncations of up to 7 amino acids from the C terminus of the cytoplasmic tail had no detectable effect on the lack of fusion activity of the full-length Env protein; however, further truncations resulted in a progressive increase in cell fusion activity. Studies of mutant proteins with amino acid substitutions in the cytoplasmic tail showed that Leu-627 plays an important role in fusion inhibition by the R peptide, while most of the other amino acids in the R peptide were not essential for fusion inhibition. Studies of mutant proteins with internal deletions upstream of the cleavage site in the cytoplasmic tail showed that this region is also involved in fusion inhibition by the R peptide, although only to a limited extent.

Ponnazhagan et al., J. Gen. Virol. 77:1111-1122, 1996). In the present studies, we investigated the ability of AAV to infect primary human hematopoietic progenitor cells capable of multilineage differentiation. Bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells from 12 hematologically normal volunteer donors were infected with a recombinant AAV containing the beta-galactosidase gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter (vCMVp-lacZ). Whereas 15 to 80% of the cells from approximately 50% of the donors showed various levels of lacZ gene expression, the expression was undetectable in cells from the remaining donors. However, if cells from both sets of donors were stimulated with various combinations of cytokines to induce differentiation into myeloid and lymphoid lineages following AAV infection, then the level of expression of the transduced gene increased up to 20-fold over a period of 14 days. The results of virus-binding assays suggested that the observed difference between the two groups was due to the differential susceptibility of CD34+ cells to AAV infection rather than to differences in transcription and translation of the transduced gene. To corroborate these results, CD34+ cells from the two donor groups, KB (human nasopharyngeal carcinoma) cells, and M07e (human megakaryocytic leukemia) cells were infected with vCMVp-lacZ. KB cells served as a positive control for AAV infection, and M07e cells served as a negative control. Whereas abundant hybridization to the single-stranded viral DNA on Southern blots was detected in KB and CD34+ cells that were positive for lacZ gene expression, little activity was detected in M07e and CD34+ cells that did not show expression of the lacZ gene. These results suggest that the levels of expression of the putative cellular receptor for AAV vary widely in CD34+ cells from different donors. These studies have implications for the potential use of AAV vectors in human gene therapy involving primary human primitive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.","['Ponnazhagan, S', 'Mukherjee, P', 'Wang, X S', 'Qing, K', 'Kube, D M', 'Mah, C', 'Kurpad, C', 'Yoder, M C', 'Srour, E F', 'Srivastava, A']","['Ponnazhagan S', 'Mukherjee P', 'Wang XS', 'Qing K', 'Kube DM', 'Mah C', 'Kurpad C', 'Yoder MC', 'Srour EF', 'Srivastava A']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Walther Oncology Center, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['DK-49218/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-48342/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-53586/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/virology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dependovirus/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*virology', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic']",1997/10/29 00:00,1997/10/29 00:01,['1997/10/29 00:00'],"['1997/10/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/29 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.11.8262-8267.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Nov;71(11):8262-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.11.8262-8267.1997.,,PMC192284,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of an active v-Abl protein tyrosine kinase is required for the oncogenic functions of the virus. Despite the strong growth-stimulatory signal provided by v-Abl, the virus-induced tumors are clonal or oligoclonal, and changes in the growth and oncogenic potential of in vitro transformants occur during the derivation of the cell lines. Both of these features suggest that v-Abl expression must be complemented by changes in expression of one or more cellular genes for cells to acquire a fully malignant phenotype. Such genes could include other oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Among the latter is Tp53, a gene mutated in many spontaneous cancers. To determine if mutation of the Tp53 tumor suppressor gene plays a role in Abelson virus transformation, conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies were used to examine p53 expression in a panel of Abelson virus-transformed pre-B cells. Expression of mutant forms of p53 was detected in over 40% of the isolates. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of point mutations affecting the highly conserved central portion of the protein. These mutations interfered with the ability of p53 to activate transcription from a promoter containing p53-responsive elements and to induce apoptosis in response to DNA damage. In addition, cells expressing mutant forms of p53 induced a higher frequency of tumors with a more rapid course compared to transformants expressing wild-type p53. These data suggest that Tp53 is one important cellular gene involved in malignant transformation by Abelson virus.","['Thome, K C', 'Radfar, A', 'Rosenberg, N']","['Thome KC', 'Radfar A', 'Rosenberg N']","['Department of Pathology and Graduate Program in Immunology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA.']",['eng'],['CA 33771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Damage', 'Gamma Rays', '*Genes, p53', 'Mutation', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/physiology']",1997/10/29 00:00,1997/10/29 00:01,['1997/10/29 00:00'],"['1997/10/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/29 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.11.8149-8156.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Nov;71(11):8149-56. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.11.8149-8156.1997.,,PMC192271,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The replication properties of FeLV-B are distinct from those of FeLV-A; FeLV-B infects many nonfeline cell lines and recognizes the human Pit1 (HuPit1) receptor, whereas FeLV-A infects primarily feline cells, using a distinct but as yet undefined receptor. Here, we demonstrate that some FeLV-Bs can also use human Pit2 (HuPit2) and hamster Pit2 (HaPit2) for entry. By making viruses that contain chimeric surface (SU) envelope proteins from FeLV-A and FeLV-B, and testing their infectivity, we have defined genetic determinants that confer host range and specific receptor recognition. HuPit1 receptor recognition determinants localize to the N-terminal region of the FeLV-B SU, amino acids 83 to 116, encompassing the N-terminal portion of variable region A (VRA). While this 34-amino-acid domain of the FeLV-B VRA is sufficient for infection of some cells (feline, canine, and human), amino acids 146 to 249 of FeLV-B, which include variable region B (VRB), were required for efficient infection in other cell types (hamster, bovine, and rat). Chimeras encoding FeLV-B VRA and VRB also infected cells expressing HaPit2 and HuPit2 receptors more efficiently than chimeras encoding only the VRA of FeLV-B, suggesting that VRB provides a secondary determinant that is both cell and receptor specific. However, viruses containing additional FeLV-B sequences in the C terminus of SU could not recognize HuPit2, implying that there is a determinant beyond VRB that negatively affects HuPit2 interactions. Thus, Pit2 recognition may drive selection for the generation of specific FeLV-B recombinants, offering an explanation for the two major classes of FeLV-B that have been observed in vivo. Furthermore, the finding that some FeLV-Bs can use both Pit1 and Pit2 may explain previous observations that FeLV-B and GALV, which primarily uses Pit1, display nonreciprocal interference on many cell types.","['Boomer, S', 'Eiden, M', 'Burns, C C', 'Overbaugh, J']","['Boomer S', 'Eiden M', 'Burns CC', 'Overbaugh J']","['University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA51080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA62771-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM07270/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cats/virology', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Dogs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*metabolism', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Species Specificity', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*metabolism']",1997/10/29 00:00,1997/10/29 00:01,['1997/10/29 00:00'],"['1997/10/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/29 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.11.8116-8123.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Nov;71(11):8116-23. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.11.8116-8123.1997.,,PMC192267,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is expression of the chimeric transcript, PML/RAR alpha, in these APL cells. These clinical APL cases respond to the differentiation agent all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) with complete but not durable remissions because ATRA resistance develops. The NB4 APL cell line expresses PML/RAR alpha and responds to the growth inhibitory and differentiation-inducing signals of ATRA. To identify mechanisms responsible for ATRA resistance in APL, ATRA-resistant NB4 cell lines were derived from parental NB4 cells using different strategies. These lines were resistant to the growth inhibition and differentiation effects of ATRA. ATRA-resistant cells were isolated as a de novo resistant line from parental NB4 cells (NB4-R1), following chemical mutagenization and selection in ATRA (NB4-R2), or after chronic selection in ATRA (NB4-R3). Common defects linked to this ATRA resistance were found. When cultured in ATRA, these resistant cells still express PML, RAR alpha, and PML/RAR alpha proteins. Sequence abnormalities were not detected in the RAR alpha DNA binding domains cloned from a representative RA-resistant NB4 line. In ATRA-sensitive but not ATRA-resistant NB4 cells, ATRA down-regulated retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXR alpha) expression, a known marker of ATRA response in parental NB4 cells. Notably, engineered overexpression of RXR alpha in ATRA-sensitive NB4 cells did not block ATRA-mediated growth suppression. ATRA treatment of these resistant NB4 lines did not signal a decline in telomerase activity or reorganization of PML-associated nuclear bodies, but both events occurred in ATRA-sensitive NB4 cells. These ATRA-resistant NB4 lines are not fully differentiation-defective, since monocytic maturation was induced following treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D3 (vitamin D3). Notably, induced monocytic differentiation of these distinct ATRA-resistant APL lines markedly repressed telomerase activity. Thus, this study suggests that persistent telomerase activity and nuclear body disorganization are linked to ATRA resistance in APL.","['Nason-Burchenal, K', 'Maerz, W', 'Albanell, J', 'Allopenna, J', 'Martin, P', 'Moore, M A', 'Dmitrovsky, E']","['Nason-Burchenal K', 'Maerz W', 'Albanell J', 'Allopenna J', 'Martin P', 'Moore MA', 'Dmitrovsky E']","['Laboratory of Molecular Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA 29502-14A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA62275-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U9CA67842-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '12H3O2UGSF (Methylnitronitrosoguanidine)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinogens', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Methylnitronitrosoguanidine', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/biosynthesis', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/10/29 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/29 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-4681(09)60685-X [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-0436.1997.6150321.x [doi]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 1997 Aug;61(5):321-31. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-0436.1997.6150321.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Irinotecan, and its more potent metabolite SN-38 (7- ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin), interfere with mammalian DNA topoisomerase I and cancer cell death appears to result from DNA strand breaks caused by the formation of cleavable complexes. The main clinical adverse effects of irinotecan therapy are neutropenia and diarrhoea. Irinotecan has shown activity in leukaemia, lymphoma and the following cancer sites: colorectum, lung, ovary, cervix, pancreas, stomach and breast. Following the intravenous administration of irinotecan at 100 to 350 mg/m2, mean maximum irinotecan plasma concentrations are within the 1 to 10 mg/L range. Plasma concentrations can be described using a 2- or 3-compartment model with a mean terminal half-life ranging from 5 to 27 hours. The volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) ranges from 136 to 255 L/m2, and the total body clearance is 8 to 21 L/h/m2. Irinotecan is 65% bound to plasma proteins. The areas under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of both irinotecan and SN-38 increase proportionally to the administered dose, although interpatient variability is important. SN-38 levels achieved in humans are about 100-fold lower than corresponding irinotecan concentrations, but these concentrations are potentially important as SN-38 is 100- to 1000-fold more cytotoxic than the parent compound. SN-38 is 95% bound to plasma proteins. Maximum concentrations of SN-38 are reached about 1 hour after the beginning of a short intravenous infusion. SN-38 plasma decay follows closely that of the parent compound with an apparent terminal half-life ranging from 6 to 30 hours. In human plasma at equilibrium, the irinotecan lactone form accounts for 25 to 30% of the total and SN-38 lactone for 50 to 64%. Irinotecan is extensively metabolised in the liver. The bipiperidinocarbonylxy group of irinotecan is first removed by hydrolysis to yield the corresponding carboxylic acid and SN-38 by carboxyesterase. SN-38 can be converted into SN-38 glucuronide by hepatic UDP-glucuronyltransferase. Another recently identified metabolite is 7-ethyl-10-[4-N-(5-aminopentanoic acid)-1-piperidino]-carbonyloxy-camptothecin (APC). This metabolite is a weak inhibitor of KB cell growth and a poor inducer of topoisomerase I DNA-cleavable complexes (100-fold less potent than SN-38). Numerous other unidentified metabolites have been detected in bile and urine. The mean 24-hour irinotecan urinary excretion represents 17 to 25% of the administered dose. Recovery of SN-38 and its glucuronide in urine is low and represents 1 to 3% of the irinotecan dose. Cumulative biliary excretion is 25% for irinotecan, 2% for SN-38 glucuronide and about 1% for SN-38. The pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and SN-38 are not influenced by prior exposure to the parent drug. The AUC of irinotecan and SN-38 correlate significantly with leuco-neutropenia and sometimes with the intensity of diarrhoea. Certain hepatic function parameters have been correlated negatively with irinotecan total body clearance. It was noted that most tumour responses were observed at the highest doses administered in phase I trials, which indicates a dose-response relationship with this drug. In the future, these pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships will undoubtedly prove useful in minimising the toxicity and maximise the likelihood of tumour response in patients.","['Chabot, G G']",['Chabot GG'],"['Pharmacology Laboratory (URA 147 CNRS), Gustave-Roussy Institute, Villejuif, France. gchabot@igr.fr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Camptothecin/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Irinotecan', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors']",1997/10/29 00:00,1997/10/29 00:01,['1997/10/29 00:00'],"['1997/10/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/29 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00003088-199733040-00001 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 1997 Oct;33(4):245-59. doi: 10.2165/00003088-199733040-00001.,114,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is not clear, however, whether differentiation merely is a consequence of the ability of p53 to arrest cell proliferation or whether hitherto unknown molecular mechanisms are responsible for the p53-mediated differentiation. To further explore the role of p53 in leukemic cell differentiation, we investigated whether transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), a cytokine involved in cell cycle control at several levels, can cooperate with wild-type p53 to induce differentiation of monoblastic U-937 and erythroleukemic K562 cells. Indeed, wild-type p53-expressing cells were found to be more sensitive to TGF-beta1-induced differentiation than control cells, lending support to the idea that p53 is of importance for differentiation induction of leukemic cells. In addition, it is shown that TGF-beta1 can suppress p53-mediated cell death, thus reinforcing the differentiation response. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) are downstream effectors of p53-mediated growth arrest. Therefore, the roles for these molecules in p53-mediated differentiation were examined. The p53-dependent signals of differentiation were associated with induction of p21 in both cell lines investigated. However, activation of pRb by induced hypophosphorylation and concomitant decreased growth rate on p53-mediated differentiation was observed only in U-937 cells expressing an inducible, temperature-sensitive form of p53 but not in K562 cells constitutively expressing p53. Thus, our data suggest a role for p53 in the regulation of differentiation in leukemic cells that can be independent of its ability to activate pRb and arrest cell proliferation.","['Ehinger, M', 'Bergh, G', 'Johnsson, E', 'Gullberg, U', 'Olsson, I']","['Ehinger M', 'Bergh G', 'Johnsson E', 'Gullberg U', 'Olsson I']","['Department of Hematology, University of Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Genes, p53/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'Temperature', 'Transfection', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1997/10/28 00:00,1997/10/28 00:01,['1997/10/28 00:00'],"['1997/10/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/28 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/28 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1997 Oct;8(10):1127-37.,,,,,,,,['Cell Growth Differ 1998 Feb;9(2):195'],,,,,,,

In this study, we demonstrate the disparate fates of HL-60 cells treated with the phorbol ester 12,13-phorbol dibutyric acid (PDBu) or DMSO. After DMSO treatment, HL-60 cells eventually died via apoptosis, whereas the viability of PDBu-treated cells was not affected during the same interval. The levels of the apoptosis effector proteins Bak and Bad were enhanced, whereas there was a slight down-regulation of the apoptosis suppressor protein Bcl-2 after treatment of the cells with PDBu and DMSO. Treatment with DMSO resulted in the elevation of the apoptosis effector Bax, whereas treatment with PDBu did not significantly alter the levels of this protein. However, treatment of HL-60 cells with PDBu induced the rapid expression of the apoptosis suppressor protein Bcl-xL, whereas the expression of this protein remained unaltered in DMSO-treated cells. The generality of this finding was confirmed by the induction of Bcl-xL in human myeloid U-937 cells, human peripheral blood monocytes exposed to phorbol ester, and mouse thioglycollate-activated and resident peritoneal macrophages. PDBu-treated HL-60 cells remained viable for 7 days and thereafter began to die via apoptosis, with a concomitant down-regulation of Bcl-xL. In conclusion, we propose that Bcl-xL expression is associated with differentiation and survival of hematopoietic cells along the monocyte/macrophage lineage.","['Chatterjee, D', 'Han, Z', 'Mendoza, J', 'Goodglick, L', 'Hendrickson, E A', 'Pantazis, P', 'Wyche, J H']","['Chatterjee D', 'Han Z', 'Mendoza J', 'Goodglick L', 'Hendrickson EA', 'Pantazis P', 'Wyche JH']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Cell Biology and Biochemistry, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA.

Occurrence inside the cranium is rare, and there has been only one case of primary EMCT involving the cerebellum reported in the literature. The case we report here is a blastic EMCT occurring in the cerebellum of a 3-year-old boy who had no signs of leukemia or any hematological disorder throughout the entire course.

The tumor disappeared during chemotherapy consisting of 12 treatments. However, it recurred and metastasized to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shortly after the therapy was completed.

Different analogues of the antitumor antibiotic rebeccamycin substituted on the imide nitrogen with a methyl group were synthesized.

Most ABL and BCR genes (75%) are located at a distance of 20-65% of the local radius from the nuclear centre to the nuclear membrane. A chimeric BCR-ABL gene located on a derivative chromosome 22 resulting from t(9;22)(q34;q11) [the so-called Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome] as well as the intact ABL and BCR genes of patients suffering from chronic myeloid leukaemia are also located mostly in this region, which has a mean thickness of 2 microns in bone marrow cells. We have not found any significant differences in the location of the two genes in the G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle, nor between bone marrow cells and stimulated lymphocytes. Irradiation of lymphocytes with a dose of 5 Gy of gamma-rays results in a shift of both genes to the central region of the nucleus (0-20% of the radius distant from the nuclear centre) in about 15% of the cells. The minimum distance between one ABL and one BCR gene is less than 1 micron in 47.5% of bone marrow cells of control donors. Such a small distance is found between homologous ABL and between homologous BCR genes in only 8.1% and 8.4% of cells, respectively. It is possible that the relative closeness of nonhomologous ABL and BCR genes in interphase nuclei of bone marrow cells could facilitate translocation between these genes. In 16.4% of bone marrow cells one ABL and one BCR gene are juxtaposed (the distance between them varies from 0-0.5 micron) and simulate the Ph chromosome. This juxtaposition is the result of the projection of two genes located one above another into a plane, as follows from the probability calculation.","['Lukasova, E', 'Kozubek, S', 'Kozubek, M', 'Kjeronska, J', 'Ryznar, L', 'Horakova, J', 'Krahulcova, E', 'Horneck, G']","['Lukasova E', 'Kozubek S', 'Kozubek M', 'Kjeronska J', 'Ryznar L', 'Horakova J', 'Krahulcova E', 'Horneck G']","['Institute of Biophysics, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Hum Genet,Human genetics,7613873,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Nucleus/*chemistry', 'DNA Probes/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gamma Rays', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes/radiation effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics']",1997/10/28 00:00,1997/10/28 00:01,['1997/10/28 00:00'],"['1997/10/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/28 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004390050547 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Genet. 1997 Oct;100(5-6):525-35. doi: 10.1007/s004390050547.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The peptides selected were substrates of HIV protease or of avian sarcoma virus protease, both of which have been reported to be cleaved specifically at X-Pro by pepsin as well as by the corresponding viral protease enzyme. By working at 0 degrees C, it was possible to separate kinetically cleavage and cis/trans isomerization. For the case of the protease substrate, Ser-Gln-Asn-FPhe-Pro-Ile-Val-Gln, cleavage was shown to be specific for the trans conformation. A value for the rate constant for hydrolysis of the trans peptide divided by the Michaelis constant, ktH/KMtrans = 0.3 min-1 mM-1 was obtained with this substrate, and the Michaelis constant appears to be considerably higher than the substrate concentration, 3.7 mM, used in the study. On a slower time scale, additional cleavages can readily be detected. For the avian leukemia virus protease substrate, Thr-Phe-Gln-Ala-FPhe-Pro-Leu-Arg-Glu-Ala, the cleavage was both slower and less specific. In addition to the primary cleavage at the FPhe-Pro site, cleavage also occurs at the Ala-FPhe bond on a somewhat slower time scale.

In previous work, we identified an essential site in the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter, Tax-responsive element 1 (TRE1), necessary for transactivation by Tax. We also identified Sp1, Sp3, and NGFI-A/Egr-1 as the primary nuclear transcription factors binding to TRE1 which mediate Tax responsiveness. In the present work, we have investigated the mechanism(s) whereby Tax transactivates the c-sis/PDGF-B proto-oncogene. In vitro transcription assays showed that Tax was able to significantly increase the transcriptional activity of a template containing the -257 to +74 region of the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis showed that Tax increased the DNA binding activity of both Sp1 and NGFI-A/Egr-1 using a TRE1 probe. Analysis of Tax mutants showed that two mutants, IEXC29S and IEXL320G, were unable to significantly transactivate the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Tax is able to stably bind to both Sp1 and NGFI-A/Egr-1. Interestingly, co-immunoprecipitation analysis also revealed that Tax mutant IEXC29S is unable to interact with NGFI-A/Egr-1, whereas Tax mutant IEXL320G is able to interact with NGFI-A/Egr-1.","['Trejo, S R', 'Fahl, W E', 'Ratner, L']","['Trejo SR', 'Fahl WE', 'Ratner L']","['Division of Molecular Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['5 T32 HL07088/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immediate-Early Proteins', 'Luciferases', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Zinc Fingers']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.43.27411 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)68060-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Oct 24;272(43):27411-21. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.43.27411.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is located predominantly at the N terminus of Zn-finger DNA-binding proteins, where it may function as a repression domain, and less frequently in actin-binding and poxvirus-encoded proteins, where it may function as a protein-protein interaction interface. A prototypic human BTB/POZ protein, PLZF (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger) is fused to RARalpha (retinoic acid receptor alpha) in a subset of acute promyelocytic leukemias (APLs), where it acts as a potent oncogene. The exact role of the BTB/POZ domain in protein-protein interactions and/or transcriptional regulation is unknown. We have overexpressed, purified, characterized, and crystallized the BTB/POZ domain from PLZF (PLZF-BTB/POZ). Gel filtration, dynamic light scattering, and equilibrium sedimentation experiments show that PLZF-BTB/POZ forms a homodimer with a Kd below 200 nM. Differential scanning calorimetry and equilibrium denaturation experiments are consistent with the PLZF-BTB/POZ dimer undergoing a two-state unfolding transition with a Tm of 70.4 degrees C, and a DeltaG of 12.8 +/- 0.4 kcal/mol. Circular dichroism shows that the PLZF-BTB/POZ dimer has significant secondary structure including about 45% helix and 20% beta-sheet. We have prepared crystals of the PLZF-BTB/POZ that are suitable for a high resolution structure determination using x-ray crystallography. The crystals form in the space group I222 or I212121 with a = 38.8, b = 77.7, and c = 85.3 A and contain 1 protein subunit per asymmetric unit with approximately 40% solvent. Our data support the hypothesis that the BTB/POZ domain mediates a functionally relevant dimerization function in vivo. The crystal structure of the PLZF-BTB/POZ domain will provide a paradigm for understanding the structural basis underlying BTB/POZ domain function.","['Li, X', 'Lopez-Guisa, J M', 'Ninan, N', 'Weiner, E J', 'Rauscher, F J 3rd', 'Marmorstein, R']","['Li X', 'Lopez-Guisa JM', 'Ninan N', 'Weiner EJ', 'Rauscher FJ 3rd', 'Marmorstein R']","['The Wistar Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Bric-a-brac protein 1, Drosophila)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ZBTB6 protein, human)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Calorimetry, Differential Scanning', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Dimerization', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Protein Folding', '*Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Ultracentrifugation', 'Zinc Fingers']",1997/10/27 20:32,2001/03/28 10:01,['1997/10/27 20:32'],"['1997/10/27 20:32 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 20:32 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.43.27324 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)68049-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Oct 24;272(43):27324-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.43.27324.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Role of heme incorporation and heterodimer formation in maturation and stability of gp91phox and p22phox subunits.,27288-94,"The NADPH oxidase cytochrome b558 is a membrane heterodimer comprised of a glycosylated 91-kDa subunit, gp91(phox), and a nonglycosylated 22-kDa subunit, p22(phox). The role of heme in cytochrome b558 biosynthesis was studied using succinyl acetone, an inhibitor of heme synthesis, in PLB-985 myeloid cells undergoing granulocytic differentiation. Succinyl acetone markedly reduced expression of p22(phox) and the mature 91-kDa form of gp91(phox) but not its 65-kDa high mannose precursor, in association with a profound reduction in NADPH oxidase activity. Expression of non-heme-containing cytosolic oxidase components was unaffected. The reduction in cytochrome b558 expression and NADPH oxidase activity was prevented by adding exogenous heme and was reversible upon removal of succinyl acetone. Transgenic expression of gp91(phox) in monkey COS-7 and murine 3T3 cells, both of which lacked endogenous p22(phox) mRNA, demonstrated that p22(phox) was not required for maturation of gp91(phox) carbohydrate to complex oligosaccharides. However, coexpression of transgenic p22(phox) increased the abundance of the mature gp91(phox) glycoprotein. These results suggest that heme incorporation plays an important role in cytochrome b558 assembly and provide further support for the concept that stability of p22(phox) and the mature gp91(phox) subunit is increased by heterodimer formation.","['Yu, L', 'Zhen, L', 'Dinauer, M C']","['Yu L', 'Zhen L', 'Dinauer MC']","['Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Department of Pediatrics (Hematology/Oncology), James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children, Indiana University Medical Center, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA.']",['eng'],['R01HL45635/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cytochrome b Group)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Heptanoates)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '51568-18-4 (succinylacetone)', '9064-78-2 (cytochrome b558)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (CYBB protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.3.1 (CYBA protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.99.1 (NADPH Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Cytochrome b Group/*biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Dimerization', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Granulocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Granulomatous Disease, Chronic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heme/*metabolism', 'Heptanoates/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/chemistry', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Mice', 'NADPH Dehydrogenase/*biosynthesis/chemistry', 'NADPH Oxidase 2', 'NADPH Oxidases/*biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Phagocytes/*enzymology', 'Phosphoproteins/*biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.43.27288 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)68043-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Oct 24;272(43):27288-94. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.43.27288.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ribozymes were delivered into cells using anionic or cationic liposomes fused with hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ). Cellular uptake of ribozymes complexed with HVJ-cationic liposomes was 15-20 times higher cellular uptake than naked ribozymes, and 4-5 times higher than that of ribozymes complexed with HVJ-anionic liposomes. HVJ-cationic liposomes promoted accumulation of ribozymes in cytoplasm and accelerated transport to the nucleus. Tax protein levels were decreased about 95% and were five times lower when the same amount of TR was introduced into the cells using HVJ-cationic, rather than HVJ-anionic liposomes. Inactive ribozyme and tax antisense oligodeoxynucleotides reduced Tax expression by about 20%, whereas RR and tax sense oligodeoxynucleotides had no effect. These results suggest that the ribozymes' effect against tax mRNA was sequence-specific, and HVJ-cationic liposomes can be useful for intracellular introduction of ribozymes.","['Kitajima, I', 'Hanyu, N', 'Soejima, Y', 'Hirano, R', 'Arahira, S', 'Yamaoka, S', 'Yamada, R', 'Maruyama, I', 'Kaneda, Y']","['Kitajima I', 'Hanyu N', 'Soejima Y', 'Hirano R', 'Arahira S', 'Yamaoka S', 'Yamada R', 'Maruyama I', 'Kaneda Y']","['Department of Laboratory and Molecular Medicine, University of Kagoshima, 8-35-1 Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima 890, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Carriers', 'Gene Products, rex/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/biosynthesis/*metabolism', '*Genes, pX', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Liposomes', 'RNA, Catalytic/chemical synthesis/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Respirovirus', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.43.27099 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)68017-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Oct 24;272(43):27099-106. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.43.27099.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The introduction of mutations into human LIF that reduced the affinity for gp130 while retaining affinity for LIF-R has generated antagonists for LIF. In the current study, a LIF antagonist that was free of detectable agonistic activity was tested for antagonism against the family of LIF-R ligands. On cells that express LIF-R and gp130, all LIF-R ligands were antagonized. On cells that also express OSM receptor, OSM was not antagonized, demonstrating that the antagonist is specific for LIF-R.

I: Definitions, principle indications, complications].","480-91, 505","The transplantation of hematopoietic and lymphopoetic stem and progenitor cells has become a standard procedure for the treatment of many malignant diseases. Autologous stem cells are derived from the patient himself, allogeneic cells from an HLA-identical or HLA-compatible family or unrelated donor. Hematopoietic stem cells can be obtained from bone marrow, blood and fetal cord blood. After 3 to 5 days treatment, the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilizes stem- and progenitor cells from the marrow into the blood. This method is now standard in autologous transplantation and is increasingly preferred in allogeneic transplantation. The time to hematopoietic recovery is shorter with blood stem cells than with bone marrow cells. With myeloablative high dose therapy followed by stem cell transplantation, long term disease free survival is possible in many cases and great proportions of patients can be cured (see part II). Improvements of supportive care have reduced toxicity of treatment substantially, however severe complications still occur at oropharynx, gastrointestinal tract, liver, lung, skin, kidney, urinary tract and nervous system. After allogeneic transplantation immunocompetent donor cells can react with the recipients tissue. In HLA-identical donor and recipients differences in the minor histocompatibility antigens account for this graft-versus-host-reaction (GvH), which is mainly mediated by transplanted T-cells. The GvH-reaction can affect skin, liver, gut and other organs and cause clinically relevant GvH-disease (GvHD). The GvHD is more severe in HLA-mismatched or unrelated transplantations. Immunodeficiency and organ dysfunction due to GvHD may predispose infections and impair the outcome of transplantation. Unrelated cord blood stem cells may have a minor risk of inducing acute GvHD, as stem and T-cells are immature. After allogeneic stem cell transplantation, the relapse rate of leukemia or lymphoma is significantly reduced by immunoreactive cells:graft-versus-tumor (GvT) or graft-versus-leukemia effect (GvL).","['Link, H', 'Kolb, H J', 'Ebell, W', 'Hossfeld, D K', 'Zander, A', 'Niethammer, D', 'Wandt, H', 'Grosse-Wilde, H', 'Schaefer, U W']","['Link H', 'Kolb HJ', 'Ebell W', 'Hossfeld DK', 'Zander A', 'Niethammer D', 'Wandt H', 'Grosse-Wilde H', 'Schaefer UW']","['Abteilung Hamatologie und Onkologie, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover.']",['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Med Klin (Munich),"Medizinische Klinik (Munich, Germany : 1983)",8303501,,IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1997/08/15 00:00,2000/03/22 09:00,['1997/08/15 00:00'],"['1997/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '1997/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF03044917 [doi]'],ppublish,"Med Klin (Munich). 1997 Aug 15;92(8):480-91, 505. doi: 10.1007/BF03044917.",106,PMC7146030,,,,,,,"Die Transplantation hamatopoetischer Stammzellen.

(1983), many improvements have been introduced to the system to increase titer, or to achieve better expression of the transduced genes in cells of different lineage. The typical form of recombinant retrovirus vector utilizes its 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) as a promoter unit for the transcription of the inserted gene(s), which allows only the constitutive expression of the inserted gene(s) in target cells. Although constitutive expression of the delivered gene(s) in target cells may be sufficient for some purposes, controlled expression of gene(s) in target cells or tissues would be favorable in many basic and clinical applications. To circumvent these problems, we developed a new retroviral vector that allows controlled expression of the inserted genes. With these new retroviral vectors, the expression level of the inserted genes can be controlled up to 200-fold in the presence of a minimum amount of tetracycline. We think these new retroviral vectors will be useful in regulating the expression of the genes delivered in vivo.","['Kim, S J', 'Sadelain, M', 'Choi, K H', 'Kim, H K', 'Lee, J S', 'Chung, H Y']","['Kim SJ', 'Sadelain M', 'Choi KH', 'Kim HK', 'Lee JS', 'Chung HY']","['Laboratory of Tumor Immunology, Korea Cancer Center Hospital, Seoul.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,"['0 (Viral Structural Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'F8VB5M810T (Tetracycline)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Encephalomyocarditis virus/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors/chemical synthesis/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/physiology', 'Tetracycline/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Structural Proteins/genetics', 'Virion/physiology', 'Virus Replication']",1997/08/31 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/08/31 00:00'],"['1997/08/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/31 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cells. 1997 Aug 31;7(4):514-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated several factors affecting the gene transfer efficiency and the following immune response by intramuscular injection of plasmid DNA. When the strength of several highly efficient viral promoters was compared in muscle by using the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene as an indicator, cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early promoter was found to be stronger than any other viral promoters including Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), murine leukemia virus (SL3-3) and simian virus 40 (SV40) early promoters. Inclusion of adenovirus tripartite leader (TPL) sequences and a synthetic intron in the 5' untranslated region of mRNA moderately stimulated the CAT expression. On the other hand, the expression of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) VP1 gene was greatly enhanced by the TPL sequences and an intron. The level of humoral immune response by intramuscular injection of various VP1 expression plasmids was compared. The seroconversion rate was highly dependent on the strength of the expression vector. However, the ratio of IgG1 and IgG2a immune response was not significantly variable depending on the strength of the expression vector. Also, the efficiency of the sindbis virus-based DNA vector was examined for the gene expression and immune response. Although a high level of CAT expression was obtained in muscle by using this system, VP1 was not produced as much as the conventional expression vectors. Furthermore, little humoral immune response was elicited by intramuscular injection of VP1-expressing sindbis vector, suggesting that this system was not superior to the conventional vector for DNA immunization.","['Lee, A H', 'Suh, Y S', 'Sung, J H', 'Yang, S H', 'Sung, Y C']","['Lee AH', 'Suh YS', 'Sung JH', 'Yang SH', 'Sung YC']","['Department of Life Science, School of Environmental Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Capsid/genetics/immunology', 'Capsid Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Encephalomyocarditis virus/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Genetic Vectors/chemical synthesis/immunology', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Muscle, Skeletal/metabolism', 'Plasmids/administration & dosage/*chemical synthesis/*immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Transgenes/immunology', 'Vaccines, DNA/genetics/immunology']",1997/08/31 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/08/31 00:00'],"['1997/08/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/31 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cells. 1997 Aug 31;7(4):495-501.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the autografts are frequently contaminated with large numbers of tumor cells, we have studied double purging of PBPC using immunomagnetic CD34+ cell selection (Isolex 300i) followed by negative depletion with anti-CD19/20/23/37-labeled immunomagnetic beads. In four small-scale experiments using PBPC from patients with CLL or leukemic low-grade lymphoma, double purging resulted in CD34+ enrichment from 0.9-4.4% to 95.8-99.4%. Lymphoma cells were always undetectable by FACS and PCR (CDR3 or t(14;18)) after negative depletion. Next, seven heavily contaminated full grafts from five patients with CLL or lymphoplasmocytoid immunocytoma were subjected to the double purging procedure, resulting in a CD34+ enrichment from 1.6% (0.7-5.6) to 98.5% (96-99.8). The CD34+ yield after double purging was 1.3-6.3 x 10(6)/kg, according to a median recovery of 32%. The overall reduction of lymphoma cells was 5.6 (>4.6-6) log. Although CLL cells were completely absent after purging in five cases as assessed by FACS, all grafts remained PCR positive. The first two patients have been reinfused with double selected products after myeloablative radiochemotherapy and showed prompt and uneventful hematopoietic engraftment. We conclude that without significant loss of CD34+ cells, negative depletion adds 2 log of CLL cell depletion to CD34+ selection, resulting in an overall purging efficacy of more than 5 log. This combination of positive and negative selection can be successfully applied even to heavily contaminated PBPC grafts.","['Paulus, U', 'Schmitz, N', 'Viehmann, K', 'von Neuhoff, N', 'Dreger, P']","['Paulus U', 'Schmitz N', 'Viehmann K', 'von Neuhoff N', 'Dreger P']","['Second Department of Medicine, University of Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Technical Report']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/blood', '*Bone Marrow Purging', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunomagnetic Separation/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700914 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Sep;20(5):415-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700914.,,,,['Bone Marrow Transplant. 2000 Jul;26(1):114-6.

However there are no data regarding the use of different technologies for CD34+ cell selection in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). We therefore compared the performance of three laboratory grade CD34+ selection columns (MiniMACS, Cellpro Ceprate LC and Baxter Isolex 50), using CML chronic phase peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM). With different CML samples the CD34+ purity from the three columns was equivalent, but comparing five paired samples the Ceprate purity was greater than MiniMACS, at 92.5 and 80.9%, respectively, P = 0.04. Combining results from paired and unpaired CML samples, MiniMACS (n = 7) gave a higher CD34+ yield than Ceprate LC (n = 8) or Isolex 50 (n = 4) with a mean of 51.1%, 24.3% and 13.2% respectively, (P = 0.04 and 0.01). Cell losses with all columns were similar. Attempts to improve the yield from the Ceprate LC columns by modifying the method were unsuccessful. Following MiniMACS and Ceprate LC separation the clonogenic potentials of CD34+ cells in the pre- and positive cell fractions were the same. The proportion of CD34+ 38- or CD34+ DR- cells was unchanged following column separation. These data suggest that the MiniMACS column may be the best column for CD34+ cell selection in CML but these results must be confirmed using large scale clinical columns once the MiniMACS column is licensed. It is possible that variations in CD34+ cell yields between the different columns reflect differences in antibody binding affinity to CML cells, or differences in column technologies.","['Hawkins, T E', 'Marley, S B', ""O'Brien, S G"", 'Gordon, M Y', 'Goldman, J M']","['Hawkins TE', 'Marley SB', ""O'Brien SG"", 'Gordon MY', 'Goldman JM']","['LRF Leukaemia Unit, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Technical Report']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antigens, CD34/*blood', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/immunology/physiology', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Chromatography/classification/methods/standards', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'HLA-DR Antigens/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*blood/immunology']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700908 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Sep;20(5):409-13. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700908.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL) cells were treated with antigen and or the calmodulin antagonist, 0-50 microM trifluoperazine (TFP). The release of a secretory granule enzyme, beta-hexosaminidase, into the external medium was used as a measure of secretion. Quantitation of cell surface microvilli was determined by using a computer with input from a digitising tablet from scanning electron micrographs. Cytoskeletal proteins present in microvilli were analysed by confocal immunofluorescence. RESULTS: When RBL cells are stimulated to secrete with an antigen, the cell surface is transformed from a microvillous morphology to a ruffled one. The cell surface rearrangement preceded beta-hexosaminidase secretion: the majority of microvilli disappeared rapidly after stimulation (t1/2 of 39 s) whereas secretion can only be measured after a lag of 47 s. The calmodulin antagonist, TFP did not inhibit antigen-induced secretion or loss of microvilli, however TFP alone caused a similar loss of microvilli but was unable to stimulate or potentiate secretion. The microvilli mostly disappeared within 30 s, and a half-maximal effect occurred at approximately 8 microM TFP. Using immunofluorescence, calmodulin was localized to punctate structures on the dorsal cell surface which presumably correspond to the microvilli, and which also stained for F-actin and myosin I. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of cell surface microvilli on RBL cells precedes secretion and could reflect a cytoskeletal rearrangement which facilitates fusion of secretory granules with the membrane. It can be mimicked using trifluoperazine and we suggest it may involve calmodulin-binding components of the microvillus cytoskeleton such as myosin I.","['Edgar, A J', 'Davies, G R', 'Anwar, M A', 'Bennett, J P']","['Edgar AJ', 'Davies GR', 'Anwar MA', 'Bennett JP']","[""Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Imperial College School of Medicine at St. Mary's, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, London, UK. a.edgar@ic.ac.uk""]",['eng'],['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

Using molecular mapping techniques, we have previously defined the critical region of gene loss of the 5q- chromosome in the 5q- syndrome as the approximately 5-Mb region at 5q31-q33 flanked by the genes for FGF1 and IL12B. This region is completely represented by a series of overlapping YACs, and we are currently generating a transcription map with the aim of identifying the tumor-suppressor gene associated with the development of the 5q- syndrome. In this study two techniques have been used: first, the screening of full-length cDNA libraries with radiolabeled YACs and second, the mapping of chromosome 5-specific expressed sequence tags (ESTs) to a YAC contig. A 1-Mb YAC contig encompassing the CSF1R gene has been used to screen a fetal brain cDNA library, and this has resulted in the identification of two genes comprising one known gene previously localized to the region (ADRB2) and one known gene previously unlocalized. Six of 135 chromosome 5-specific ESTs were localized by PCR screening to the YAC contig mapping to the critical region of the 5q- syndrome. IMAGE cDNA clones for each of the six ESTs have been obtained. These seven (excluding ADRB2) newly assigned cDNA clones were subjected to further analysis. The expression patterns of each of the cDNA clones have been established in a range of human tissues, including bone marrow. Six of seven cDNAs are expressed in human bone marrow. Six of seven cDNAs have no known homology to any deposited human sequences, and one (C29) is dihydropyrimidinase-related protein-3, a member of a novel gene family.

None of the 6 normal controls expressed detectable levels of WT-1 transcripts (< 10(-4), background level), whereas 31 (93.9%) of 33 patients expressed variable levels of WT-1 transcripts (range, 10(-4) to 10(1)) at diagnosis. The level of WT-1 expression was not different between AML and ALL. By monitoring WT-1 gene expression in PB of 31 patients during CR, 5 patients relapsed (two from the 18 patients with undetectable levels of WT-1 gene expression and three from the 13 with WT-1 gene expression in low levels). Three of the 5 relapsed patients showed preceding reappearance or rise of WT-1 gene expression. From these results, we reconfirmed that the WT-1 gene is a pan-acute leukemic marker, which can be used to monitor minimal residual leukemia (MRL) after chemotherapy or in patients with CR.","['Kim, S C', 'Yoo, N C', 'Hahn, J S', 'Lee, S', 'Chong, S Y', 'Min, Y H', 'Ko, Y W']","['Kim SC', 'Yoo NC', 'Hahn JS', 'Lee S', 'Chong SY', 'Min YH', 'Ko YW']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Yonsei Med J,Yonsei medical journal,0414003,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Gene Expression/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Wilms Tumor/*genetics']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3349/ymj.1997.38.4.212 [doi]'],ppublish,Yonsei Med J. 1997 Aug;38(4):212-9. doi: 10.3349/ymj.1997.38.4.212.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical records of all men with Stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumors seen at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Australia between 1982 and 1995 were reviewed. Data were obtained concerning the histologic type of tumor, levels of serum tumor markers, relapse and subsequent treatment, and survival. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were entered into the active surveillance protocol between 1982 and 1995. With a minimum follow-up of 2 years, 27 (35%) have relapsed, with a median time to relapse of 5 months. Two late relapses occurred at 37 and 57 months after diagnosis. Relapses occurred most commonly in the retroperitoneal lymph nodes, with the lungs the second most common site. Following treatment with chemotherapy and surgery, all patients achieved complete remission, with 1 patient subsequently relapsing and ultimately dying of progressive tumor. One other patient died of acute myeloid leukemia, thought to be secondary to chemotherapy. Overall, 75 patients (97%) remain alive and free of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Active surveillance is a safe and effective approach to the management of Stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumors. Although most relapses occur within the first 2 years, late relapses may occur.","['Boyer, M J', 'Cox, K', 'Tattersall, M H', 'Findlay, M P', 'Grygiel, J', 'Rogers, J']","['Boyer MJ', 'Cox K', 'Tattersall MH', 'Findlay MP', 'Grygiel J', 'Rogers J']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Urology,Urology,0366151,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Germinoma/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*epidemiology', '*Orchiectomy', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*surgery', 'Time Factors']",1997/10/24 00:00,1997/10/24 00:01,['1997/10/24 00:00'],"['1997/10/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/24 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0090-4295(97)00301-4 [pii]', '10.1016/S0090-4295(97)00301-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Urology. 1997 Oct;50(4):588-92. doi: 10.1016/S0090-4295(97)00301-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A multicentre retrospective analysis of eosinophilia in 360 patients treated with 2-CdA for lymphoid malignancies has been made. B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) was diagnosed in 153, hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) in 68, low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (LGNHL) in 119, high-grade NHL in 2 and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia (WM) in 18 patients. 2-CdA was administered at a dose 0.12 mg/kg/d in 2-h intravenous infusion for 5 consecutive d. The courses were repeated monthly. Patients with HCL received 1 cycle of 2-CdA, with NHL 2-6 (mean 3.5) cycles and with B-CLL 3-6 (mean 5) cycles. Twenty patients (5.5%), including 5 with HCL, 6 with LGNHL, 7 with B-CLL and 2 with WM, developed peripheral blood eosinophilia. The mean values of absolute eosinophil count were 0.78x10(9)/l (0.58-1.06x10(9)/l), 0.71x10(9)/l (0.52-1.3x10(9)/l), 85 (0.56-1.82x10(9)/l) and 0.75 (0.74-0.76x10(9)/l), respectively. Eosinophilia occurred in 13 patients after 1 course, in 4 after 2 courses, and in 5 after > or =3 courses of the therapy. In 17 cases it resolved spontaneously. Allergic skin lesions with pruritus were noticed in 3 patients simultaneously with an increase in eosinophil count. All of them required antihistaminic drugs and/or corticosteroids. One patient with B-CLL experienced repeated episodes of eosinophilia. The highest incidence of 2-CdA-induced eosinophilia was noticed in patients with MW (11.1%) and HCL (7.4%) who received only 1 cycle of this drug and entered a complete remission. This side effect was less frequently observed in LGNHL and B-CLL, i.e. in 5.0% and 4.6% of cases, respectively. The mechanism of 2-CdA-induced eosinophilia is not clear. It has been postulated that massive tumour cell lysis may trigger a release of IL-5 and probably other cytokines. The allergic mechanism of 2-CdA-induced eosinophilia is also possible, especially in patients with simultaneous skin reactions.","['Robak, T', 'Blasinska-Morawiec, M', 'Krykowski, E', 'Hellmann, A', 'Lewandowski, K', 'Dmoszynska, A', 'Adamczyk-Cioch, M', 'Kazimierczak, M', 'Trepinska, E', 'Dwilewicz-Trojaczek, M', 'Kuratowska, Z', 'Skotnicki, A B', 'Nowak, W S', 'Zdziarska, B', 'Urasinski, I']","['Robak T', 'Blasinska-Morawiec M', 'Krykowski E', 'Hellmann A', 'Lewandowski K', 'Dmoszynska A', 'Adamczyk-Cioch M', 'Kazimierczak M', 'Trepinska E', 'Dwilewicz-Trojaczek M', 'Kuratowska Z', 'Skotnicki AB', 'Nowak WS', 'Zdziarska B', 'Urasinski I']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', ""JYW18Y92UP (2-chloro-3'-deoxyadenosine)""]",IM,"['2-Chloroadenosine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Deoxyadenosines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Eosinophilia/blood/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",1997/10/24 00:00,1997/10/24 00:01,['1997/10/24 00:00'],"['1997/10/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/24 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1997.tb00980.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1997 Oct;59(4):216-20. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1997.tb00980.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transcriptional activation of various genes occurs subsequent to LIF signal transduction in its target cells. Using the mRNA differential display method, a LIF-inducible gene was isolated from LIF-stimulated M1 murine myeloid leukemia cells. By DNA sequencing, this gene turned out to be gp49B1, which has been reported as an inhibitory signaling receptor to attenuate mast cell activation. Because gp49B1 expression was limited to the uterus of a pregnant mouse, its uterine expression was examined especially in relation to LIF expression during pregnancy. gp49B1 was expressed specifically on day 4.0 of pregnancy, as was LIF, and the site of the most abundant expression of LIF and gp49B1 mRNA was the luminal epithelium of the uterine endometrium. These findings suggest that the gp49B1 expression in the uterine endometrium is induced just before implantation by paracrine and/or autocrine effects of LIF. Considering its function as an inhibitory signaling receptor on mast cells, a possible role for gp49B1 on the surface of the uterine endometrium as an immunoreceptor that allows blastocyst attachment is proposed.","['Matsumoto, Y', 'Handa, S', 'Taki, T']","['Matsumoto Y', 'Handa S', 'Taki T']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Dev Growth Differ,"Development, growth & differentiation",0356504,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Gp49a protein, mouse)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lilrb4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'DNA Probes', 'Embryo Implantation/*physiology', 'Endometrium/cytology/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'In Situ Hybridization', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', '*Receptors, Immunologic', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/10/24 00:00,1997/10/24 00:01,['1997/10/24 00:00'],"['1997/10/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/24 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1440-169x.1997.t01-4-00006.x [doi]'],ppublish,Dev Growth Differ. 1997 Oct;39(5):591-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1440-169x.1997.t01-4-00006.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The immunophenotypic features and clonality of the lymphocytes in tumor and peripheral blood now are elucidating this enigmatic phenomenon. METHODS: The author presents what is believed to be the seventh case of peripheral T-cell lymphocytosis associated with thymoma and reviews the previous six cases. The pathology slides of the thymoma were reviewed with a pathologist who confirmed the presence of neoplastic thymic epithelium with cytokeratin stains. Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry was performed at Dianon Systems, Inc., on both the thymoma cells and cells in the peripheral blood. In addition, gene rearrangement analysis was performed on the peripheral lymphocytes using the previously described Southern blot analysis technique with immunoglobulin probes (heavy chain, kappa light chain, and lambda light chain) and T-cell receptor gene probes (beta and gamma chains). RESULTS: Analyses of the T cells within the thymoma and the peripheral blood confirm that the peripheral T cells are both polyclonal and more mature than those populating the thymoma. Clearly the peripheral T cells are not themselves neoplastic, and yet they represent more than physical ""spillover"" of the immature tumor-related T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral T-cell lymphocytosis occurs rarely with locally aggressive, lymphocytic thymomas. Although it is clear that these cells are not neoplastic, as they are in other T-cell proliferative disorders, the etiology of this unusual phenomenon remains obscure and may reflect the perturbation of systemic immunoregulation that accompanies thymic neoplasia. It is important to differentiate this condition from T-cell lymphomas or leukemia to treat affected patients appropriately.","['Barton, A D']",['Barton AD'],"['Department of Medicine, The Stamford Hospital, Connecticut, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocytosis/blood/*etiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Thymoma/blood/*complications/*pathology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/blood/*complications/*pathology']",1997/10/24 21:28,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/10/24 21:28'],"['1997/10/24 21:28 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/10/24 21:28 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19971015)80:8<1409::AID-CNCR7>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19971015)80:8<1409::aid-cncr7>3.0.co;2-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1997 Oct 15;80(8):1409-17. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19971015)80:8<1409::aid-cncr7>3.0.co;2-9.,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The growth of LIT cells HeLa and THP-1, when transferred from transferrin (5 micrograms/ml) medium into low-iron (5 microM ferric citrate) medium, was not significantly affected while HID cells Jiyoye and K562 showed nearly no growth. HeLa and THP-1 cells, as well as Jiyoye and K562 cells, do not produce transferrin in sufficient amounts to support their growth in low-iron medium. Surprisingly, similar rates of iron uptake in low-iron medium (0.033 and 0.032 nmol Fe/min and 10(6) cells) were found for LIT cells HeLa and HID cells K562. Furthermore, the intracellular iron level (4.64 nmol/10(6) cells) of HeLa cells grown in low-iron medium was much higher than iron levels (0.15 or 0.20 nmol/10(6) cells) of HeLa or K562 cells grown in transferrin medium. We demonstrated that the activity (ratio activated/total) of the iron regulatory protein (IRP) in HID cells Jiyoye and K562 increased more than twofold (from 0.32 to 0.79 and from 0.47 to 1.12, respectively) within 48 h after their transfer into low-iron medium. In the case of LIT cells HeLa and THP-1, IRP activity stayed at similar or slightly decreased levels (0.86-0.73 and 0.58-0.55, respectively). Addition of iron chelator deferoxamine (50 microM, i.e., about half-maximal growth-inhibitory dose) resulted in significantly increased activity of IRP also in HeLa and THP-1 cells. We hypothesize that the relatively higher bioavailability of nontransferrin iron in LIT cells, over that in HID cells, determines the differing responses observed under low-iron conditions.","['Kovar, J', 'Kuhn, L C', 'Richardson, V', 'Seiser, C', 'Kriegerbeckova, K', 'Musilkova, J']","['Kovar J', 'Kuhn LC', 'Richardson V', 'Seiser C', 'Kriegerbeckova K', 'Musilkova J']","['Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

The ability of ara-C to kill neoplastic cells is regulated at three distinct but interrelated levels. First, the activity of ara-C depends on conversion to its lethal triphosphate derivative, ara-CTP, a process that is influenced by multiple factors, including nucleoside transport, phosphorylation, deamination, and levels of competing metabolites, particularly dCTP. Second, the antiproliferative and lethal effects of ara-C are linked to the ability of ara-CTP to interfere with one or more DNA polymerases as well as the degree to which it is incorporated into elongating DNA strands, leading to DNA fragmentation and chain termination. Finally, the fate of the cell is ultimately determined by whether a threshold level of ara-C-mediated DNA damage is exceeded, thereby inducing apoptosis, or programmed cell death. The latter process is influenced by components of various signal transduction pathways (e.g., PKC) and expression of oncogenes (e.g., bcl-2, c-Jun), perturbations in which may significantly alter ara-C sensitivity. A better understanding of these factors could eventually lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies capable of overcoming ara-C resistance and improving therapeutic efficacy.","['Grant, S']",['Grant S'],"['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond 23298, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Adv Cancer Res,Advances in cancer research,0370416,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Membrane Lipids/metabolism', 'Oncogenes', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",1997/10/24 00:00,1997/10/24 00:01,['1997/10/24 00:00'],"['1997/10/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/24 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0065-230X(08)60703-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0065-230x(08)60703-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Adv Cancer Res. 1998;72:197-233. doi: 10.1016/s0065-230x(08)60703-4.,277,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Together, the Children's Cancer Group and Pediatric Oncology Group serve as a national registry of nearly all childhood cancers in the United States, provide a national network of communication for researchers, care providers and families of paediatric patients with malignant disease and conduct laboratory investigations and clinical trials of new treatments of cancers in infants, children, adolescents and young adults. Nearly 95% of patients with cancer in the United States who are below 15 years of age are registered by the Children's Cancer Group and the Pediatric Oncology Group and more than half of American children with cancer are entered into at least one trial by a paediatric group. Improved survival of children receiving treatment according to well-defined protocols in specialised children's centres, in contrast to children who received treatment outside of these centres, has been shown for those with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, lymphoma, Wilms' tumour, medulloblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma. By the year 2000, the overall cure rate for United States children and adolescents with cancer should exceed 85%. To reach this goal, the way forward will depend on international collaboration, implementation of global harmonisation, prevention of the erosion of biomedical research and clinical trials by the managed health care industry, increased public and private financial support and continued recruitment into paediatric oncology of brilliant and dedicated young investigators. The specific challenges ahead include: (1) transferring the knowledge, methodologies and technologies to countries that are less fortunate; (2) conducting multinational clinical trials in conjunction with paediatric cooperative groups in other countries; (3) accessing older adolescent patients who currently do not participate in cooperative group trials; (4) merging clinical trials by adult collaborative groups that overlap with the paediatric groups, as in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute myelogenous leukaemia, Hodgkin's disease, osteosarcoma and germ cell tumours; (5) establishing a stable source of funding for national and international cooperative paediatric cancer clinical trials; (6) creating an informatics system that can link paediatric cooperative group operation centres around the world, and the institutions within each collaborative group; and (7) securing the support of the insurance industry and government in covering clinical trials.","['Bleyer, W A']",['Bleyer WA'],"['University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Division of Pediatrics, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*trends', 'Cooperative Behavior', 'Humans', '*International Cooperation', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'United States/epidemiology']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/10/24 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/24 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0959804997002499 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(97)00249-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1997 Aug;33(9):1439-47. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(97)00249-9.,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Psoralen plus UVA (PUVA) is one of the treatments proposed for this disease. We had reported previously that exposure of regular blood cultures from healthy donors to PUVA leads to chromosomal breakage via the formation of transferable clastogenic materials, a phenomenon inhibitable by superoxide dismutase. In the present paper we show that these clastogenic factors (CF) are also formed in vivo. The CF were found in about 50% of the psoriasis patients studied (14 out of 31). In PUVA-treated psoriasis patients, the clastogenic activity of the plasma increased significantly between the first and the last (16th) exposure to PUVA. We hypothesize that CF formation in psoriasis is similar to that in other diseases accompanied by oxidative stress, in particular chronic inflammatory diseases with autoimmune reactions such as lupus erythematosus, progressive systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and others. Increased superoxide production by phagocytes, formation of lipid peroxidation products and release of cytokines are considered to be responsible for the superoxide-stimulating and chromosome-damaging properties of patients' plasma. During PUVA therapy, superoxide generated via the interaction of psoralen with UVA may contribute to CF formation in addition to superoxide from inflammatory cells. An increased risk of cancer and leukemia is observed in diseases accompanied by CF formation. Therefore CF may contribute to the well-known risk of photocarcinogenesis by PUVA therapy. This additional risk may be preventable by antioxidants and superoxide scavengers.","['Filipe, P', 'Emerit, I', 'Alaoui Youssefi, A', 'Levy, A', 'Cernjavski, L', 'Freitas, J', 'de Castro, J L']","['Filipe P', 'Emerit I', 'Alaoui Youssefi A', 'Levy A', 'Cernjavski L', 'Freitas J', 'de Castro JL']","['Department of Dermatology, Hospital de Santa Maria, University of Lisboa, Portugal.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Mutagens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Free Radicals/blood', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutagens/*metabolism', 'PUVA Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Psoriasis/*blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin Neoplasms/etiology/prevention & control']",1997/10/24 00:00,1997/10/24 00:01,['1997/10/24 00:00'],"['1997/10/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/24 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1751-1097.1997.tb03179.x [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1997 Oct;66(4):497-501. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-1097.1997.tb03179.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The vitamin D derivatives acted to increase the differentiation of U937 and HL-60 cell cultures in a dose-dependent manner, as determined by nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction, with EB1089 and KH1060 being more effective than the native hormone. As an additional index of leukaemic cell differentiation, induction of expression of the phenotypic cell surface antigen, CD14, and the beta2-integrins, CD11b and CD18 by the vitamin D and retinoid compounds were monitored using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses. Following 96-hr treatment of U937 and HL-60 cells with 5 x 10(-10) M of the vitamin D derivatives, a striking increase in CD14 antigen expression was apparent, indicating the promotion by these compounds of a monocyte/macrophage lineage of cells. CD11b and CD18 antigen expression were also raised above control levels. In contrast, both retinoid compounds used at the higher concentration of 1 x 10(-8) M were not effective inducers of CD14 antigen expression. However, CD11b and CD18 were both readily increased in U937 and HL-60 cell cultures. Treatment of U937 cell cultures with the vitamin D compounds and the retinoids resulted in cooperative effects on induction of differentiation, with correlation by both NBT reduction and FACS analyses of CD14 antigen expression. The presence of 9-cis RA or ATRA appeared to contribute to the further increase of CD14 in these cells. HL-60 cell cotreatment with these compounds also displayed enhanced cooperative effects in phagocytic function by NBT reduction. However, analysis of CD14 revealed a dramatic diminution in HL-60 cells treated with the combinations of the vitamin D derivatives and the retinoids. Assessment of HL-60 cell morphology treated with these combinations demonstrated the presence of a mixed population of monocytes and granulocytes. CD11b and CD18 antigen expression was also enhanced in both cell lines with cotreatment. The ability of EB1089 and KH1060 to induce leukaemic cell differentiation may provide an additional option for therapeutic use alone or together with other differentiation agents such as 9-cis RA or ATRA.","['James, S Y', 'Williams, M A', 'Kelsey, S M', 'Newland, A C', 'Colston, K W']","['James SY', 'Williams MA', 'Kelsey SM', 'Newland AC', 'Colston KW']","[""Division of Gastroenterology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, St. George's Hospital Medical School, London, UK.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '131875-08-6 (KH 1060)', '1UA8E65KDZ (Alitretinoin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'Q0OZ0D9223 (seocalcitol)']",IM,"['Alitretinoin', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(97)00195-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00195-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1997 Sep 1;54(5):625-34. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00195-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pretreatment of HL-60 cells for 24 hr with 10 nM bryostatin 1 significantly potentiated the ability of ara-C (10 microM; 6 hr) to induce apoptosis without reducing the expression of c-Myc protein. In contrast, equivalent exposure to the stage 2 tumor-promoting PKC activator mezerein (10 nM) in conjunction with ara-C reduced c-Myc levels by 87% and failed to potentiate apoptosis. Co-administration of bryostatin 1 with mezerein before ara-C prevented down-regulation of c-Myc and augmented cell death, whereas co-treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187 (250 nM) and bryostatin 1 reduced c-Myc levels by 80% and abrogated the increase in ara-C-induced apoptosis. When cells were exposed for 24 hr to a c-myc antisense oligonucleotide (AS-ODN;10 microM) but not to a scrambled sequence ODN (SS-ODN) prior to ara-C, c-Myc expression was reduced by 81%, and apoptosis and cell viability were unperturbed. However, AS-ODN (but not SS-ODN) reduced c-Myc protein in cells pre-exposed to bryostatin 1 by 74% and abrogated potentiation of ara-C-induced apoptosis. The actions of c-myc AS-ODN did not stem from proximal G1 arrest/differentiation or biochemical events, since they were not associated with a reduction in the S-phase cell fraction, p21(WAF1/CIP1) induction, pRb hypophosphorylation, or alterations in ara-C metabolism. Together, these findings indicate that HL-60 cell apoptosis proceeds by both c-Myc-dependent and -independent pathways, and that only the former are involved in the potentiation of ara-C-mediated cell death by bryostatin 1.","['Chelliah, J', 'Freemerman, A J', 'Wu-Pong, S', 'Jarvis, W D', 'Grant, S']","['Chelliah J', 'Freemerman AJ', 'Wu-Pong S', 'Jarvis WD', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298, U.S.A.']",['eng'],['CA 63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Terpenes)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '34807-41-5 (mezerein)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', '*Diterpenes', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Macrolides', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Terpenes/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thionucleotides']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(97)00212-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00212-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1997 Sep 1;54(5):563-73. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00212-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In their guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP)-bound form, G-protein alpha-subunits activate effector systems. Termination of G-protein activation is achieved by the high-affinity GTPase [E.C. 3.6.1.-] of their alpha-subunits. Like GTP, inosine 5'-triphosphate (ITP) and xanthosine 5'-triphosphate (XTP) can support effector system activation. We studied the interactions of GTP, ITP, and XTP with the retinal G-protein, transducin (TD), and with G-proteins in HL-60 leukemia cell membranes. TD hydrolyzed nucleoside 5'-triphosphates (NTPs) in the order of efficacy GTP > ITP > XTP. NTPs eluted TD from rod outer segment disk membranes in the same order of efficacy. ITP and XTP competitively inhibited TD-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis. In HL-60 membranes, the chemoattractants N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) effectively activated GTP and ITP hydrolysis by Gi-proteins. fMLP and LTB4 were at least 10-fold more potent activators of ITPase than of GTPase. Complement C5a effectively activated the GTPase of Gi-proteins but was only a weak stimulator of ITPase. The potency of C5a to activate GTP and ITP hydrolysis was similar. The fMLP-stimulated GTPase had a lower Km value than the fMLP-stimulated ITPase, whereas the opposite was true for the Vmax values. fMLP, C5a, and LTB4 did not stimulate XTP hydrolysis. Collectively, our data show that GTP, ITP, and XTP bind to G-proteins with different affinities, that G-proteins hydrolyze NTPs with different efficacies, and that chemoattractants stimulate GTP and ITP hydrolysis by Gi-proteins in a receptor-specific manner. On the basis of our results and the data in the literature, we put forward the hypothesis that GTP, ITP, and XTP act as differential signal amplifiers and signal sorters at the G-protein level.","['Klinker, J F', 'Seifert, R']","['Klinker JF', 'Seifert R']","['Institut fur Neuropsychopharmakologie, Freie Universitat Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '132-06-9 (Inosine Triphosphate)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', ""6253-56-1 (xanthosine 5'-triphosphate)"", '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (Transducin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Complement C5a/pharmacology', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/*metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Inosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukotriene B4/pharmacology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Ribonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Rod Cell Outer Segment/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transducin/*metabolism']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(97)00205-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00205-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1997 Sep 1;54(5):551-62. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00205-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Significant reductions in both the resting and stimulated parotid and submandibular salivary flow rates were observed during IL-2/IFN-alpha immunotherapy compared with the pre- and post-therapy values (P < 0.01), while no hyposalivation was observed in the control patients who underwent ABSCT and did not received IL-2. Sialochemical evaluation revealed a significant increase in potassium concentration (24.4+/-0.6 mEq/l to 28.9+/-1.4 mEq/l) and a significant decrease in sodium concentration (6.7+/-2.1 mEq/l to 3.3+/-1.0 mEq/l) (P < 0.05) in the stimulated parotid gland saliva secreted during IL-2/IFN-alpha administration. Salivary protein concentrations were not altered by the IL-2/IFN-alpha immunotherapy. Similar changes were previously observed in mice and humans with chronic GVHD. We conclude that IL-2 immunotherapy induces major salivary gland dysfunction in humans, similar to our previous observations in patients with chronic GVHD, which may indicate similar pathophysiologic mechanisms.","['Nagler, A', 'Nagler, R', 'Ackerstein, A', 'Levi, S', 'Marmary, Y']","['Nagler A', 'Nagler R', 'Ackerstein A', 'Levi S', 'Marmary Y']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/*physiopathology/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-2/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Salivary Glands/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700928 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Oct;20(7):575-80. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700928.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A retrospective analysis was carried out of the outcome of 373 consecutive transplants performed at 38 European institutions between 1980 and 1988 and reported to the registry of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. All transplants were carried out for first chronic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia using unmanipulated marow cells from HLA-identical sibling donors. The probability of survival and leukemia-free survival at 8 years were 54% (95% CI: 49-59) and 47% (95% CI: 41-52) respectively. The probabilities of developing acute GVHD (II-IV) at 100 days and chronic GVHD at 4 years after transplant were 47% (95% CI: 41-53) and 52% (95% CI: 46-58) respectively. The probabilities of transplant-related mortality and leukemic relapse 8 years after BMT were 41% (95% CI: 36-48) and 19% (95% CI: 14-25), respectively. Transplant within 12 months of diagnosis was associated with reduced transplant-related mortality (34 vs 45%, P = 0.013) and resulted in improved leukemia-free survival (52 vs 44%, P = 0.03). The probability of relapse was significantly reduced in patients who developed chronic GVHD (RR = 0.33, P = 0.004). The probability of relapse occurring more than 2 years after transplant was increased more than five-fold in patients transplanted from a male donor (RR = 5.5, P = 0.006). Sixty-seven patients in hematologic remission were studied for residual disease by two-step RT/PCR for BCR-ABL mRNA and 61 (91%) tested negative. We conclude that bone marrow transplantation can induce long-term survival in approximately one-half of CML patients; the majority of survivors have no evidence of residual leukemia cells when studied by molecular techniques. The probability of late relapse is increased with use of a male donor.","['van Rhee, F', 'Szydlo, R M', 'Hermans, J', 'Devergie, A', 'Frassoni, F', 'Arcese, W', 'de Witte, T', 'Kolb, H J', 'Niederwiser, D', 'Jacobsen, N', 'Gahrton, G', 'Bandini, G', 'Carreras, E', 'Bacigalupo, A', 'Michallet, M', 'Ruutu, T', 'Reiffers, J', 'Goldman, J M', 'Apperley, J', 'Gratwohl, A']","['van Rhee F', 'Szydlo RM', 'Hermans J', 'Devergie A', 'Frassoni F', 'Arcese W', 'de Witte T', 'Kolb HJ', 'Niederwiser D', 'Jacobsen N', 'Gahrton G', 'Bandini G', 'Carreras E', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Michallet M', 'Ruutu T', 'Reiffers J', 'Goldman JM', 'Apperley J', 'Gratwohl A']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700933 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Oct;20(7):553-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700933.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Severe graft-versus-host disease and prolonged periods of pancytopenia compromise the success of this treatment in a substantial number of patients. We used filgrastim-mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs), in some cases preceded by cytoreductive therapy, to circumvent some of the problems associated with DLI. Eleven patients (median age 41 years) received a total of 20 donor cell infusions. Their diagnosis was CML in hematological (two patients) or cytogenetic relapse (two patients), six patients suffered from acute myeloid leukemia (AM; n = 5) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL Ph+). One patient had multiple myeloma (MM). All six patients with acute leukemias received cytoreductive therapy prior to PBPC infusions; three patients with CML were pretreated with IFN alpha. Four of four patients with CML responded to PBPC infusions and currently are in complete clinical and molecular remission for time periods between 1 and 12 months. Six of six patients with acute leukemias achieved a complete remission. All of them relapsed after a median remission duration of 24 weeks (range 11-49 weeks). Three patients relapsed at extramedullary sites (CNS, testes, skin). Four of six acute leukemia patients received further cytoreductive therapy. All patients responded again and are in complete remission for time periods between 14 and 615 days. Two patients with acute leukemias have died due to dissemination of the disease. The patient with MM did not respond and is alive with disease. Severe (grade III) acute GVHD developed in two of 11 patients, three patients developed grade II disease, six patients did not show any signs of GVHD. Extensive chronic GVHD has developed in two cases to date. Patients with chemotherapy prior to PBPC infusion developed neutropenia and thrombocytopenia with a maximum duration of 20 and 14 days, respectively; prolonged periods of neutropenia did not occur. Two patients developed long-lasting thrombocytopenia in spite of PBPC infusion, in one case followed by leukemic relapse. Repeated courses of chemotherapy and PBPC infusion were generally tolerated well; no early deaths due to treatment-related toxicity or GVHD were observed. We conclude that the use of allogeneic PBPC instead of DLI in patients with relapse after BMT is technically feasible and safe. The efficacy of PBPC infusions seems comparable to DLI in patients with CML. Patients with acute leukemias also achieved complete albeit transient remissions. Aggressive chemotherapy followed by PBPC infusions resulted in only limited duration of cytopenia. The usage of PBPC infusion instead of non G-CSF-mobilized donor cells for treatment of relapse after BMT may reduce pancytopenia-related complications and merits further investigation.","['Glass, B', 'Majolino, I', 'Dreger, P', 'Scime, R', 'Santoro, A', 'Vasta, S', 'Suttorp, M', 'Haferlach, T', 'Schmitz, N']","['Glass B', 'Majolino I', 'Dreger P', 'Scime R', 'Santoro A', 'Vasta S', 'Suttorp M', 'Haferlach T', 'Schmitz N']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, University of Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700934 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Oct;20(7):533-41. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700934.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A pilot study of leuprolide acetate.,537-41,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, in a pilot study, the use and efficacy of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-agonist in inducing amenorrhea in women undergoing BMT. STUDY DESIGN: We evaluated the use of the GnRH agonist leuprolide acetate (LA) for the induction of amenorrhea in 10 postmenarcheal women prior to BMT. If there was a contraindication to the use of the intramuscular (i.m.) formulation of LA, the subcutaneous (s.c.) formulation was given as a daily intravenous (i.v.) bolus. Once the subject's platelet count was > 50,000/microL, the LA was discontinued. Menstrual bleeding, time from initiation of therapy to amenorrhea, and liver function test results were monitored. RESULTS: All subjects had induction of amenorrhea with the use of LA except for one subject with a large, myomatous uterus, who experienced light spotting. One subject who was thrombocytopenic at the prescribed time of the second dosage of i.m. LA received i.v. LA with documentation of continued pituitary/gonadal suppression. No adverse effects were determined to be directly related to either the i.m. or i.v. LA. CONCLUSION: LA is an option for the induction of amenorrhea in postmenarcheal women undergoing BMT. In thrombocytopenic subjects, administration of the s.c. formulation of LA by an i.v. route served as an alternative to i.m. injection and was documented to maintain gonadotropin suppression.","['Laufer, M R', 'Townsend, N L', 'Parsons, K E', 'Brody, K A', 'Diller, L R', 'Emans, S J', 'Guinan, E C']","['Laufer MR', 'Townsend NL', 'Parsons KE', 'Brody KA', 'Diller LR', 'Emans SJ', 'Guinan EC']","[""Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Biology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Reprod Med,The Journal of reproductive medicine,0173343,['EFY6W0M8TG (Leuprolide)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amenorrhea/*chemically induced', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Contraindications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Leuprolide/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Platelet Count', 'Uterine Hemorrhage/prevention & control']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Reprod Med. 1997 Sep;42(9):537-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-eight patients previously treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with two prior cytotoxic regimens for low-grade and one prior regimen for intermediate-grade lymphoma were entered onto this phase II trial. Central pathologic review was required. Twenty-four IWF A to C and 31 IWF D to H patients with normal hepatic and renal function, performance status (PS) 0 to 2, and adequate hematologic function were eligible. Patients received docetaxel 100 mg/m2 intravenously over 1 hour without corticosteroid premedications every 3 weeks with weekly hematologic monitoring, and tumor assessment every 3 weeks. For grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity, the docetaxel dosage was lowered to 75 mg/m2. Patients received a maximum of six cycles of therapy. RESULTS: The major response rate was 13% (95% confidence limits, 3% to 32%) for IWF A to C and 16% (95% confidence limits, 5% to 34%) for IWF D to H; response durations ranged from 1.4 to 20 months. Time to response ranged from 1.3 to 2.8 months. Patients refractory to previous chemotherapy were less apt to respond to docetaxel, but the differences were not statistically different in this small sample size. Twelve percent of IWF A to C and 6% of IWF D to H patients discontinued treatment because of toxicity. The major toxicity was granulocytopenia (grade 3 to 4), which occurred in virtually all patients during the first course of therapy. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that docetaxel has limited but definite activity in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and suggests that the previously reported responses with taxanes can not be attributed solely to the use of corticosteroid premedications.","['Budman, D R', 'Petroni, G R', 'Johnson, J L', 'Cooper, M R', 'Schlossman, D M', 'Barcos, M', 'Peterson, B A']","['Budman DR', 'Petroni GR', 'Johnson JL', 'Cooper MR', 'Schlossman DM', 'Barcos M', 'Peterson BA']","['Cancer and Leukemia Group B, Chicago, IL, USA. budman@nshs.edu']",['eng'],"['CA 31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 59518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Taxoids)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Docetaxel', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paclitaxel/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate', '*Taxoids']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.10.3275 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 Oct;15(10):3275-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.10.3275.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the role of substance P (SP), a neurotransmitter peptide of the tachykinin family, in inducing astrocyte secretory activities, we have examined the expression of SP receptors and the functional consequences of their activation in cultured astrocytes from the human embryonic brain or spinal cord. Radioligand binding studies revealed that only one type of SP receptors, the high affinity NK-1 receptor, was present on human astrocytes and that spinal cord astrocytes expressed about 6 times as many SP binding sites as brain astrocytes. Following SP treatment, a substantial inositol phosphate formation was observed in spinal cord astrocytes only. Stimulation of spinal cord astrocytes with SP alone did not induce secretion of cytokines [interleukin-6 (IL-6), granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 or leukemia inhibitory factor] or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Interestingly, however, SP selectively potentiated the inducing effect of IL-1beta on IL-6 and PGE2 secretion by spinal cord astrocytes without affecting the IL-1-beta-evoked secretion of other cytokines. SP also enhanced the small inducing effect of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on IL-6 and PGE2 secretion and that of transforming growth factor-beta on PGE2 secretion. These results suggest that SP can enhance immunoregulatory and neurotrophic astroglial functions mediated by IL-6 and PGE2 by acting in concert with a set of cytokines whose cerebral expression has been reported during development and in a variety of diseases.","['Palma, C', 'Minghetti, L', 'Astolfi, M', 'Ambrosini, E', 'Silberstein, F C', 'Manzini, S', 'Levi, G', 'Aloisi, F']","['Palma C', 'Minghetti L', 'Astolfi M', 'Ambrosini E', 'Silberstein FC', 'Manzini S', 'Levi G', 'Aloisi F']","['Department of Pharmacology, Menarini Ricerche, Pomezia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Glia,Glia,8806785,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Neurokinin-1)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '33507-63-0 (Substance P)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Astrocytes/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Neurokinin-1/*metabolism', 'Spinal Cord/cytology/*metabolism', 'Substance P/*pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1098-1136(199710)21:2<183::AID-GLIA2>3.0.CO;2-8 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1098-1136(199710)21:2<183::aid-glia2>3.0.co;2-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Glia. 1997 Oct;21(2):183-93. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1098-1136(199710)21:2<183::aid-glia2>3.0.co;2-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed an electroporation device that requires only 1 microl of sample to load adherent cells in a 10-mm2 surface area while retaining greater than 90% cell survivability. To better understand this device, field-induced permeabilization of adherent rat basophilic leukemia and neocortical neuroblastoma cells was investigated by using fluorescent calcium and voltage indicators. Rectangular field pulses led to the formation of only a few calcium entry sites, preferentially in the hyperpolarized parts of the cell body and processes. Individual entry sites were formed at the same locations when field pulses were repeated. Before calcium entry, a partial breakdown of the membrane potential was observed in both polar regions. Based on our results, a model is proposed for the formation and closure of macromolecule entry sites in adherent cells. First, the rapid formation of a large number of small pores leads to a partial membrane potential breakdown in both polar regions of the cell. Second, over tens of milliseconds, a few entry sites for macromolecules are formed, preferentially in the hyperpolarized part of cell body and processes, at locations defined by the local membrane structure. These entry sites reseal on a time scale of 50 ms to several seconds, with residual small pores remaining open for several minutes.","['Teruel, M N', 'Meyer, T']","['Teruel MN', 'Meyer T']","['Department of Cell Biology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['GM-48113/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-51457/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Biophysical Phenomena', 'Biophysics', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/*physiology', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cell Polarity', 'Electroporation/instrumentation/*methods', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Homeostasis', 'Ion Transport', 'Kinetics', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Models, Biological', 'Rats', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-3495(97)78209-2 [pii]', '10.1016/S0006-3495(97)78209-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 1997 Oct;73(4):1785-96. doi: 10.1016/S0006-3495(97)78209-2.,,PMC1181079,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the optimal therapeutic scheme that achieves the highest disease-free survival with the minimum long-term toxicity is yet to be determined. An analysis of the patterns of failure and late complications after radiation therapy was conducted to address this question. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective study was conducted of 145 patients with Stage I Hodgkin's disease treated at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from 1967 through 1987. Follow-up extended from a minimum of 30 to 339 months, with a median period of observation of 16.5 years. All the patients were treated with radiation therapy and, and 16 received combination MOPP-based chemotherapy as part of their initial treatment. The radiotherapy technique, was involved/regional in 71 (49%), extended in 62 (43%), and subtotal nodal irradiation in 12 patients. The median total dose was 40 Gy. RESULTS: The actuarial freedom from progression at 10 and 20 years was 76% and 69%, respectively. Forty of 145 patients relapsed (27.6%). The site of primary disease was cervical adenopathy in 30 (75%), axillary in 7 (17.5%), mediastinal in 2 patients and subdiaphragmatic in one patient. Twenty-two patients were treated with involved/regional technique (55%), 17 with extended (42.5%), and 1 with subtotal nodal irradiation technique. There were three in field and four marginal recurrences. Six relapses occurred in non-irradiated nodal regions at the same side of the diaphragm and 17 in non-irradiated transdiaphragmatic lymph nodes (57.5%). Nine patients (22.5%) relapsed with visceral disease. Nineteen patients (47.5%) relapsed within the first 2 years, 15 (37.5%) 3 to 10 years after diagnosis and the remaining 6 (15%) after 10 years. Eleven of 40 patients died of disease after the first or subsequent relapses (27.5%). Three of six patients with late relapses had progression in viscera but only two died with disease. Thirty-eight of 145 patients developed late toxicity from the treatment (26.2%). Twenty-three patients experienced ischemic heart disease (15.9%), only 13 of whom received mediastinal irradiation (9%). Fifteen patients developed secondary malignant solid tumors (10.3%). Nine of those (6.2%) occurred within the irradiation field (two were also treated with chemotherapy). Two additional patients, one of whom received chemotherapy as part of the initial treatment, died of acute myelogenous leukemia. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and lung cancer were the most common second malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: Limited field radiotherapy results in a significant number of relapses in non-irradiated, especially transdiaphragmatic lymph nodes. Subtotal nodal irradiation can prevent some relapses and therefore improve freedom from progression. Careful design of the treatment fields may decrease the risk of morbidity and mortality from coronary artery disease and second malignancies in early-stage Hodgkin's disease. Careful long-term surveillance may permit early detection and management of late relapses and treatment complications.","['Vlachaki, M T', 'Ha, C S', 'Hagemeister, F B', 'Fuller, L M', 'Rodriguez, M A', 'Besa, P C', 'Hess, M A', 'Brown, B', 'Cabanillas, F', 'Cox, J D']","['Vlachaki MT', 'Ha CS', 'Hagemeister FB', 'Fuller LM', 'Rodriguez MA', 'Besa PC', 'Hess MA', 'Brown B', 'Cabanillas F', 'Cox JD']","['Division of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging/methods', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Radiation Injuries/*etiology', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0360-3016(97)00371-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(97)00371-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1997 Oct 1;39(3):609-16. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(97)00371-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PURPOSE: The ice crystal formation during the freezing procedure is the key point that can be harmful to the cells. The cryopreservation of hematopoietic stem cells in a controlled-rate freezer could decrease the cell damage. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with a median age of 26 years (range 03-57) had bone marrow and/or peripheral blood stem cells harvested from March 1993 through October 1994, ending up to 86 freezing procedures. The patient's diagnoses are as follows: Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (n = 5); Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (n = 8); Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (n = 6); Hodgkin's disease (n = 3); Multiple Myeloma (n = 1). The cells were frozen away in a controlled-rate freezer chamber at the following rate: -1 degree C/min from room temperature to -45 degrees C and then, at -10 degrees C/min down to -80 degrees C. After freezing, the cells were kept into mechanical freezers until the marrow infusion. To mobilize PBSC (peripheral blood stem cells), G-CSF (granulocyte colony stimulating factor) was given. RESULTS: A median of 3.16 x 10(8) cells/kg (range 0.86-24.22) of PBSC and 2.03 x 10(8) cells/kg (0.19-12.21) of bone marrow cells were frozen. The median time to reach granulocytes greater than 500/microL and platelets greater than 20,000/microL was 12 days (range 8-40) and 31 days (range 8-80), respectively. All patients had marrow engraftment after infusion of hematopoietic stem cells. CONCLUSION: The cryopreservation procedure using a controlled-rate freezer can store hematopoietic stem cells and potentially, cause less damage to the cells.","['Massumoto, C M', 'Mizukami, S', 'Campos, M F', 'Silva, L A', 'Mendrone Junior, A', 'Sakashita, A', 'Zambon, E', 'Ostronoff, M', 'Macedo, M C', 'Medeiros, R', 'Dorlhiac, P', 'Chamone, D', 'Dulley, F']","['Massumoto CM', 'Mizukami S', 'Campos MF', 'Silva LA', 'Mendrone Junior A', 'Sakashita A', 'Zambon E', 'Ostronoff M', 'Macedo MC', 'Medeiros R', 'Dorlhiac P', 'Chamone D', 'Dulley F']",['Disciplina de Hematologia e Hemoterapia da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo.'],['por'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Brazil,Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira (1992),9308586,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cryopreservation/*methods', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Stem Cells']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1590/s0104-42301997000200003 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992). 1997 Apr-Jun;43(2):93-8. doi: 10.1590/s0104-42301997000200003.,,,,,,,,,Criopreservacao de medula ossea e celulas pluripotentes perifericas utilizando um congelador programavel: experiencia em 86 congelamentos.,,,,,,

Here we report an increased frequency of partial albinism, a morphological aberration associated with a loss of fitness, among barn swallows, Hirundo rustica, breeding close to Chernobyl.

Furthermore, evidence for an increased germline mutation rate was obtained from segregation analysis at two hypervariable microsatellite loci, indicating that mutation events in barn swallows from Chernobyl were two- to tenfold higher than in birds from control areas in Ukraine and Italy.","['Ellegren, H', 'Lindgren, G', 'Primmer, C R', 'Moller, A P']","['Ellegren H', 'Lindgren G', 'Primmer CR', 'Moller AP']","['Department of Animal Breeding and Genetics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala. hans.ellegren@bmc.uu.se']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,,IM,"['Albinism/etiology/veterinary', 'Animals', 'Birds/genetics/*physiology', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Italy', 'Microsatellite Repeats', '*Power Plants', '*Radioactive Hazard Release', 'Reproduction', 'Ukraine']",1997/10/23 22:33,2001/03/23 10:01,['1997/10/23 22:33'],"['1997/10/23 22:33 [pubmed]', '2001/03/23 10:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 22:33 [entrez]']",['10.1038/39303 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1997 Oct 9;389(6651):593-6. doi: 10.1038/39303.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We postulated that intracellular iron in turn may regulate the expression of TNF-alpha. In the human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, low basal TNF-alpha message levels were stimulated (sevenfold) when serum was excluded from the culture medium. Addition of hemin completely suppressed TNF-alpha expression. Similarly, hemin suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of TNF-alpha. Sn-protoporphyrin, an inhibitor of heme oxygenase (which releases iron from hemin), prevented hemin-induced suppression of TNF-alpha expression. Conversely, the intracellular iron chelator, desferrioxamine, stimulated TNF-alpha expression.

These sustained responses were not accounted for by changes in the transfected receptor's ability to interact with ligand or by receptor density. Signal transduction pathways of transfected and neutrophil FPRs are apparently similar. In transfected cells, dissociation of ligand is sensitive to guanine nucleotide, the G protein is pertussis toxin-sensitive, FPR and G protein appear to be precoupled, the F-actin response is stimulated with the same dose-response profile as in neutrophils, and the F-actin accumulation response is directly regulated by the FPR, even long after initial stimulation. Potentially significant differences between neutrophil and transfected FPR were found when receptor processing was measured. In neutrophils, practically 100% of the FPR is converted to forms that dissociate slowly from ligand and are inactive in signal transduction within 2 min of ligand stimulation. By contrast, 20% or more of transfected FPR remains rapidly dissociating even 5 min after stimulation. Although 80% of neutrophil FPR is internalized by 5 min after stimulation, transfected FPR appears to plateau at 50-60% internalized. Because actin responses in neutrophils are regulated by a small number of active receptors, the inefficiency of receptor inactivation in RBL(FPR) transfectants may account for the prolonged F-actin accumulation response.","['Hall, A L', 'Wilson, B S', 'Pfeiffer, J R', 'Oliver, J M', 'Sklar, L A']","['Hall AL', 'Wilson BS', 'Pfeiffer JR', 'Oliver JM', 'Sklar LA']","['Cancer Research and Treatment Center and Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque 87131, USA.']",['eng'],"['AI19032/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'RR01315/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Actins/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/physiology/ultrastructure', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/pharmacology"", 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Microscopy, Video', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/*physiology', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Receptors, Peptide/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.62.4.535 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1997 Oct;62(4):535-46. doi: 10.1002/jlb.62.4.535.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether Tie might be involved in early hematopoiesis, we asked whether the Tie gene is expressed in normal human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and if the expression of this gene could be regulated. Using a single-cell reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay to study expression of the Tie gene in the subset of human umbilical cord blood (UCB) CD34+++ primitive stem/ progenitor cells with extensive replating capacity, we demonstrated at the single isolated cell level that Tie was expressed in these cells. The expression of Tie gene in CD34+ cells was at a low level but was enhanced up to two- to fourfold by steel factor (SLF) or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), two cytokines that regulate production of stem/progenitor cells, as assessed using competitive PCR and semi-quantitative RT-PCR assays. The fold increases were observed as early as 2 h for SLF and 4 h for LIF and remained elevated for 24 h. These results demonstrate modulation of gene regulation in the rare populations of CD34+ cells and suggest the possibility that Tie may play a role in the proliferation and differentiation of immature hematopoietic cells.","['Ge, Y', 'Li, Z H', 'Yung, Y P', 'Ratzkin, B J', 'Broxmeyer, H E', 'Lu, L']","['Ge Y', 'Li ZH', 'Yung YP', 'Ratzkin BJ', 'Broxmeyer HE', 'Lu L']","['Department of Microbiology/Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5121, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL49202/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL56416/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA36464/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, TIE)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Interleukin-6', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, TIE', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology', '*Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.62.4.510 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1997 Oct;62(4):510-6. doi: 10.1002/jlb.62.4.510.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 58 year-old woman complained of hearing disturbance, severe headache and vomiting, and showed signs of meningeal irritation, as well as papilledema and bilateral dysacusis. Immature atypical cells were found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with elevated pressure, pleocytosis, increased protein and decreased glucose levels. She was diagnosed as having neoplastic meningitis. In spite of intensive investigations, including bone marrow puncture, malignancies were not found in organs other than intra-cranial site. The symptoms and CSF findings were temporarily improved with chemotherapy and irradiation, but she relapsed into neoplastic meningitis. The anaplastic cells in CSF were positive with CD45 by immunocytochemistry, and were positive by peroxidase staining. Thus, the anaplastic cells were considered to be myelocytic leukemic cells. Chromosomal analysis showed that these leukemic cells had a novel chromosomal abnormality: 46XX, 4q+, 10q-, 16q-. There has been no report of leukemic meningitis without bone marrow abnormalities. It is possible that this peculiar abnormal chromosome is related to the primary infiltration of the central nervous system. With this novel chromosomal abnormality, this case is important for considering the mechanism of primary leukemic meningitis.","['Hayashi, T', 'Onodera, J', 'Mochizuki, H', 'Onodera, H', 'Abe, K', 'Itoyama, Y']","['Hayashi T', 'Onodera J', 'Mochizuki H', 'Onodera H', 'Abe K', 'Itoyama Y']","['Department of Neurology, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,J Neurol Sci,Journal of the neurological sciences,0375403,,IM,"['Central Nervous System Diseases/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-510X(97)00099-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-510x(97)00099-3 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurol Sci. 1997 Oct 3;151(1):107-10. doi: 10.1016/s0022-510x(97)00099-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of HCV RNA was documented both in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in the bone marrow by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of the 5' untranslated region of the viral genome. Of interest, HCV RNA was also found in the serum, showing that viraemia was associated with the presence of circulating anti-HCV antibodies. HCV genotyping, performed by PCR amplification of the core region, revealed the presence of an unclassifiable genotype. The hypothetical mechanisms leading to HCV-induced cytopenia in this patient are briefly discussed. Treatment with corticosteroids was effective in controlling blood cell counts, without increasing viraemia and deterioration of liver disease.

To investigate this relationship, the CCRF-CEM (CEM) human T-cell leukaemia cell line was treated with fractionated gamma-radiation totalling 75 Gy (10 cycles of 1.5 Gy daily for 5 days). This produced the CEMRR subline which was 1.5-fold resistant to radiation compared with the parental CEM cells. The CEMRR subline was also resistant to daunorbicin, idarubicin and etoposide but not to paclitaxel, cis-platinum or chlorambucil. Treatment with 50 microM buthionine sulphoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, reversed the daunorubicin resistance in the CEMRR subline. Multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) mRNA was 6-fold higher in the CEMRR subline than in the CEM cells, and there was no detectable expression of P-glycoprotein in either the CEM cells or the CEMRR subline. Treatment of the CEM cells with 2 Gy of gamma-radiation caused an increase in MRP-mRNA within 4 hr which, by 24 hr, was greater than 5-fold that of the untreated CEM cells. No change in MRP mRNA was observed in the CEMRR subline with similar treatment. We conclude that MRP is involved in the immediate response to radiation and it may account for the drug resistance that often develops following radiation treatment.","['Harvie, R M', 'Davey, M W', 'Davey, R A']","['Harvie RM', 'Davey MW', 'Davey RA']","['Bill Walsh Cancer Research Laboratories, Clinical Oncology Department, Royal North Shore Hospital, St. Leonards, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics/*physiology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Dose Fractionation, Radiation', 'Drug Resistance', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', '*Radiation Tolerance', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/10/23 22:31,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/10/23 22:31'],"['1997/10/23 22:31 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/10/23 22:31 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19970926)73:1<164::AID-IJC25>3.0.CO;2-F [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19970926)73:1<164::aid-ijc25>3.0.co;2-f [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1997 Sep 26;73(1):164-7. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19970926)73:1<164::aid-ijc25>3.0.co;2-f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a major problem in ABMT is relapse, and ex vivo purging may be very important in preventing it. We show here that quercetin enhances the growth-inhibitory effect of hyperthermia (HT) in AML (19 cases) and ALL (6 cases) leukemic blasts. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of this combined treatment resulted in leukemic-cell apoptosis. On the contrary, normal hematopoietic progenitors were neither growth-inhibited nor induced to apoptosis by HT-plus-quercetin treatment. To explain this difference in sensitivity of leukemic and normal hematopoietic progenitors, we analyzed the effect of quercetin on heat-induced expression of heat-shock protein-70 (HSP-70), which has been shown to be important in regulating thermosensitivity. We found that quercetin inhibits heat-induced HSP-70 expression both at protein and at mRNA levels in AML and ALL blasts. In normal CD34+ progenitors, the combined treatment with HT and quercetin did not reduce HSP-70 expression and did not induce cell apoptosis. Considering the difference in heat sensitivity of normal CD34+ and leukemic progenitors in the presence of quercetin, the combined use of HT and quercetin could constitute a purging protocol for ABMT.","['Larocca, L M', 'Ranelletti, F O', 'Maggiano, N', 'Rutella, S', 'La Barbera, E O', 'Rumi, C', 'Serra, F', 'Voso, M T', 'Piantelli, M', 'Teofili, L', 'Leone, G']","['Larocca LM', 'Ranelletti FO', 'Maggiano N', 'Rutella S', 'La Barbera EO', 'Rumi C', 'Serra F', 'Voso MT', 'Piantelli M', 'Teofili L', 'Leone G']","['Istituto di Anatomia Patologica, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', '*Hyperthermia, Induced', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*therapy', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/10/23 22:31,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/10/23 22:31'],"['1997/10/23 22:31 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/10/23 22:31 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19970926)73:1<75::AID-IJC13>3.0.CO;2-4 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19970926)73:1<75::aid-ijc13>3.0.co;2-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1997 Sep 26;73(1):75-83. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19970926)73:1<75::aid-ijc13>3.0.co;2-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although ATM is considered to be a tumorigenic factor in several human cancers, it has not yet been found mutated in tumors of non-AT patients. Given the marked predisposition of AT patients to develop neoplasms of the T-cell lineage, we analyzed a series of T-cell leukemias (T-prolymphocytic leukemia, or T-PLL) in non-AT patients in search of genomic changes associated with the development of this disease. Among the recurrent aberrations identified, deletion of the chromosome arm 11q was very frequent. Subsequent molecular cytogenetic analyses allowed us to define a small commonly deleted segment at 11q22.3-23.1 in 15 of 24 T-PLLs studied. Since this critical region contained ATM, we further analyzed the remaining copy of the gene in six cases showing deletions affecting one ATM allele. In all six cases, mutations of the second ATM allele were identified, leading to the absence, premature truncation or alteration of the ATM gene product. Thus, our study demonstrates disruption of both ATM alleles by deletion or point mutation in T-PLL, suggesting that ATM functions as a tumor-suppressor gene in tumors of non-AT individuals.","['Stilgenbauer, S', 'Schaffner, C', 'Litterst, A', 'Liebisch, P', 'Gilad, S', 'Bar-Shira, A', 'James, M R', 'Lichter, P', 'Dohner, H']","['Stilgenbauer S', 'Schaffner C', 'Litterst A', 'Liebisch P', 'Gilad S', 'Bar-Shira A', 'James MR', 'Lichter P', 'Dohner H']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik V, University of Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/nm1097-1155 [doi]'],ppublish,Nat Med. 1997 Oct;3(10):1155-9. doi: 10.1038/nm1097-1155.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now show here that integrin alpha4 tail deletion markedly impairs static cell adhesion by a mechanism that does not involve altered binding of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ligand. Instead, truncation of the alpha4 cytoplasmic domain caused a severe deficiency in integrin accumulation into cell surface clusters, as induced by ligand and/ or antibodies. Furthermore, alpha4 tail deletion also significantly decreased the membrane diffusivity of alpha4beta1, as determined by a single particle tracking technique. Notably, low doses of cytochalasin D partially restored the deficiency in cell adhesion seen upon alpha4 tail deletion. Together, these results suggest that alpha4 tail deletion exposes the beta1 cytoplasmic domain, leading to cytoskeletal associations that apparently restrict integrin lateral diffusion and accumulation into clusters, thus causing reduced static cell adhesion. Our demonstration of integrin adhesive activity regulated through receptor diffusion/clustering (rather than through altered ligand binding affinity) may be highly relevant towards the understanding of inside-out signaling mechanisms for beta1 integrins.","['Yauch, R L', 'Felsenfeld, D P', 'Kraeft, S K', 'Chen, L B', 'Sheetz, M P', 'Hemler, M E']","['Yauch RL', 'Felsenfeld DP', 'Kraeft SK', 'Chen LB', 'Sheetz MP', 'Hemler ME']","['Division of Tumor Virology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['AI09490/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM46526/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '0 (Receptors, Very Late Antigen)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', '968JJ8C9DV (Sodium Azide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Adhesion/genetics', 'Cricetinae', 'Epitopes/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Ligands', 'Manganese', '*Mutagenesis', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Very Late Antigen/drug effects', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Sodium Azide', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.186.8.1347 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1997 Oct 20;186(8):1347-55. doi: 10.1084/jem.186.8.1347.,,PMC2199079,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Receptors capable of interfering with the signaling of antigen receptors, such as Fc epsilon RI, recruit tyrosine and inositol phosphatases that results in diminished calcium mobilization. Here, we show that antibodies recognizing CD81 inhibit Fc epsilon RI-mediated mast cell degranulation but, surprisingly, without affecting aggregation-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation, calcium mobilization, or leukotriene synthesis. Furthermore, CD81 antibodies also inhibit mast cell degranulation in vivo as measured by reduced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis responses.

DC pulsed with tumor-associated antigen (TAA) peptide or protein have recently been demonstrated to elicit antigen-specific protective antitumor immunity in a number of murine models. Transduction of DCs with TAA genes may allow stable, prolonged antigen expression as well as the potential for presentation of multiple, or unidentified, epitopes in association with major histocompatibility complex class I and/or class II molecules. To evaluate the potential efficacy of retrovirally transduced DCs, bone marrow cells harvested from BALB/c mice were transduced with either a model antigen gene encoding beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) or a control gene encoding rat HER-2/neu (Neu) by coculture with irradiated ecotropic retroviral producer lines. Bone marrow cells were differentiated into DC in vitro using granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4. After 7 d in culture, cells were 45-78% double positive for DC phenotypic cell surface markers by FACS(R) analysis, and DC transduced with beta-gal were 41-72% positive for beta-gal expression by X-gal staining. In addition, coculture of beta-gal transduced DC with a beta-gal-specific T cell line (CTLx) resulted in the production of large amounts of interferon-gamma, demonstrating that transduced DCs could process and present endogenously expressed beta-gal. DC transduced with beta-gal and control rat HER-2/neu were then used to treat 3-d lung metastases in mice bearing an experimental murine tumor CT26.CL25, expressing the model antigen, beta-gal. Treatment with beta-gal-transduced DC significantly reduced the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules compared with treatment with Hank's balanced salt solution or DCs transduced with rat HER-2/neu. In addition, immunization with beta-gal-transduced DCs resulted in the generation of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which were significantly more reactive against relevant tumor targets than CTLs generated from mice immunized with DCs pulsed with the Ld-restricted beta-gal peptide. The results observed in this rapidly lethal tumor model suggest that DCs transduced with TAA may be a useful treatment modality in tumor immunotherapy.","['Specht, J M', 'Wang, G', 'Do, M T', 'Lam, J S', 'Royal, R E', 'Reeves, M E', 'Rosenberg, S A', 'Hwu, P']","['Specht JM', 'Wang G', 'Do MT', 'Lam JS', 'Royal RE', 'Reeves ME', 'Rosenberg SA', 'Hwu P']","['Surgery Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,['EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/enzymology/immunology/virology', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Dendritic Cells/enzymology/*transplantation/virology', 'Female', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Lung Neoplasms/*immunology/secondary/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Models, Immunological', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase/biosynthesis/*genetics/*immunology']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.186.8.1213 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1997 Oct 20;186(8):1213-21. doi: 10.1084/jem.186.8.1213.,,PMC2199086,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Presentation of adhesion molecules on leukocyte microvilli can substantially enhance tethering. Localization of L-selectin to microvilli and of CD44 to the planar cell body have been shown to depend upon their transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. We investigated the role of leukocyte integrin transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains in initiating adhesion under flow and in microvillous localization. Integrins alpha4beta7, alphaLbeta2, and alphaMbeta2 were heterologously expressed in K562 cells. alpha4beta7 initiated adhesion under flow and localized to microvilli, whereas beta2 integrins did not initiate adhesion and localized to the cell body. Chimeric integrins were produced by replacing the alpha4beta7 cytoplasmic and/or transmembrane domains with the homologous domains of alphaLbeta2 or alphaMbeta2. Unexpectedly, these chimeras efficiently mediated adhesion to the alpha4beta7 ligand mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 under flow and localized to microvilli. Therefore, differences between the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of alpha4 and beta2 integrins do not account for differences in ability to support attachment under flow or in membrane localization. Integrins alpha4beta1, alpha5beta1, alpha6Abeta1, alphavbeta3, and alphaEbeta7 also localized to microvilli. Transmembrane proteins known or suspected to associate with extracellular domains of microvillous integrins, including tetraspans and CD47, were concentrated on microvilli as well. These findings suggest that interactions between the extracellular domains of integrins and associated proteins could direct the assembly of multimolecular complexes on leukocyte microvilli.","['Abitorabi, M A', 'Pachynski, R K', 'Ferrando, R E', 'Tidswell, M', 'Erle, D J']","['Abitorabi MA', 'Pachynski RK', 'Ferrando RE', 'Tidswell M', 'Erle DJ']","['The Lung Biology Center, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.']",['eng'],"['HL 50024/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL03230/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL07155/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Integrins)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (integrin alpha4beta7)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Humans', 'Integrins/analysis/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukocytes/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Microvilli/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.139.2.563 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1997 Oct 20;139(2):563-71. doi: 10.1083/jcb.139.2.563.,,PMC2139798,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Homology search analysis revealed that the aa sequence of p190 showed 90% identity over the entire sequence with the product of the AF-6 gene, which was found to be fused to the ALL-1 gene, known to be involved in acute leukemia. p190 is likely to be a rat counterpart of human AF-6 protein. p205 bound along the sides of F-actin but hardly showed the F-actin-cross-linking activity. Northern and Western blot analyses showed that p205 was ubiquitously expressed in all the rat tissues examined, whereas p190 was specifically expressed in brain. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopic studies revealed that p205 was concentrated at cadherin-based cell-to-cell AJ of various tissues. We named p205 l-afadin (a large splicing variant of AF-6 protein localized at adherens junction) and p190 s-afadin (a small splicing variant of l-afadin).

By SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western immunoblotting we showed that hGRbeta is endogenously expressed at the protein level in HeLa cells and human lymphatic leukemia cells.

Identification of promoter elements and role of regulatory proteins.,26585-94,"We have characterized the 5'-flanking region of the human erythroid-specific 5-amino levulinate synthase (ALAS) gene (the ALAS2 gene) and shown that the first 300 base pairs of promoter sequence gives maximal expression in erythroid cells. Transcription factor binding sites clustered within this promoter sequence include GATA motifs and CACCC boxes, critical regulatory sequences of many erythroid cell-expressed genes. GATA sites at -126/-121 (on the noncoding strand) and -102/-97 were each recognized by GATA-1 protein in vitro using erythroid cell nuclear extracts. Promoter mutagenesis and transient expression assays in erythroid cells established that both GATA-1 binding sites were functional and exogenously expressed GATA-1 increased promoter activity through these sites in transactivation experiments. A noncanonical TATA sequence at the expected TATA box location (-30/-23) bound GATA-1- or TATA-binding protein (TBP) in vitro. Conversion of this sequence to a canonical TATA box reduced expression in erythroid cells, suggesting a specific role for GATA-1 at this site. However, expression was also markedly reduced when the -30/-23 sequence was converted to a consensus GATA-1 sequence (that did not bind TBP in vitro), suggesting that a functional interaction of both factors with this sequence is important. A sequence comprising two overlapping CACCC boxes at -59/-48 (on the noncoding strand) was demonstrated by mutagenesis to be functionally important.

Similar to MDS1-EVI1, RIZ gene normally produces two protein products that differ by the PR domain. The smaller protein RIZ2 lacks the PR domain of RIZ1 but is otherwise identical to RIZ1. Here we show that RIZ proteins bind to GC-rich or Sp-1-binding elements and repress transcription. Both RIZ1 and RIZ2 repressed the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) promoter, one of the best characterized eukaryotic promoters. Recombinant RIZ1 proteins were able to bind to HSV-TK promoter. This binding was mediated by the GC-rich Sp-1 elements of the promoter and the first three zinc finger motifs of RIZ1. RIZ also encodes a repressor domain that was mapped to the central region of the protein. Fusion of this region to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain generated GAL4 site-dependent transcriptional repressors. We also show that RIZ1 protein can efficiently repress the simian virus 40 (SV40) early promoter, which primarily consists of Sp-1 sites; RIZ2, however, only weakly repressed this promoter, suggesting a role for PR in modulating RIZ protein function. The data have implications for a role of RIZ proteins in the regulation of cellular gene promoters, many of which are characterized by GC-rich elements.","['Xie, M', 'Shao, G', 'Buyse, I M', 'Huang, S']","['Xie M', 'Shao G', 'Buyse IM', 'Huang S']","['La Jolla Cancer Research Center, The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],['R01CA57496/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Zinc Fingers/*genetics']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.42.26360 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)66426-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Oct 17;272(42):26360-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.42.26360.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chromosomal rearrangements induced by radiation most likely are one of the principal genetic alterations resulting in malignant transformation. The chimeric BCR-ABL associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and H4-RET oncogenes associated with thyroid papillary carcinoma are the result of a translocation and inversion, respectively. In vitro studies showed these genes were induced by high-doses of X-irradiation in cell lines. Studies also show that therapeutic external X-ray doses as high as 60 Gy for treatment of various childhood cancers including Hodgkin's disease significantly increase the risk of thyroid cancer. Therefore, we examined the induction and persistence of these chimeric genes in human thyroid tissues transplanted in scid mice after 50 Gy exposure as a function of time for 2 months to elucidate the early events of thyroid carcinogenesis. The H4-RET genes were detected on day 2 and throughout the 2 month period. On the other hand, BCR-ABL genes were detected on day 2 and were undetectable subsequently. These results suggest that ionizing radiation causes various oncogene activations, but cells with only specific gene alteration uniquely associated with thyroid carcinogenesis are selectively retained demonstrating one of the early events in the beginnings of radiation carcinogenesis in human thyroid tissues.","['Mizuno, T', 'Kyoizumi, S', 'Suzuki, T', 'Iwamoto, K S', 'Seyama, T']","['Mizuno T', 'Kyoizumi S', 'Suzuki T', 'Iwamoto KS', 'Seyama T']","['Department of Radiobiology, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Ret protein, Drosophila)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Ret protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Papillary/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'DNA Primers', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Exons', 'Fetal Tissue Transplantation/pathology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*genetics/pathology', '*Oncogenes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Thyroid Gland/pathology/transplantation', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/pathology']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201313 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1997 Sep 18;15(12):1455-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201313.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: In the phenytoin-treated patient, the metabolic formation of IFF enantiomers was increased and the metabolic pattern of the N-dechloroethylation altered from non-phenytoin-treated patients: (R)-3-DCE IFF > > (S)-3-DCE-IFF = (S)-2-DCE-IFF > (R)-2-DCE-IFF (control) vs (S)-3-DCE-IFF = (S)-2-DCE-IFF > (R)-3-DCE-IFF > > (R)-2-DCE-IFF (patient).

In 116 patients, standard conditioning was intensified by the addition of anthracyclines. Multivariate analysis revealed significantly more acute GVHD > or = grade 2 and a trend towards more chronic GVHD in patients conditioned with the addition of anthracyclines. For all patients the risk for chronic GVHD, but not for acute GVHD increased with a higher number of T cells in the graft. The projected 5-year probability of relapse was significantly lower in the group of patients conditioned with anthracyclines; 26% versus 52% (P = 0.015). In multivariate analysis the addition of anthracyclines to the conditioning regimen was the only significant factor contributing to a lower probability of relapse. The projected 5-year probability of leukaemia-free survival [LFS] in the patients conditioned with and without the addition of anthracyclines was 56% and 36%, respectively (P = 0.004). In multivariate analysis the addition of anthracyclines to the conditioning regimen correlated significantly with a lower number of mixed chimaeras in patients at 6 and 12 months after BMT. Mixed chimaerism at 6 months after transplantation did not significantly correlate with a higher incidence of relapse in further follow-up. In contrast, mixed chimaerism at 12 months after BMT was significantly associated with higher relapse rate.

Using continuous human leukaemia cell lines as model systems, we found that IFN-gamma stimulated the proliferation of leukaemic myeloid cells; this effect was specifically neutralized by an anti-IFN-gamma monoclonal antibody (McAb). No proliferative response was seen in autonomously growing cell lines; however, 11/19 constitutively growth factor-dependent cell lines showed a significant response in short-term proliferation assays upon incubation with IFN-gamma. The stimulation indices ranged from 2 to 37 compared with the untreated control cells; the EC50 values for these cell lines were in the range of 0.1-0.6 ng/ml IFN-gamma. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated heterogeneity in the expression of the IFN-gamma receptor, as it was found on 37-97% of the cells per cell line. The effects of IFN-gamma on proliferation triggered by a spectrum of 10 other cytokines were variable, and both stimulation and attenuation of the proliferative responses were seen in different cell lines. Under serum-free culture conditions, IFN-gamma acted as a survival factor suppressing apoptosis. As has been described for other functional processes triggered by IFN-gamma, the proliferation-inducing activity of IFN-gamma also led to activation of the signal transducing element STAT 1. Thus, IFN-gamma can induce myeloid leukaemia cells to proliferate and can modulate their proliferative response to other cytokines. Therefore IFN-gamma may be a pathologically relevant ligand for leukaemic cell proliferation in vivo. In physiological settings, IFN-gamma might be a bifunctional regulator of haemopoietic cell proliferation, depending on other differential co-signals from the micro-environment.","['Drexler, H G', 'Zaborski, M', 'Quentmeier, H']","['Drexler HG', 'Zaborski M', 'Quentmeier H']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '07MXG07O12 (interferon gamma receptor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interferon/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.2673084.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Sep;98(3):699-710. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.2673084.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that the vinblastine-resistant leukaemic cell line CEM/VLB100 has a more active mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) than the parental CCRF-CEM cell line. Inhibition of mitochondrial DNA replication by ethidium bromide (EB) depleted the activity of the ETC and reduced cellular respiratory rate. Depletion of mitochondrial DNA was associated with increased resistance to vinblastine-induced apoptosis in both cell lines. In contrast, the highly specific inhibitor of the energy producing mitochondrial enzyme F1Fzero-ATPase, oligomycin, rendered CEM/VLB100 cells more sensitive to vinblastine by inhibiting the energy-dependent P-glycoprotein (Pgp) pump, suggesting that the effect of EB is independent of energy generation and ATPase activity. Both mitochondrial ETC depletion and ATPase inhibition decreased vinblastine-induced cell cycle changes in the CCRF-CEM cell line, suggesting that cell cycle changes are dependent on ATP generation. However, EB-induced ETC depletion in CEM/VLB100 cells inhibited apoptosis in response to high concentration of vinblastine, but not G2M arrest. We suggest that: (1) over-expression of Pgp by drug-resistant cells may up-regulate mitochondrial energy production; (2) mitochondrial ETC activity is required for DNA fragmentation in response to vinblastine, but the mechanism is independent of Pgp activity and ATP generation; (3) down-regulation of mitochondrial ETC activity may confer resistance to vinblastine-induced apoptosis; (4) the mitochondrial ETC is involved in vinblastine-induced apoptosis downstream of microtubule disruption and cell cycle changes.","['Jia, L', 'Allen, P D', 'Macey, M G', 'Grahn, M F', 'Newland, A C', 'Kelsey, S M']","['Jia L', 'Allen PD', 'Macey MG', 'Grahn MF', 'Newland AC', 'Kelsey SM']","[""Department of Haematology, St Bartholomew's, London.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Oligomycins)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/*biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Electron Transport', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lactic Acid/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Oligomycins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/therapeutic use']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.2683085.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Sep;98(3):686-98. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.2683085.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TNF alpha-induced cell death showed an apoptotic pattern, as detected by agarose electrophoresis, flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM images revealed that autophagy and codensed mitochondria occurred earlier than nuclear fragmentation. The specific inhibitor of autophagy, 3-methyladenine (3MA), inhibited the formation of autophagosomes. TNF alpha-induced DNA fragmentation and cytolysis were completely inhibited by 10 mM 3MA. Inhibition of the fusion of lysosomes with autophagosomes by asparagine did not block TNF alpha-induced apoptosis. In addition, amino acid and protein deprivation enhanced TNF alpha-induced autophagy but not apoptosis. We propose that the early stages of autophagy are required for, but do not necessarily result in, TNF alpha-induced apoptosis.","['Jia, L', 'Dourmashkin, R R', 'Allen, P D', 'Gray, A B', 'Newland, A C', 'Kelsey, S M']","['Jia L', 'Dourmashkin RR', 'Allen PD', 'Gray AB', 'Newland AC', 'Kelsey SM']","[""Department of Haematology, St Bartholomew's, London.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Autophagy/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Lysosomes/pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mitochondria/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.2623081.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Sep;98(3):673-85. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.2623081.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, S1 protection analysis demonstrated expression of beta-globin mRNA, and Epo receptor (Epo-R) protein was detected by cytofluorimetric assay. Several growth factors, when tested alone or in combination, failed to influence the B1647 cell growth.

Two of these, alpha 1 and alpha 2, differ in their cytoplasmic domains. Because the GM-CSFR beta chain (beta c) is shared with the receptors for interleukins 3 and 5 it is possible that the alpha chain confers specificity on the GM-CSF response and that the different isoforms might refine this response further. Studies have been directed at determination of the respective biological roles of the alpha 1 and alpha 2 isoforms. Expression of the isoforms was examined by RNase protection analysis in normal granulocytes and a variety of cell lines of haemopoietic origin, at different stages of differentiation and activation. Expression was also analysed in cells from patients with a variety of leukaemic subtypes. Results demonstrated that the relative abundance of the isoforms was similar in all cell populations examined. The human GM-CSFR alpha 1 or alpha 2 receptors were independently expressed in the murine factor-dependent cell line FDC-P1, so that the properties of the receptors could be compared. Cell lines that expressed either receptor could be converted to growth in response to human GM-CSF and assumed a more differentiated phenotype when compared with the parental cell line. However, the morphology, expression of cell surface antigens and dose-growth response characteristics did not differ significantly between cells that expressed either the alpha 1 or alpha 2 receptor. These studies demonstrate that the alpha 1 and alpha 2 subunits of the GM-CSF receptor are co-ordinately regulated in both normal and malignant haemopoiesis. Furthermore, each receptor is able to deliver both proliferative and differentiative signals to myeloid cells.","['Crosier, K E', 'Hall, L R', 'Vitas, M R', 'Crosier, P S']","['Crosier KE', 'Hall LR', 'Vitas MR', 'Crosier PS']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isomerism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Monocytes/pathology', 'Neutrophil Activation', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*chemistry/metabolism/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.2653082.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Sep;98(3):540-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.2653082.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Virtually all breakpoints occur within an 8.3 kb BamHI fragment and result in 5' MLL fused to partner genes in a 5'-3' orientation. The translocation t(9;11)(p22;q23), which results in the fusion of MLL to AF9, is the most common of the 11q23 chromosomal abnormalities observed in de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in therapy related leukemia (t-AML), and rarely in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We have studied 24 patients with a t(9;11) and an MLL rearrangement, including 19 patients with AML, four with t-AML, and one with ALL. To understand the mechanisms of this illegitimate recombination, we cloned and sequenced the t(9;11) translocation breakpoint junctions on both derivative chromosomes from one AML patient and from the Mono Mac 6 (MM6) cell line, which was derived from a patient with AML. Two different complex junctions were noted. In the AML patient, both chromosome 11 and 9 breaks were staggered, occurred in Alu DNA sequences, and resulted in a 331 bp duplication. In the MM6 cell line, breaks in chromosomes 11 and 9 were also staggered, but, in contrast to the finding in the AML patient, the breaks did not involve Alu DNA sequences and resulted in a 664 bp deletion at the breakpoints. Using reverse transcriptase (RT-) PCR, we analyzed 11 patient samples, including the two just described, for MML-AF9 fusions. The fusion occurred in six of seven AML patients, two of two t-AML patients, one patient with ALL, and in the MM6 cell line. Interestingly, all of the breaks within the AF9 gene in AML patients occurred in the central AF9 exon, called Site A by others, whereas in the single ALL patient the breakpoint mapped to a more 3' region of the AF9 gene. Our data, when combined with those of others, suggest that the fusion point within the AF9 gene, and thus the amount of AF9 material included in the MLL-AF9 fusion gene product, may influence the phenotype of the resulting leukemia. This further supports the proposal that the MML translocation partner genes play a critical role in the leukemogenic process.","['Super, H G', 'Strissel, P L', 'Sobulo, O M', 'Burian, D', 'Reshmi, S C', 'Roe, B', 'Zeleznik-Le, N J', 'Diaz, M O', 'Rowley, J D']","['Super HG', 'Strissel PL', 'Sobulo OM', 'Burian D', 'Reshmi SC', 'Roe B', 'Zeleznik-Le NJ', 'Diaz MO', 'Rowley JD']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['5T32CA09273-19/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA38725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLLT3 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genomic Library', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/10/23 22:24,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/10/23 22:24'],"['1997/10/23 22:24 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/10/23 22:24 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199710)20:2<185::AID-GCC9>3.0.CO;2-# [pii]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1997 Oct;20(2):185-95.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FISH, using library probes and a panel of YAC probes, mapped along the long arm of chromosome 12, confirmed the cytogenetic results in all cases analyzed except for three cases of t(14;18)-positive follicle center lymphoma or diffuse large cell lymphoma with dup(12q). In these cases, FISH showed similar, possibly identical, duplications, which involved a region more centromeric (12q11-21) than assumed by karyotypic analysis (12q13-22 or 12q13-23) and included alphoid DNA sequences, a combination hitherto unknown. In addition, commonly duplicated regions of chromosome 12 could be defined: 12q11-21, including alphoid DNA sequences for follicle center cell lymphoma or t(14;18)-positive diffuse large cell lymphoma, 12q13-22 for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and 12p13-q15 for marginal zone cell lymphoma, all of which overlapped in 12q13-15. Whether these regions, especially 12q13-15, may contain genes which are important in malignant transformation or disease progression of B-cell lymphoproliferative malignancies characterized by complete or partial trisomy 12 remains to be determined.","['Dierlamm, J', 'Wlodarska, I', 'Michaux, L', 'Vermeesch, J R', 'Meeus, P', 'Stul, M', 'Criel, A', 'Verhoef, G', 'Thomas, J', 'Delannoy, A', 'Louwagie, A', 'Cassiman, J J', 'Mecucci, C', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'Van den Berghe, H']","['Dierlamm J', 'Wlodarska I', 'Michaux L', 'Vermeesch JR', 'Meeus P', 'Stul M', 'Criel A', 'Verhoef G', 'Thomas J', 'Delannoy A', 'Louwagie A', 'Cassiman JJ', 'Mecucci C', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Van den Berghe H']","['Center for Human Genetics, University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multigene Family', 'Trisomy/*genetics']",1997/10/23 22:24,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/10/23 22:24'],"['1997/10/23 22:24 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/10/23 22:24 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199710)20:2<155::AID-GCC6>3.0.CO;2-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1997 Oct;20(2):155-66.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a retrospective analysis at our institution to determine whether autograft CFU-GM levels predict engraftment of neutrophils and platelets after ABMT in heavily pretreated patients with hematologic malignancies. Between 1 January 1993 and 1 March 1995, 58 heavily pretreated patients received only marrow cells as the autograft product. Patients with Hodgkin's disease (n = 25), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 19), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 14) underwent intensive therapy with etoposide and melphalan. Unpurged marrow containing a minimum of 1.5 x 10(8)/kg (range: 1.5-4.8) was infused. Median time to an absolute neutrophil count > or = 0.5 x 10(9)/L was 21 days (range 10-270) and median time to a platelet count > or = 20 x 10(9)/L independent of transfusions was 44 days (range 13-317). There was no correlation between autograft MNC count and neutrophil or platelet engraftment. However, a correlation between autograft CFU-GM and both platelet and neutrophil recovery was demonstrated with a threshold CFU-GM of 3 x 10(4)/kg; delayed neutrophil recovery was observed in 79% of patients below this threshold compared to only 9% in those with an autograft CFU-GM level of more than 3 x 10(4)/kg (p = 0.0001). Similarly, platelet recovery was delayed in 76% of patients below, and 20% of those above this threshold (p = 0.003). We conclude that marrow autograft CFU-GM is predictive of engraftment of both platelets and neutrophils in heavily pretreated patients after ABMT for hematological malignancies.","['al-Fiar, F', 'Prince, H M', 'Imrie, K', 'Stewart, A K', 'Crump, M', 'Keating, A']","['al-Fiar F', 'Prince HM', 'Imrie K', 'Stewart AK', 'Crump M', 'Keating A']","['University of Toronto Autologous Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Toronto Hospital, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cell Transplant,Cell transplantation,9208854,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Blood Platelets', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Granulocytes', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*cytology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/therapy', 'Macrophages', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neutrophils', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0963689797000535 [pii]'],ppublish,Cell Transplant. 1997 Sep-Oct;6(5):491-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although examples of NK-cell tumors resembling acute leukemia have been described anecdotally as blastic, blastoid, or monomorphic NK-cell leukemia/lymphoma (NKL/L), the clinical and pathologic features of these tumors have not been systematically defined. We report four patients with blastic NKL/L and describe the clinical, pathologic, and immunophenotypic findings in these cases. All patients were elderly (58-82 years) and presented with cutaneous plaques. Two patients also had adenopathy, and three patients had marrow involvement at presentation. Biopsy of cutaneous lesions showed atypical superficial and deep dermal lymphoid infiltrates. Involved lymph nodes were architecturally effaced by an interfollicular infiltrate with blastic cytologic features. In Wright-Giemsa-stained blood or marrow smears, tumor cells had finely distributed nuclear chromatin, many with nucleoli, and variable amounts of cytoplasm. In contrast to many NK and NK-like T-cell disorders, azurophilic cytoplasmic granules were absent or inconspicuous. The tumor cells were immunophenotypically distinctive. They expressed intermediate density CD45, as is characteristic of blasts; in addition, the cells were positive for HLA-DR, CD2, CD4, and the NK-associated antigen CD56. Surface CD3, cytoplasmic CD3, and CD5 were negative in all cases tested, whereas CD7 was expressed in two cases. In formalin-fixed tissue, tumor cells marked with antibodies to CD43, but not with other T- or B-lineage-related antibodies. All three cases studied for Epstein-Barr viral RNA by in situ hybridization were negative. Although treatments varied, all three patients with clinical follow-up died within months of the diagnosis. The clinical course in two patients culminated in an overtly leukemic phase. These findings suggest that blastic NKL/L represents a distinct clinicopathologic entity, characterized by cutaneous, nodal, and marrow involvement by blastic cells with immunophenotypic characteristics of true NK cells. The disease afflicts elderly patients, pursues an aggressive course, and may culminate in overt leukemia.","['DiGiuseppe, J A', 'Louie, D C', 'Williams, J E', 'Miller, D T', 'Griffin, C A', 'Mann, R B', 'Borowitz, M J']","['DiGiuseppe JA', 'Louie DC', 'Williams JE', 'Miller DT', 'Griffin CA', 'Mann RB', 'Borowitz MJ']","['Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland 21287-6417, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/chemistry/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/chemistry/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin/pathology']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000478-199710000-00014 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 1997 Oct;21(10):1223-30. doi: 10.1097/00000478-199710000-00014.,,,,['Am J Surg Pathol. 1999 Aug;23(8):991-2.

In nine cases, the FGT involvement was the initial clinical presentation of the disease, and in the other two cases, the FGT involvement was discovered during a relapse of acute myeloid leukemia. The tumors ranged from 0.5 to 14 (mean, 7.5) cm in greatest dimension. Two ovarian tumors were bilateral, and three were green. Microscopic examination revealed a predominantly diffuse pattern of growth, but cords and pseudoacinar spaces were also present focally in several cases. Sclerosis was seen in five tumors and was prominent in one. Prominent myeloid differentiation was readily recognizable on routinely stained sections in three cases, whereas the neoplastic cells in the other cases were primitive with only rare eosinophilic myelocytes. All 11 tumors were positive for chloroacetate esterase, nine of nine were strongly and diffusely positive for lysozyme, eight of eight for myeloperoxidase, seven of seven for CD68, and six of six for CD43. Examination of bone marrow or peripheral blood performed after the diagnosis of FGT involvement revealed acute myeloid leukemia in three of five cases. Two of these patients died of disease, 1 and 16 months after the initial diagnosis, and the third, who received chemotherapy, is alive and free of disease 8 months after the initial diagnosis. One of the two patients with negative bone marrow had recurrent granulocytic sarcoma 30 months after diagnosis and died of sepsis 1 month later; no residual disease was noted at autopsy. The other patient is alive and free of disease 18 months after the diagnosis. One of the four remaining patients with primary FGT involvement who did not have a bone marrow biopsy died of leukemia 24 months later; no follow-up information is available for the other three patients. One of the two patients with a prior diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia was alive with disease 26 months later; follow-up is not available for the second patient. The diagnosis was often difficult in these cases, the most common problem being distinction from malignant lymphoma, but carcinoma, granulosa cell tumor, and, rarely, other tumors were considered. Immunohistochemical and enzyme histochemical staining were useful in establishing the diagnosis, although suspicion of the diagnosis on examination of routinely stained sections was of paramount importance.","['Oliva, E', 'Ferry, J A', 'Young, R H', 'Prat, J', 'Srigley, J R', 'Scully, R E']","['Oliva E', 'Ferry JA', 'Young RH', 'Prat J', 'Srigley JR', 'Scully RE']","['Massachusetts General Hospital, the Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston 02114, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Genital Neoplasms, Female/complications/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Middle Aged', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/pathology', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology', 'Vaginal Neoplasms/pathology']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000478-199710000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 1997 Oct;21(10):1156-65. doi: 10.1097/00000478-199710000-00005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The combination of more active agents like vinorelbine and paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) with cisplatin has led to improved survival for patients with advanced metastatic disease. The ability to escalate the dose of cisplatin-based regimens is limited by nonhematologic toxicities and is especially difficult in the population of patients with advanced NSCLC. However, the development of new agents with significant activity against NSCLC as well as new strategies for high-dose therapy have made it possible to examine the potential of dose-intense therapy in this population. A phase I trial performed at the University of North Carolina was designed to evaluate paclitaxel 250 mg/m2 given over 24 hours plus escalating doses of carboplatin starting at an area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) dose of 8 supported by peripheral blood stem cells and filgrastim in the treatment of advanced NSCLC. The AUC dose of carboplatin was escalated in increments of 2. The maximum tolerated dose of carboplatin combined with paclitaxel 250 mg/m2 administered over 24 hours was defined at an AUC of 18. In this study, six of seven patients with advanced NSCLC had major responses. This regimen is currently being tested in patients with locally advanced NSCLC by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B: patients receive two cycles of induction therapy with paclitaxel 250 mg/m2 over 3 hours followed by carboplatin at an AUC of 18 supported by peripheral blood stem cells and filgrastim. Depending on response to induction therapy, patients then receive surgical resection, thoracic radiation therapy, or both.

Although it has proven valuable, etoposide is also a known mutagen and has been implicated as a causative agent of treatment-related secondary acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. We have investigated the induction of mutation following etoposide treatment in vivo using the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) T-cell cloning assay in small cell lung cancer patients receiving single-drug etoposide chemotherapy. This report presents results on the monitoring of 12 patients (mean age, 74.8 +/- 6.0 years; range, 66-83 years) before, during, and after chemotherapy. The treatment regimen included up to six cycles of oral etoposide given in twice-daily 50-mg tablets for 10-14 days, separated by 2 weeks of rest. Peripheral blood samples were collected on the first day of each cycle prior to treatment. Patients received one to six etoposide cycles and were followed for 0.7-5.3 months after the start of chemotherapy (total etoposide dose, 1.4-8.4 g). Results from the pooled data show no significant increase in the hprt mutant frequency (pretreatment, 46 x 10(-6) +/- 38 x 10(-6), versus posttreatment, 55 x 10(-6) +/- 46 x 10(-6)), although considerable interpatient variability was observed. Of a total of 424 selected mutants, 228 were analyzed by sequencing hprt cDNA. Spectra of 56 pretreatment and 147 posttreatment mutations revealed significant enhancement of AT-->TA transversions and a concomitant decrease in the number of GC-->TA transversions in posttreatment spectra, when they were compared with pretreatment or control spectra. No evidence for the induction of gross deletions or rearrangements was found in the spectra of mutants that were recovered from patients after etoposide treatment. The lack of enhanced mutant frequency after treatment suggests that the etoposide chemotherapy was not particularly effective in inducing mutation, as measured by the hprt assay. It is proposed that mutated cells are eliminated through apoptosis due to accumulated DNA damage.","['Karnaoukhova, L', 'Moffat, J', 'Martins, H', 'Glickman, B']","['Karnaoukhova L', 'Moffat J', 'Martins H', 'Glickman B']","['Centre for Environmental Health, Department of Biology, University of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', '*Mutagenesis', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/*pathology', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1997 Oct 1;57(19):4393-407.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IFN-gamma treatment of ADPM-susceptible C58/M mice protected them from paralytic disease, but had no detectable effect on the IgG anti-LDV response or LDV viremia. IFN-gamma-mediated protection from ADPM correlated with reduced expression of LDV RNA, but not MuLV RNA, in the spinal cords of C58/M mice.

The uptake of IDA by both cell types was temperature- and concentration-dependent, was inhibited competitively by daunorubicin (DNR) and noncompetitively by adriamycin (ADR), and was stimulated by preloading of the cells with DNR and ADR, indicating the partial involvement of a carrier-mediated mechanism. On pretreatment of the cells with 2,4-dinitrophenol, IDA uptake by HL60 cells increased, but that by MNCs decreased, suggesting that IDA was partially taken up into HL60 cells via an energy-independent carrier system, and into MNCs via an energy-dependent one. We speculated that in HL60 cells the carrier concerned with IDA uptake was common to DNR and ADR, and that the binding site of IDA on the carrier was the same as that for DNR, but not that for ADR, while in MNCs the carrier system consisted of, at least in part, a carrier for DNR uptake and one for ADR uptake, and the binding site of IDA was identical to that for DNR in the former, but different from that for ADR in the latter. It appeared that the uptake of IDA was greater than those of pirarubicin, DNR and ADR in both HL60 cells and MNCs, and that IDA was incorporated into MNCs more efficiently than into HL60 cells because of the higher uptake efficacy of the carrier(s).","['Nagasawa, K', 'Ohnishi, N', 'Yokoyama, T']","['Nagasawa K', 'Ohnishi N', 'Yokoyama T']","['Department of Hospital Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyoto Pharmaceutical University.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'D58G680W0G (pirarubicin)', 'Q13SKS21MN (2,4-Dinitrophenol)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['2,4-Dinitrophenol/pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Antimetabolites/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Transport', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism', 'Diffusion', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Temperature']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0910505097846182 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1997.tb00447.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1997 Aug;88(8):750-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1997.tb00447.x.,,PMC5921500,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Between January 1990 and December 1994, from a total of 76 leukemic patients who have received combination chemotherapy consisting of cytosine arabinoside and anthracycline antibiotics, 15 patients developed chemotherapy-induced acral erythema. Fourteen of the patients had acute myelocytic leukemia, and one of them had chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast phase. Clinical features of these 15 patients have been analysed. Biopsy specimens obtained from eight of the patients were also evaluated for histopathologic alterations. RESULTS: The overall incidence of this reaction was found to be 19.7% in our group of patients receiving this chemotherapy protocol. The onset of reaction varied from the fourth to the seventeenth days of the chemotherapy and resolved within 2 weeks in most of the patients. Lesions appeared as well-defined erythema and edema involving the palmar surfaces in all of the patients. In nine of the patients the reaction recurred with subsequent chemotherapies. Scattered necrotic keratinocytes, vacuolar alterations of the basal layer, and mild to moderate perivascular lymphocytic infiltration in the dermis were the histopathologic findings observed in the biopsy specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Chemotherapy-induced acral erythema is a frequent reaction in patients who are receiving high-dose chemotherapy. For patients in whom this self-limited condition develops, reassurance is the mainstay of therapy. Awareness of this reaction is also important to be able to differentiate it from acute graft versus host disease in patients who receive bone marrow transplants.","['Demircay, Z', 'Gurbuz, O', 'Alpdogan, T B', 'Yucelten, D', 'Alpdogan, O', 'Kurtkaya, O', 'Bayik, M']","['Demircay Z', 'Gurbuz O', 'Alpdogan TB', 'Yucelten D', 'Alpdogan O', 'Kurtkaya O', 'Bayik M']","['Department of Dermatology, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Int J Dermatol,International journal of dermatology,0243704,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Erythema/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-4362.1997.00040.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Dermatol. 1997 Aug;36(8):593-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-4362.1997.00040.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With regard to monoclonal gammopathies, MGUS had lower S-TK than MM patients (p < 0.05) and patients with stage I MM according to Durie and Salmon had S-TK levels significantly lower than those with more advanced stages (p < 0.01). There was a correlation between S-TK and plasma cell labeling index (r = 0.56, p < 0.001). Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia showed significantly higher S-TK levels in the RAI stages 3 and 4 than in stages 1 and 2 (p < 0.01). In cases of other malignant NHL in progression sensitivities of S-TK were found to be: immunocytoma 36%, centrocytic/centroblastic-centrocytic lymphoma 54% and high-grade NHL 40% (cut off defined on lymphomas in remission). S-TK levels varied in MM according to the course of disease and response to therapy decreasing at remission and increasing again at relapse. Analogous variations were found in the other NHL. After two years, 83% of patients with a pretreatment S-TK of < 10 U/L and 47% of the patients with a S-TK of > or = 10 U/L were still alive.

The combined sensitivities ranged between 55 and 60% (NCAM+ beta 2-M, beta 2-M+S-TK, NCAM+S-TK). No correlation with beta 2-M or S-TK could be demonstrated. However, NCAM values were correlated with the concentration of monoclonal immunoglobulin (IgG-paraprotein: r = 0.45; IgA-paraprotein: r = 0.58). In the follow-up of patients with myeloma, NCAM values decreased in response to chemotherapy and were low in smouldering myeloma. But in three patients with progression NCAM did not reflect the tumor activity. At the time of censor, 80% of patients (n = 80) with a pre-treatment NCAM of < 18.5 U/mL and 61% of patients with a NCAM of > 18.5 U/mL were still alive.

The 15-year estimated risk of developing a second malignant neoplasm after treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is 2.5%. Most of these neoplasms are central nervous system tumors. The risk of secondary acute myeloid leukemia has been negligible in most treatment regimens. Here, we report the first case of a primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) in a patient treated for ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 15.7-year-old girl developed pain in her left leg 7 years after diagnosis of low-risk ALL. Imaging studies revealed lytic lesions in her left proximal tibia and several vertebra as well as metastatic nodules in both lungs. RESULTS: Immunocytochemical and molecular analyses led to the diagnosis of PNET. The treatment of this SMN was composed of combination chemotherapy with hematopoietic growth factor support and radiotherapy to the primary lesion and affected spine. The tumor recurred 5 months after the completion of treatment, and the patient is now undergoing salvage therapy composed of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Imaging studies revealed a large left pleural effusion. Bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid studies were negative for disease at this time. RESULTS: Histopathologic examination of biopsy samples revealed cells with morphologic features of acute lymphoblastic leukemia blasts. Immunophenotyping, cytogenetic, and gene rearrangement studies confirmed the presence of a leukemic blast cell population similar to that detected at initial diagnosis. An isolated extramedullary relapse in the pleura was diagnosed. The patient underwent successful reinduction therapy and subsequently a matched unrelated donor bone marrow transplant; he died of disseminated infection in the posttransplant period. CONCLUSIONS: Unusual extramedullary sites of relapse are recognized with increasing frequency as long-term survival in childhood ALL improves. The length of the disease-free interval before relapse is felt to be of prognostic significance. Isolated relapse to the pleural space has not previously been described.

Few epidemiologic reports, however, have focused on this important age group. METHODS: Population-based data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program were used to estimate relative frequency, incidence rates, and average annual percentage change of rates among children in their first year of life (infants) who were diagnosed with a malignant neoplasm from 1973 to 1992 (N = 1461). RESULTS: The greatest proportion of cases (12%) was diagnosed during the first month of life, with extracranial neuroblastoma accounting for 35% of this total. Overall, the average annual incidence rate was 223/1,000,000 infants. Extracranial neuroblastoma was the most common infant malignancy (58/1,000,000 infants per year), followed by leukemias (37/1,000,000), brain and central nervous system (CNS) tumors (34/1,000,000), and retinoblastoma (27/1,000,000). White infants had a 32% higher incidence rate than black infants. The average annual percentage increase in rates for all cancer from 1973 to 1992 was 2.9% (95% CI: 1.9%, 3.8%). For neoplasms with at least 100 cases, increasing trends were greatest for retinoblastoma (4.6%), CNS (4.1%), and extracranial neuroblastoma (3.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Incidence rates increased notably over the study period. Future studies should consider the unique presentation of infants with cancer when developing new hypotheses related to cancer etiology and gene-environment interactions.","['Gurney, J G', 'Ross, J A', 'Wall, D A', 'Bleyer, W A', 'Severson, R K', 'Robison, L L']","['Gurney JG', 'Ross JA', 'Wall DA', 'Bleyer WA', 'Severson RK', 'Robison LL']","['Department of Community Health, School of Public Health, Saint Louis University, MO 63108-3342, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['African Americans', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Eye Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/classification/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Neuroblastoma/epidemiology', 'Retinoblastoma/epidemiology', 'SEER Program', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Whites']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199709000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1997 Sep-Oct;19(5):428-32. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199709000-00004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induced differentiation of these cells was found to be associated with repression of telomerase activity irrespective of the inducing agent. We have employed a series of sublines of human promyelocytic leukemia line HL60 with differing degrees of resistance to differentiation to determine how tightly the expression of the differentiated phenotype is coupled to the downregulation of telomerase activity and to the expression of the recently identified telomerase-associated protein 1 (TP1). As expected, in the 1,25D3-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3)-resistant subclones (20A-100A cells), telomerase activity was not significantly downregulated by 1,25D3 and, in most cases, by all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), to which these cells were cross-resistant, but telomerase activity was repressed by dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (TPA), to which the sublines were in general sensitive. However, there were exceptions; in some instances telomerase activity was repressed in the absence of the expression of markers of differentiation. Also, there was an inverse relationship between telomerase activity and the cellular levels of TP1 transcripts.

These antibodies were classified into 4 groups according to competitive binding ELISAs to the human IL-18 molecule. 1 murine mAb and all 6 rat mAbs neutralized IFN-gamma production induced by IL-18. A specific human IL-18 ELISA was developed using two neutralizing mAbs (#125-2H and #159-12B). This ELISA detects human IL-18 with a minimum detection limit of 10 pg/ml, but does not react with heat-denatured human IL-18. The ELISA does not show any cross-reactivity with other cytokines. Using this assay, human IL-18 was measurable in the plasma of leukemia patients.

We evaluated its ex vivo effects on myeloid leukemia cell lines and primary acute myelogenous leukemia cells. Vesnarinone inhibited the incorporation of radiolabeled thymidine by a myeloid cell line, HL60, in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 30 microg/mL. A maximum 40% suppression was seen at a concentration of 10 microg/mL. Determination of viable cell counts by trypan blue dye exclusion method demonstrated vesnarinone to be cytocidal for HL60 cells. Vesnarinone induced DNA fragmentation as detected by electrophresis in HL60 cells after 72-hour culture; this effect was not inhibited by G-CSF. The apoptosis induced by vesnarinone was also detected by the in situ end-labeling method. Northern blot analysis showed a reduction of c-myc mRNA expression in HL60 cells by vesnarinone. However, immunostaining assay showed no change in the expression of Fas and Bcl-2 proteins. We next examined the effect of vesnarinone on primary myeloid leukemia cells derived from 10 patients: 3 cases of M1, 2 of M2, 3 of M3, 1 of M4, and 1 of M6, by the French-American-British classification. Vesnarinone inhibited the incorporation of thymidine in all cells, with a mean suppression of 58.1%. DNA electrophoresis showed induction of DNA fragmentation in cultured cells with vesnarinone for 72 hours in 8 of the 10 patients with primary leukemia. However, bone marrow mononuclear cells from healthy controls showed no growth suppression or DNA fragmentation in response to vesnarinone. These results suggest that vesnarinone may be useful in treating myeloid leukemia.","['Fujiwara, H', 'Arima, N', 'Otsubo, H', 'Matsushita, K', 'Hidaka, S', 'Arimura, K', 'Kukita, T', 'Yamaguchi, K', 'Tanaka, H']","['Fujiwara H', 'Arima N', 'Otsubo H', 'Matsushita K', 'Hidaka S', 'Arimura K', 'Kukita T', 'Yamaguchi K', 'Tanaka H']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '5COW40EV8M (vesnarinone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Pyrazines', 'Quinolines/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/analysis']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1997 Oct;25(11):1180-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nuclear localization, lineage- and stage-specific expression, association with chromatin, and regulation by interferon alpha indicate that this protein is involved in regulating gene expression uniquely associated with the differentiation process and/or function of the monocyte/macrophage. MNDA does not bind specific DNA sequences, but rather a set of nuclear proteins that includes nucleolin (C23). Both in vitro binding assays and co-immunoprecipitation were used to demonstrate that MNDA also binds protein B23 (nucleophosmin/NPM). Three reciprocal chromosome translocations found in certain cases of leukemia/lymphoma involve fusions with the NPM/B23 gene, t(5;17) NPM-RARalpha, t(2;5) NPM-ALK, and the t(3;5) NPM-MLF1. In the current study, MNDA was not able to bind the NPM-ALK chimera originating from the t(2;5) and containing residues 1-117 of NPM. However, MNDA did bind the NPM-MLF1 product of the t(3;5) that contains the N-terminal 175 residues of NPM. The additional 58 amino acids (amino acids 117-175) of the NPM sequence that are contained in the product of the NPM-MLF1 fusion gene relative to the product of the NPM-ALK fusion appear responsible for MNDA binding. This additional NPM sequence contains a nuclear localization signal and clusters of acidic residues believed to bind nuclear localization signals of other proteins. Whereas NPM and nucleolin are primarily localized within the nucleolus, MNDA is distributed throughout the nucleus including the nucleolus, suggesting that additional interactions define overall MNDA localization.","['Xie, J', 'Briggs, J A', 'Morris, S W', 'Olson, M O', 'Kinney, M C', 'Briggs, R C']","['Xie J', 'Briggs JA', 'Morris SW', 'Olson MO', 'Kinney MC', 'Briggs RC']","['Department of Pathology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232-5310, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA01702/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA76301/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM28349/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MLF1 protein, human)', '0 (MNDA protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (p80(NPM-ALK) protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1997 Oct;25(11):1111-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms responsible for oncogenesis of cholangiocytes are unknown. Resistance to apoptosis, especially by altered expression of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 (Bcl-2) family members, has been implicated as a mechanism contributing to malignant transformation. Thus, our aim was to test the hypothesis that altered expression of Bcl-2 family members by cholangiocarcinoma cells renders them resistant to apoptosis. We compared the apoptotic threshold and expression of the Bcl-2 protein family members, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bax, in two human cell lines: 1) nonmalignant human cholangiocytes immortalized by transfection with the simian virus 40 (SV 40) large T antigen; and 2) a malignant human cholangiocarcinoma cell line. Apoptosis was induced pharmacologically using beauvericin. Bcl-2, Bcl-x long, and Bax protein expression were evaluated by immunoblot analysis, and Bcl-2 expression was modulated using antisense technology. The cholangiocyte and malignant/nonmaligant phenotype of both cell lines was verified using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. Beauvericin induced apoptosis of nonmalignant cholangiocytes in a concentration- (0 to 25 micromol/L) and time- (0 to 6 hours) dependent manner. In contrast, malignant cholangiocytes were resistant to apoptosis. Although expression of Bcl-x long and Bax protein were similiar in the two cell lines, Bcl-2 protein expression was 15-fold greater in malignant than in nonmalignant cholangiocytes. An 18 mer bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide reduced expression of Bcl-2 protein by 50% and increased the rate of beauvericin-induced apoptosis more than threefold in the malignant cells. Our results support the hypothesis that resistance to apoptosis by overexpression of Bcl-2 may be a feature of cholangiocarcinoma.","['Harnois, D M', 'Que, F G', 'Celli, A', 'LaRusso, N F', 'Gores, G J']","['Harnois DM', 'Que FG', 'Celli A', 'LaRusso NF', 'Gores GJ']","['Center for Basic Research in Digestive Diseases, Division of Gastroenterology and Internal Medicine, Mayo Medical School, Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA 15083-23F3.2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 24031/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 41876/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '26S048LS2R (beauvericin)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Bile Duct Neoplasms/chemistry/*pathology', '*Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/chemistry/*pathology', '*Depsipeptides', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', '*Peptides', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0270913997004345 [pii]', '10.1002/hep.510260413 [doi]']",ppublish,Hepatology. 1997 Oct;26(4):884-90. doi: 10.1002/hep.510260413.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latter property of hemin has been examined, using murine L1210 cells and three different oxidant generating systems: (i) glucose/glucose oxidase, (ii) near-ultraviolet irradiation, and (iii) dye-mediated photodynamic action. Cells treated with the lipophilic iron donor ferric-8-hydroxyquinoline, Fe(HQ)2 (1 microM, 30 min) were found to be more sensitive to oxidative killing than nontreated controls. However, cells challenged after long-term (20-24 h) exposure to hemin (10 microM) were substantially more resistant than controls and were sensitized far less by Fe(HQ)2. Immunoblot analyses of 24-h hemin-treated cells indicated that the ferritin heavy (H) subunit was elevated 12- to 15-fold, whereas the light (L) subunit was essentially unchanged. Experiments carried out with 55Fe(HQ)2 showed that iron uptake capacity of cells was greatly enhanced after hemin treatment. More specifically, hemin-stimulated cells were found to contain approximately 9 times more immunoprecipitable ferritin iron after incubation with saturating levels (4-5 microM) of 55Fe(HQ)2 and approximately 3 times more iron per ferritin molecule compared with nonstimulated controls. The nonferritin iron content of the latter was estimated to be approximately 40 times greater than that of the former following low-level (0.5 microM) 55Fe(HQ)2 treatment. These results are consistent with the idea that induced ferritin, enriched in H-chain, sequesters redox active iron rapidly and copiously, thereby enhancing cellular resistance to oxidants.","['Lin, F', 'Girotti, A W']","['Lin F', 'Girotti AW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['2-PO1 CA49089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA70823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ferric Compounds)', '0 (Hydroxyquinolines)', '0 (ferric 8-hydroxyquinoline)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Drug Resistance', 'Ferric Compounds/metabolism/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Ferritins/*biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hemin/*pharmacology', 'Hydroxyquinolines/metabolism/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Iron/metabolism/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Mice', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/radiation effects', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Up-Regulation']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(97)90300-3 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1997.0300 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1997 Oct 1;346(1):131-41. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1997.0300.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of their support for the United States during the Vietnam war, many Laotian Hmong fled to Thailand and eventually were re-settled in the US after the end of that conflict. Approximately 100,000 Hmong currently live in the US, of whom about half reside in the Central Valley of California. The purpose of this study was to measure cancer incidence in this unique new immigrant population. Using the resources of the Cancer Registry of Central California (CRCC), a population-based cancer registry, cancer incidence in the Hmong was evaluated by calculating age-adjusted incidence rates as well as by calculating proportional incidence ratios. Compared with all races combined, elevated rates of cancer in the Hmong were observed for the following sites: nasopharynx, stomach, liver, pancreas, leukemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Cervical cancer incidence overall was elevated, but more noteworthy, invasive cervix cancer rates were much higher than expected. Lower cancer rates were found for breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer. Hmong also experienced advanced stage and grade of disease at diagnosis for many cancer sites in addition to cervical cancer, which may be explained by cultural factors, including avoidance of Western medical care and low rates of participation in screening programs. This population should be followed closely and monitored for patterns of cancer incidence in the future since it provides a natural laboratory for studies of cancer etiology as this population gradually becomes acculturated to the Western lifestyle.","['Mills, P K', 'Yang, R']","['Mills PK', 'Yang R']","['Cancer Registry of Central California, Fresno 93710, USA.']",['eng'],['U75-CCU910677-01/PHS HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'California/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/ethnology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Laos/ethnology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/ethnology', 'Refugees/*statistics & numerical data', 'Registries', 'Sex Factors']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1018423219749 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 1997 Sep;8(5):705-12. doi: 10.1023/a:1018423219749.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The initial oxidative metabolite of benzene has long been suspected to be benzene oxide (3,5-cyclohexadiene-1,2-oxide). During in vitro experiments designed to characterize the oxidative metabolism of [14C]benzene, a metabolite was detected by HPLC-radioactivity analysis that did not elute with other known oxidative metabolites. The purpose of our investigation was to prove the hypothesis that this metabolite was benzene oxide. Benzene (1 mM) was incubated with liver microsomes from human donors, male B6C3F1 mice, or male Fischer-344 rats, NADH (1 mM), and NADPH (1 mM) in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and then extracted with methylene chloride. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of incubation extracts for mice, rats, and humans detected a metabolite whose elution time and mass spectrum matched that of synthetic benzene oxide. The elution time of the benzene oxide peak was approximately 4.1 min, while phenol eluted at approximately 8 min. Benzene oxide also coeluted with the HPLC peak of the previously unidentified metabolite. Based on the 14C activity of this peak, the concentration of benzene oxide was determined to be approximately 18 microM, or 7% of total benzene metabolites, after 18 min of incubation of mouse microsomes with 1 mM benzene. The metabolite was not observed in incubations using heat-inactivated microsomes. This is the first demonstration that benzene oxide is a product of hepatic benzene metabolism in vitro. The level of benzene oxide detected suggests that benzene oxide is sufficiently stable to reach significant levels in the blood of mice, rats, and humans and may be translocated to the bone marrow. Therefore benzene oxide should not be excluded as a possible metabolite involved in benzene-induced leukemogenesis.","['Lovern, M R', 'Turner, M J', 'Meyer, M', 'Kedderis, G L', 'Bechtold, W E', 'Schlosser, P M']","['Lovern MR', 'Turner MJ', 'Meyer M', 'Kedderis GL', 'Bechtold WE', 'Schlosser PM']","['Biomathematics Program, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Cyclohexanes)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'V2WDI94M5S (benzene oxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cyclohexanes/*metabolism', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Microsomes, Liver/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Species Specificity']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/18.9.1695 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1997 Sep;18(9):1695-700. doi: 10.1093/carcin/18.9.1695.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous studies have shown that butadiene and its metabolites cause sister chromatid exchanges in vitro and in vivo. To test for other types of genotoxicity, the micronucleus assay and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) have been used to detect chromosome damage in human lymphocytes caused by two reactive metabolites of butadiene, diepoxybutane (DEB) and monoepoxybutene (MEB). DEB (0.5-5.0 microM) significantly increased micronucleus formation 4- to 6-fold (P <0.01) and MEB (1-500 microM) by 2- to 4-fold (P <0.01) over control levels. The ability of DEB and MEB to induce aneuploidy of chromosomes 7, 8, 12, and X was examined using dual-color FISH in both interphase and metaphase cells. These chromosomes were chosen because of their involvement in leukemogenesis. Both DEB and MEB caused dose-dependent increases in hyperdiploidy of chromosomes 12 and X, but had no discernible effect on chromosomes 7 and 8. These results suggest that DEB and MEB cause chromosome-specific aneuploidy in human cells. If formed in sufficient amounts, DEB and MEB may produce chromosome damage of the type found in leukemia following exposure to butadiene.","['Xi, L', 'Zhang, L', 'Wang, Y', 'Smith, M T']","['Xi L', 'Zhang L', 'Wang Y', 'Smith MT']","['Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley 94720-7360, USA.']",['eng'],"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'B118-05/PHS HHS/United States', 'P42ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '478ERR5NKR (3,4-epoxy-1-butene)', '60OB65YNAB (diepoxybutane)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'JSD5FGP5VD (1,3-butadiene)']",IM,"['*Aneuploidy', 'Butadienes/metabolism', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Diploidy', 'Epoxy Compounds/*toxicity', 'Genotype', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Metaphase', '*Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective', 'Micronucleus Tests']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/18.9.1687 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1997 Sep;18(9):1687-93. doi: 10.1093/carcin/18.9.1687.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The consequences of low cellular NAD levels in a cell line deficient in nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT), an enzyme essential for NAD biosynthesis, were investigated by assessing NAD metabolism and DNA repair after treatment with alkylating agents. A tiazofurin-resistant L1210 cell line (TZR) was isolated. NAD levels were approximately 5933 and 3375 pmol mg(-1) protein for parental (wild type, WT) and TZR cells respectively, and NMNAT levels were reduced by > 95%. TZR cells were more sensitive to temozolomide (TM) and 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitroso-guanidine (MNNG), particularly at concentrations that caused > 50% NAD depletion. TM and MNNG treatment decreased NAD levels in both cell lines, but took longer to return to control levels in TZR cells. For example, MNNG (5 microM), depleted NAD levels at 6 h to approximately 4512 (WT) and 1442 (TZR) pmol mg(-1) protein; however, NAD levels had returned to control levels by 8 h in WT cells, but were not restored by 16 h in TZR cells. Both cell lines were equisensitive to the growth-inhibitory effects of NU1025 per se (IC50 370 microM). Co-exposure of the cell lines to TM (100 microM) with increasing concentrations of NU1025 led to a synergistic enhancement of cytotoxicity, with IC50 values for NU1025 decreasing to 17 +/- 4 microM (TZR) and 37 +/- 6 microM (WT). A similar enhanced sensitivity to NU1025 (approximately 2.7-fold) was obtained when TZR cells were co-exposed to MNNG + NU1025. TM-induced DNA strand breaks were increased by co-incubation with NU1025, and again the TZR cell line showed increased sensitivity to NU1025. There were no significant changes in NMNAT activity in response to MNNG treatment over 24 h, either in the presence or in the absence of NU1025. These data demonstrate that modest decreases in cellular NAD levels can sensitize cells to alkylating agents and PADPRP inhibitors.","['Boulton, S', 'Kyle, S', 'Durkacz, B W']","['Boulton S', 'Kyle S', 'Durkacz BW']","['Cancer Research Unit, Medical School, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '12H3O2UGSF (Methylnitronitrosoguanidine)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 2.7.7.1 (Nicotinamide-Nucleotide Adenylyltransferase)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'Dacarbazine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology/pathology', 'Methylnitronitrosoguanidine/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'NAD/*biosynthesis', 'Nicotinamide-Nucleotide Adenylyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Temozolomide']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1997.473 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1997;76(7):845-51. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1997.473.,,PMC2228057,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Second cancers were reported in 1406 men (observed-to-expected ratio [O/E] = 1.43; 95% confidence interval = 1.36-1.51), with statistically significant excesses noted for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (O/E = 5.20), acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (O/E = 3.07), melanoma (O/E = 1.69), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (O/E = 1.88), and cancers of the stomach (O/E = 1.95), colon (O/E = 1.27), rectum (O/E = 1.41), pancreas (O/E = 2.21), prostate (O/E = 1.26), kidney (O/E = 1.50), bladder (O/E = 2.02), thyroid (O/E = 2.92), and connective tissue (O/E = 3.16). Overall risk was similar after seminomas (O/E = 1.42) or nonseminomatous tumors (O/E = 1.50). Risk of solid tumors increased with time since the diagnosis of testicular cancer, yielding an O/E = 1.54 (O = 369) among 20-year survivors (two-sided P for trend = .00002). Secondary leukemia was associated with both radiotherapy and chemotherapy, whereas excess cancers of the stomach, bladder, and, possibly, pancreas were associated mainly with radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Men with testicular cancer continue to be at significantly elevated risk of second malignant neoplasms for more than two decades following initial diagnosis. Patterns of excess second cancers suggest that many factors may be involved, although the precise roles of treatment, natural history, diagnostic surveillance, and other influences are yet to be clarified.","['Travis, L B', 'Curtis, R E', 'Storm, H', 'Hall, P', 'Holowaty, E', 'Van Leeuwen, F E', 'Kohler, B A', 'Pukkala, E', 'Lynch, C F', 'Andersson, M', 'Bergfeldt, K', 'Clarke, E A', 'Wiklund, T', 'Stoter, G', 'Gospodarowicz, M', 'Sturgeon, J', 'Fraumeni, J F Jr', 'Boice, J D Jr']","['Travis LB', 'Curtis RE', 'Storm H', 'Hall P', 'Holowaty E', 'Van Leeuwen FE', 'Kohler BA', 'Pukkala E', 'Lynch CF', 'Andersson M', 'Bergfeldt K', 'Clarke EA', 'Wiklund T', 'Stoter G', 'Gospodarowicz M', 'Sturgeon J', 'Fraumeni JF Jr', 'Boice JD Jr']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Connective Tissue/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Rectal Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'Seminoma/therapy', 'Stomach Neoplasms/pathology', 'Survival Rate', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*therapy', 'United States', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/epidemiology']",1997/11/05 14:50,2001/03/28 10:01,['1997/11/05 14:50'],"['1997/11/05 14:50 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 14:50 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/89.19.1429 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1997 Oct 1;89(19):1429-39. doi: 10.1093/jnci/89.19.1429.,,,,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1997 Oct 1;89(19):1394-5.

In the present study the charts of the patients with onset of uveitis at 16 years of age or younger were reviewed in order to analyze the etiology in pediatric patients with uveitis, and to compare the results with other studies carried out on different populations. The charts of 90 cases, followed at the Uvea-Immunology Clinic of the Cukurova University Medical Faculty Department of Ophthalmology, between January 1987 and February 1996 were reviewed retrospectively. There were 47 girls, 43 boys, aged 5-20 (13.64 +/- 4.24) in the study group. The average age at onset of uveitis was 12.20 +/- 4.81, and the follow-up period was 9-98 months (21.80 +/- 11.13). Of the 90 patients 31 (34.4%) had panuveitis, 30 (33.3%) had anterior uveitis, 21 (23.3%) had posterior uveitis and 8 (8.9%) had intermediate uveitis. Only 2 (9.5%) of the patients with posterior uveitis were considered idiopathic after extensive laboratory and clinical work-up, whereas idiopathic cases constituted 48.4% of panuveitis, and 46.7% of anterior uveitis cases. Of the 90 patients an associated condition could be found in only 59 (65.6%) patients. Of these 59 patients 23 had toxoplasmosis (39%), which constituted the most common associated condition in this study. The second most common underlying cause was Behcet's disease (17%), followed by pars planitis (13.6%), Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis (8.5%), JRA (5.1%), leukemia (5.1%), and herpetic eye disease (5.1%). There were single cases with Reiter, toxocariasis, traumatic uveitis, and sympathetic ophthalmia. Environmental, cultural and genetic factors may be accountable for the differences in relative frequencies of some of the associated conditions between our findings and those of previously published studies in patients with pediatric uveitis.","['Soylu, M', 'Ozdemir, G', 'Anli, A']","['Soylu M', 'Ozdemir G', 'Anli A']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Cukurova University Medical Faculty Adana, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Ocul Immunol Inflamm,Ocular immunology and inflammation,9312169,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Turkey/epidemiology', 'Uveitis/*epidemiology/etiology']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/09273949709116894 [doi]'],ppublish,Ocul Immunol Inflamm. 1997 Sep;5(3):197-202. doi: 10.3109/09273949709116894.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used panhandle PCR to clone MLL genomic breakpoints in two pediatric treatment-related leukemias. The karyotype in a case of treatment-related acute lymphoblastic leukemia showed the t(4;11)(q21;q23). Panhandle PCR amplified the translocation breakpoint at position 2158 in intron 6 in the 5' MLL breakpoint cluster region (bcr). The karyotype in a case of treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia was normal, but Southern blot analysis showed a single MLL gene rearrangement. Panhandle PCR amplified the breakpoint at position 1493 in MLL intron 6. Screening of somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid DNAs by PCR and reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of the leukemic cells indicated that panhandle PCR identified a fusion of MLL intron 6 with a previously uncharacterized sequence in MLL intron 1, consistent with a partial duplication. In both cases, the breakpoints in the MLL bcr were in Alu repeats, and there were Alu repeats in proximity to the breakpoints in the partner DNAs, suggesting that Alu sequences were relevant to these rearrangements. This study shows that panhandle PCR is an effective method for cloning MLL genomic breakpoints in treatment-related leukemias. Analysis of additional pediatric cases will determine whether breakpoint distribution deviates from the predilection for 3' distribution in the bcr that has been found in adult cases.","['Megonigal, M D', 'Rappaport, E F', 'Jones, D H', 'Kim, C S', 'Nowell, P C', 'Lange, B J', 'Felix, C A']","['Megonigal MD', 'Rappaport EF', 'Jones DH', 'Kim CS', 'Nowell PC', 'Lange BJ', 'Felix CA']","[""Division of Oncology, Jr. Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104-4318, USA.""]",['eng'],"['1R29CA66140-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R25CA4009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42232/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Zinc Fingers']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.94.21.11583 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Oct 14;94(21):11583-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.94.21.11583.,,PMC23546,"['GENBANK/AF024540', 'GENBANK/AF024541', 'GENBANK/AF024542', 'GENBANK/AF024543']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that, in all cases studied, this HLA-G-mediated protection was abolished by treatment of cytotrophoblasts with an HLA-G-specific mAb. The HLA class I-negative K562 cell line transfected with the predominant HLA-G1 isoform results in similar protection and abolition from maternal uterine NK lysis.

To evaluate whether phosphatases are actively induced by a soluble factor released following injury, the effect of tissue fluids collected from porcine or human skin wounds was tested on primary cultures of endothelial cells. Phosphatase activity increased approximately 50-fold following 48-h culture in the presence of wound fluid. Inductive activity was present only in fluids collected during the inflammatory phase of wound repair. The phosphatase activity metabolized adenosine monophosphate to free phosphate and was the liver/bone/kidney alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme: activity was temperature- and levamisole-sensitive, 1-phenylalanine-resistant, and linked to the cell surface via phospholipid, and migrated at a size identical to this isozyme. interleukin-6 was identified as the phosphatase-inducing factor in wound fluid and the related cytokines, leukaemia inhibiting factor, and oncostatin M, caused a similar degree of alkaline phosphatase induction. Therefore, following injury, accumulation of interleukin-6 can lead to production by alkaline phosphatase of adenosine and subsequent protection from ischemic injury.","['Gallo, R L', 'Dorschner, R A', 'Takashima, S', 'Klagsbrun, M', 'Eriksson, E', 'Bernfield, M']","['Gallo RL', 'Dorschner RA', 'Takashima S', 'Klagsbrun M', 'Eriksson E', 'Bernfield M']","[""Department of Dermatology, Joint Program of Neonatology, Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, U.S.A.""]",['eng'],"['AR01875/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR44379/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '415SHH325A (Adenosine Monophosphate)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Monophosphate/metabolism', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Aorta/cytology/metabolism', 'Body Fluids/physiology', 'Bone and Bones/enzymology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/*enzymology', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Kidney/enzymology', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Swine', 'Wound Healing/*physiology', 'Wounds and Injuries/metabolism']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-202X(15)43031-3 [pii]', '10.1111/1523-1747.ep12337529 [doi]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 1997 Oct;109(4):597-603. doi: 10.1111/1523-1747.ep12337529.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, in a biopsy obtained from the patient 9 mo later, during disease progression (deep muscle infiltration), the lymphoma cells again contained the same VHDJH gene rearrangement (six of 18 in biopsy II) without any further somatic mutations.

We have found that this cell line produces GM-CSF in amounts up to 113 pg/ml in culture supernatants. Deprivation of endogenous GM-CSF by addition of neutralizing anti-GM-CSF antibody strongly inhibits proliferation of the cells, suggesting a GM-CSF autocrine growth mechanism. To examine whether endogenously produced GM-CSF activates intracellular GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5-related signal transduction pathways, we performed antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting of cell lysates of AML14.3D10 cells before and after deprivation of endogenous GM-CSF. We found constitutive tyrosine-phosphorylation of a number of proteins in AML14.3D10 that could not be detectably increased by the addition of exogenous GM-CSF, IL-3, or IL-5. However, GM-CSF-deprived cells demonstrated a marked increase in phosphorylation of proteins of identical molecular mass following addition of GM-CSF and IL-5, but not IL-3, consistent with the receptor expression of the cells and the known use of the same signaling pathways by the three cytokines. This suggests that AML14.3D10 cells use endogenously produced GM-CSF to activate signal transduction pathways, interfering with activation by exogenous cytokine until the endogenous stimulation is removed. We then assessed the activation of the beta-subunit common to the GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptors (beta c), JAK2 and p53/56 lyn, known to be involved in the common signaling pathways of the three cytokines. We found that phosphorylation of beta c and JAK2 in response to GM-CSF and IL-5 could be markedly enhanced by depriving cells of endogenous GM-CSF. Constitutive hyperphosphorylation of lyn was found in AML14.3D10 cells, and no further activation of lyn in response to cytokine was demonstrable in GM-CSF-deprived cells, suggesting that lyn is activated in this cell line by a mechanism other than GM-CSF. These studies represent the first demonstration of autocrine activation of intracellular cytokine signaling pathways by malignant hematopoietic cells. Because the addition of anti-GM-CSF to cell cultures improved responsiveness of intracellular signal transducing molecules to exogenous GM-CSF and IL-5, it can be inferred that endogenously produced GM-CSF exerts its effects by secretion and binding to surface GM-CSF receptors, although an intracellular component to signaling cannot be excluded. These observations provide further information regarding an autocrine contribution to leukemic cell growth, and establish a new model for study of these events.","['Paul, C C', 'Mahrer, S', 'McMannama, K', 'Baumann, M A']","['Paul CC', 'Mahrer S', 'McMannama K', 'Baumann MA']","['Research Service, VA Medical Center, Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio 45428, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Hormones)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antibodies/immunology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/immunology/*metabolism', 'Hormones/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-5/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/10/27 20:25,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/10/27 20:25'],"['1997/10/27 20:25 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/10/27 20:25 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199710)56:2<79::AID-AJH2>3.0.CO;2-Y [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199710)56:2<79::aid-ajh2>3.0.co;2-y [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1997 Oct;56(2):79-85. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199710)56:2<79::aid-ajh2>3.0.co;2-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the regulation of SGP gene expression by luciferase reporter gene assays using the lactoferrin (LF) promoter. Reporter plasmids were transiently transfected into non-LF-expressing hematopoietic cell lines. Luciferase activity was detected from reporter plasmids containing base-pair (bp) -387 to bp -726 of the LF promoter, but not in a -916-bp plasmid. Transfection of a -916-bp plasmid into a LF-expressing cell line resulted in abrogation of the silencing effect. Sequence analysis of this region revealed three eight-bp repetitive elements, the deletion of which restored wild-type levels of luciferase activity to the -916-bp reporter plasmid. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and UV cross-linking analysis identified a protein of approximately 180 kD that binds to this region in non-LF-expressing cells but not in LF-expressing cells. This protein was identified to be the CCAAT displacement protein (CDP/cut). CDP/cut has been shown to downregulate expression of gp91-phox, a gene expressed relatively early in the myeloid lineage. Our observations suggest that the binding of CDP/cut to the LF silencer element serves to suppress basal promoter activity of the LF gene in non-LF-expressing cells. Furthermore, overexpression of CDP/cut in cultured myeloid stem cells blocks LF expression upon granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-induced neutrophil maturation without blocking phenotypic maturation. This block in LF expression may be due, in part, to the persistence of CDP/cut binding to the LF silencer element.","['Khanna-Gupta, A', 'Zibello, T', 'Kolla, S', 'Neufeld, E J', 'Berliner, N']","['Khanna-Gupta A', 'Zibello T', 'Kolla S', 'Neufeld EJ', 'Berliner N']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510, USA.']",['eng'],['DK42347/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CUX1 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Humans', 'Lactoferrin/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*pharmacology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Repressor Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57991-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Oct 1;90(7):2784-95.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, 5% to 25% of patients develop retinoic acid syndrome, a potentially life-threatening complication in which the pathogenesis relates to adhesive alterations of APL cells. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between tRA-induced differentiation and the adhesive properties of APL cells. After confirming differentiation-related morphological changes of NB-4 cells in response to tRA, we showed that homotypic aggregation of NB-4 cells grown in tRA for 72 hours is dose-dependent with a median effective dose of approximately 50 nmol/L. Maximal aggregation occurred at mean and peak therapeutic serum concentrations (100 and 1,000 nmol/L, respectively). Aggregation also increased with the length of tRA exposure over 168 hours. Aggregation was inhibited by neutralizing antibodies against LFA-1 and ICAM-2. Notably, antibodies directed against VLA-4, other beta2 integrins (Mac-1 and p150), or other potential LFA-1 counterstructures that were expressed on the cell surface (ICAM-1 and ICAM-3) did not block aggregation. Aggregation occurred with similar kinetics regardless of the presence of phorbol ester or the ""activating"" monoclonal antibody (MoAb) KIM 185, suggesting that the avidity of LFA-1 is not modulated on NB-4 cells in a manner similar to other leukocytes. Consistent with the prompt clinical effectiveness of methyl prednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) in retinoic acid syndrome, MPSS rapidly inhibited homotypic aggregation in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, tRA alters the adhesive properties of APL cells by inducing the expression of high-avidity beta2 integrins, aggregation is inhibited by LFA-1 and ICAM-2 MoAb, and tRA effects are rapidly reversible by MPSS. Taken together, our findings provide a clinically relevant system for study of LFA-1/ICAM-2 interaction and suggest a mechanism in part for retinoic acid syndrome and the effectiveness of MPSS in ameliorating retinoic acid syndrome.","['Larson, R S', 'Brown, D C', 'Sklar, L A']","['Larson RS', 'Brown DC', 'Sklar LA']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Cancer Center, Albuquerque 87131-5636, USA.']",['eng'],"['GM 37696/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'PAR-96-012/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (ICAM2 protein, human)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '5GMR90S4KN (Methylprednisolone Hemisuccinate)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/*physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/immunology/*physiology', 'Cell Aggregation/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Edetic Acid/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/physiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/immunology/*physiology', 'Methylprednisolone Hemisuccinate/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57987-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Oct 1;90(7):2747-56.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The SpSp MPO genotype is shown to correlate with increased MPO mRNA levels in primary myeloid leukemia cells.

The objective of this report is to determine the relation between in vitro resistance to 12 drugs, measured with the colorimetric methyl-thiazol-tetrazolium (MTT) assay, and long-term clinical response to chemotherapy in 152 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. At risk-group stratified analyses, in vitro resistance to prednisolone, L-asparaginase, and vincristine were each significantly (P < .01) related to the probability of disease-free survival (pDFS) after combination chemotherapy. The combination of data for prednisolone, L-asparaginase, and vincristine provided a drug-resistance profile with prognostic independent significance superior to that of any single drug or any other factor. The 3-years pDFS was 100% for the group with the most sensitive profile, 20% of all patients, 84% (SE 6%) for the group with an intermediately sensitive profile, 40% of all patients, and 43% (SE 8%) for the remaining group with the most resistant profile (P < .001). In conclusion, the extent of in vitro cellular resistance to prednisolone, L-asparaginase, and vincristine, measured using the MTT assay, was significantly related to the clinical response to combination chemotherapy.

Production of IL-2 requires the formation of transcription factors involved in the IL-2-gene regulation. T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 engagement results in the activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), activator protein-1 (AP-1), and nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB), whereas the CD28 responsive complex (CD28RC) is activated in response to the CD28 signal. Costimulation of phytohemagglutinin/anti-CD28 activated T lymphocytes with IL-7 induces a fivefold enhanced IL-2-mRNA accumulation and a 2.5-fold enhanced protein secretion. The IL-2-gene transcription rate is increased 3.4-fold, indicating that the effect of IL-7 is in part mediated at the transcriptional level. The molecular mechanisms underlying the IL-7 effect involve the upregulation of the DNA binding activity of NFAT (60%) and AP-1 (120%), without affecting the activities of NFkappaB and CD28RC, which was confirmed by transfection assays. We also show that the IL-7-induced enhancement of the AP-1-DNA binding activity is not cyclosporin A-sensitive. Since AP-1 is part of the NFAT complex, we conclude that the IL-7-signaling pathway is involved in the activation of the fos and jun proteins of which AP-1 consists.","['Gringhuis, S I', 'de Leij, L F', 'Verschuren, E W', 'Borger, P', 'Vellenga, E']","['Gringhuis SI', 'de Leij LF', 'Verschuren EW', 'Borger P', 'Vellenga E']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'CD28 Antigens/immunology/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-7/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57981-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Oct 1;90(7):2690-700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initial studies indicated it may be an important regulator of human myelopoiesis. To elucidate the range of expression of C/EBP epsilon, we used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis and examined its expression in 28 hematopoietic and 14 nonhematopoietic cell lines, 16 fresh myeloid leukemia samples, and normal human hematopoietic stem cells and their mature progeny. Prominent expression of C/EBP epsilon mRNA occurred in the late myeloblastic and promyelocytic cell lines (NB4, HL60, GFD8), the myelomonoblastic cell lines (U937 and THP-1), the early myeloblast cell lines (ML1, KCL22, MDS92), and the T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines CEM and HSB-2. For the acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4, C/EBP epsilon was the only C/EBP family member that was easily detected by RT-PCR. No C/EBP epsilon mRNA was found in erythroid, megakaryocyte, basophil, B lymphoid, or nonhematopoietic cell lines. Most acute myeloid leukemia samples (11 of 12) from patients expressed C/EBP epsilon. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses showed that C/EBP epsilon mRNA decreased when the HL60 and KG-1 myeloblast cell lines were induced to differentiate toward macrophages. Similarly, Western blot analysis showed that expression of C/EBP epsilon protein was either unchanged or decreased slightly as the promyelocytic cell line NB4 differentiated down the macrophage-like pathway after treatment with a potent vitamin D3 analog (KH1060). In contrast, C/EBP epsilon protein levels increased dramatically as NB4 cells were induced to differentiate down the granulocytic pathway after exposure to 9-cis retinoic acid. Furthermore, very early, normal hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+/CD38-), purified from humans had very weak expression of C/EBP epsilon mRNA, but levels increased as these cells differentiated towards granulocytes. Likewise, purified granulocytes appeared to express higher levels of C/EBP epsilon mRNA than purified macrophages. Addition of phosphothiolated antisense, but not sense oligonucleotides to C/EBP epsilon, decreased clonal growth of HL-60 and NB4 cells by about 50% compared with control cultures. Taken together, our results indicate that expression of C/EBP epsilon is restricted to hematopoietic tissues, especially myeloid cells as they differentiate towards granulocytes and inhibition of its expression in HL-60 and NB4 myeloblasts and promyelocytes decreased their proliferative capacity. Therefore, this transcriptional factor may play an important role in the process of normal myeloid development.","['Morosetti, R', 'Park, D J', 'Chumakov, A M', 'Grillier, I', 'Shiohara, M', 'Gombart, A F', 'Nakamaki, T', 'Weinberg, K', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Morosetti R', 'Park DJ', 'Chumakov AM', 'Grillier I', 'Shiohara M', 'Gombart AF', 'Nakamaki T', 'Weinberg K', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center/UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '131875-08-6 (KH 1060)', '1UA8E65KDZ (Alitretinoin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Alitretinoin', 'Blotting, Western', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Calcitriol/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57970-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Oct 1;90(7):2591-600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it remains unknown whether these two pathways cooperate in the generation of IFN-alpha responses or function independently, and whether IRS-proteins transduce distinct downstream signals in response to IFNs or insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1-mediated activation. Our data show that in response to IFN-alpha treatment, IRS-1 functions selectively as a docking protein for the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of the PI 3'-kinase, but not the SH2 domain of Grb-2 which is engaged during insulin/IGF-1 signaling. In studies with THP-1 human myelomonocytic cells and 32D mouse myeloid cells, which are IRS-defective, we found that the IFN-alpha-regulated activation of Stat-1, Stat-2, and Stat-3 does not require the function of the IRS-system. Furthermore, THP-1 cells are responsive to the protective effect of IFN-alpha against vesicular stomatitis virus. Both 32D and THP-1 cells were resistant to the growth inhibitory effect of IFN-alpha, but this effect was not reversible by expression of IRS-1 or IRS-2 alone in 32D cells. Taken altogether these data show that: (1) The IRS-system transduces common and distinct signals in response to IFN-alpha or insulin/lGF-1 stimulation of hematopoietic cells. (2) The IRS-pathway operates separately from the Stat-pathway, and its function is not essential for the generation of the antiviral effect of IFN-alpha. (3) Neither the IRS- nor the Stat-pathways alone are sufficient to mediate the antiproliferative effects of IFN-alpha in hematopoietic cells, and additional signaling elements are required.","['Uddin, S', 'Fish, E N', 'Sher, D', 'Gardziola, C', 'Colamonici, O R', 'Kellum, M', 'Pitha, P M', 'White, M F', 'Platanias, L C']","['Uddin S', 'Fish EN', 'Sher D', 'Gardziola C', 'Colamonici OR', 'Kellum M', 'Pitha PM', 'White MF', 'Platanias LC']","['Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago and West Side Veterans Affairs Hospital, 60607-7173, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA73381/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK38712/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK43808/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IRS1 protein, human)', '0 (IRS2 protein, human)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Irs1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Irs2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT2 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '156986-95-7 (Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Insulin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Insulin/pharmacology', 'Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/pharmacology', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Phosphoproteins/*physiology', 'Receptor, Insulin/drug effects/*physiology', 'Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta', 'Receptors, Interferon/drug effects/*physiology', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT2 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'src Homology Domains']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57968-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Oct 1;90(7):2574-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With this information, culture conditions that were known to support normal long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) were tested, with or without supplements of one or more of these three growth factors, for their ability to support primitive progenitors from 10 cell samples from patients with AML. In all cases cytogenetically abnormal colony forming cells (CFC) were detected after 5 weeks when AML peripheral blood or marrow cells were cocultured on preestablished, normal human marrow feeders (HMF) and/or SI/SI mouse fibroblast feeders and the number of CFC detected in these 5-week-old LTC maintained a linear relationship to the number of input AML cells. Limiting dilution analysis, performed on 6 of the 10 samples, showed the frequency of AML cells initiating LTC (AML LTC-IC) to be 5- to 300-fold lower than the frequency of AML-CFC in the same cell sample, whereas the average number of CFC produced per LTC-IC varied from 1 to 13. Surprisingly, in each case the concentration of cytogenetically normal LTC-IC detected in AML patient blood was at least 10-fold higher than that previously observed in the blood of normal individuals. ""Mixed"" mouse fibroblast feeders engineered to produce human G-CSF, IL-3, and SF did not enhance detection of AML LTC-IC but did increase the output of cytogenetically normal CFC from LTC of 3 of 4 patient samples.

These studies show that conditions that support normal LTC-IC also allow a functionally analogous but rare AML progenitor cell type to be detected. In addition, differences in the responses of normal and leukemic cells to various cytokines active on normal LTC-IC were revealed.

There were eight men and six women, median age, 33 years. Twelve patients received marrow from a related allogeneic donor and two received marrow from a syngeneic donor. The median percentage of Ph-positive metaphases at the time of starting interferon was 55% (10% to 87%). Daily interferon was started at a dose of 1 to 3 x 10(6) U/M2/d, depending on initial blood counts and was adjusted as tolerated to maintain the white blood count in the range of 2,000 to 3,000/microL and the platelet count greater than 60,000/microL. After a stable cytogenetic remission was achieved, the interferon dose was decreased to a maintenance level. Twelve patients achieved a complete cytogenetic remission on at least one occasion. Median time to achieve a complete cytogenetic remission was 7.5 months (range, 1.5 to 12). Eight patients remain in cytogenetic remission for 10+ to 54+ months from the time of first documented remission. After complete cytogenetic remission was established, nine patients were tested for the presence of the mRNA transcript of the bcr/abl fusion gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Four patients were PCR-negative on at least one occasion: two patients were PCR-negative on a single occasion; one patient had serial tests, which were PCR-negative; and one patient had serial PCR-negative peripheral blood tests with a single PCR-positive bone marrow obtained concurrently with a negative peripheral blood test. Median follow-up time for all patients is 44 months (range, 20 to 64). Interferon was generally well tolerated; only one responding patient was unable to continue interferon because of toxicity. Interferon induces durable cytogenetic remissions in a significant proportion (57%) of patients with cytogenetic relapse following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) without causing life-threatening toxicities.","['Higano, C S', 'Chielens, D', 'Raskind, W', 'Bryant, E', 'Flowers, M E', 'Radich, J', 'Clift, R', 'Appelbaum, F']","['Higano CS', 'Chielens D', 'Raskind W', 'Bryant E', 'Flowers ME', 'Radich J', 'Clift R', 'Appelbaum F']","['Division of Oncology, University of Washington and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA16448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/drug therapy/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Platelet Count', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57965-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Oct 1;90(7):2549-54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The leukaemic cell lines K562, U937 and KG-1 were used as models of human leukaemia as they exhibit differential sensitivity to cell-mediated or TNF-mediated cytotoxicity. Monocyte tumouricidal activity was augmented by rhGM-CSF or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) alone in vitro against leukaemic blasts, whereas granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) was without effect. rhGM-CSF and LPS exhibited an additive effect in stimulating the cytotoxic effect of monocytes against K562 blasts compared with either agent alone (P < 0.001). Both cell-mediated and soluble TNF-mediated killing of leukaemic blasts was augmented by rhGM-CSF administration to patients following chemotherapy. This effect persisted for up to 4 weeks after cessation of GM-CSF therapy. The administration of rhGM-CSF significantly increased the anti-leukaemic activity of monocytes against leukaemic targets that were resistant to secreted TNF, probably via a transmembrane TNF-dependent mechanism. Therapy with rhG-CSF exhibited a minimal effect. We conclude that administration of rhGM-CSF, but not rhG-CSF, augments the tumouricidal properties of the monocyte-macrophage system, particularly during recovery from myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Moreover, the killing mechanism is direct and not mediated by an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic (ADCC) mechanism. Killing of TNF-resistant leukaemic cells in particular may be augmented via cell-to-cell contact.","['Williams, M A', 'Newland, A C', 'Kelsey, S M']","['Williams MA', 'Newland AC', 'Kelsey SM']","[""Department of Haematology, St Bartholomew's and The Royal London Hospitals School of Medicine and Dentistry.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes, Activated Killer/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.2923108.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Sep;98(4):960-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.2923108.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA synthesis was maximally inhibited after 48 h exposure to DT-GM-CSF. Cell viability and AML colony forming ability in vitro were reduced. 18/22 samples were found to be sensitive to DT-GM-CSF, with 50% inhibition of DNA synthesis (ID50) at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 16 ng/ml, and four samples were minimally or not sensitive to DT-GM-CSF (ID50 > or = 99 ng/ml). From the 15 samples which showed autonomous proliferation, 13 were sensitive to inhibition of proliferation by DT-GM-CSF. The level of GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFR) expression was determined by flow cytometry after labelling with specific antibodies for the alpha and beta subunits. Although the toxicity to DT-GM-CSF was specifically mediated by the GM-CSFR, no correlation was found between the level of expression of the GM-CSFR alpha or beta subunit and the sensitivity for DT-GM-CSF. These in vitro studies show that the DT-GM-CSF fusion protein can be used for specifically targeting and eliminating leukaemic cells in the majority of AML cases.","['Rozemuller, H', 'Rombouts, E J', 'Touw, I P', 'FitzGerald, D J', 'Kreitman, R J', 'Pastan, I', 'Hagenbeek, A', 'Martens, A C']","['Rozemuller H', 'Rombouts EJ', 'Touw IP', 'FitzGerald DJ', 'Kreitman RJ', 'Pastan I', 'Hagenbeek A', 'Martens AC']","['Institute of Haematology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Division', 'Diphtheria Toxin/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/*therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.2893106.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Sep;98(4):952-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.2893106.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A simple polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test for monoclonality showed that immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangements of the same size were present at the times of both hypoplasia and leukaemia, and DNA sequencing confirmed identity of these rearrangements. PCR-based quantification, using patient-specific primers, showed in both patients that the leukaemic clone made up 20-25% of the marrow cells during hypoplasia. In contrast, four patients with typical aplastic anaemia showed only polyclonal B-cell populations in the marrow.

Normal human CD34+ haemopoietic progenitors and blasts from patients with acute myeloblastic, but not lymphoblastic, leukaemia responded to NIH44-1. All CD44 antibodies tested which bound the same epitope as NIH44-1 also augmented haemopoietic cell adhesion to bone marrow adherent layers; however, antibodies which bound to other CD44 epitopes showed mixed responses. Augmented adhesion was independent of cell metabolism, suggesting that antibody binding resulted in direct activation of the CD44 molecule. However, hyaluronic acid was not the ligand for induced adhesion, nor could we show a role for other CD44 ligands including fibronectin, laminin, collagen or chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan. Similarly, none of the 22 CD44 antibodies tested inhibited the stimulatory effect of the NIH44-1. Expression of CD44 was not sufficient to determine NIH44-1 responsiveness since cell lines and leukaemic cells which failed to respond to NIH44-1 expressed high levels of CD44.

A case report and a review of the literature.,256-9,"A 26-year-old man, affected by acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, received a bone marrow transplantation from his HLA identical sister. A mild (grade 1) acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) developed during the first month after BMT. A moderate (grade 2) muco-cutaneous GVHD was present from the 4th month on, in association with recurrent oral herpes simplex infection. A typical clinical and electromyographic picture of myasthenia gravis (MG) developed 46 months after BMT, requiring continuous medication with pyridostigmine. A high titer of antibiotics against the acetylcholine receptor was found in the serum of the patient but not in the serum of the donor. Since the donor had no evidence of MG or other autoimmune disorders, this is likely to be an autoimmune complication of chronic GVHD. Other cases described in the literature are reviewed: a recurrent expression or coexpression of some HLA antigens was recorded, indicating that some genetic factors could predispose to this acquired disorder.","['Zaja, F', 'Barillari, G', 'Russo, D', 'Silvestri, F', 'Fanin, R', 'Baccarani, M']","['Zaja F', 'Barillari G', 'Russo D', 'Silvestri F', 'Fanin R', 'Baccarani M']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Denmark,Acta Neurol Scand,Acta neurologica Scandinavica,0370336,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Cholinergic)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Autoantibodies/blood', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Electromyography', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Living Donors', 'Male', 'Myasthenia Gravis/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Receptors, Cholinergic/immunology', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Neurol Scand. 1997 Oct;96(4):256-9.,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific activity of Lyn at the basal state was decreased in Csk-expressing cells, and further decreased in mCsk-expressing cells. In mCsk(-)-expressing cells, basal specific activity of Lyn was increased, thereby indicating that mCsk(-) functioned as a dominant negative molecule. The onset of FcepsilonRI-mediated Lyn activation was delayed in Csk-expressing cells, and further delayed in mCsk-expressing cells. In mCsk(-)-expressing cells, Lyn activation was rapid and quite long lasting. These findings indicate (i) Csk negatively regulates rapid FcepsilonRI/Lyn coupling, and (ii) Csk activity is potentially required for its termination. The onsets of the series of events including tyrosyl phosphorylation of Syk, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation, elevation of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), and histamine release were all stepwisely delayed in Csk-expressing cells and in mCsk-expressing cells. The durations of Syk phosphorylation and MAP kinase activation also closely correlated with those of Lyn activation, but [Ca2+]i elevation and histamine release followed different temporal patterns: the delayed responses in Csk-expressing cells and in mCsk-expressing cells led to sustained [Ca2+]i oscillation and histamine release, while the prompt responses in parent cells and mCsk(-)-expressing cells rapidly subsided. These findings provide further evidence that the initiations of the FcepsilonRI-mediated signals are upstreamly regulated by Src family protein tyrosine kinases and revealed that their terminations are regulated by Lyn-dependent (Syk and MAP kinase) and -independent ([Ca2+]i elevation and histamine release) mechanisms.","['Honda, Z i', 'Suzuki, T', 'Hirose, N', 'Aihara, M', 'Shimizu, T', 'Nada, S', 'Okada, M', 'Ra, C', 'Morita, Y', 'Ito, K']","['Honda Zi', 'Suzuki T', 'Hirose N', 'Aihara M', 'Shimizu T', 'Nada S', 'Okada M', 'Ra C', 'Morita Y', 'Ito K']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, 7-3-1, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113, Japan. honda-phy@h.u-tokyo.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (CSK Tyrosine-Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'CSK Tyrosine-Protein Kinase', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Kinetics', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.41.25753 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)60171-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Oct 10;272(41):25753-60. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.41.25753.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While genetically encoding for an envelope-derived immunodominant CTL epitope [KSPWFTTL] located in the transmembrane region of p15TM, this virus, unlike the emv-11-derived virus AKR623, fails to be efficiently recognized by AKR/Gross MuLV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes [CTL]. AK7 thus provides the opportunity to study the role of retroviral sequence variations that are located outside of the immunodominant epitope as a mechanism of escape from CTL-mediated immune surveillance. In an attempt to identify which region[s] of the AK7 genome could account for its ability to evade efficient recognition by AKR/Gross MuLV-specific CTL, we have constructed recombinant murine retroviruses. The direct influence of a sequence variation twelve amino acids N-terminal to KSPWFTTL was explored with the use of chimeric viruses and determined not to significantly impair the presentation of KSPWFTTL to AKR/Gross MuLV-specific CTL. The long terminal repeat [LTR] derived from the AK7 virus, which possesses only one copy of the 99-base pair transcriptional enhancer in the U3 region, in contrast to AKR623 that possesses two copies of the tandem direct repeat enhancers, was also analyzed for its influence on the presentation of KSPWFTTL. Interestingly, our data indicate that the enhancer region derived from AK7 negatively influences the presentation of KSPWFTTL in the context of a recombinant AKR623 virus.","['Kim, V', 'Green, W R']","['Kim V', 'Green WR']","['Department of Microbiology, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA.']",['eng'],"['AI-07363/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-69525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/genetics/immunology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigen Presentation', '*Antigenic Variation', 'Antigens, Viral/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/immunology']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(97)98747-X [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1997.8747 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1997 Sep 29;236(2):221-33. doi: 10.1006/viro.1997.8747.,,,['GENBANK/AF019257'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, casein zymography confirmed the presence of serine proteases in the form of pro-urokinase. Activation of proMMP-9 was dependent on the plasminogen activator/plasmin (PA/plasmin) system and was inhibited by aprotinin. MMP-9 was only detected in cellular extracts or conditioned media incubated with HL-60 cells, indicating that cells are essential to the activation process. Addition of plasminogen increased by 3-fold the basal invasive rate of these cells across a matrigel layer (2.1% versus 0.7% in control cells after 4 h of incubation).

In the M1 myeloleukemic cell line, Stat3 is a critical transcription factor causing repression of c-myc and c-myb genes, expression of junB and IRF1, growth arrest at G1, and subsequent macrophage differentiation. To understand the mechanisms by which Stat3 causes such effects, we searched for other Stat3-regulated genes possibly involved in growth arrest. We identified this inducible molecule as p19INK4D using a specific antibody. Both p19INK4D mRNA and protein were rapidly induced by IL-6 treatment without requiring de novo protein synthesis and the induction was fully suppressed by dominant-negative forms of Stat3. Thus both Stat3-regulated events, repressions of c-myc and c-myb and induction of p19INK4D, are likely to be involved in IL-6-induced growth arrest in M1 cells.","['Narimatsu, M', 'Nakajima, K', 'Ichiba, M', 'Hirano, T']","['Narimatsu M', 'Nakajima K', 'Ichiba M', 'Hirano T']","['Department of Oncology, Biomedical Research Center, Osaka University Medical School, Suita, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cdkn2d protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p19)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk4 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4', '*Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p19', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*physiology', '*Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/10/23 00:00,1997/10/23 00:01,['1997/10/23 00:00'],"['1997/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(97)97387-3 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1997.7387 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1997 Sep 29;238(3):764-8. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1997.7387.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that at the concentrations above 12.5 microg/ml (20 microM) cotylenin A induced the functional and morphological differentiation in murine (M1) and human myeloid leukemia (HL-60) cells. Although cotylenin A has some similarity to PMA both in carbotricyclic diterpene structure and in biological activity (i.e. differentiation-induction of HL-60 cells into macrophages), the activation of PKC and the elevation of Ca2+-levels by cotylenin A were not observed. Quite recently it has been reported that fusicoccin (closely related to cotylenin A)-targets are 14-3-3 proteins, which are at the crosspoint of a huge array of signalling and regulatory pathways.

After start of chemotherapy, the ex-vivo LPS-stimulated production of cytokines in whole blood decreased and subsequently disappeared completely in all patients, and recovered after the end of treatment. The decrease of cytokine production could not be attributed to the decreased number of cells only, as the net production per circulating neutrophil or monocyte also decreased significantly, and was restored after completion of chemotherapy.

In the present study we show that CT-1 binds to the KB epidermoid cancer cell surface through a tripartite receptor complex which includes the gp130 signal transducing protein, LIF receptor beta (LIFR beta) and a third component displaying a molecular weight of 80 kDa. CT-1 activates gp130 and LIFR beta transducing components, as attested by analysing their tyrosine phosphorylation level. The activation process is relayed to the nucleus by the recruitment of the STAT3 transcription factor. Analysis of KB cell line culture supernatants after CT-1 treatment indicates that CT-1 stimulates the production of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This stimulation of IL-6 production by CT-1 is associated with an increase in intracellular levels of IL-6 mRNA. This study suggests that at least in some pathological situations CT-1 might represent an immunomodulator regulating cytokine-induced gene products.","['Robledo, O', 'Chevalier, S', 'Froger, J', 'Barthelaix-Pouplard, A', 'Pennica, D', 'Gascan, H']","['Robledo O', 'Chevalier S', 'Froger J', 'Barthelaix-Pouplard A', 'Pennica D', 'Gascan H']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire, CHU Angers, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-4666(97)90220-9 [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.1997.0220 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1997 Sep;9(9):666-71. doi: 10.1006/cyto.1997.0220.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TF-1 cells grew well in the presence of any one of the cytokines in early passages. However, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation was minimal in response to IL-5, and detection of a tyrosine phosphorylation signal required high concentrations of IL-5. When grown for longer periods of time in the presence of one of the cytokines, there were dramatic difference in the cells' responses. IL-3 or GM-CSF-grown cells showed only half of the original bioassay response to IL-5. However, cells grown in IL-5 alone kept the same response, and all cells showed the same response to IL-3 and GM-CSF. IL-5-grown cells also had an increased tyrosine phosphorylation signal, along with increased sensitivity to IL-5, yet there was no difference in an IL-5 bioassay. The relative level of detection of tyrosine phosphorylated JAK-2, STAT-5, SHC, and other substrates corresponded to the overall tyrosine phosphorylation signal. IL-5-grown cells had approximately 10-fold more IL-5 receptor alpha subunit message compared to IL-3-grown. These results suggest that response of TF-1 cells to IL-5 may be deceiving in that a good response in a bioassay can be observed with relatively little tyrosine phosphorylation, but an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation can be correlated with an increase in the expression of IL-5 receptor alpha subunit.","['Ettinger, S', 'Fong, D', 'Duronio, V']","['Ettinger S', 'Fong D', 'Duronio V']","['Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Jack Bell Research Centre, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-5)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-5/*pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', '*Milk Proteins', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*drug effects/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Interleukin/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-5', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transfection']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-4666(97)90213-1 [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.1997.0213 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1997 Sep;9(9):650-9. doi: 10.1006/cyto.1997.0213.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) induce macrophage differentiation and growth arrest through activation of the Janus kinase (Jak)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) signal pathway in murine M1 myeloid leukaemia cells. Treatment of various other myeloid leukaemia lines with LIF or IL-6 did not lead to induction of differentiation. Several defects in the cytokine triggered Jak/Stat signal pathway were striking in these lines. They expressed a decreased or undetectable amount of at least one of the components of the specific cytokine receptor complexes. Three lines contained a constitutively activated Jak/Stat signal cascade and in two of them, lines C and BMC-63, this cascade was inducible by treatment with IL-6, despite of a very low density of IL-6-receptors. Apart from the cytokine receptors, additional components of the Jak/Stat signal cascade were altered in these lines. Expression and activation of the transcription factor Stat5a and the tyrosine kinase Jak2 were markedly decreased compared to M1 cells, suggesting a role of activated Stat5a in the induction of differentiation. These results demonstrate a direct correlation between alterations in the Jak/Stat signal pathway and the inability to differentiate after cytokine treatment of myeloid leukaemia cells.","['Piekorz, R P', 'Hocke, G M']","['Piekorz RP', 'Hocke GM']","['Institute for Microbiology, Biochemistry and Genetics, University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat5a protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-4666(97)90221-0 [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.1997.0221 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1997 Sep;9(9):639-49. doi: 10.1006/cyto.1997.0221.,,,,,,,,"['Cytokine 1998 Jan;10(1):73', 'Cytokine 1998 Mar;10(3):240']",,,,,,,

G., and Gitler, C. (1993) Anal. Biochem. 212, 325-334). Redox dithiol to intraprotein disulfide conversion could regulate the cellular function of these proteins. A general method is presented to identify and enrich vicinal thiol proteins existing in cells in their oxidized, disulfide state. The method is based on the in situ blockage by cell permeable N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) of readily accessible cellular protein sulfhydryls. Following removal of the excess NEM, disulfide-containing proteins were identified by reduction with DTT and specific labeling with N-iodoacetyl-[125I]-3-iodotyrosine. The vicinal thiol proteins formed could also be enriched, prior to labeling with [125I]IAIT, by their selective binding to Sepha-rose-aminohexanoyl-4-aminophenylarsine oxide. Exponentially growing L1210 lymphoblasts contain more than 20 proteins with thiols in the oxidized, disulfide state. The majority derive from vicinal thiol proteins. The fraction oxidized, in some proteins, represents almost the totality of the protein present in the cell. Exposure of lymphoblasts to diamide increases the number and concentration of proteins with intraprotein disulfides. This method allows sensitive direct identification of vicinal thiol proteins that participate in redox regulation and those that are targets to oxidative stress conditions.","['Gitler, C', 'Zarmi, B', 'Kalef, E']","['Gitler C', 'Zarmi B', 'Kalef E']","['Department of Membrane Research and Biophysics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel. bmgitler@weizmann.weizmann.ac.il']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,"['0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '10465-78-8 (Diamide)', '150956-52-8 (N-iodoacetyl-3-iodotyrosine)', 'FRQ98U4U27 (Monoiodotyrosine)', 'O3C74ACM9V (Ethylmaleimide)', 'T8ID5YZU6Y (Dithiothreitol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biochemistry/*methods', 'Cell Extracts', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Diamide/pharmacology', 'Disulfides/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Dithiothreitol/chemistry', 'Ethylmaleimide/chemistry', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Monoiodotyrosine/analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-2697(97)92294-6 [pii]', '10.1006/abio.1997.2294 [doi]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 1997 Oct 1;252(1):48-55. doi: 10.1006/abio.1997.2294.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They mostly present as fever of unknown origin (FUO), a smaller but prognostically unfavorable group are pneumonias. The effective management of infectious complications requires a symptom and response adapted interventional strategy. THERAPEUTICAL APPROACH: In case of FUO standard therapy consists of the two drug combination of aminoglycoside plus acylaminopenicillin or third generation cephalosporine. In case of non-response carbapenems and a glycopeptide should be applied and a systemic antifungal treatment must be initiated. In pneumonia amphotericin B should be added to antibiotics already initially. Potent single agents with a broad spectrum of activity as well as new antifungal drugs provide attractive perspectives for future evaluations.

In this study, main characteristics and results of HPCT along 20 years are analyzed from the experience of Postgraduate School of Hematology ""Farreras-Valenti"" at the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six-hundred ninety-five patients transplanted between June 1976 and January 1996 were analyzed. Median age (range) were 33 (4-63) years. The following aspects were considered: donor type, source or progenitor cells, type of disease and disease-stage at transplantation, transplant related mortality and survival. RESULTS: A total of 714 HPCT were performed (448 allogeneic, 13 isogeneic, 253 autogeneic). Allogeneic HPCT were from an HLA-identical sibling in 408 cases, from other familial donors in 10, and from non-familial donors in 30. Most HPCT from non-familial donors (93%) were performed during the last five years of the study (1991-1995). The source of hemopoietic progenitor cells was bone marrow in 625 instances (88%), peripheral blood in 88 (12%), and fetal liver in one. During more than 15 years, the only source of progenitors was the bone marrow; in contrast, in the last 3 years (1993-1995) transplants using peripheral blood were predominant. Main indications for HPCT were the following: acute leukemias (n = 387) (54%), chronic leukemias (n = 134) (19%), severe aplastic anemia (n = 58) (8%), lymphomas (n = 80) (11%), multiple myeloma (n = 39) (5%) and myelodysplastic syndromes (n = 14) (2%). In patients with hematological malignancies (n = 656), HPCT was performed in first complete remission or in first chronic phase in 321 instances (49%), in subsequent remissions in 144 (22%), and in more advanced stages in the remaining 191 (29%). In the more recent years, a progressive decrease in the number of HPCT for acute leukemia or aplastic anemia was observed, contrasting with an increase in transplants for lymphoma, multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndromes. Of note, a significant decrease in transplant related mortality was evident along the years, both after autogeneic HPCT (21% during 1985-1992 and 6% thereafter) (p = 0.001) and after allogeneic transplantation (54%, 44%, and 20% during the periods 1976-1984, 1985-1992 and 1993-1995, respectively) (p = 0.004). The fact translated into an increase in the actuarial probability of survival after allogeneic HPCT (25%, 33% and 58% in the three mentioned periods, respectively) (p = 0.0003), and after autogeneic HPCT (33% in the interim 1985-1992, and 55% in the period 1993-1995) (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: During the last 20 years, HPCT has significantly evolved in aspects such as type of donor, source of progenitor cells and indications. Remarkably, a progressive decrease in transplant related mortality has been observed translating into a improvement in survival after the procedure.","['Rozman, C', 'Carreras, E', 'Sierra, J', 'Rovira, M', 'Urbano-Ispizua, A', 'Marin, P', 'Blade, J', 'Cervantes, F', 'Lopez-Guillermo, A', 'Nomdedeu, B', 'Rozman, M', 'Aguilar, J L', 'Vives-Corrons, J L', 'Mazzara, R', 'Ordinas, A', 'Ribera, J M', 'Feliu, E', 'Castillo, R', 'Granena, A', 'Montserrat, E']","['Rozman C', 'Carreras E', 'Sierra J', 'Rovira M', 'Urbano-Ispizua A', 'Marin P', 'Blade J', 'Cervantes F', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Nomdedeu B', 'Rozman M', 'Aguilar JL', 'Vives-Corrons JL', 'Mazzara R', 'Ordinas A', 'Ribera JM', 'Feliu E', 'Castillo R', 'Granena A', 'Montserrat E']","['Servicio de Hematologia Clinica, Escuela de Hematologia Farreras-Valenti Hospital Clinic, Barcelona.']",['spa'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Spain', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",1997/05/10 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/05/10 00:00'],"['1997/05/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1997 May 10;108(18):681-6.,,,,,,,,,"Trasplante de progenitores hemopoyeticos: 20 anos de experiencia en la Escuela de Hematologia ""Farreras-Valenti""/Hospital Clinic de Barcelona.",,,,,,

The usefulness of a bone marrow biopsy, in addition to an aspirate, has been a frequently asked question. PROCEDURE: This study addresses the evaluation of bone marrow cellularity and presence of residual leukemia in both aspirate and biopsy specimens in 45 consecutive pediatric patients (ages 1-19 years, 19 females, and 26 males) with ALL 7-14 days after initiation of therapy. DISCUSSION: 20/45 patients showed evidence of residual leukemia by bone marrow biopsy; 16/20 (80%) of these had evidence of residual leukemia in the aspirate specimen. Of the 4 aspirate specimens that did not demonstrate residual leukemia, 2 had <5% blasts and 2 had too few cells in the aspirate for evaluation. Of the 25/45 bone marrow biopsy specimens with no detectable residual leukemia, 14 of the aspirates had <5% blasts, and 11 had too few cells in the aspirate for evaluation. 13/45 (29%) of the aspirates had too few cells for a differential count. The bone marrow cellularity judged from the aspirate specimen was considered to be low (0-1+) in 34/45 patients. Of these 34 patients, the bone marrow biopsy showed hypocellularity (<20% cellularity) in 12/34, moderate cellularity (20-79% cellularity) in 14/34, and hypercellularity (>79% cellularity) in 8/34. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that both the bone marrow aspirate and biopsy specimens provide important information in evaluating the response to chemotherapy in pediatric patients with ALL at day 7-14 of induction chemotherapy. The aspirate alone may be misleading in terms of cellularity in many patients and may not provide evidence of residual leukemia.","['Kidd, P G', 'Saminathan, T', 'Drachtman, R A', 'Ettinger, L J']","['Kidd PG', 'Saminathan T', 'Drachtman RA', 'Ettinger LJ']","['Department of Pathology, UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ 08903, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*pathology']",1997/10/23 22:17,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/10/23 22:17'],"['1997/10/23 22:17 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/10/23 22:17 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199712)29:6<541::AID-MPO4>3.0.CO;2-K [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199712)29:6<541::aid-mpo4>3.0.co;2-k [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1997 Dec;29(6):541-3. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199712)29:6<541::aid-mpo4>3.0.co;2-k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major cause of treatment failure is relapse. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 96 children with ALL who relapsed in the marrow while on or within 1 year of completing initial therapy, 62 achieved a second remission. Nineteen patients underwent bone marrow transplantation in second remission, 11 from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related donor, seven using autologous marrow, and one from a matched unrelated donor. The event-free survival (EFS) of transplanted patients was compared to that of patients treated with intensive chemotherapy using high-dose cytarabine, vincristine, escalating dose methotrexate, L-asparaginase, and an anthracycline (daunorubicin or idarubicin). Only those patients treated with chemotherapy who survived in second remission up to the mean time that patients were transplanted (135 days) were included in the control group (33 of 43 patients who achieved second remission). RESULTS: The actuarial 2-year event-free survival of transplanted patients is 37+/-22% (95% C.I.) compared to 18+/-13% for chemotherapy-treated patients (P=0.017). EFS for allo-transplant recipients was similar to that for auto-transplant recipients. Duration of initial remission was a strong predictor of the outcome of retrieval therapy. Patients whose initial remission was greater than 3 years had better EFS after achieving second remission (five of 11 still in remission, compared to four of 41 patients whose initial remission was less than 3 years). Adjustment in the multivariate analysis for duration of initial remission did not diminish the benefit of transplant over chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: While there remains considerable possibility for further improvement in EFS after achieving second remission of childhood ALL, bone marrow transplant is superior to chemotherapy in maintaining second remission.","['Feig, S A', 'Harris, R E', 'Sather, H N']","['Feig SA', 'Harris RE', 'Sather HN']","[""UCLA Children's Hospital, Los Angeles, CA, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis']",1997/10/23 22:17,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/10/23 22:17'],"['1997/10/23 22:17 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/10/23 22:17 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199712)29:6<534::AID-MPO3>3.0.CO;2-L [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199712)29:6<534::aid-mpo3>3.0.co;2-l [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1997 Dec;29(6):534-40. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199712)29:6<534::aid-mpo3>3.0.co;2-l.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In parallel, nuclear organization of DNA was monitored using the nucleoid sedimentation technique. The results show that DNA initiation rate and relative nucleoid sedimentation change sharply and simultaneously at doses of about 1 Gy, which suggests the existence of relationship between them. This suggestion was supported by the finding, that during the after-irradiation period, first DNA organization was restored and only after this process had been completed, the restoration of replicon initiation commenced. When cells were treated with novobiocin, an agent that is known to slow down the recovery of nucleoid sedimentation rate, initiation of DNA synthesis was also postponed.

Two-round amplifications using primers derived from CDRs and joining or constant regions were performed for MRD detection.

However, the isolation of Ig genes by this method is hampered in 15-35% by technical difficulties, mostly mismatches of oligonucleotide primers to V sequences. In order to obtain DNA sequences from V heavy chain (VH) genes which could not be amplified with consensus primers, we used a modified PCR technique, the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR in combination with new heavy chain constant region primers for the isolation of human and murine VH genes. In comparison, consensus primer PCR with different sets of previously published oligonucleotide primers was used. Both methods were applied to isolate VH genes from murine B cell lymphoma (A20 and BCL1), myeloma (NS1) and hybridoma (SP6) cell lines and from freshly isolated human chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma cells. RACE PCR allowed the amplification and subsequent cloning of the complete VH gene in all cases. In contrast, consensus primer PCR failed to isolate the VH sequence of the murine A20 cell line; this was explained by a mismatch of consensus primers with VH sequences. When both PCR methods amplified VH sequences, the DNA sequences obtained were identical. Taken together, RACE PCR represents a reliable and versatile method for the isolation of VH genes from human and murine lymphoma cells, in particular if consensus primer PCR fails.","['Doenecke, A', 'Winnacker, E L', 'Hallek, M']","['Doenecke A', 'Winnacker EL', 'Hallek M']","['Genzentrum, Universitat Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"[""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Technical Report']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*isolation & purification', 'Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics', '*Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400781 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Oct;11(10):1787-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400781.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All three IL-6R+ cases also expressed CD33, which was not expressed on IL-6R-negative cases. To determine if these receptors could serve as a target for a recombinant ligand-toxin, we examined the sensitivity of primary IL-6R+ ALL cells to a recombinant IL6-Pseudomonas exotoxin (IL6-PE4E) fusion protein, in which the toxicity and specificity of the chimeric toxin was enhanced by substitution of four glutamine residues for naturally occurring amino acids in PE domain I. Primary cells from IL-6R+ cases were sensitive to IL6-PE4E in a 48-h cytotoxicity assay, with ID50 values (concentrations causing 50% decrease in viability) ranging from 23 ng/ml to 92 ng/ml (median, 61; mean, 58). Furthermore, incubation of these cells with 10(3) ng/ml IL6-toxin for 24 h prevented their subsequent engraftment in SCID mice.

A patient with AML-M4 (inv (16)) is described, who was given non-myeloablative remission reinduction therapy for leukemic relapse (inv (16), trisomy 8) diagnosed on day 184 after HLA-compatible sibling BMT. On day 236, ie about 6 weeks after completion of this course, a clinical syndrome suggestive of acute GVHD grade 3 had developed. Skin biopsy confirmed the clinical diagnosis of GVHD, with a compatible liver biopsy. Transfusion-associated GVHD was ruled out by analysis of short tandem repeat (STR) alleles in the skin biopsy, revealing alleles from donor and recipient but not from third party origin. Cyclosporin A (CsA) therapy, which had been tapered between days 150 and 175, was resumed, resulting in a favorable response and gradual transition to limited chronic GVHD. The patient has since remained in complete remission with an excellent performance status for more than 40 months, without further chemotherapy. Thus this biopsy proven case of GVHD was induced by marrow donor lymphocytes more than 200 days after transplantation and apparently triggered by remission reinduction chemotherapy. The case indicates that intensive non-myeloablative chemotherapy can cure AML relapsing after allo-BMT.

BM samples showed a significant higher sensitivity both at the CFU-GM and LTCIC level, after treatment at 42 degrees C, as compared to the control BM samples obtained from healthy volunteers. The four BM samples of CML patients with a low leukocyte number at diagnosis harbored a mixture of bcr-abl-negative and positive colonies and an increase in the percentage of bcr-abl-negative colonies was observed in all cases. CML patients with a high leukocyte count at diagnosis, however, showed only bcr-abl-positive progenitors even after hyperthermia. PBSCs showed a significant higher sensitivity at the LTCIC level but not at the CFU-GM level, after treatment at 42 degrees C, as compared to the control PBSC samples obtained from nonhematologic cancer patients. Molecular analysis of individual colonies demonstrated an increase of bcr-abl-negative progenitors after thermic treatment in two out of three samples. When comparing both stem cell sources, PBSCs showed a decreased thermic sensitivity as compared to the BM samples at the CFU-GM level, whereas at the LTCIC level an increased thermic sensitivity was observed, both for the controls and the CML samples. In conclusion, both for BM and PBSCs samples, CML progenitors are more sensitive to hyperthermia than control cells, especially at the LTCIC level. In agreement with these results, an increase of bcr-abl-negative progenitors in six out of seven samples could be demonstrated either at the CFU-GM level, LTCIC level or both. Hyperthermia should be explored further as a possible purging modality in CML.","['Thijsen, S F', 'van Oostveen, J W', 'Schuurhuis, G J', 'Theijsmeijer, A P', 'Oudejans, C B', 'van Wijk, I J', 'Langenhuijsen, M M', 'Ossenkoppele, G J']","['Thijsen SF', 'van Oostveen JW', 'Schuurhuis GJ', 'Theijsmeijer AP', 'Oudejans CB', 'van Wijk IJ', 'Langenhuijsen MM', 'Ossenkoppele GJ']","['Department of Hematology, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Hyperthermia, Induced', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400799 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Oct;11(10):1762-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400799.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long-term growth of ELM-D cells is strictly stroma cell dependent. Interaction between stem cell factor (SCF) and its receptor, c-kit, was demonstrated to be important for stroma cell-dependent growth by anti c-kit neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) inhibition experiments. Significantly, soluble growth factors such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3) or SCF of MS-5 stromal cells (MS-5 CM) could replace the requirement of stroma cells for a considerable period. However, ELM-D cells maintained in these growth factors underwent clonal extinction after 3-6 weeks unless contact with stroma was re-established. Furthermore, IL-3 or GM-CSF acted in a dominant manner in inducing cell death in the presence of stroma cells. Cells showing clonal extinction undergo programmed cell death and do not differentiate. These altered growth properties of ELM-D cells exposed to soluble growth factors or to stroma cells appear to be analogous to those described for T or B cells primed by antigen presenting cells and then grown in growth factors.","['Itoh, K', 'Friel, J', 'Laker, C', 'Zeller, W', 'Just, U', 'Bittner, S', 'Nibbs, R J', 'Harrison, P R', 'Nishikawa, S I', 'Mori, K J', 'Ostertag, W']","['Itoh K', 'Friel J', 'Laker C', 'Zeller W', 'Just U', 'Bittner S', 'Nibbs RJ', 'Harrison PR', 'Nishikawa SI', 'Mori KJ', 'Ostertag W']","['Heinrich-Pette Institute for Experimental Virology and Immunology, Hamburg University, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Culture Media', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*physiology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/drug effects/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Stromal Cells/pathology']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400787 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Oct;11(10):1753-61. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400787.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since amplification of the rearranged gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and demonstrating that the amplified sequence is indeed derived from tumor cells is more problematic in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) than in other B cell malignancies, we used a comprehensive PCR primer set and formulated stringent selection criteria to identify tumor-specific rearranged IgH genes. Rearranged IgH genes amplified from lymphoma DNA were considered to be of tumor origin if they were monoclonal, and if the same rearrangement was amplified with at least two independent VH-specific primers. From 11 of 13 (85%) intermediate- and high-grade malignant NHL, IgH rearrangements were isolated. Intraclonal IgH sequence heterogeneity was studied in four lymphomas, and detected in two of them. PCR using a lymphoma-specific primer followed by Southern hybridization of PCR product with a specific probe allowed detection of lymphoma DNA after 10,000-fold dilution. Circulating lymphoma cells were detected in patient blood and bone marrow samples which were negative by morphological and immunological criteria. Thus, also in intermediate- and high-grade malignant lymphoma, sensitive minimal disease detection using the rearranged IgH gene as a marker appears feasible.","['van Belzen, N', 'Hupkes, P E', 'Doekharan, D', 'Hoogeveen-Westerveld, M', 'Dorssers, L C', ""van't Veer, M B""]","['van Belzen N', 'Hupkes PE', 'Doekharan D', 'Hoogeveen-Westerveld M', 'Dorssers LC', ""van't Veer MB""]","['Department Hematology, Dr Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Genetic Markers)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Biopsy', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/blood/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/blood/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400797 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Oct;11(10):1742-52. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400797.,,,"['GENBANK/Y12436', 'GENBANK/Y12437', 'GENBANK/Y12438', 'GENBANK/Y12439', 'GENBANK/Y12440', 'GENBANK/Y12441', 'GENBANK/Y12442', 'GENBANK/Y12443', 'GENBANK/Y12444', 'GENBANK/Y12445', 'GENBANK/Y12446', 'GENBANK/Y12447', 'GENBANK/Y12448', 'GENBANK/Y12449', 'GENBANK/Y12450', 'GENBANK/Y12451']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Two hundred and three bone marrow samples from 54 patients (33 adults and 21 children) were analysed by PCR within specific time-points after diagnosis (ie 1, 2-3, 4-6 and 7-12 months) using FR1 and JH primers (fingerprinting with a sensitivity > or =1:5 x 10[3]). CDR3-derived allele specific oligoprimers (ASO to achieve a sensitivity between 1:10[4] and 1:10[5]) were applied to 12 children and 18 adults, while size of CDR3 region, oligoclonality and background problems prevented their application to the remaining patients. All patients were followed clinically for > or =24 months. Thirty adults and 16 children presented as newly diagnosed ALL, while the remaining eight patients were analysed in first or subsequent relapse. Patients destined to relapse showed a higher proportion of positive tests (> or =50%), particularly after 1 month, than in the remission group, irrespective of age. Among patients staying in remission, a decrease in MRD-positive tests occurred during the first 12 months in both age groups. However, the proportion of positive tests dropped below 15% at a later stage in adults (4-6 months) than in children (2-3 months). Among children, only patients destined to relapse were MRD positive beyond 1 month, with the exception of only one patient, still positive at 2-3 months in the remission group. The difference in MRD positivity between relapse and remission patients was statistically significant in children (P < 0.03) at any time of testing, but only at 4-6 months in adults (P < 0.01). These data suggest that resolution of MRD in ALL occurs more rapidly in children compared to adults, particularly within the first 6 months.

Re-evaluation of NK-a levels, lymphocyte immunophenotypes, clonogenic activity and cytokine release showed that, unlike IL-2, IL-12 did not significantly increase NK-a or CD3-/56+ cell levels in either bone marrow or peripheral blood; IL-2 + 12 led to a significant increase that fell between the values reached by each cytokine alone. IL-2 + 12 and, although to a lesser extent, also IL-12 alone induced the release of large amounts of gamma-IFN and alpha-TNF. In addition, the number of clusters particularly decreased in the samples treated with IL-2 + 12 and IL-12 alone. Clonogenic activity was not modified after stimulation with any of the treatment.

In the present study, the effects of different long terminal repeats (LTRs) on IL-3 gene expression and autocrine transformation were investigated. LTRs from defective IAPs, and replication competent Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV), human T cell leukemia (HTLV), and immunodeficiency (HIV) viruses, were inserted 5' of the IL-3 promoter region, and their transforming abilities determined. Addition of the lymphocyte specific (LS) IAP-LTR to the germline IL-3 (gIL3) gene, the IAP-LTR present in the previously described transposition, resulted in a modified IL-3 gene that only infrequently transformed IL-3-dependent cells. In contrast, addition of plasmacytoma (PC) IAP-LTRs to the gIL3 gene, which were isolated from IAPs expressed in plasmacytomas, resulted in modified IL-3 genes that transformed IL-3-dependent cells more readily. The MoMuLV-LTR and the TCRdelta enhancer also stimulated high levels of IL-3 expression and autocrine transformation. In contrast, the HTLV-I, HTLV-II and HIV LTRs did not induce significant IL-3 synthesis or autocrine transformation. Consistent with these results, higher levels of CAT expression were observed in cells transiently transfected with PC-IAP-LTR or a TCR enhancer compared with LS-IAP and HTLV LTRs. In summary, the rank order for the effects of different LTRs on IL-3 expression and cell transformation is: TCRdelta-enhancer approximately MoMuLV-LTR > PC-IAP-LTRs >> LS-IAP-LTR >> HTLV-LTRs approximately HIV-LTR. These results indicate that the LS-IAP-LTR is very weak at inducing IL-3 gene transcription and additional genetic mutations may be necessary for LS-IAPs to induce autocrine transformation of hematopoietic cells. In contrast, the enhancers contained in PC-IAP-LTRs and TCR enhancers may be more effective in inducing abnormal gene expression and malignant transformation.","['Wang, X Y', 'McCubrey, J A']","['Wang XY', 'McCubrey JA']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, East Carolina University School of Medicine, Greenville, North Carolina 27858, USA.']",['eng'],['R01CA51025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Deltaretrovirus/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Growth Substances/metabolism/physiology', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Plasmacytoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400793 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Oct;11(10):1711-25. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400793.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By using the reference HGM-CSFR McAb, in healthy subjects we found detectable levels of GM-CSF/R on blood monocytes (mean MESF (molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome)/cell: 36.1 x 10[3]), neutrophils (mean MESF/cell: 7.4 x 10[3]), bone marrow (BM) myelo-monocytic precursors (MESF range for the myeloid component, ie promyelocytes, myelocytes, metamyelocytes: 11.7-40.5 x 10[3], and for the monocytic lineage: 25.7-69.2 x 10[3]), and in two distinct subsets of BM CD34+ progenitor cells (GM-CSF/R dim: 2.5 x 10[3] MESF/cell, GM-CSF/R bright (10% of the total number of CD34 cells: 22.0 x 10[3] MESF/cell). In these subjects, there was no correlation between the expression levels of GM-CSF/R and CFU (CFU-GM, CFU-GEMM, BFU-E) colony production. Among the AML samples, M5D12 McAb was positive in 33%, 4B5F5 McAb in 90%, and HGM-CSF/R McAb in 78% of the cases examined (range of MESF/cell for the HGM-CSFR McAb: 0.9 x 10[3]-106.7 x 10[3]). The highest MESF values were seen in the M5 FAB subvariety (mean: 39.4 x 10[3]), where all the patients tested (n = 20) showed a strong positivity for the HGM-CSFR McAb. On the contrary, all ALL samples were GM-CSF/R negative except in two patients, who displayed a dim GM-CSF/R positivity (My+ALL: 1.3 x 10[3] MESF/cell; pro-B ALL: 1.0 x 10[3] MESF/cell). In most (>70%) M1 FAB subtypes, GM-CSF/R+ blasts co-expressed CD34low, HLA-DRhigh, CD33, CD38 antigens, and had little or no capacity to form CFU-GM colonies. GM-CSF/R+ blasts from the M5 FAB category were also positive for CD14, CD11c, CD33 and CD87. Furthermore, the number of GM-CSF/R expressed by leukemic cells from five out of 72 (7%) AML patients was above the highest values seen in normal samples (>69.2 x 10[3] MESF/cell), allowing the possibility of using this marker for the monitoring of the minimal residual disease (MRD) in a subset of AML. Cell culture studies aimed at evaluating GM-CSF receptor modulation following AML blast exposure to rhGM-CSF showed two distinct patterns of response; in the first group (6/10 cases) rhGM-CSF down-modulated GM-CSF receptors, whereas in the second group (4/10 cases), rhGM-CSF treatment was associated with either an increase or no change in the number of GM-CSF/R. In conclusion, cellular GM-CSF/R expression was variable and ranged from undetectable (ALL and a minority of AML) to very high intensities in M5 AML, and were also documented in some M0 AML, thus suggesting the concept that GM-CSF/R detection may be of help in lineage assignment of undifferentiated forms. Since the number of GM-CSF/R on AML blasts may be modulated after GM-CSF treatment, it can be postulated that the clinical use of GM-CSF in this disease may be optimized by a dynamic analysis of the number and the affinity status of GM-CSF-R in blasts and normal hemopoietic cells.","['Lanza, F', 'Castagnari, B', 'Rigolin, G', 'Moretti, S', 'Latorraca, A', 'Ferrari, L', 'Bardi, A', 'Castoldi, G']","['Lanza F', 'Castagnari B', 'Rigolin G', 'Moretti S', 'Latorraca A', 'Ferrari L', 'Bardi A', 'Castoldi G']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Advanced Therapies, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*analysis/blood']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400794 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Oct;11(10):1700-10. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400794.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, known as P16 (INK4A/MTS1) and P15 (INK4B/MTS2), which map to 9p21, have been found deleted in a wide range of tumors and particularly in leukemic cells. We report here Southern blot analyses of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (P16, P15, P21, and P27) status in primary tumoral cells of 121 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemias, 85 patients with acute myeloid leukemias and 42 patients with B-chronic lymphocytic leukemias. P16 inactivation was found in 25 of 38 T-ALLs and in 28 of 83 B-lineage ALLs. In eight cases (three T-ALLs and five B-lineage ALLs), one or both alleles of P16 locus were rearranged. In these cases, breakpoints occurred within the two major breakpoints cluster regions previously described in T-ALLs.

In this study we analyzed the level of unphosphorylated Op18 and of its major phosphorylated forms, Op18a and Op18b, in a series of 177 childhood acute leukemias by means of quantitative two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE). Op18 phosphorylation was significantly correlated with the white blood count at the time of diganosis, and with a high percentage of cells in the S phase.

Telomerase is the enzyme involved in telomere elongation, one of the events that permits unlimited cell proliferation. Variations in telomerase activity were quantified in hematopoietic cell lines after gamma-irradiation. Telomerase activity increased after irradiation of between 0 and 3 Gy in a dose-dependent manner, reaching a maximum at 3 Gy. The increase in telomerase activity was nearly maximum 8 h after irradiation, the peak being observed at around 24 h. Although this kinetics partly correlated with cell redistribution into the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, telomerase activity did not show significant variation over the cell cycle. Therefore, the activation of telomerase observed after gamma-irradiation may suggest the involvement of telomerase in DNA repair and chromosome healing.","['Leteurtre, F', 'Li, X', 'Gluckman, E', 'Carosella, E D']","['Leteurtre F', 'Li X', 'Gluckman E', 'Carosella ED']","[""Service de Recherches en HematoImmunologie, Laboratoire d'Immunoradiobiologie, DRM-DSV-CEA, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Cell Cycle/physiology/radiation effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'DNA Repair', 'Down-Regulation/radiation effects', 'Enzyme Activation/radiation effects', 'G2 Phase/physiology/radiation effects', 'Gamma Rays', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*enzymology/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Mitosis/physiology/radiation effects', 'Telomerase/*metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Up-Regulation/radiation effects']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400784 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Oct;11(10):1681-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400784.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs) and B-cell ALLs show a remarkable rate of 75 and 20% homozygous deletion of this gene, respectively. Restoration of p16 expression in p16-deficient solid tumor cell lines results in a dramatic reduction of growth and maligant phenotype. To test the hypothesis that p16INK4A suppresses the growth of p16-deficient leukemias, we utilized a retroviral system to restore wild-type (wt) or mutant p16 protein expression. We tested the efficacy of our system by expressing the wt or mutant p16 genes in the osteosarcoma cell line, U20S, which lacks p16 and retains functional retinoblastoma protein (pRb). The wt p16 protein formed complexes with both cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6 and inhibited U20S growth by 30-fold. The p16 mutants E120K and R144C formed complexes with CDK4 and CDK6 in cells and inhibited cell growth as effectively as wt p16 (20-fold) while the mutant proteins that did not complex with detectable levels of CDK4 or CDK6 only inhibited growth 0.25- and five-fold (G101W and D141, respectively) or not at all (H83Y and DA4). The COOH-terminal 'tail' of the wt p16 protein (amino acid residues 141-156), missing in mutant D141, enhanced the growth suppressive capability of p16. The amino acid substitutions in mutants G101W and H83Y not only disrupted CDK4 and CDK6 binding, but decreased the protein half-lives by two- and three-fold, respectively, compared to wt p16. The wt, but not mutant p16 genes, effectively inhibited the growth of T cell acute lymphoblastic (CEM) and myeloid leukemia (NB-4 and K562) cell lines that lacked the p16 gene, but retained functional pRb. Growth of the T-ALL cell line, HSB-2, which lacked both p16 and pRb, was not inhibited, indicating the growth suppression involved the pRb pathway. These results define regions critical for the function of p16 and demonstrate that restoration of wt p16 expression in p16-deficient leukemias significantly reverted their transformed phenotype and inhibited their growth.","['Gombart, A F', 'Yang, R', 'Campbell, M J', 'Berman, J D', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Gombart AF', 'Yang R', 'Campbell MJ', 'Berman JD', 'Koeffler HP']","['Burns and Allen Research Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Division of Hematology/Oncology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA42710/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK41936/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK42792/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Mutation', 'Osteosarcoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400840 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Oct;11(10):1673-80. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400840.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report we have investigated the potential importance of caspase proteases in apoptosis induced by multiple chemotherapeutic agents. Human T leukemic cells engineered to overexpress the cowpox virus CrmA protein, a direct and specific inhibitor of caspase proteases, were studied for their resistance to 1-beta-D-arabinofurasosyl-cytosine (Ara-C), etoposide (VP-16), doxorubicin (DOX), and cis-dichlorodiammine platinum (CP). Overexpression of CrmA dramatically inhibited drug-induced activation of caspases, as measured by processing of the inactive precursor form of caspase-3 and cleavage of caspase substrate proteins poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and lamin B. CrmA also significantly inhibited the kinetics of cell death induced by each of the four drugs. Moreover, when examined several days or weeks after initial exposure to drug, cultures of CrmA-expressing cells were found to have recovered and repopulated, whereas vector-transfected control cells did not. These studies demonstrate that caspase proteases play an important role in conferring sensitivity to multiple chemotherapy drugs, and that constitutive downmodulation of caspase activities can enhance chemoresistance.","['Antoku, K', 'Liu, Z', 'Johnson, D E']","['Antoku K', 'Liu Z', 'Johnson DE']","['Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, and the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, PA 15213-2582, USA.']",['eng'],['CA66044/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lamin Type B)', '0 (Lamins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Serpins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '96282-35-8 (interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme inhibitor)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 1', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lamin Type B', 'Lamins', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Serpins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Viral Proteins']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400805 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Oct;11(10):1665-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400805.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore we determined the relationship between obesity and a diagnosis of APL among patients with acute myelocytic leukemia (AML). Between 1980 and 1995 we saw 1245 patients with newly-diagnosed AML of whom 120 had APL. Increasing body mass index (BMI) was strongly associated with a diagnosis of APL (P=0.0003). Like Douer et al (Blood 1996; 8: 303-313) we found APL to be more frequent in Latinos and younger patients (P < 10[-4] for both). Logistic regression indicated that increasing BMI, decreasing age, and Latino origin were each independently associated with a diagnosis of APL (multivariate P values <10[-4], <10[-4], 0.0035, respectively). Since the mean BMI in the non-APL patients (25.1) resembled that of the general US population, it appears that APL patients are 'heavy' and not that non-APL patients are 'thin'. Five of the APL patients (4.2%) had a BMI >50 (vs none of the other 1125 AML patients). Given the distribution of BMI in the general US population ages 17-74, the probability that five of 120 normal adults would have a BMI >50 is virtually nil. Excluding the five very heavy APL patients does not alter the conclusion that increasing BMI predicted for APL in patients with AML. Although the mechanism is unclear there appears to be an association between increasing BMI and a diagnosis of APL among patients with AML. There may also be an association between APL and obesity.","['Estey, E', 'Thall, P', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Pierce, S', 'Kornblau, S', 'Keating, M']","['Estey E', 'Thall P', 'Kantarjian H', 'Pierce S', 'Kornblau S', 'Keating M']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', '*Body Mass Index', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Obesity/complications/epidemiology', 'Regression Analysis']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400783 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Oct;11(10):1661-4. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400783.,,,,['Leukemia. 1998 Sep;12(9):1503-6.

Six patients, four with Hodgkin's disease and two with non-Hodgkin lymphomas, developed leukemic complications, myelodysplasia (MDS) in four cases and overt acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in two. All six showed an abnormal karyotype, in four of them highly characteristic of therapy-related MDS (t-MDS) and therapy-related AML (t-AML). The cumulative risk of t-MDS and t-AML increased from 16 months after start of the primary chemotherapy for lymphoma and reached 17.3% (s.e. 8.5%) after 74 months.

In the present cohort the risk of t-MDS and t-AML although high, did not differ from our previous experience in patients treated conventionally for Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and did not differ for patients receiving stem cells isolated from the bone marrow as compared to patients receiving stem cells isolated from peripheral blood.

The results show that overexpression of mutant p53 can initiate the transformation of immature murine hematopoietic cells in vivo and induce two types of hematopoietic disorders, myeloproliferative disease and myelodysplastic syndrome.","['Shounan, Y', 'MacKenzie, K', 'Dolnikov, A', 'Miller, M', 'Symonds, G']","['Shounan Y', 'MacKenzie K', 'Dolnikov A', 'Miller M', 'Symonds G']","['The RW Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute-Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/physiology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genes, p53', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400782 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Oct;11(10):1641-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400782.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have found a very high frequency of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) (31 of 54 cases (57%)) on chromosome arm 9p. As expected, the smallest region of LOH was between D9S1747 and D9S1748 at 9p21, including CDKN2/INK4A/p16, but excluding CDKN2B/INK4B/p15. Homozygous deletions at 9p21 occurred in 23 of 54 (43%) samples (seven of 11 (64%) T-ALL, 16 of 45 (36%) precursor-B ALL). We detected seven cases of homozygous deletions at 9p21 which had not been detected by Southern blot hybridization, showing the power of microsatellite analysis in detecting homozygous deletions. In most cases, homozygous deletions were limited to the region between D9S1747 and CDKN2B/INK4B/p15. We have attempted to determine the mechanism and timing of 9p deletions. Of the 23 samples with homozygous deletions at 9p21, 21 samples had surrounding large LOH. Of the 29 samples with LOH of 9p, homozygous deletion at 9p21 was identified in 22 cases. In addition, six patients have been studied at diagnosis and relapse, all six showed the same 9p21 structure at relapse (normal, three patients; hemizygous deletions, two patients; homozygous deletion, one patient) as their initial presentation. Finally, three patients (homozygous deletion, one patient; hemizygous deletion, two patients) had the IFN-alpha rather than CDKN2/INK4A/p16 deleted. In summary, these data further emphasize the importance of 9p21 loss in the development of childhood ALL.","['Takeuchi, S', 'Koike, M', 'Seriu, T', 'Bartram, C R', 'Slater, J', 'Park, S', 'Miyoshi, I', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Takeuchi S', 'Koike M', 'Seriu T', 'Bartram CR', 'Slater J', 'Park S', 'Miyoshi I', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA 43277/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK42792/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Child', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Microsatellite Repeats', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Time Factors']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400817 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Oct;11(10):1636-40. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400817.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty percent of G-CSF-treated patients had therapy delayed by >35 days per course, vs 50% of historical controls (P=0.005). The incidence of pneumonia was 8% with G-CSF and 37% without in historical controls. Other infection rates (sepsis, fever of undetermined origin, minor infections) were similar. This decrease in pneumonia was noted even in high-risk groups such as patients older than 60 years and patients with hypogammaglobulinemia. The use of G-CSF following fludarabine in high-risk patients with CLL resulted in a significant decrease in myelosuppression and pneumonia.

Febrile episodes occurred in 25 patients (68%) including documented infections in 17 patients (46%). Decitabine has promising activity in CML. The most significant side-effect is prolonged myelosuppression.

Overall, 57% of the patients achieved complete hematological response (CHR), and 7% obtained partial hematological response. Nineteen patients (15% of the 123 evaluable patients) had a cytogenetic response which was major (Ph-positive <35%) in 10 patients (8%). A trend for better responses was observed with shorter disease duration. The median overall survival from start of therapy was 49 months, with an estimated 5-year survival rate of 41%. Some common pretreatment prognostic factors associated with response did not show statistical associations when applied in late CP-CML; however, characteristics such as smaller spleen size, and lower percentages of peripheral blood and marrow blasts and basophils were associated with better survival experience. When patients were subgrouped according to risk, no significant differences in the incidence of cytogenetic response and in survival outcomes were observed among various risk groups. This study confirms that alpha-IFN-based regimens have a modest activity in late CP-CML, and supports the need to develop investigational strategies aimed at improving patient prognosis in this phase.","['Sacchi, S', 'Kantarjian, H M', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Beran, M', 'Koller, C', 'Pierce, S', 'Kornblau, S', 'Estey, E', 'Keating, M J', 'Talpaz, M']","['Sacchi S', 'Kantarjian HM', ""O'Brien S"", 'Beran M', 'Koller C', 'Pierce S', 'Kornblau S', 'Estey E', 'Keating MJ', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Hematology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage', 'Interferon Type I/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-gamma/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Time Factors']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400791 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Oct;11(10):1610-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400791.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also evaluated 71 cell lines derived from 11 AML, 31 ALL, two hairy cell leukemia, three acute unclassified leukemia, 10 CML, 12 NHL including six Burkitt's lymphoma, and two MM. Using genomic PCR of exon 11 coding for the juxtamembrane (JM) domain and first amino acids of the 5'-tyrosine kinase (TK) domain, this length mutation was found only in AML (22/112, 20%) and MDS (1/37). According to the FAB subclassification, they were 5/18 (28%) of M1, 4/29 (14%) of M2, 3/17 (18%) of M3, 6/24 (25%) of M4, 4/20 (20%) of M5 and 1/9 of refractory anemia with excess of blast in transformation. In the various cell lines examined, this abnormality was determined in only one derived from AML and never found in other hematological malignancies. The sequence analysis of the abnormal PCR products revealed that 23 of 24 showed internal tandem duplication with or without insertion of nucleotides. In one AML, insertion and deletion without duplication was determined. All 24 lengthened sequences were in-frame. Duplication takes place in the sequence coding for the JM domain and leaves the TK domain intact. In conclusion, we emphasize that the length mutation of FLT3 at JM/TK-I domains were restricted to AML and MDS. Since all these mutations resulted in in-frame, this abnormality might function for the proliferation of leukemic cells.","['Yokota, S', 'Kiyoi, H', 'Nakao, M', 'Iwai, T', 'Misawa, S', 'Okuda, T', 'Sonoda, Y', 'Abe, T', 'Kahsima, K', 'Matsuo, Y', 'Naoe, T']","['Yokota S', 'Kiyoi H', 'Nakao M', 'Iwai T', 'Misawa S', 'Okuda T', 'Sonoda Y', 'Abe T', 'Kahsima K', 'Matsuo Y', 'Naoe T']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400812 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Oct;11(10):1605-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400812.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our experience suggests that a single autograft with unpurged stem cells is unlikely to cure autoimmune disease, but that other strategies building on this approach are worthy of investigation.","['Cooley, H M', 'Snowden, J A', 'Grigg, A P', 'Wicks, I P']","['Cooley HM', 'Snowden JA', 'Grigg AP', 'Wicks IP']","['Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,,IM,"['Adult', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/complications/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/complications/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Psoriasis/complications/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/art.1780400923 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 1997 Sep;40(9):1712-5. doi: 10.1002/art.1780400923.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, 862 patients with RA (96% white) were enrolled from 1966 to 1974 and were followed up for up to 35 years (mean 17.4 years) at the University of Saskatchewan Rheumatic Disease Unit. All diagnoses of cancer were cross-referenced with the Provincial Cancer Registry. Expected cancer incidence rates were determined based on province of Saskatchewan population statistics matched to each study patient for age, sex, and calendar year. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of the observed-to-expected cancer incidence and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were then calculated. RESULTS: A total of 136 cases of cancer were observed compared with 168 expected (SIR 0.80, P = 0.011 [95% CI 0.67-0.95]). The relative risk of colorectal malignancy was significantly reduced in the RA study population (SIR 0.52, P = 0.037 [95% CI 0.25-0.96]). A significant excess of leukemia was found (SIR 2.47, P = 0.026 [95% CI 1.12-4.69]), whereas the incidence rates for Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and all other site-specific malignancies were not found to be significantly different from general population rates. CONCLUSION: In our cohort of RA patients, colorectal cancer was detected in only half the expected number of patients. This risk reduction may be related to long-term nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use in RA, as has been suggested in several other studies of long-term NSAID use. An increased risk of leukemia was confirmed. This may be due to the persistent immune stimulation associated with RA itself, since other potential explanatory factors for increased leukemia were not apparent. Despite the excess of hemopoietic malignancy and despite treatment of RA with potentially oncogenic agents, the overall risk of malignancy was reduced in this RA cohort.","['Cibere, J', 'Sibley, J', 'Haga, M']","['Cibere J', 'Sibley J', 'Haga M']","['University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada.']",['eng'],['AM-21393/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*complications/drug therapy', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Demography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Life Style', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/art.1780400906 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 1997 Sep;40(9):1580-6. doi: 10.1002/art.1780400906.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The method is sensitive enough to detect the international reference serum E4/10 in pooled blood serum samples collected from up to 50 cows, or, if a 10-fold concentrate of milk whey is tested, in samples of bulk milk collected from up to 400 cows. The application of MAb p24 has considerably increased not only the sensitivity, but also the specificity of ELISA. Moreover it is possible to differentiate reliably between positive and 'false positive' reagents by testing a suspicious sample in a pair of wells of which one is coated with MAb p24 alone and the other with the complex MAb p24 + EBLV antigen and the subsequent calculation of 'specific absorbance'. This method, showing the highest sensitivity of detection of antibodies to EBLV p24 described so far, can become an effective tool on the sanitation of infected herds as well as in checks of the EBL-free status.

A review of the literature and personal experience.,415-21,"The authors, on the basis of a review of the literature and on their personal experience, derived from the observation of 169 cases of acute and chronic leukaemias, describe the different aspects of the cutaneous lesions present during the course of these neoplastic conditions. The cutaneous lesions, subdivided according to the type of leukaemia, show an extremely variable pattern and it is therefore difficult to differentiate on the basis of the sole macroscopic appearances, specific leukaemic nodules or infiltrates from dermatoses due to bacterial, viral and fungal infections on which an haemorrhagic component may be superimposed. Similarly, if a clearly established diagnosis of leukaemia has not been confirmed, it is difficult to distinguish leukaemic infiltrates from cutaneous lesions caused by a malignant lymphoma, metastatic carcinoma, an eosinophilic granuloma, or from benign lymphohistiocytic infiltrates, secondary to cutaneous infections. It is important also to bear in mind the development of skin eruptions, often with an haemorrhagic component, due to acquired sensitivity to numerous agents, cytostatic drugs, antibiotics, blood products and others, used in therapy. The authors therefore underline the importance of an early recognition of an infectious lesion, often complicated by a previous haemorrhagic event or secondary to microbial invasion of a catheter tip or of a venipuncture site, and consequently, the authors emphasize the need to distinguish these non-specific skin alterations, amenable to appropriate treatment from those lesions due to the development of a skin tumour or to a leukaemic infiltrate, which is nearly always indicative of a leukaemia recurrence or extension of the leukaemic process.","['Quaglino, D', 'Di Leonardo, G', 'Furia, N', 'Paglione, M', 'Pasqualoni, E']","['Quaglino D', 'Di Leonardo G', 'Furia N', 'Paglione M', 'Pasqualoni E']","[""Dipartimento di Medicina Interna e Sanita Pubblica, Universita, L'Aquila.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Recenti Prog Med,Recenti progressi in medicina,0401271,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Skin/*pathology']",1997/11/05 00:00,1997/11/05 00:01,['1997/11/05 00:00'],"['1997/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Recenti Prog Med. 1997 Sep;88(9):415-21.,18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) has been used in the management of leukemia but its diverse adverse activities with multiple potential side effects, possibly unrelated to therapeutic targets, may negatively influence the ability of IFN-alpha to treat this disorder. Therefore, we examined the ability of adenovirus (Ad)-IFN-alpha gene construct to transfect normal (CD34+ cells) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) and the transient overexpression of IFN-alpha in these cells. Ad-cytomegalovirus promoter driven IFN-alpha (AdCMV-IFN-alpha) at multiple doses was assessed to transfect highly purified CD34+ cells in liquid culture, and optimal transduction of CD34+ cells was achieved using 120 plaque forming units. Flow cytometric determinations revealed that there was no significant difference in cell viability for the 4 h or 24 h transfection periods. Immunoassay of IFN-alpha produced by CD34+ cells shows that IFN-alpha levels increased several fold in transfected cells. Transient expression of the IFN-alpha gene did not suppress proliferation of CD34+ progenitors as indicated by BFU-E or colony forming units-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) growth. Reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction analysis of RNA from CD34+ harvested CFU-GM progenitor cells demonstrated transient IFN-alpha mRNA expression. Similarly, CML BMMNC were transfected with AdCMV-IFN-alpha under similar conditions as described for CD34+ cells. BMMNC cells exposed to adenovirus for 24 h and 48 h were found to express IFN-alpha at a substantial level. This in vitro data suggest that Ad-mediated gene transfer of IFN-alpha into hematopoietic stem cells can be achieved and that the IFN-alpha gene can be translated into its specific mRNA in CD34 progenitor cells.","['Feldman, E', 'Ahmed, T', 'Lutton, J D', 'Farley, T', 'Tani, K', 'Freund, M', 'Asano, S', 'Abraham, N G']","['Feldman E', 'Ahmed T', 'Lutton JD', 'Farley T', 'Tani K', 'Freund M', 'Asano S', 'Abraham NG']","['Department of Pharmacology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY 10595, USA.']",['eng'],['R01-HL-5438/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Antigens, CD34/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*genetics/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Stem Cells/drug effects/immunology/physiology', 'Transfection']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/11/04 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/04 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.150386 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1997;15(5):386-95. doi: 10.1002/stem.150386.,,,,['Cell Stem Cell. 2016 Jul 7;19(1):6-8.

The v-myb oncogene, carried by avian defective retroviruses, causes leukaemias in the chicken and transforms haematopoietic cells in vitro. Its normal cellular equivalent c-myb, has been shown to promote the proliferation and block the differentiation of haematopoietic cells in several experimental models and is required for fetal haematopoiesis. Two other members of the family have been cloned more recently, A-myb and B-myb, which show sequence homology with c-myb in several domains, of which the DNA binding domain as well as other regulatory domains. Both have been shown to be transcription factors. B-myb is also involved in the control of proliferation and differentiation, but, unlike c-myb, it is expressed in many cell types. The third member of the family, A-myb, shows the most restricted pattern of expression, suggesting a very specific role for this transcription factor. A-myb is expressed in a subpopulation of normal B lymphocytes activated in vivo and localised in the germinal center of peripheral lymphoid organs and is not detected at significant levels in all other mature or immature haematopoietic populations studied, including bone marrow cells, T lymphocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, either at rest or after in vitro activation. These studies indicate that A-myb plays a role during a narrow window of normal B cell differentiation. A-myb expression has also been studied in a wide range of neoplastic B cells, representing the whole spectrum of B cell differentiation. A-myb is strongly expressed in Burkitt's lymphomas (BL) and slg+ B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (B-ALL) and not in all other leukaemias/lymphomas tested, with the exception of a subset of CLL (about 25% of cases). It is intriguing that the A-myb genome has been localised relatively close to the c-myc gene on chromosome 8, suggesting that the c-myc translocation in BL and B-ALL may affect A-myb transcription. Studies are in progress to investigate the functional relationship between A-myb and c-myc, particularly in the context of BL cells and to determine whether A-myb is deregulated in these cells.","['Golay, J', 'Facchinetti, V', 'Ying, G', 'Introna, M']","['Golay J', 'Facchinetti V', 'Ying G', 'Introna M']","['Department of Immunology and Cellular Biology, Istituto Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (A-MYB protein, chicken)', '0 (Avian Proteins)', '0 (MYBL1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Avian Proteins', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/10/10 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199709051776 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1997 Jul;26(3-4):271-9. doi: 10.3109/10428199709051776.,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, future success in the clinic depends on enhancing antibody effector functions. Here, we suggest that target antigen selection may influence recruitment of effector cells for antibody therapy, and may improve the outcome of antibody treatment in patients. Comparing a wide range of antibodies to different B cell antigens, we found most were able to mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) with blood mononuclear cells (MNC). In direct contrast, however, polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN) from the same donors showed ADCC only with HLA class II antibodies. Based on this observation, we propose a therapeutic strategy with a combination of HLA class antibodies and G-CSF, the latter being required to increase number and activational state of neutrophils. In particular, we suggest using bispecific antibodies (BsAb) in which one arm binds to HLA class II on tumor cells, and the second to FcgammaRI on activated effector cells. The clinical potential of this approach for the treatment of B cell malignancies looks most attractive.","['Valerius, T', 'Elsasser, D', 'Repp, R', 'Van de Winkel, J G', 'Gramatzki, M', 'Glennie, M']","['Valerius T', 'Elsasser D', 'Repp R', 'Van de Winkel JG', 'Gramatzki M', 'Glennie M']","['Department of Medicine III, University Erlangen, Nurnberg, Germany.

Methylation is one mechanism by which gene expression is controlled and the CpG sites, which are the targets of DNA methylation, are also the sites of a number of the mutations found in the p53 gene. Cells harbouring mutant p53 have been shown to accumulate further genomic and genetic aberrations and methylation which alters the conformation of DNA is also believed to play a role in genomic stability. There appears to be an interplay between p53 deregulation and changing methylation patterns with the progression of CML.

Therapy is currently limited to allogeneic marrow transplantation; patients lacking a suitable donor usually die from aplasia or acute leukemia. Recently, mutation in a novel gene named FACC (Fanconi anemia C-complementing) has been identified as causing one type of FA. FACC mutations, which introduce splicing errors or stop codons, have been identified in approximately 15% of FA patients. We have recently been successful in functional complementation of four FA cell lines using retroviral vectors to transfer a copy of the normal FACC gene. We also analyzed the ability of our viral vectors to functionally correct hematopoietic progenitor cells from a patient bearing a splice donor mutation. As for the lymphoid cell lines, these CD34-enriched cells were extremely sensitive to MMC. After infection of these progenitor cells with viral vectors bearing normal FACC, the progenitors gave rise to increased numbers of colonies both in the absence and presence of up to 5nM MMC, whereas control cells were completely destroyed by 1nM MMC. In summary, we have demonstrated that: (1) retroviral vectors can be engineered to transfer a normal FACC gene to FA(C) lymphoid cell lines and primary hematopoietic cells; (2) introduction of a normal FACC gene into CD34+ progenitors markedly enhances their growth in the absence and presence of MMC. This study is designed to determine whether hematopoietic progenitors transduced with the normal FACC gene can be reinfused safely into FA(C) patients. CD34+ cells obtained from G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood will be transduced ex vivo over a 72-hour period in the presence of IL-3, IL-6, and Stem Cell Factor with the FACC retroviral vector. These transduced cells will be reinfused into FA(C) patients. Patients will be monitored for toxicities as well as evidence of successful gene transfer and expression. The procedure will be repeated up to a total of 4 times with each treatment 2-4 months apart. Theoretically, these rescued stem cells should have a selective growth advantage within the hypoplastic FA marrow environment in vivo.","['Liu, J M', 'Young, N S', 'Walsh, C E', 'Cottler-Fox, M', 'Carter, C', 'Dunbar, C', 'Barrett, A J', 'Emmons, R']","['Liu JM', 'Young NS', 'Walsh CE', 'Cottler-Fox M', 'Carter C', 'Dunbar C', 'Barrett AJ', 'Emmons R']",,['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FANCC protein, human)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Clinical Protocols', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fanconi Anemia/*therapy', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics']",1997/10/10 00:00,1997/10/10 00:01,['1997/10/10 00:00'],"['1997/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1997.8.14-1715 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1997 Sep 20;8(14):1715-30. doi: 10.1089/hum.1997.8.14-1715.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the transgene was detected only in the progeny of flow cytometer sorted CD34+ population transduced by the LAPSN (PG13) viral vector in the presence of cationic lipids but not when transduction was facilitated with conventional polycations Polybrene or protamine sulfate. Thus, a combination of GaLV pseudotyped vectors and cationic lipids results in increased transduction frequencies of the CD34+ cells without a requirement of extended in vitro culture, or co-cultivation with producer cell lines.

This method was used for gene transfer because (a) it provides a gene delivery reservoir; (b) no intraluminal manipulations are performed; (c) installation of the collar induces arterial smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and enhances retroviral gene transfer efficiency where target cell proliferation is required. The transfer of the beta-galactosidase (lacZ) marker gene to the adventitia and media occurred with all gene transfer systems. Adenoviruses also transferred the beta-galactosidase gene to some endothelial cells. After 5 days, adenoviral vectors produced the highest gene transfer efficiency with up to 10%+/-6% of cells showing beta-galactosidase activity. Pseudotyped VSV-G retroviruses were also effective in achieving gene transfer in 0.05%+/-0.03% of cells in the adventitia and media. Plasmid/liposome complexes and MMLV retroviruses infected 0.05%+/-0.03% and <0.01%+/-0.01% of cells, respectively. It is concluded that replication-deficient adenoviruses, VSV-G pseudotyped retroviruses, and plasmid/liposome complexes can be used for gene transfer to the arterial wall using the collar method. Because the endothelium remains anatomically present throughout the experiments, the model may be useful for the gene transfer studies involving diffusible or secreted gene products that primarily act on the endothelium. Effects on medial SMC and even endothelium can be achieved from the adventitial side, suggesting an alternative route for the delivery of therapeutically useful genes into the arterial wall.","['Laitinen, M', 'Pakkanen, T', 'Donetti, E', 'Baetta, R', 'Luoma, J', 'Lehtolainen, P', 'Viita, H', 'Agrawal, R', 'Miyanohara, A', 'Friedmann, T', 'Risau, W', 'Martin, J F', 'Soma, M', 'Yla-Herttuala, S']","['Laitinen M', 'Pakkanen T', 'Donetti E', 'Baetta R', 'Luoma J', 'Lehtolainen P', 'Viita H', 'Agrawal R', 'Miyanohara A', 'Friedmann T', 'Risau W', 'Martin JF', 'Soma M', 'Yla-Herttuala S']","['A.I.

Apoptosis was demonstrated by the in situ end-labeling technique (ISEL) and proliferative activity by applying the monoclonal antibody PC10 raised against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). To assess dynamic features of hematopoiesis, an index was calculated consisting of the ratio between PCNA-positive nuclei and the apoptotic cell fraction. This factor was termed the hematopoietic turnover index (HTI). Morphometric analysis revealed that the HTI was significantly increased in AML and PV. According to cell culture studies both disorders are characterized by either a prevalent proliferation of the myeloid or erythroid cell mass. On the other hand, PG, PTH, and TH showed no relevant enhancement of this index in comparison to the control specimen. In vitro experiment results are in keeping with the finding that PG and PTH are not associated with a significant expansion of the erythroid lineage (CFU-E). Similar to ITP and TH, in PTH megakaryocyte proliferation (CFU-MEG) is the predominant feature of cell turnover. Differences between PTH and TH are in line with the reduced in vitro formation of CFU-MEG in the latter disorder.

P-gp was determined using monoclonal antibody 4E3.16 and functional activity using the rhodamine 123 accumulation test. P-gp positivity was defined as a Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) D value > or = 0.15, P-gp negativity as a KS D value < 0.15.

A survey performed on archival hematologic slides.,383-90,"We describe a method of spectrophotometric detection of BCR/ABL chimeric sequences amplified by multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), enabling the use of archival hematologic slides as RNA sources. Multiplex PCR amplified b3a2, b2a2, and e1a2 break points of the BCR/ABL translocation and the normal ABL gene product. Assessment of sensitivity, performed on K562 cells, showed that the threshold approximated radioactive methods of detection (i.e., 1 positive cell in 1 x 10(6) negative cells for single round PCR and lower than 1 positive cell in 1 x 10(7) negative cells for nested PCR). Then, we assayed 38 different archival hematologic slides from 18 patients, including 11 cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia-like disease, such as a case of myelofibrosis and a case of chronic neutrophilic leukemia, 6 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 1 case of acute myelogenous leukemia. Amplification and spectrophotometric detection of BCR/ABL fusion messenger RNAs gave an unambiguous positive result in 24 (89%) of 27 expected positive slides, among which 17 (63%) were positive after a single PCR round. Concordant unambiguous results were obtained from 35 (92%) of 38 slides, as verified through parallel analyses of corresponding cryopreserved cells. Retrospective analysis on archival hematologic slides yielded identification of the presence or absence of the t(9;22) translocation and break point in 14 previously uncharacterized cases. The application of this method can help define the diagnosis of cases lacking other appropriate material and assist in the retrospective analysis of large patient series for which only smears are available.","['Attadia, V', 'Alosi, M', 'Improta, S', 'Zagonel, V', 'Martinazzo, G', 'Carbone, A', 'Pinto, A']","['Attadia V', 'Alosi M', 'Improta S', 'Zagonel V', 'Martinazzo G', 'Carbone A', 'Pinto A']","['Division of Experimental Oncology 2, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico IRCCS, Aviano, Pordenone, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spectrophotometry/*methods', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/10/10 00:00,1997/10/10 00:01,['1997/10/10 00:00'],"['1997/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/108.4.383 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1997 Oct;108(4):383-90. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/108.4.383.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether the monoclonal antibody SN8 (CD79b) could improve our previous scoring system. Peripheral blood samples of 298 patients with CLL and 166 patients with non-CLL were analyzed by flow cytometry. Using the five standard markers, the accuracy of the scoring system was 91.8%, using a cutoff of 4 points or higher, to distinguish CLL from non-CLL. This was increased to 96.6% if SN8 was added and a cutoff of 4 points or higher was also used. A similar accuracy, 96.8%, was observed if CD22 was excluded and a cutoff of 3 points or higher was used.

We retrospectively assessed dysplastic changes in peripheral blood and bone marrow specimens obtained before and after transplantation from nine patients and correlated them with karyotype and survival. All patients had normal cytogenetic study results before transplantation and had clonal karyotypic abnormalities develop after auto-BMT. Four patients (with aggressive MDS) survived a short time and died of acute myelogenous leukemia or MDS-related complications, four (with indolent MDS) had a prolonged survival period, and one patient died of recurrent lymphoma. The group with aggressive MDS had significantly more bone marrow trilineage dysplasia before auto-BMT than did the group with indolent MDS or cytogenetically normal auto-BMT controls, suggesting that stem cell damage occurred before transplantation and was not detected by pretransplantation cytogenetic analysis. Comparatively greater dyserythropoiesis and dysmegakaryopoiesis were present after transplantation; these changes were similar to those seen in de novo MDS.

The current options for alternative donor sources include matched unrelated donor, mismatched related donor, and unrelated cord blood donor. Compared to a matched sibling donor, each of these options has an increased risk for graft failure and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). For patients who receive stem cells from matched unrelated donors or mismatched related donors, the risk of graft failure is 5% to 10% and the risk of GVHD approaches 80%. After unrelated cord blood transplants, the graft failure rate is 8%, but this is potentially offset by less severe GVHD.

Our experience with the two cases reported here has led us to propose guidelines for the treatment of initial PTE in a pediatric hematology unit. Two children with leukemia developed PTE, the first during the relapse for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and the second at the onset of acute promyelocytic leukemia. In both cases, the diagnosis of PTE was based on clinical assessment of sudden acute respiratory failure with positive pulmonary perfusional scintigraphy in spite of a negative chest X-ray. The subintensive supervision consisted of instrumental monitoring with the assistance of an intensive care anesthetist. The clinical monitoring was based on the serial registration of respiratory rate, cardiac rate, SaO2 and body temperature. The thrombolytic therapy, together with heparin prophylaxis, was successfully administered in the hematology ward without the need for intensive care support (i.e. mechanical ventilation). The success of the treatment was documented by the criterion of a return to the normal cardiorespiratory parameters a few hours after the start of the thrombolytic treatment. Furthermore, a chest CT scan in case 1 and an arteriography in case 2 confirmed the PTE-related hypoperfusion. On the basis of this experience, the authors point out that in the course of acute respiratory failure in leukemic children, the combination of a negative chest X-ray and a positive pulmonary perfusional scintigraphy (compared whenever possible with ventilatory scintigraphy) in the presence of a negative CT scan could be a reliable diagnostic tool for PTE. This pathology should be treated promptly and with specific therapy to avoid progression to a severe, massive PTE.","['Marchi, P', 'Uderzo, C', 'Riva, A', 'Rovelli, A', 'Biagi, E', 'Arrigo, C', 'Marraro, G', 'Masera, G']","['Marchi P', 'Uderzo C', 'Riva A', 'Rovelli A', 'Biagi E', 'Arrigo C', 'Marraro G', 'Masera G']","['Servizio di Anestesiologia, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)']",IM,"['Anticoagulants/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Heparin/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*complications/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/therapy', 'Pulmonary Embolism/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Time Factors']",1997/10/10 00:00,1997/10/10 00:01,['1997/10/10 00:00'],"['1997/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s005200050102 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 1997 Sep;5(5):417-20. doi: 10.1007/s005200050102.,,PMC7102284,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The pancreatic tumor diminished spontaneously without chemotherapy when ATL cells in the peripheral blood disappeared by spontaneous regression.","['Mizumoto, K', 'Suehara, N', 'Ohuchida, J', 'Kitada, H', 'Naritomi, G', 'Ogawa, Y', 'Ohshima, K', 'Sueishi, K', 'Tanaka, M']","['Mizumoto K', 'Suehara N', 'Ohuchida J', 'Kitada H', 'Naritomi G', 'Ogawa Y', 'Ohshima K', 'Sueishi K', 'Tanaka M']","['Department of Surgery 1, Kyushu University Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Int J Pancreatol,International journal of pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology,8703511,,IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', '*Leukemic Infiltration', 'Male', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*pathology']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/10/10 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02821612 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Pancreatol. 1997 Jun;21(3):253-7. doi: 10.1007/BF02821612.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is not clear whether induction therapy with all-trans-retinoic acid is superior to chemotherapy alone or whether maintenance treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid improves outcome. METHODS: Three hundred forty-six patients with previously untreated acute promyelocytic leukemia were randomly assigned to receive all-trans-retinoic acid or daunorubicin plus cytarabine as induction treatment. Patients who had a complete remission received consolidation therapy consisting of one cycle of treatment identical to the induction chemotherapy, then high-dose cytarabine plus daunorubicin. Patients still in complete remission after two cycles of consolidation therapy were then randomly assigned to maintenance treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid or to observation. RESULTS: Of the 174 patients treated with chemotherapy, 120 (69 percent) had a complete remission, as did 124 of the 172 (72 percent) given all-trans-retinoic acid (P=0.56). When both induction and maintenance treatments were taken into account, the estimated rates of disease-free survival at one, two, and three years were 77, 61, and 55 percent, respectively, for patients assigned to chemotherapy then all-trans-retinoic acid; 86, 75, and 75 percent for all-trans-retinoic acid then all-trans-retinoic acid; 75, 60, and 60 percent for all-trans-retinoic acid then observation; and 29, 18, and 18 percent for chemotherapy then observation. By intention-to-treat analysis, the rates of overall survival at one, two, and three years after entry into the study were 75, 57, and 50 percent, respectively, among patients assigned to chemotherapy, and 82, 72, and 67 percent among those assigned to all-trans-retinoic acid (P= 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: All-trans-retinoic acid as induction or maintenance treatment improves disease-free and overall survival as compared with chemotherapy alone and should be included in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia.","['Tallman, M S', 'Andersen, J W', 'Schiffer, C A', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Feusner, J H', 'Ogden, A', 'Shepherd, L', 'Willman, C', 'Bloomfield, C D', 'Rowe, J M', 'Wiernik, P H']","['Tallman MS', 'Andersen JW', 'Schiffer CA', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Feusner JH', 'Ogden A', 'Shepherd L', 'Willman C', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Rowe JM', 'Wiernik PH']","['Northwestern University Medical School, Robert H.

Ceramide, which accumulates in response to different types of cellular stress such as chemo- and radiotherapy, strongly induced expression of CD95-L, cleavage of caspases and apoptosis. Antisense CD95-L as well as dominant-negative FADD inhibited ceramide- and cellular stress-induced apoptosis. Fibroblasts from type A Niemann-Pick patients (NPA), genetically deficient in ceramide synthesis, failed to up-regulate CD95-L expression and to undergo apoptosis after gamma-irradiation or doxorubicin treatment. In contrast, JNK/SAPK activity was still inducible by doxorubicin in the NPA cells, suggesting that activation of JNK/SAPKs alone is not sufficient for induction of the CD95 system and apoptosis. CD95-L expression and apoptosis in NPA fibroblasts were restorable by exogenously added ceramide. In addition, NPA fibroblasts undergo apoptosis after triggering of CD95 with an agonistic antibody. These data demonstrate that ceramide links cellular stress responses induced by gamma-irradiation or anticancer drugs to the CD95 pathway of apoptosis.","['Herr, I', 'Wilhelm, D', 'Bohler, T', 'Angel, P', 'Debatin, K M']","['Herr I', 'Wilhelm D', 'Bohler T', 'Angel P', 'Debatin KM']","['Division of Molecular Oncology, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Ceramides/*metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Niemann-Pick Diseases/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/metabolism', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",1997/10/08 00:00,1997/10/08 00:01,['1997/10/08 00:00'],"['1997/10/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/08 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/16.20.6200 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 1997 Oct 15;16(20):6200-8. doi: 10.1093/emboj/16.20.6200.,,PMC1326304,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PI-3k/Akt pathway is essential for BCR/ABL leukemogenesis as indicated by experiments demonstrating that wortmannin, a PI-3k specific inhibitor at low concentrations, suppressed BCR/ABL-dependent colony formation of murine marrow cells, and that a kinase-deficient Akt mutant with dominant-negative activity inhibited BCR/ABL-dependent transformation of murine bone marrow cells in vitro and suppressed leukemia development in SCID mice. In complementation assays using mouse marrow progenitor cells, the ability of transformation-defective SH2 domain BCR/ABL mutants to induce growth factor-independent colony formation and leukemia in SCID mice was markedly enhanced by expression of constitutively active Akt. In retrovirally infected mouse marrow cells, the BCR/ABL mutant lacking the SH2 domain was unable to upregulate the expression of c-Myc and Bcl-2; in contrast, expression of a constitutively active Akt mutant induced Bcl-2 and c-Myc expression, and stimulated the transcription activation function of c-Myc. Together, these data demonstrate the requirement for the BCR/ABL SH2 domain in PI-3k activation and document the essential role of the PI-3k/Akt pathway in BCR/ABL leukemogenesis.","['Skorski, T', 'Bellacosa, A', 'Nieborowska-Skorska, M', 'Majewski, M', 'Martinez, R', 'Choi, J K', 'Trotta, R', 'Wlodarski, P', 'Perrotti, D', 'Chan, T O', 'Wasik, M A', 'Tsichlis, P N', 'Calabretta, B']","['Skorski T', 'Bellacosa A', 'Nieborowska-Skorska M', 'Majewski M', 'Martinez R', 'Choi JK', 'Trotta R', 'Wlodarski P', 'Perrotti D', 'Chan TO', 'Wasik MA', 'Tsichlis PN', 'Calabretta B']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],['1R29 CA70815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Genes, myc', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Liver/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spleen/pathology']",1997/10/08 00:00,1997/10/08 00:01,['1997/10/08 00:00'],"['1997/10/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/08 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/16.20.6151 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 1997 Oct 15;16(20):6151-61. doi: 10.1093/emboj/16.20.6151.,,PMC1326299,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer chemotherapy appears less effective in three neoplasms of older individuals: acute myelogenous leukemia, large cell lymphoma, and coelomic carcinoma of the ovary. In the case of acute myelogenous leukemia, a higher prevalence of MDR-1 expression and involvement of the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells in the neoplastic process contribute to chemotherapy resistance. Chemotherapy-related myelodepression, cardiotoxicity, and peripheral and central neurotoxicity are more common and more severe in older individuals. This toxicity results from the increased vulnerability of target organs and delayed excretion of renally excretable agents. The complications of chemotherapy may be ameliorated by modifying the doses of drugs according to the patient's creatinine clearance, by using antidotes to drug toxicity, and by the early diagnosis and timely management of therapeutic complications. A comprehensive assessment of the older person with cancer allows clinicians to predict the benefits and risks of cancer chemotherapy in individual circumstances.","['Balducci, L', 'Extermann, M']","['Balducci L', 'Extermann M']","['Department of Medicine, University of South Florida College of Medicine, Tampa, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aging/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Genes, MDR/genetics', 'Geriatric Assessment', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy']",1997/10/08 22:28,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/10/08 22:28'],"['1997/10/08 22:28 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/10/08 22:28 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19971001)80:7<1317::AID-CNCR18>3.0.CO;2-A [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1997 Oct 1;80(7):1317-22.,51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Delayed lymphocyte infusion (DLI) post-BMT can mediate a potent GVL effect with less graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) than would be observed if given early post-BMT. In vivo CD28/B7 blockade can reduce GVHD lethality, and B7 ligand expression can augment an antitumor immune response in mice. To examine the role of CD28/B7 interactions in DLI-mediated GVL, we established murine allogeneic BMT models in C57BL/6 (B6) recipients of C1498 (B6 acute myeloid leukemia) or EL4 (B6 acute T cell leukemia) that closely mimic human GVL. Recipients of C1498 and DLI had a marked reduction in relapse. GVL was blocked by anti-B7 mAb infusion. In contrast, recipients of EL4 cells and B10.BR DLI had a more modest GVL effect. The forced expression of B7-1 on EL4 cells markedly augmented the GVL effect of DLI, in contrast to the forced expression of B7-2 on EL4 cells. Relapse rates observed in recipients of C1498-B7-1 and DLI were significantly lower than in recipients of parental C1498 cells. We conclude that the administration of anti-B7 mAbs may impair the GVL effect of DLI and that the forced expression of B7-1 ligands stimulates a GVL effect without adversely affecting the GVHD lethality effect of DLI.","['Blazar, B R', 'Taylor, P A', 'Boyer, M W', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari, A', 'Allison, J P', 'Vallera, D A']","['Blazar BR', 'Taylor PA', 'Boyer MW', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari A', 'Allison JP', 'Vallera DA']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota Hospital and Clinic, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01-CA21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI34495/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA72669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Cd86 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'B7-1 Antigen/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology/mortality', 'CD28 Antigens/*metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/transplantation', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/transplantation', 'Graft vs Host Reaction/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Spleen/cytology/transplantation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/10/08 00:00,1997/10/08 00:01,['1997/10/08 00:00'],"['1997/10/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/08 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1997 Oct 1;159(7):3460-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the recent identification and cloning of at least seven distinct G protein-coupled ATP receptor subtypes (P2Y family), we investigated P2Y receptor subtype expression during myeloid cell differentiation. We observed that KG-1 myeloblasts express P2Y1 but not P2Y2 receptors (previously termed P2U receptors), whereas later myeloid progenitors, including HL-60 promyelocytes and THP-1 monocytes, expressed P2Y2 but not P2Y1 receptors. In KG-1 cells, significant activation of Ca2+ mobilization by P2Y1 receptors was only observed after preincubation with potato apyrase, an exogenous ATPase. This indicated that P2Y1 receptors are desensitized in KG-1 cells by autocrine mechanisms that may involve enhanced release of endogenous nucleotides and/or decreased expression of cell-surface ecto-nucleotidases. We compared the levels of ecto-apyrase activity and expression in KG-1 myeloblasts and HL-60 promyelocytes. Extracellular ATP was rapidly metabolized by HL-60 but not by KG-1 cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that mRNA for CD39 (cluster of differentiation), an identified ecto-apyrase, was present in HL-60 but not KG-1 cells. Ecto-apyrase activity was modestly increased with differentiation of myeloid progenitors with either phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (DBcAMP). Differentiation of HL-60 cells with PMA, but not DBcAMP, strongly induced ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity and CD73 mRNA expression. These observations indicate that signal transduction by extracellular ATP in myeloid leukocytes can be regulated by developmentally programmed changes in the expression of P2Y receptor subtypes and multiple ecto-nucleotidases.","['Clifford, E E', 'Martin, K A', 'Dalal, P', 'Thomas, R', 'Dubyak, G R']","['Clifford EE', 'Martin KA', 'Dalal P', 'Thomas R', 'Dubyak GR']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106-4970, USA.']",['eng'],"['GM-36387/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-07678/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '415SHH325A (Adenosine Monophosphate)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)"", 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.5 (Apyrase)', 'EC 3.6.1.5 (CD39 antigen)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'UT0S826Z60 (Uridine Triphosphate)']",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/*biosynthesis"", 'Adenosine Diphosphate/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Monophosphate/pharmacology', '*Adenosine Triphosphatases', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Apyrase/*biosynthesis', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cytosol/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Leukocytes/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/*biosynthesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uridine Triphosphate/pharmacology']",1997/10/08 00:00,1997/10/08 00:01,['1997/10/08 00:00'],"['1997/10/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/08 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/ajpcell.1997.273.3.C973 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1997 Sep;273(3 Pt 1):C973-87. doi: 10.1152/ajpcell.1997.273.3.C973.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

X-gal assay revealed marked beta-gal activity, both in total muscles and whole muscle fibers on histological sections, up to three months after transfection. The most intensive staining was observed after SV40-lacZ delivery. No staining was detected with LTR-lacZneo DNA as well as in untreated muscles. The higher tungsten particle concentration in the bombardment mixture correlated with more intense X-gal staining. At the gold/tungsten ratio of 1:4 the microparticles penetrated the musculus glutaeus superficialis and transfected the underlying musculus glutaeus medius as well. Immuno-cytochemical assay for human dystrophin revealed dystrophin positive myofibers (DPM) in the bombarded area up to two months after transfection. The proportion of DMP varied from 2.5% on day 17 up two 5% on day 60 after bombardment compared to only 0.5% in the control mdx mice.

In B cells, previous studies showed replication timing to be early throughout the immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) locus. The implication from replication timing studies in the B-cell line MPC11 was that early replication of the Igh locus was regulated by sequences downstream of the C alpha gene. A potential candidate for these replication control sequences was the 3' regulatory region of the Igh locus. Our results demonstrate, however, that the Igh locus maintains early replication in a B-cell line in which the 3' regulatory region has been deleted from one allele, thus indicating that replication timing of the locus is independent of this region. In non-B cells (murine erythroleukemia cells [MEL]), previous studies of segments within the mouse Igh locus demonstrated that DNA replication likely initiated downstream of the Igh gene cluster. Here we use recently cloned DNA to demonstrate that segments located sequentially downstream of the Igh 3' regulatory region continue to replicate progressively earlier in S phase in MEL. Furthermore, analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis indicates that replication forks proceed exclusively in the 3'-to-5' direction through the region 3' of the Igh locus. Extrapolation from these data predicts that initiation of DNA replication occurs in MEL at one or more sites within a 90-kb interval located between 40 and 130 kb downstream of the 3' regulatory region.","['Michaelson, J S', 'Ermakova, O', 'Birshtein, B K', 'Ashouian, N', 'Chevillard, C', 'Riblet, R', 'Schildkraut, C L']","['Michaelson JS', 'Ermakova O', 'Birshtein BK', 'Ashouian N', 'Chevillard C', 'Riblet R', 'Schildkraut CL']","['Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['AI23438/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM45751/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37AI13509/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Replication/*genetics/immunology', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Globins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', 'Replicon/genetics', 'S Phase/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/10/07 00:00,1997/10/07 00:01,['1997/10/07 00:00'],"['1997/10/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/07 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.17.10.6167 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1997 Oct;17(10):6167-74. doi: 10.1128/MCB.17.10.6167.,,PMC232467,"['GENBANK/AF005484', 'GENBANK/AF017981', 'GENBANK/AF017982', 'GENBANK/AF019135']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This enhancer-independent expression of the alpha-globin gene requires extensive sequences not only from the 5' flanking sequence but also from the intragenic region. However, the features of these internal sequences that are responsible for their positive effect are unclear. We tested several possible determinants of this activity. One possibility is that a previously identified array of discrete binding sites for known and potential regulatory proteins within the alpha-globin gene comprise an intragenic enhancer specific for the alpha-globin promoter, but directed rearrangements of the sequences show that this is not the case. Alternatively, the promoter may extend into the gene, with the function of the discrete binding sites being dependent on maintenance of their proper positions and orientations relative to the 5' flanking sequence. However, the positive effects observed in gene fusions do not localize to a discrete region of the alpha-globin gene and the results of internal deletions and point mutations argue against a required role of the targeted discrete binding sites. A third possibility is that the CpG island, which includes both the 5' flanking and intragenic regions associated with the positive activity, may itself have a more general effect on expression in transfected cells. Indeed, we show that the size of the CpG island in constructs correlates with the level of gene expression. Furthermore, the alpha-globin promoter is more active in the context of a previously inactive CpG island than in an A+T-rich context, showing that the CpG island provides an environment more permissive for expression. These effects are seen only after integration, suggesting a possible mechanism at the level of chromatin structure.","['Shewchuk, B M', 'Hardison, R C']","['Shewchuk BM', 'Hardison RC']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Center for Gene Regulation, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, 16802, USA.']",['eng'],"['DK27635/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'LM05110/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', 'LM05773/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Composition', 'CpG Islands/*genetics', 'DNA/chemistry', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Multigene Family/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Pseudogenes/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rabbits', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/10/07 00:00,1997/10/07 00:01,['1997/10/07 00:00'],"['1997/10/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/07 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.17.10.5856 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1997 Oct;17(10):5856-66. doi: 10.1128/MCB.17.10.5856.,,PMC232433,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although Pbx proteins have been shown to dimerize with Hox proteins and modulate their DNA binding properties in vitro, the biochemical compositions of endogenous Pbx-containing complexes have not been determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that Pbx and Meis proteins form abundant complexes that comprise a major Pbx-containing DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts of cultured cells and mouse embryos. Pbx1 and Meis1 dimerize in solution and cooperatively bind bipartite DNA sequences consisting of directly adjacent Pbx and Meis half sites. Pbx1-Meis1 heterodimers display distinctive DNA binding specificities and cross-bind to a subset of Pbx-Hox sites, including those previously implicated as response elements for the execution of Pbx-dependent Hox programs in vivo.

The breakpoints were localized to intron 7 of FUS, intron 1 of CHOP, an intronic sequence of ERG and intron 7 of EWS. In two MLS cases with t(12;16) and in the AML, the breaks in intron 7 of FUS had occurred close to each other, a few nucleotides downstream from a TG dinucleotide repeat region. The break in the two MLS had occurred in the same ATGGTG hexamer and in the AML 40 nucleotides upstream from the hexamer. The third case of t(12;16) MLS had a break upstream and near a TC-dinucleotide repeat region and a sequence similar to the chi bacterial recombination element was found to flank the breakpoint. In the MLS with the EWS/ CHOP hybrid gene, the break in intron 7 of EWS had occurred close to an Alu sequence. Similarly, in all 4 MLS, the breaks in intron 1 of CHOP were near an Alu sequence. No Alu or other repetitive sequences were found 250 bp upstream or downstream from the break in the ERG intron involved in the AML case. In the AML, the MLS with ESW/CHOP and in one MLS with FUS/CHOP there were one, two and six, respectively, nucleotide identity between the contributing germline sequences in the breakpoint. In the other two MLS cases, two and three extra nucleotides of unknown origin were inserted between the FUS and CHOP sequences.

Mice lacking CBF subunits or expressing the CBF beta-SMMHC or AML1-ETO oncoproteins failed to develop definitive hematopoiesis. To investigate these effects on hematopoiesis, we expressed CBF beta-SMMHC from the metallothionein promoter, in both 32D cl3 myeloid cells and Ba/F3 B-lymphoid cells. Addition of zinc increased CBF beta-SMMHC levels more than tenfold, with higher levels evident in Ba/F3 lines. Levels obtained in 32D cl3 cells were similar to those of endogenous CBF beta. Indirect immunofluorescence revealed zinc-inducible speckled, nuclear staining in Ba/F3 cells and diffuse nuclear staining in 32D cl3 cells. CBF beta-SMMHC reduced endogenous CBF DNA-binding fivefold in both cell types, increased cell generation time 1.9-fold, on average, in 32D cl3 cells and 1.5-fold in Ba/ F3 cells and decreased tritiated thymidine incorporation into DNA correspondingly.

Neither apoptosis nor 32D differentiation was induced by zinc in IL-3 in these lines. Induction of CBF beta-SMMHC in 32D cl3 cells did not inhibit their differentiation to neutrophils or their expression of myeloperoxidase mRNA in G-CSF, and did not produce an eosinophilic phenotype.

Moreover, NPM was overexpressed in several clinical leukemia samples and human-derived leukemia cell lines. Finally, overexpression of NPM in NIH3T3 cells resulted in malignant transformation.

RESULTS: Excess deaths among nurses less than 65 years of age were seen in both comparison groups for viral hepatitis, cancer of the nasal cavities, accidental falls, suicide, and drug-related deaths. Among nurses 65 years old or older, deaths due to chronic myeloid leukemia were in excess.

ICMs isolated from early blastocysts (Day 7 of pregnancy) and epiblasts isolated from preelongated blastocysts (Day 11 of pregnancy) were cultured for up to 5 days in the presence of human leukemia inhibitory factor (hLIF) (1000 U/ml). The proliferation rate was evaluated by determination of the percentage of cells in S-phase. The differentiation state was determined by studying the expression of the stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA-1), a marker for undifferentiated murine embryonic stem (ES) cells, and the expression of laminin and cytokeratins 8/18, markers of ES cell differentiation. The staining pattern showed that freshly collected Day 11 epiblasts appeared undifferentiated but rapidly lost this characteristic in vitro. A decrease in the proliferation rate was also observed during culture. This decrease was reduced in the presence of high concentrations of hLIF (optimal concentrations: 5000 U/ml). Conversely, treatment of Day 11 epiblast cells with retinoic acid, an agent known to induce differentiation in murine ES cells, caused a dramatic decrease in the proliferation rate in vitro. In contrast to Day 11 epiblasts, Day 7 ICMs expressed SSEA-1 in vitro and showed a higher proliferation rate (p < 0.01). However, their proliferation rate also decreased during culture and following trypsinization. These results indicate that the undifferentiated characteristics of Day 7 ICMs are more likely to be maintained in vitro than are those of Day 11 epiblasts, which are rapidly committed into early differentiation.","['Wianny, F', 'Perreau, C', 'Hochereau de Reviers, M T']","['Wianny F', 'Perreau C', 'Hochereau de Reviers MT']","['INRA, URA-CNRS 1291, Nouzilly, France. florence.wianny@ens-lyon.fr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/*cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lewis X Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Pregnancy', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Swine', 'Tretinoin/metabolism']",1997/10/07 00:00,1997/10/07 00:01,['1997/10/07 00:00'],"['1997/10/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/07 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1095/biolreprod57.4.756 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Reprod. 1997 Oct;57(4):756-64. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod57.4.756.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In three different leukemia cell lines, we showed that agents that directly (carbobenzoxy-Ala-Ala-borophe (DK120) or indirectly inhibit activation of AP24 (protein kinase inhibitors, basic fibroblast growth factor, tosylphenylalaninechloromethylketone, and caspase inhibitors) protected cells from apoptosis induced by TNF or UV light. Only the caspase inhibitors, however, prevented activation of CPP32-like activity as revealed by cleavage of the synthetic substrate, DEVD-pNa, by cell cytosols, and also by in vivo cleavage of poly (ADP-ribosyl) polymerase, a known substrate of CPP32. Activation of DEVD-pNa cleaving activity without apoptosis was also demonstrated in two variants derived from the U937 monocytic leukemia in the absence of exogenous inhibitors. Cell-permeable peptide inhibitors selective for CPP32-like proteases suppressed AP24 activation and apoptotic death. These findings indicate that CPP32-like activity is one of several upstream signals required for AP24 activation.

CASE REPORT: We report on a 27-year-old man with chronic myelocytic leukemia and asymptomatic chronic hepatitis B who received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The donor was his HLA identical brother with natural immunity against hepatitis B. Before BMT the donor had received an additional dose of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. Twenty days after BMT alanine aminotransferase levels increased and graft versus host disease of the skin was observed. Elevation of liver enzymes was initially attributed to graft versus host disease of the liver and the patient received high doses of steroids in addition to standard immunosuppression. Alanine aminotransferase levels increased up to a maximum on day 52 while the HBV DNA level peaked on day 38 after BMT. A liver biopsy showed reactivation of hepatitis B and treatment with steroids was tapered down. Although alanine aminotransferase and HBV DNA levels decreased, liver function deteriorated. The patient died 130 days after BMT due to liver failure. CONCLUSION: This report indicates that disturbance of the balance between HBV replication and immune control after BMT may result in fatal reactivation of hepatitis B. Careful monitoring, including HBV DNA level and early liver biopsy, of patients with chronic hepatitis B undergoing BMT as well as determination of the HBV immune status of the BMT donor is suggested and necessary.","['Caselitz, M', 'Link, H', 'Hein, R', 'Maschek, H', 'Boker, K', 'Poliwoda, H', 'Manns, M P']","['Caselitz M', 'Link H', 'Hein R', 'Maschek H', 'Boker K', 'Poliwoda H', 'Manns MP']","['Dept. of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Medical School of Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,J Hepatol,Journal of hepatology,8503886,,IM,"['*Adoptive Transfer', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Hepatitis B, Chronic/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/*therapy', 'Liver Failure/*etiology', 'Male', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1997/10/06 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/10/06 00:00'],"['1997/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0168-8278(97)80363-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-8278(97)80363-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Hepatol. 1997 Sep;27(3):572-7. doi: 10.1016/s0168-8278(97)80363-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These HCV replication systems were used to assess the infective potencies of seven sera containing more than 10(6) HCV genomes per ml obtained from HCV-positive blood donors. RESULTS: The results showed that these sera had different infectivities for MT-2 and PH5CH cells. One of the seven sera, 1B-1, was more infective for MT-2 cells than PH5CH cells, whereas all the sera except serum 1B-1 were more infective for PH5CH cells than for MT-2 cells. Intracellular HCV RNA could be detected at least 30 days after inoculation with three of the sera. These findings suggested that the infective potency of each serum depends on the type of target cells. To further investigate HCV replication in these cells, we examined the hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) populations of HCV recovered from both MT-2 and PH5CH cells at 8 days postinoculation. The results revealed that the shift to limited HVR1 populations from the quasi-species of HVR1 populations in both cells usually occurred within 8 days after virus inoculation. Furthermore, in two of four sera, the predominant HVR1 populations in MT-2 and PH5CH cells appeared to be different.

Marrow hematopoietic progenitors were investigated by a short-term methylcellulose assay quantitating multipotent CFU-Mix, erythroid BFU-E and granulocyte-macrophage CFU-GM, as well as a long-term assay quantitating long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC). The marrow microenvironment was studied by evaluating the incidence of fibroblastoid progenitors (CFU-F) and the capacity of stromal layers to support allogeneic hematopoietic progenitors. As compared to normal controls (n = 57), AML patients (n = 26) showed a statistically significant reduction of the mean (+/-s.e.m.) number of CFU-Mix (5.3 +/- 0.6 vs 0.8 +/- 0.2, P < or = 0.0001), BFU-E (68 +/- 5 vs 20 +/- 4, P < or = 0.0001), CFU-GM (198 +/- 11 vs 144 +/- 15, P < or = 0.008), and LTC-IC (302 +/- 46 vs 50 +/- 8, P < or = 0.001). The mean (+/-s.e.m.) incidence of marrow CFU-F was not significantly reduced as compared to normal controls (48 +/- 6 vs 52 +/- 7, P < or = 0.73). Seventeen AML stromal layers were tested for their capacity to support the growth of allogeneic hematopoietic progenitors. Seven samples failed to support any progenitor cell growth, seven had a significantly lower supportive activity as compared to normal stromal layers (13 +/- 5 vs 249 +/- 56, P < or = 0.002), whereas three cultures could not be analyzed due to contamination. In conclusion, induction and consolidation regimens used in AML patients of the AML10 protocol induce a markedly defective in vitro growth of primitive hematopoietic progenitors and a severe functional defect of marrow stroma. The association of hematopoietic with microenvironmental damage might play a key role in the delayed hematopoietic regeneration observed following ABMT in patients of the AML10 trial.","['Carlo-Stella, C', 'Tabilio, A', 'Regazzi, E', 'Garau, D', 'La Tagliata, R', 'Trasarti, S', 'Andrizzi, C', 'Vignetti, M', 'Meloni, G']","['Carlo-Stella C', 'Tabilio A', 'Regazzi E', 'Garau D', 'La Tagliata R', 'Trasarti S', 'Andrizzi C', 'Vignetti M', 'Meloni G']","['Department of Hematology, University of Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/pathology']",1997/10/06 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/10/06 00:00'],"['1997/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700916 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Sep;20(6):465-71. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700916.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The thrombocytopenia associated with ABMT generally lasts 14-18 days, and is associated with variable platelet transfusion requirements. Little, if any, data exist examining prognostic parameters for platelet transfusion requirements during autologous transplantation. We retrospectively examined 286 consecutive patients undergoing autologous transplantation from 1 January 1994 to 1 June 1996 with respect to platelet engraftment and platelet transfusion requirements. One hundred and fifty four patients were transplanted for breast cancer (54%), 72 for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (25%), 35 for Hodgkin's disease (12%), 13 for acute leukemia (5%), eight for myeloma (3%), and four for other malignancy (1%). The median age was 44. All patients received cytokine priming, usually with G-CSF, for the procurement of PBPC. The median number of CD34+ cells collected was 4.3 x 10(6)/kg. All patients received a chemotherapeutic preparative regimen and all received an autologous transplant using PBPC alone. The median time to a platelet count of 20 x 10(9)/l was 13 days. Patients beginning the transplant with a less than normal platelet count (less than 150 x 10(9)/l) engrafted in 17 days, and received a median number of seven platelet transfusions, as compared with platelet engraftment of 12 days, and four platelet transfusions, for patients beginning the transplant with a normal platelet count (P = 0.001).

In most cell types investigated the nuclear matrix does not spontaneously resist these treatments but must be stabilized before the application of extracting agents. Incubation of isolated nuclei at 37C or 42C in buffers containing Mg++ has been widely employed as stabilizing agent. We have previously demonstrated that heat treatment induces changes in the distribution of three nuclear scaffold proteins in nuclei prepared in the absence of Mg++ ions. We studied whether different concentrations of Mg++ (2.0-5 mM) affect the spatial distribution of nuclear matrix proteins in nuclei isolated from K562 erythroleukemia cells and stabilized by heat at either 37C or 42C. Five proteins were studied, two of which were RNA metabolism-related proteins (a 105-kD component of splicing complexes and an RNP component), one a 126-kD constituent of a class of nuclear bodies, and two were components of the inner matrix network.

The incubation of the IL-1beta- responsive AML cell line OCIM2 with 10 nM 1,25D3 reduced growth 80% in liquid culture, and a 100-1000-fold lower concentration of 20-epi analogues (MC1288 and MC1301) was sufficient to achieve similar growth inhibition. The growth inhibition was associated with a rapid but transient downregulation of IL-1beta and IL-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE) mRNAs in 1,25D3- and 20-epi analogue- treated cells, and the 20-epi analogue was more effective than 1,25D3 in repressing ICE expression. An examination of long-term changes in the levels of mature IL-1beta and its precursor revealed that 24-h incubation of OCIM2 with either 1,25D3 or its 20-epi analogues abolished the production of mature IL-1beta. The effect of 1,25D3 and its analogues on growth of fresh bone marrow cells from seven AML patients was tested by a clonogenic assay. Growth inhibition of 60% was reached in only one of seven 1,25D3-treated samples, but all seven samples were inhibited 60-90% by the 20-epi analogue MC1301. Growth inhibition by 1,25D3 and the analogue was reversible by addition of IL-1beta. These results suggest that 1,25D3 and its 20-epi analogues interrupt IL-1beta autocrine growth regulation by inhibiting IL-1beta production and processing but not the response to IL-1beta.","['Peleg, S', 'Qiu, H', 'Reddy, S', 'Harris, D', 'Van, Q', 'Estey, E H', 'Talpaz, M', 'Estrov, Z']","['Peleg S', 'Qiu H', 'Reddy S', 'Harris D', 'Van Q', 'Estey EH', 'Talpaz M', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Medical Specialties, The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['CA-55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '128312-71-0 (CB 966)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Caspase 1', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/10/06 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/10/06 00:00'],"['1997/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI119696 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1997 Oct 1;100(7):1716-24. doi: 10.1172/JCI119696.,,PMC508354,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of transformation, however, is complex and not well understood. One of the important contributions of BCR to transformation is believed to be dimerization or oligomerization of ABL, thereby activating ABL tyrosine kinase activity. We reasoned that if ABL was dimerized through other mechanisms, activation of the tyrosine kinase activity should also result, and the activated kinase may also be transforming. Erythropoietin is known to activate its receptor by causing dimerization, and therefore a synthetic oncogene was created by linking the extracytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of the EPO receptor with c-ABL. This chimeric receptor was stably expressed in Ba/F3 cells and, in the absence of EPO, had no detectable biological effect on the cells. EPO, however, induced a rapid, dose-dependent activation of ABL tyrosine kinase activity and phosphorylation of several cellular proteins. The major target proteins have been identified, and are very similar to the known substrates of BCR/ABL, including Shc, CBL, CRKL, and several proteins in the cytoskeleton. EPO treatment also resulted in biological effects that were remarkably similar to those of BCR/ABL, including improved viability, altered integrin function, and a weak mitogenic signal. The biological effects were in part dose-dependent, in that low EPO concentrations enhanced viability but did not cause proliferation. At high EPO doses, kinase activation was maximal, and a mitogenic effect was also revealed. In nude mice, Ba/F3 cells expressing this chimeric receptor did not cause detectable disease without administration of pharmacologic doses of EPO. If EPO was given intraperitoneally 5 days a week, however, a dose-dependent lethal leukemia resulted. This ligand-regulatable oncogene mimics some of the biological effects of BCR/ABL, and analysis of ABL mutants in this system will be useful to dissect the signaling pathways that cause CML.","['Okuda, K', ""D'Andrea, A"", 'Etten, R A', 'Griffin, J D']","['Okuda K', ""D'Andrea A"", 'Etten RA', 'Griffin JD']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK560654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis']",1997/10/06 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/10/06 00:00'],"['1997/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI119695 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1997 Oct 1;100(7):1708-15. doi: 10.1172/JCI119695.,,PMC508353,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From studies in the mouse, it emerged that CD5+ B cells represent a separate lineage of B lymphocytes that, in contrast to conventional (CD5-) B cells, are not driven into T cell-dependent immune responses in which rearranged variable (V) region genes are diversified by somatic hypermutation. Against this background it came as a surprise that human disease-involved CD5-positive autoreactive B cells as well as B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias can harbor somatically mutated V region genes. Recent V gene analyses on CD5+ B cells in healthy adults did not give rise to a clear picture about the fraction of somatically mutated among all CD5+ B cells. In this work we used a molecular single-cell analysis to determine reliably the frequency of mutated CD5+ B cells in healthy humans: single, kappa light chain-expressing CD5+ peripheral blood B cells were isolated by flow cytometry, and rearranged Vkappa genes were amplified by PCR. From one donor, CD5+CD19+ B cells were analyzed. Since CD5+ B cells were found among IgM+IgD+ and IgM+IgD- cells (but almost not among class-switched cells) from two other donors, individual cells corresponding to these IgM-expressing subsets were investigated separately. The sequence analysis of rearranged Vkappa genes revealed that most if not all CD5+ B cells in healthy humans carry unmutated V region genes. From one of the donors, a novel polymorphic Jkappa2 gene segment was identified. To explain the discrepancy between the frequent occurrence of disease-associated somatically mutated CD5+ B cells and the low incidence or absence of somatic mutation in normal CD5+ B cells, we speculate that CD5+ B cells usually do not participate in germinal center reactions, but if they occasionally do so, they may be at an increased risk to become involved in autoimmune diseases or B cell malignancies.","['Fischer, M', 'Klein, U', 'Kuppers, R']","['Fischer M', 'Klein U', 'Kuppers R']","['Institute for Genetics, University of Cologne, 50931 Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin D)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD19', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/*immunology', '*CD5 Antigens', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Light Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin D/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin M/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/etiology', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",1997/10/06 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/10/06 00:00'],"['1997/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI119691 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1997 Oct 1;100(7):1667-76. doi: 10.1172/JCI119691.,,PMC508349,"['GENBANK/Z98605', 'GENBANK/Z98606', 'GENBANK/Z98607', 'GENBANK/Z98608', 'GENBANK/Z98609', 'GENBANK/Z98610', 'GENBANK/Z98611', 'GENBANK/Z98612', 'GENBANK/Z98613', 'GENBANK/Z98614', 'GENBANK/Z98615', 'GENBANK/Z98616', 'GENBANK/Z98617', 'GENBANK/Z98618', 'GENBANK/Z98619', 'GENBANK/Z98620', 'GENBANK/Z98621', 'GENBANK/Z98622', 'GENBANK/Z98623', 'GENBANK/Z98624', 'GENBANK/Z98625', 'GENBANK/Z98626', 'GENBANK/Z98627', 'GENBANK/Z98628', 'GENBANK/Z98629', 'GENBANK/Z98630', 'GENBANK/Z98631', 'GENBANK/Z98632', 'GENBANK/Z98633', 'GENBANK/Z98634', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To test the hypothesis that lineage-specific transcription factors promote transgene expression from the HTLV-I-LTR in osteoclasts, we first examined tax expression in transgenic bone marrow cultures. Expression was dependent on 1alpha,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol and coincided with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) expression, a marker of osteoclast differentiation. Furthermore, Tax was expressed in vitronectin receptor-positive mononuclear precursors as well as in mature osteoclast-like cells (OCLs). Consistent with our hypothesis, electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed the presence of an OCL nuclear factor (NFOC-1) that binds to the LTR 21-base pair direct repeat, a region critical for the promoter activity. This binding is further enhanced by Tax. Since NFOC-1 is absent in macrophages and conserved in osteoclasts among species including human, such a factor may play a role in lineage determination and/or in expression of the differentiated osteoclast phenotype.","['Inoue, D', 'Santiago, P', 'Horne, W C', 'Baron, R']","['Inoue D', 'Santiago P', 'Horne WC', 'Baron R']","['Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Base Composition', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Osteoclasts/cytology/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",1997/10/06 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/10/06 00:00'],"['1997/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.40.25386 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)63558-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Oct 3;272(40):25386-93. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.40.25386.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is now reported that the steady state levels of FPGS mRNA in normal and neoplastic cells reflect these patterns, supporting the concept that the control mechanisms underlying this distribution are transcriptional. To initiate an understanding of these interacting levels of control, we have determined the position and properties of the minimal FPGS promoter controlling transcription of the FPGS gene in human CEM leukemia cells, a line which expresses high levels of this enzyme and its mRNA. The TATA-less region immediately upstream of the major transcriptional start site previously mapped in human tumor cells, which includes several GC- and Y-boxes, functioned as a remarkably efficient promoter when used to drive expression of a luciferase reporter in transient expression studies in CEM cells. The minimal region of the FPGS promoter required for maximal transcriptional activation in CEM cells included the 80 base pairs over which the multiple transcriptional start sites were located, and the 43 base pairs immediately upstream. DNase I footprint analysis detected the binding of Sp1 at all seven of the consensus sites within the probe used, two of which are contained within the minimal promoter region. The several Sp1 sites immediately upstream of the first major transcriptional start activated transcription in Drosophila cells when cotransfected with an Sp1 construct, including those in the region which functioned as a minimal promoter in CEM cells. An additional region of the minimal promoter, situated between the two translational start codons of the FPGS gene, was bound by protein(s) from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. We conclude that transcription of the FPGS gene in CEM cells involves transactivation events over a limited upstream DNA sequence and that the FPGS promoter used in proliferating human leukemic cells has strong similarity to other TATA-less promoters that utilize tandem, closely spaced Sp1 sites to initiate transcription.","['Freemantle, S J', 'Moran, R G']","['Freemantle SJ', 'Moran RG']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology and the Massey Cancer Center, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA 27605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 39687/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Codon', 'DNA Probes', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Synthases/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/10/06 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/10/06 00:00'],"['1997/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.40.25373 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)63556-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Oct 3;272(40):25373-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.40.25373.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pre-leukemic phase of Friend erythroleukemia results from activation of the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) by the spleen focus forming virus (SFFV) envelope glycoprotein, followed by the emergence of leukemic clones characterized by overexpression of Spi-1 and mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. We developed a heterologous system to analyze the contribution of these alterations to the induction of primary erythroblast transformation. Avian erythroblasts expressing the activated mouse EpoR(R129C) differentiated into erythrocytes in response to hEpo. Expression of Spi-1 in these cells inhibited this ability to differentiate and rescued the cells from the apoptotic cell death program normally induced upon hEpo withdrawal. Although devoid of any effect by itself, a mutant p53 cooperated with Spi-1 and EpoR(R129C) to reinforce both phenotypes. Analysis of erythroblasts co-expressing Spi-1 and the wild-type mouse EpoR showed that differentiation arrest and inhibition of apoptosis depended on specific cooperation between Spi-1 and EpoR(R129C). This cooperation was also required to induce the sustained proliferation of differentiation-blocked erythroblasts in response to ligand activation of the endogenous tyrosine kinase receptor c-Kit. These results show that Spi-1/PU.1 requires signals emanating from specific cytokine and growth factor receptors to affect the survival, proliferation and differentiation control of primary erythroblasts. They also suggest that the function of Spi-1/PU.1 in the late phase of Friend leukemia requires specific signaling from the gp55-modified EpoR generated during the early phase of the disease.","['Quang, C T', 'Wessely, O', 'Pironin, M', 'Beug, H', 'Ghysdael, J']","['Quang CT', 'Wessely O', 'Pironin M', 'Beug H', 'Ghysdael J']","['CNRS UMR146, Institut Curie, Section de Recherche, Centre Universitaire, Batiment 110, 91405 Orsay, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Chickens', 'Erythroblasts/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/genetics', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism']",1997/10/06 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/10/06 00:00'],"['1997/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/16.18.5639 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 1997 Sep 15;16(18):5639-53. doi: 10.1093/emboj/16.18.5639.,,PMC1170196,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The region has also been proposed to be the GALV binding site, but this lacks empirical support. Whether an acidic residue at the first position in this sequence is a definitive requirement for GALV infection has also remained unclear; certain receptors retain function even in the absence of this acidic residue. We report here that in Pit1 an acidic residue is dispensable not only at position 550 but also at 553 alone and at both positions. Further, the virus requires no specific residue at either position. Mutations generated a collection of region A sequences, often with fundamentally different physicochemical properties (overall hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity and net charge of -1, or 0, or +1), and yet Pit1 remained an efficient GALV receptor. A comparison of these sequences and a few previously published ones from highly efficient GALV receptors revealed that every position in region A can vary without affecting GALV entry. Even Pit2 is nonfunctional for GALV only because it has lysine at the first position in its region A, which is otherwise highly diverse from region A of Pit1. We propose that region A itself is not the GALV binding motif and that other sequences are required for virus entry. Indeed, certain Pit1/Pit2 chimeras revealed that sequences outside domain IV are specifically important for GALV infection.","['Chaudry, G J', 'Eiden, M V']","['Chaudry GJ', 'Eiden MV']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Regulation, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-4068, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Hylobates', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/*metabolism/*pathogenicity', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Point Mutation', 'Receptors, Virus/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*virology']",1997/10/06 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/10/06 00:00'],"['1997/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.10.8078-8081.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Oct;71(10):8078-81. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.10.8078-8081.1997.,,PMC192175,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, further elucidation of the roles of the extracellular loops in infection is hampered by the high level of sequence similarity among these proteins. The sodium-dependent phosphate transporter, Pho-4, from the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa is distantly related to Pit1 and -2, showing an amino acid identity of only 35% to Pit1 in the putative extracellular loops. We show here that Pho-4 itself does not function as a receptor for GALV. Introduction of 12 Pit1-specific amino acid residues in the putative fourth extracellular loop of Pho-4 resulted in a functional GALV receptor.

The limited efficiency of gene transfer using these vectors hampers implementation of gene therapy. Successful integration of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMuLV)-derived retroviral vectors into the host cell DNA requires cell division. The time difference between virus entry and cell division is variable and prolonged in slowly dividing cells. Therefore, the rate of intracellular decay of internalized vectors between the time of entry into the target cell and cell division may limit the probability of successful integration following viral entry. We present two methods that measure the intracellular stability of MMuLV-derived retroviral vectors in NIH 3T3 cells. The first is based on a temporary interruption of cell cycle progression by using cell detachment. This method provides an estimate, but not a direct measurement, of the half-life. The results show that the MMuLV intracellular half-life is on the order of but shorter than the total cell cycle time. The second method allows the direct measurement of the intracellular half-life by using two cell cycle-specific labels: 5-bromodeoxyuridine, a thymidine analog that labels cells in S-phase; and the viral vector that labels cells in mitosis. By varying the time between the administration of the two labels, the intracellular half-life is measured to be in the range of 5.5 to 7.5 h. Such a short intracellular half-life may restrict the efficiency of gene transfer by retroviral vectors, particularly in slowly dividing target cells.","['Andreadis, S T', 'Brott, D', 'Fuller, A O', 'Palsson, B O']","['Andreadis ST', 'Brott D', 'Fuller AO', 'Palsson BO']","['Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', '*Cell Cycle', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors/*pharmacokinetics', 'Half-Life', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'S Phase', 'Trypsin', '*Virus Integration', 'beta-Galactosidase/biosynthesis']",1997/10/06 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/10/06 00:00'],"['1997/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.10.7541-7548.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Oct;71(10):7541-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.10.7541-7548.1997.,,PMC192101,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major genetic determinant of disease is the transcriptional enhancer, which consists of a repeated region with densely packed binding sites for several transcription factors, including AML1 (also known as core binding factor and polyoma enhancer-binding protein 2) and nuclear factor 1 (NF1). Previously, we examined the enhancer structure of proviruses from murine tumors induced by SL3-3 with mutated AML1 (core) sites and found a few cases of second-site alterations. These consisted of deletions involving the NF1 sites and alterations in overall number of repeat elements, and they conferred increased enhancer strength in transient transcription assays. We have now tested the pathogenicity of a virus harboring one such second-site variant enhancer in inbred NMRI mice. It induced lymphomas with a 100% incidence and a significantly shorter latency than the AML1 mutant it evolved from. The enhancer structure thus represents the selection for a more tumorigenic virus variant during the pathogenic process. Sequencing of provirus from the induced tumors showed the new enhancer variant to be genetically stable. Also, Southern blotting showed that the tumors induced by the variant were T-cell lymphomas, as were the wild-type-induced lymphomas. In contrast, tumors induced by the original core/AML1 site I-II mutant appeared to be of non-T-cell origin and several proviral genomes with altered enhancer regions could be found in the tumors. Moreover, reporter constructs with the new tumor-derived variant could not be transactivated by AML1 in cotransfection experiments as could the wild type. These results emphasize the importance of both core/AML1 site I and site II for the pathogenic potential of SL3-3 and at the same time show that second-site alterations can form a viral variant with a substantial pathogenic potential although both AML1 sites I and II are nonfunctional.","['Ethelberg, S', 'Lovmand, J', 'Schmidt, J', 'Luz, A', 'Pedersen, F S']","['Ethelberg S', 'Lovmand J', 'Schmidt J', 'Luz A', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular and Structural Biology, University of Aarhus, Aarhus C, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neurofibromin 1)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Genetic Variation', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Lymphoma/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neurofibromin 1', 'Proteins/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Teratoma', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/10/06 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/10/06 00:00'],"['1997/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.10.7273-7280.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Oct;71(10):7273-80. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.10.7273-7280.1997.,,PMC192069,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mutated envelopes were tested for intracellular maturation and for functions, including ability to elicit syncytium formation and ability to mediate cell-to-cell transmission of the virus. Three major phenotypes, defining three functionally distinct regions, were identified. (i) Mutations causing defects in intracellular maturation of the envelope precursor are mostly distributed in the central portion of the TM ectodomain, containing the immunosuppressive peptide. This region, which includes vicinal cysteines thought to form an intramolecular disulfide bridge, is probably essential for correct folding of the protein. (ii) Mutations resulting in reduced syncytium-forming ability despite correct intracellular maturation are clustered in the amino-terminal part of the TM ectodomain, within the leucine zipper-like motif. Similar motifs with a propensity to form coiled-coil structures have been implicated in the fusion process driven by other viral envelope proteins, and HTLV-1 may thus conform to this general rule for viral fusion. (iii) Mutants with increased syncytium-forming ability define a region immediately amino-terminal to the membrane-spanning domain. Surprisingly, these mutants exhibited severe defects in infectivity, despite competence for fusion. Existence of this phenotype indicates that capacity for cell-to-cell fusion is not sufficient to ensure viral entry, even in cell-to-cell transmission. The ectodomain of the TM glycoprotein thus may be involved in postfusion events required for full infectivity of HTLV-1, which perhaps represents a unique feature of this poorly infectious retrovirus.","['Rosenberg, A R', 'Delamarre, L', 'Pique, C', 'Pham, D', 'Dokhelar, M C']","['Rosenberg AR', 'Delamarre L', 'Pique C', 'Pham D', 'Dokhelar MC']","['URA 1156 CNRS, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France. arielle@cochin.inserm.fr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Macaca mulatta', '*Membrane Fusion', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Point Mutation', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism']",1997/10/06 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/10/06 00:00'],"['1997/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.10.7180-7186.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Oct;71(10):7180-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.10.7180-7186.1997.,,PMC192057,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Entry in mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts is by endocytosis, whereas entry in rat XC sarcoma cells is by surface fusion. We report here the identification of a step common to both entry pathways, as well as of a step unique to the endocytic pathway. Recent demonstration of the clustering of the virus receptor on rat cells suggested a possible interaction of the receptor with the cellular cytoskeleton (M. H. Woodard, W. A. Dunn, R. O. Laine, M. Malandro, R. McMahon, O. Simell, E. R. Block, and M. S. Kilberg, Am. J. Physiol. 266:E817-E824, 1994). We tested the hypothesis that such an interaction might influence receptor function. We found that entry into NIH 3T3 and XC cells was greatly diminished by the disruption of the actin network before but not shortly after virus internalization, suggesting the actin network plays a critical role in an early step common to both entry pathways. Disruption of microtubules before and shortly after virus internalization markedly reduced entry in NIH 3T3 cells, while entry into XC cells remained efficient. These data suggest that intact microtubules are required in a postpenetration step unique to efficient virus entry via endocytosis. The physiological function of the receptor was not affected by disruption of either the actin network or the microtubules, as the uptake of cationic amino acids in NIH 3T3 and XC cells was comparable to that in control cells even when the cytoskeleton remained disrupted for as long as 3 h.","['Kizhatil, K', 'Albritton, L M']","['Kizhatil K', 'Albritton LM']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, University of Tennessee-Memphis, 38163, USA.']",['eng'],['AI33410/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Tubulin)', '22144-77-0 (Cytochalasin D)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Actins/drug effects/physiology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytochalasin D/*pharmacology', 'Cytoskeleton/drug effects/*physiology/virology', '*Endocytosis', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Membrane Fusion/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Microtubules/physiology', 'Nocodazole/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Sarcoma, Experimental', 'Time Factors', 'Tubulin/immunology/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/10/06 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/10/06 00:00'],"['1997/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.10.7145-7156.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Oct;71(10):7145-56. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.10.7145-7156.1997.,,PMC192054,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 14-OH-DAB derivatives showed enhanced anti-proliferative activity as compared to the parent compounds on the MDR-positive cancer cell lines. Particularly, IDN 5109 showed a 25- to 30-fold higher activity than paclitaxel. The fold change in activity between paclitaxel and analogs (IC50 paclitaxel/IC50 analogs) on the MDR-positive cell lines was calculated and a significant correlation observed.

On the basis of the data obtained on cell growth inhibition, we selected the most active compounds to study their effect on the cell cycle. Cell cycle analysis showed that all of the compounds tested were able to induce cell cycle block at G2/M in a concentration-dependent manner. The amount of cell block, measured as a G1/G2 ratio, was correlated significantly (p < 0.001) with apoptosis, as evaluated in the sub-G1 region (% of DNA fragmentation), thereby suggesting that the G2/M-blocked cells underwent apoptosis.

The OR for family history of any type of cancer except breast cancer was 1.1. For family history of breast cancer the ORs were similar across strata of age of the proband, being 2.4 below age 45, 2.2 at age 45-59 and 2.7 above age 60, and whether the relative affected was the mother, sister(s) or both, while the risk appeared higher if the age at onset of breast cancer in the relative was lower than 40 years (OR 3.5), rather than higher (OR 2.2).

It is marginally less cytotoxic than mitoxantrone but much more growth-inhibitory than netropsin. Various spectroscopic and biochemical techniques have been employed to characterize the interaction of the drug, NetMitox, with DNA. Circular dichroism (CD) and electric linear dichroism (ELD) data indicate that binding of the netropsin moiety or moieties within the minor groove of the double helix impedes the intercalation of the adjacent anthracenedione ring. ELD and footprinting experiments reveal a certain amount of mutual interference between the two functionalities of the conjugate molecule but the selective recognition of AT-rich sequences by netropsin largely dominates the recognition pattern. The lack of interaction with GC-rich sequences is attributable to steric hindrance occasioned by the 2-amino group of guanine which impedes access of the netropsin moiety into the minor groove, as is evident by the good binding of the hybrid to poly(dI-dC) x poly(dI-dC) as well as by the redistribution of its binding sites on DNA molecules substituted with inosine and/or 2,6-diaminopurine. The difficulty of the anthracenedione system in intercalating correlates with the lack of effect of the drug on cleavable complex formation with topoisomerase II as well as its diminished cytotoxicity compared to mitoxantrone. However, the finding that the drug retains significant toxicity towards leukaemia cells may suggest that DNA is perhaps not the unique molecular target.","['Boitte, N', 'Pommery, N', 'Colson, P', 'Houssier, C', 'Waring, M J', 'Henichart, J P', 'Bailly, C']","['Boitte N', 'Pommery N', 'Colson P', 'Houssier C', 'Waring MJ', 'Henichart JP', 'Bailly C']","['Institut de Chimie Pharmaceutique, Lille, France.']",['eng'],['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,"['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (bis(netropsin)-anthracenedione conjugate)', '64B3O0RD7N (Netropsin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthraquinones/*chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Footprinting', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mitoxantrone/*analogs & derivatives', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Netropsin/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viscosity']",1997/10/06 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/10/06 00:00'],"['1997/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1997 Sep;12(6):481-501.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P-gp function can be determined microfluorometrically using the fluorescent dye rhodamine 123(Rh123), which is an artificial substrate for P-gp. In this study, we assessed P-gp function in human leukemia sublines of MOLT-3 with various magnitude of MDR phenotype using the Rh123-efflux assay. The MDR cells efficiently pumped out Rh123 outside cells in parallel with the magnitude of resistance to vincristine, while the parent MOLT-3 cells scarcely showed dye efflux. The P-gp function determined by the dye efflux assay was correlated with the degree of cell surface expression of P-gp measured by indirect flow cytometric analysis using MRK16 anti-P-gp antibody and with the amount of MDR1 mRNA (encoding P-gp) quantified by Northern blot analysis and by competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. In the evaluation of 28 clinical samples obtained from patients with leukemias, 9 cases exhibited positive results Rh123-efflux. A good correlation of Rh123-efflux with MDR1 expression measured by competitive RT-PCR was observed in these samples. Since subpopulations of normal lymphocytes show low degree of P-gp function, the strict gating of leukemia cells was mandatory in the dye-efflux assay in clinical samples. Although leukemia cells could not be distinguished from normal lymphocytes in the conventional scattergram in some cases, additional staining of the former cells with specific monoclonal antibody such as CD34(labelled with PE-Cy5, a dye without interference with Rh123 fluorescence emission) enabled a selective analysis of a particular subpopulation.

It is not clear whether ATL initially manifests with lesions in Waldeyer's ring (WR) in an ATL-endemic area. In the present study, we examined distributions of immunophenotypes and the presence of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes in 62 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of WR (NHL-WR) from two areas of Japan: Osaka, an ATL-nonendemic area (25 cases), and Okinawa, an ATL-endemic area (37 cases). In both areas, age ranged from 10 to 94 years (median, 64 yr), with a male-to-female ratio of 1.81:1. Twelve patients were in Stage I, 34 in Stage II, and 6 in Stage III; stage was unknown in 10. The 25 Osaka cases were B-cell type (16 diffuse immunoblastic type (DIB), 8 diffuse large cell predominantly noncleaved cell (DLNC), 1 cleaved cell (DLC)). Of the 37 Okinawa cases, 20 were B-cell type (3 DIB, 10 DLNC, 2 DLC, 5 other). The remaining 17 cases showed T-cell phenotype (4 DIB, 3 DLC, 3 diffuse large cell not otherwise specified, 7 other). There was a significant difference in the distribution of immunophenotypes between these two areas (P < .001). Combined studies of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization revealed the presence of EBV genome in 1 (4%) of 24 Osaka cases, 2 (13%) of 16 B-cell NHLs from Okinawa, and 3 (23%) of 13 T-cell NHLs from Okinawa. HTLV-1 proviral genome was found in 11 (85%) of 13 T-cell lymphomas from Okinawa but could not be detected in B-cell lymphomas from Osaka and Okinawa. Combined clinical, histologic, serologic, and PCR findings suggest that NHL-WR in an ATL-endemic area could be an initial manifestation of ATL.","['Tomita, Y', 'Ohsawa, M', 'Mishiro, Y', 'Itokazu, T', 'Kojya, S', 'Noda, Y', 'Ikehara, O', 'Aozasa, K']","['Tomita Y', 'Ohsawa M', 'Mishiro Y', 'Itokazu T', 'Kojya S', 'Noda Y', 'Ikehara O', 'Aozasa K']","['Department of Pathology, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tonsillar Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology']",1997/10/06 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/10/06 00:00'],"['1997/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mod Pathol. 1997 Sep;10(9):933-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cyclin D1 was expressed in 18 (26%) of 69 plasma cell neoplasms, including 16 (30%) of 54 MMs and 2 (17%) of 12 plasmacytomas. Three cases of plasma cell leukemia were negative. Cyclin D1 expression correlated with the cytologic differentiation and histologic stage of MM. Twelve (75%) of 16 MMs had intermediate or immature cytologic features and were histologic Stage III. With use of a polymerase chain reaction assay, we also analyzed six cases (three cyclin D1 positive, three cyclin D1 negative) for the t(11;14); one MM carried the t(11;14) and expressed cyclin D1 protein. We conclude that cyclin D1 expression occurs in approximately one-quarter of plasma cell neoplasms and correlates with the degree of cytologic differentiation and histologic stage. The relatively high frequency of cyclin D1 expression, compared with the less than 5% incidence of the t(11;14) detected by conventional cytogenetics reported in the literature, suggests that upregulation of cyclin D1 protein might be the result of mechanisms other than the t(11;14).","['Vasef, M A', 'Medeiros, L J', 'Yospur, L S', 'Sun, N C', 'McCourty, A', 'Brynes, R K']","['Vasef MA', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Yospur LS', 'Sun NC', 'McCourty A', 'Brynes RK']","['Division of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cyclin D1/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/immunology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/immunology/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology/*metabolism/mortality', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Plasmacytoma/immunology/*metabolism/mortality', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate']",1997/10/06 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/10/06 00:00'],"['1997/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mod Pathol. 1997 Sep;10(9):927-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunization of naive mice with irradiated B7-1-transfected P1.HTR cells is sufficient to induce specific cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) and to protect against tumor challenge. However, patients to be treated will have an existing tumor burden; thus, preclinical models should examine therapeutic efficacy in an established tumor setting. Contrary to expectations, immunization of mice with irradiated B7-1-transfected P1.HTR cells had no impact on the growth of pre-established control-transfected tumors. Mice bearing control-transfected P1.HTR tumors successfully rejected living B7-1 transfectants on the contralateral flank, demonstrating the ability of tumor-bearing mice to respond to B7 co-stimulation. Inasmuch as IL-12 is another important factor for CTL maturation, P1.HTR transfectants expressing B7-1 and/or IL-12 were then constructed. Remarkably, regression of pre-established tumors was achieved following immunization with irradiated IL-12 transfectants, even without co-expression of B7-1. Rejection required a shared antigen with the tumor used for immunization, could not be reproduced with rIL-12 alone, depended on host T lymphocytes and correlated with a high IFN-gamma-producing T cell phenotype. In addition, IL-12-facilitated tumor rejection required co-operation with a CTLA-4 ligand provided by the host, and correlated with up-regulation of B7-1 and B7-2 on host antigen-presenting cells. Thus, active immunization in the established tumor setting is benefitted greatly by the provision of IL-12, which may recruit participation of sufficient B7 co-stimulation from the host that it need not be provided exogenously.","['Fallarino, F', 'Ashikari, A', 'Boon, T', 'Gajewski, T F']","['Fallarino F', 'Ashikari A', 'Boon T', 'Gajewski TF']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medical Center, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Ctla4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Ligands)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '7D0YB67S97 (Abatacept)']",IM,"['Abatacept', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/physiology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen/biosynthesis/*genetics/radiation effects', 'CTLA-4 Antigen', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Cell Division/immunology/radiation effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/genetics/immunology', '*Immunoconjugates', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-12/biosynthesis/*genetics/radiation effects', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Ligands', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/*immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/metabolism', 'Transfection/immunology']",1997/10/06 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/10/06 00:00'],"['1997/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/intimm/9.9.1259 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Immunol. 1997 Sep;9(9):1259-69. doi: 10.1093/intimm/9.9.1259.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, many patients eventually relapse due to the persistence of low numbers of residual leukemic cells that are undetectable by conventional cytomorphologic criteria (minimal residual disease [MRD]). Using immunophenotypic multiparametric flow cytometry, we have investigated in sequential studies (diagnosis and follow-up) the impact of MRD detection on the outcome of 53 AML patients that had achieved morphologic remission with standard AML protocols and displayed at diagnosis an aberrant phenotype. Patients were studied at diagnosis with a panel of 35 monoclonal antibodies in triple staining combinations for detection of aberrant or uncommon phenotypic features. According to these features, a patient's probe was custom-built at diagnosis for the identification of possible residual leukemic cells during follow-up. The level of MRD at the end of induction and intensification therapy correlated with the number of relapses and relapse-free survival (RFS). Thus, patients with more than 5 x 10(-3) residual cells (5 residual cells among 1,000 normal bone marrow [BM] cells) identified as leukemic by immunophenotyping in the first remission BM showed a significant higher rate of relapse (67% v 20% for patients with less than 5 x 10(-3) residual cells; P = .002) and a lower median RFS (17 months v not reached; P = .01). At the end of intensification, with a cut-off value of 2 x 10(-3) leukemic cells, AML patients also separated into two distinct groups with relapse rates of 69% versus 32% (P = .02), respectively, and median RFS of 16 months versus not reached (P = .04). In addition, overall survival was also significantly related to the level of residual cells in the marrow obtained at the end of induction and particularly after intensification therapy (P = .008). Furthermore, we have explored whether residual disease was related with the functional expression of multidrug resistance (MDR-1) at diagnosis as assessed by the rhodamine123 assay. Patients with > or =5 x 10(-3) residual leukemic cells at the end of induction therapy had a significantly higher rhodamine-123 efflux (mean, 56% +/- 24%) than those with less than 5 x 10(-3) residual cells (mean, 32% +/- 31%; P = .04). Finally, multivariate analysis showed that the number of residual cells at the end of induction or intensification therapy was the most important prognostic factor for prediction of RFS. Overall, our results show that immunophenotypical investigation of MRD strongly predicts outcome in patients with AML and that the number of residual leukemic cells correlates with multidrug resistance.","['San Miguel, J F', 'Martinez, A', 'Macedo, A', 'Vidriales, M B', 'Lopez-Berges, C', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Caballero, D', 'Garcia-Marcos, M A', 'Ramos, F', 'Fernandez-Calvo, J', 'Calmuntia, M J', 'Diaz-Mediavilla, J', 'Orfao, A']","['San Miguel JF', 'Martinez A', 'Macedo A', 'Vidriales MB', 'Lopez-Berges C', 'Gonzalez M', 'Caballero D', 'Garcia-Marcos MA', 'Ramos F', 'Fernandez-Calvo J', 'Calmuntia MJ', 'Diaz-Mediavilla J', 'Orfao A']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",1997/10/06 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/10/06 00:00'],"['1997/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58043-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Sep 15;90(6):2465-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of these rearrangements are targeted to the IGHJ segments, but only some can be amplified with regular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. To permit PCR amplification of potentially all IGHJ rearrangements, we have devised a method incorporating self-ligation of restriction endonuclease-digested DNA fragments with long-distance PCR (long-distance, inverse PCR [LDI-PCR]). We show here, using only 4 nested oligonucleotide primers, the successful amplification and DNA sequencing of all IGHJ rearrangements up to 5.4 kb in length from a panel of 13 cases and cell lines of various types of B-cell malignancy. In all cases, both VDJ and DJ IGH rearrangements and translocation breakpoints were amplified. Six cases exhibited t(14;18)(q32;q21). All translocation breakpoints were cloned and sequenced. Three cases exhibited a rearrangement to the BCL2 major breakpoint region (MBR). However, 2 other cases exhibited rearrangements between the MBR and the minor cluster region (mcr). These 2 cases broke within 44 bp of each other, confirming the presence of an additional 3' BCL2 breakpoint cluster region. The final case fell immediately 3' of the 3' UTR of the BCL2 gene adjacent to an Alu repeat. No other BCL2 breakpoints within this region have been reported. Four cases exhibited t(11;14)(q13;q32). All 3 cases with translocations targeted to the IGHJ segments were successfully amplified and sequenced, including 1 case in which the BCL1 translocation could not be detected by DNA blot using the currently available probes. All three translocation breakpointsfell outside the BCL1 major translocation cluster between 20 and 40 kb telomeric and showed no clustering. Two of the three fell within or adjacent to Alu repeat regions.

We describe here seven cases of acute leukemia of conceivable myeloid and NK cell precursor phenotype in six men and one woman varying from 19 to 59 years of age (median, 46 years). Striking extramedullary involvement was evident at initial presentation, with peripheral lymphadenopathy and/or mediastinal masses. Two lacked any leukemic cells in the bone marrow at diagnosis. Using cytochemical myeloperoxidase staining, less than 3% of the leukemic cells showed positive reactivity. However, expression of CD7, CD33, CD34, CD56, and frequently HLA-DR, but not other NK, T-cell, and B-cell markers was observed. Cytoplasmic CD3 was detected in three of the cases by flow cytometry and in six by Northern blotting, suggesting an origin from common progenitors between the NK cell and myeloid lineages. All but one presented germline configurations of the T-cell receptor beta and gamma chain genes and Ig heavy chain gene. With regard to morphology, the cells were generally L2-shaped, with variation in cell size, round to moderately irregular nuclei and prominent nucleoli, pale cytoplasm, and a lack of azurophilic granules. Histopathologic examination of biopsied specimens of extramedullary tumors showed a lymphoblast-like morphology, implying the differential diagnostic problem from lymphoblastic lymphomas, especially in cases lacking bone marrow involvement. Three patients were successfully treated with chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), whereas three other patients proved refractory to chemotherapeutic regimens for lymphoid malignancies, although two responded to subsequent AML chemotherapy.

However, evidence exists to suggest that HCP also may exert important effects on blood cell differentiation. To investigate possible roles for HCP during late erythroid differentiation, effects of manipulating HCP expression or recruitment on EPO-induced hemoglobinization in erythroleukemic SKT6 cells have been investigated. No effects of EPO on levels of HCP, Syp, Stat5, the EPO receptor, or GATA-1 expression were observed during induced differentiation. However, the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, the EPO receptor, and Stat5 was efficiently activated, and HCP was observed to associate constitutively with the EPO receptor in this differentiation-specific system. In studies of HCP function, inhibition of HCP expression by antisense oligonucleotides enhanced hemoglobinization, whereas the enforced ectopic expression of wild-type (wt) HCP markedly inhibited EPO-induced globin expression and Stat5 activation. Based on these findings, epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor/EPO receptor chimeras containing either the wt EPO receptor cytoplasmic domain (EECA) or a derived HCP binding site mutant (EECA-Y429,431F) were expressed in SKT6 cells, and their abilities to mediate differentiation were assayed. Each chimera supported EGF-induced hemoglobinization, but efficiencies for EECA-Y429,431F were enhanced 400% to 500%. Thus, these studies show a novel role for HCP as a negative regulator of EPO-induced erythroid differentiation. In normal erythroid progenitor cells, HCP may act to prevent premature commitment to terminal differentiation. In erythroleukemic SKT6 cells, this action also may enforce mitogenesis.","['Sharlow, E R', 'Pacifici, R', 'Crouse, J', 'Batac, J', 'Todokoro, K', 'Wojchowski, D M']","['Sharlow ER', 'Pacifici R', 'Crouse J', 'Batac J', 'Todokoro K', 'Wojchowski DM']","['Graduate Program in Genetics, Department of Veterinary Science, Amgen, Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['DK 40242/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 03042/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn6 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'ErbB Receptors/chemistry', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Globins/genetics', 'Hemoglobins/*biosynthesis', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/physiopathology', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics/*physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/10/06 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/10/06 00:00'],"['1997/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58012-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Sep 15;90(6):2175-87.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used here homologous recombination in ES cells to create an in-frame fusion of BCR-ABL(p190) that mimics the consequences of the human chromosomal translocation by fusion of BCR-ABL coding sequences into the bcr endogenous gene. The chimeric mice generated with the mutant embryonic stem cells systematically develop B-ALL. Using these chimeric mice, we further show that BCR-ABL oncogene does not require the endogenous bcr product in leukemogenesis.

In this study, we evaluated the feasibility and consequences of introducing foreign genetic material by retroviral vectors into dendritic cell progenitors. Proliferating human bone marrow and cord blood CD34+ cells were infected by retroviral vectors encoding the murine CD2 surface antigen. Mean transduction efficiency in dendritic cells was 11.5% from bone marrow and 21.2% from cord blood progenitors. Transduced or untransduced dendritic cell progeny expressed comparable levels of HLA-DR, CD83, CD1a, CD80, CD86, S100, and p55 antigens. Granulocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells were equally represented among the transduced and mock-transduced cells, thus showing no apparent alteration in the differentiation of transduced CD34+ precursors. The T-cell stimulatory capacity of retrovirally modified and purified mCD2-positive allogeneic or nominal antigen-pulsed autologous dendritic cells was comparable with that of untransduced dendritic cells. Human CD34+ dendritic cell progenitors can therefore be efficiently transduced using retroviral vectors and can differentiate into potent immunostimulatory dendritic cells without compromising their T-cell stimulatory capacity or the expression of critical costimulatory molecules and phenotypic markers. These results support ongoing efforts to develop genetically modified dendritic cells for immunotherapy.","['Szabolcs, P', 'Gallardo, H F', 'Ciocon, D H', 'Sadelain, M', 'Young, J W']","['Szabolcs P', 'Gallardo HF', 'Ciocon DH', 'Sadelain M', 'Young JW']","['Laboratory of Cellular Physiology and Immunology, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['K08-AI-01254/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA-23766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA-59350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Superantigens)']",IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/*physiology', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'CD2 Antigens/physiology', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/virology', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Engineering/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Superantigens/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",1997/10/06 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/10/06 00:00'],"['1997/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58010-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Sep 15;90(6):2160-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The line is cross-resistant to etoposide, daunomycin, and vinblastine. L1210 MQ-580 cells expressed 8-fold resistance to 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (3-AP), a relatively newly developed inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase. The accumulation of [14C]3-AP by L1210 MQ-580 cells was 5- to 6-fold less than by parental L1210 cells. An increased rate of efflux of 3-AP was responsible for the lower steady-state concentration of 3-AP in resistant cells. In reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays, L1210 MQ-580 cells were found to overexpress the multidrug resistance genes mdr1, mdr3, and mrp, but not the mdr2 gene, compared with parental L1210 cells. Measurement of the steady-state concentration of doxorubicin, a potential substrate for both the mdr and mrp gene products, demonstrated that L1210 MQ-580 cells accumulated 4-fold less anthracycline than parental cells. These findings indicate that drug efflux is a major determinant of the pattern of cross-resistance of L1210 MQ-580 cells. To extrapolate these observations to the human homologues of the mdr1, mdr3, and mrp murine genes, the effects of 3-AP were measured in L1210/VMDRC0.06 and NIH3T3 36-8-32 cells transfected with human MDR1 and MRP cDNAs, respectively. The transfectants were 2- to 3-fold resistant to the cytotoxic effects of 3-AP and accumulated less [14C]3-AP than their parental mock-transfected counterparts. Moreover, the cytotoxic activity of 3-AP was significantly greater in two double mrp gene knockout cell lines than in parental W 9.5 embryonic stem cells. Thus, the results suggest that 3-AP is a substrate for both the P-glycoprotein and MRP and that baseline MRP expression has the capacity to exert a protective role against the toxicity of this agent.","['Rappa, G', 'Lorico, A', 'Liu, M C', 'Kruh, G D', 'Cory, A H', 'Cory, J G', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Rappa G', 'Lorico A', 'Liu MC', 'Kruh GD', 'Cory AH', 'Cory JG', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology and Developmental Therapeutics Program, Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06520, U.S.A.']",['eng'],"['CA-55540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-66739/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Thiosemicarbazones)', '9EI49ZU76O (multidrug resistance protein 3)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)']",IM,"['*ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Thiosemicarbazones/pharmacology']",1997/10/06 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/10/06 00:00'],"['1997/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(97)00210-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00210-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1997 Sep 15;54(6):649-55. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00210-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was no significant intracellular F-MTX accumulation over this period in a K562 subline (K500E) with a documented defect (approximately 10% of wild type) in membrane transport by the reduced folate carrier (RFC). F-MTX uptake was re-established in K500E cells transfected with a cDNA to human RFC, establishing a role for RFC in the cellular uptake of this compound. High levels of intracellular labelling were detected in all cell lines after prolonged (24 h) F-MTX incubations, however F-MTX accumulation at this time was not inhibited by ZD1694. F-MTX uptake by RFC was also detected in leukaemic blasts from children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and could be blocked with ZD1694. In leukaemic blasts with a documented defect in MTX uptake, F-MTX accumulation was abolished in almost all the cells. These results display the power of confocal microscopy for directly visualizing RFC-mediated anti-folate uptake. Over short intervals, F-MTX uptake is mediated by RFC, however, RFC-independent processes predominate during long drug exposures. Direct assay by confocal microscopy may be better suited than other indirect methods (i.e. flow cytometry) for detecting low levels of RFC transport in leukaemic blasts from patients undergoing chemotherapy with methotrexate.","['Jolivet, J', 'Faure, M P', 'Wong, S C', 'Taub, J W', 'Matherly, L H']","['Jolivet J', 'Faure MP', 'Wong SC', 'Taub JW', 'Matherly LH']","[""Centre de Recherche, Centre hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, Pavillon, Canada.""]",['eng'],['CA-53535/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', '0 (SLC19A2 protein, human)', '0 (Thiophenes)', 'FCB9EGG971 (raltitrexed)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', '*Membrane Proteins', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Microscopy, Confocal/*methods', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Thiophenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1997.454 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1997;76(6):734-8. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1997.454.,,PMC2228032,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MIB1 scores showed significant differences between DS, PFS and TFS (5.5%, 16.61% and 24.14%, respectively; p < 0.0001). Worth noting, the MIB1 score did not differ significantly when comparing DS with the diffuse areas of PFS, or TFS with the pseudofollicles of PFS. The mean bcl-2 gene protein score was displayed to a high extent in all subtypes, but less extensively by larger activated lymphocytes that, conversely, expressed c-myc. MIB1 score correlated negatively with bcl-2 and positively with c-myc protein scores. These findings suggest that lymphocytes protected from apoptosis by bcl-2 would be exponed to cell activation and growth acceleration provided by c-myc. This condition would account for a different aggressiveness of morphologically activated subtypes, such as TFS and PFS with larger pseudofollicles. The survival analysis, performed in 23 cases, showed a trend of association of cell proliferation and c-myc expression with a more aggressive progression of the disease. Overexpression of p53 and apoptosis were found only in a minority of cases, unrelated to the subtypes. In conclusion, cell growth fraction, bcl-2 and c-myc assessment may be of help in predicting the aggressiveness of different subtypes of SLL. This approach should be most conveniently applied to PFS, which represents a continuum between DS and TFS, in order to distinguish, in this heterogeneous subtype, more indolent from more aggressive disorders.","['Palestro, G', 'Ponti, R', 'Chiusa, L', 'Chiarle, R', 'Geuna, M', 'Novero, D', 'Freilone, R', 'Pich, A']","['Palestro G', 'Ponti R', 'Chiusa L', 'Chiarle R', 'Geuna M', 'Novero D', 'Freilone R', 'Pich A']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, University of Torino Medical School, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Nuclear', '*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*classification/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",1997/10/06 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/10/06 00:00'],"['1997/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1997.tb00968.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1997 Sep;59(3):148-54. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1997.tb00968.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prompt initiation of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics is essential to limit morbidity and mortality. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of combination antibiotics consisting of a third generation cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside, a retrospective review of all febrile granulocytopenic patients admitted to our institution was conducted. Between June 1994 and August 1996, 183 febrile episodes in granulocytopenic children with cancer were empirically treated with ceftriaxone and amikacin in a single daily dose. 96/183 (52%) patients had absolute granulocyte count lower than 100/mm3 at the onset; 68 (37%) were affected by acute leukemia or lymphoma, 3 (1%) by chronic leukemia, 94 (51%) by solid tumors, and 21 (11%) patients underwent bone marrow transplantation. Ceftriaxone plus amikacin was effective in 135/183 (74%) patients with a median time to defervescence of 3 days (range 1-11). Economic evaluation (cost minimization analysis) was limited to the cost savings for nonreusable materials, and difference in direct drug costs in comparison with another combination regimen such as ceftazidime and amikacin. This analysis showed that compared to a 3 times daily regimen, administration of single daily doses of ceftriaxone would result in a net cost saving of US$ 11 (17,500 Italian liras) and US$ 65.6 (105,000 Italian liras) for a 1-day and a 6-day treatment period, respectively, for the treatment of a child of 30 kg body weight. Moreover, once daily therapy has the potential to lead to savings in the time of the nursing staff and may well contribute to an improved quality of life for febrile granulocytopenic children. For these reasons, in our department, ceftriaxone plus amikacin still remain the standard regimen for the empirical treatment of febrile granulocytopenic children with cancer.","['Pession, A', 'Prete, A', 'Paolucci, G']","['Pession A', 'Prete A', 'Paolucci G']","['Oncology and Hematology Pediatric Unit, University of Bologna, Policlinico S.

However, ethanol inhibits fresh human NK activity when added to the lytic assay medium, as reported previously by other investigators. In contrast, using the same target (K562 erythroleukemia cells), peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured 3 days with 50 units/ml of interleukin-2 are no longer inhibited significantly by the same concentration of ethanol that inhibited the fresh cells by 80%. When freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, monocyte-depleted lymphocytes, or partially purified NK cells are pre-exposed to ethanol in vitro for 1 to 7 days, washed, and assayed for lytic activity against K562, the lytic activity is increased compared with nonethanol-exposed cells incubated concurrently. This increase is not dependent on accessory cells, added cytokines, or cell growth, and seems to be an intrinsic response of the NK subset to ethanol exposure. The finding of NK stimulation by ethanol, considered together with the observation of NK cell loss in some chronic alcoholics, suggests that loss of NK activity in the chronic alcoholic may result from cell loss rather than direct ethanol inhibition of NK activity.","['Li, F', 'Cook, R T', 'Alber, C', 'Rasmussen, W', 'Stapleton, J T', 'Ballas, Z K']","['Li F', 'Cook RT', 'Alber C', 'Rasmussen W', 'Stapleton JT', 'Ballas ZK']","['Department of Pathology, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Iowa City, Iowa, USA.']",['eng'],"['AA08402/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'AA09598/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'AI26460/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Alcohol Clin Exp Res,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",7707242,"['0 (Cytokines)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alcoholism/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects/immunology', 'Ethanol/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Stimulation, Chemical']",1997/10/06 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/10/06 00:00'],"['1997/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['00000374-199709000-00006 [pii]'],ppublish,Alcohol Clin Exp Res. 1997 Sep;21(6):981-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The practical conclusions of this case report indicate that a patient with MGUS must be followed periodically and over an indefinite period, and that PCL must be considered into the possible evolution of MGUS.","['Pasqualetti, P', 'Casale, R']","['Pasqualetti P', 'Casale R']","[""Department of Internal Medicine and Public Health, School of Medicine and Surgery, University of L'Aquila, Italy.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/complications/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraproteinemias/*etiology']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0753-3322(97)83544-5 [pii]', '10.1016/S0753-3322(97)83544-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 1997;51(6-7):284-5. doi: 10.1016/S0753-3322(97)83544-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, a single injection of AS-oligomer plus ADR intraperitoneally into B6D2F1 mice with P388/ADR significantly prolonged mean survival time in a dose-dependent fashion. Again, sense mdr1 oligomer had no effect in vivo. No side effects, either acute or chronic, were found with this treatment during the observation period.

The aim of this study was to document the presence of IL-4 during the development of post-irradiation lung fibrosis. Right lungs of male Fischer rats were irradiated with a single dose of 20 Gy and IL-4 expression in the irradiated lungs was monitored for a period of three months. IL-4 gene transcription as determined by ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) as well as IL-4 synthesis as shown by Western blotting increased in the irradiated lungs reaching a plateau concentration within 3 weeks after irradiation. Enhanced IL-4 production was still detected at day 84 after irradiation. The cellular origin of IL-4 was analyzed by in situ hybridization and two-color immunofluorescence on lung tissue sections and on cytospin preparations of leukocytes obtained from bronchoalveolar lavages.

Archived sera from 90 implicated blood donors were tested for B19 IgM and DNA by the use of dot-blot hybridization and a nested polymerase chain reaction with primers from the B19 nonstructural gene. B19 DNA from patient and donor sera were sequenced. One of the 90 blood donors (Donor A) was B19 IgM positive and had a high level of B19 DNA. The patient was viremic 3 days after transfusion of platelets from this donor, and the sequence of B19 DNA from the patient exactly matched that of B19 DNA from the donor. A second blood donor (Donor B) had a low level of B19 DNA but was IgM negative. The patient showed no evidence of B19 infection after the transfusion of red cells from Donor B, and the sequence of this donor's B19 DNA was different from that in the patient. CONCLUSION: Blood Donor A with asymptomatic acute B19 infection was the source of B19 infection in the bone marrow transplant patient. Donor B with a low level of B19 DNA was not the source of infection.","['Cohen, B J', 'Beard, S', 'Knowles, W A', 'Ellis, J S', 'Joske, D', 'Goldman, J M', 'Hewitt, P', 'Ward, K N']","['Cohen BJ', 'Beard S', 'Knowles WA', 'Ellis JS', 'Joske D', 'Goldman JM', 'Hewitt P', 'Ward KN']","['Enteric & Respiratory Virus Laboratory, North London Centre, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia/*etiology', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Base Sequence', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Parvoviridae Infections/complications/*transmission', '*Parvovirus B19, Human/genetics/immunology', 'Platelet Transfusion/*adverse effects', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1997/10/06 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/10/06 00:00'],"['1997/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1997.37997454023.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 1997 Sep;37(9):947-52. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1997.37997454023.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Translocations involving 14q32 have been reported in 20-40% of abnormal karyotypes from human multiple myeloma (MM), and involve a variety of loci. Using cytogenetics, FISH and a Southern blot assay, we analyzed 21 MM cells lines and one plasma cell leukemia and identified evidence of a 14q32 translocation in 20/22 samples. The partner loci involved are 11q13 in 6 (associated with cyclin D1 expression), 4p16 in 6 (associated with FGFR3 expression), unidentified in 3 and 1p13, 6, 8q24, 12q24, 16q23, and 21q22 once each. We conclude that conventional karyotypes underestimate the frequency of 14q32 translocations in MM, where they appear to be a nearly universal event. The translocations most frequently involve IgH switch regions, and include two recurrent partner loci (11q13 and 4p16) and a promiscuous array of other partner loci. Although c-myc appears to be cis-dysregulated frequently in MM, it is only rarely translocated to the IgH locus.","['Bergsagel, P L', 'Nardini, E', 'Brents, L', 'Chesi, M', 'Kuehl, W M']","['Bergsagel PL', 'Nardini E', 'Brents L', 'Chesi M', 'Kuehl WM']","['Cornell University Medical College, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Current topics in microbiology and immunology,0110513,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Switch Region/genetics', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/*immunology', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/10/06 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-60801-8_30 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 1997;224:283-7. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-60801-8_30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We propose an exact adjustment method, based on the joint permutational distributions of the test statistics, in settings where the acquired sample size only allows analysis of a single feature at a time.

To further address the activities of Rb in proliferation and tumorigenesis in the hematopoietic lineage, we transplanted Rb-/- fetal liver cells into sibling mice and assessed the outcome of Rb-/- hematopoietic cells in both short-term and long-term studies. Rb-/- hematopoietic cells rescued lethally irradiated mice with an efficiency comparable to that of wild-type cells. In spleen colony-forming unit assays, proliferation rates of the Rb-/- cells were greater than those of the wild-type cells. Similarly, in vitro burst-forming unit-erythroid and colony-forming unit-erythroid assays showed increased erythroid colony numbers from Rb-/- embryonic livers. Recipients of Rb-/- cells lived for more than 15-18 months, and most blood cell lineages matured normally with the expected switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin. However, the continued presence of nucleated erythrocytes in the peripheral blood and extensive extramedullary erythropoiesis indicated that the Rb-/- erythrocytes were not completely normal. No erythroleukemia developed during the 15-18 month period following transplantation. These results demonstrate the mitogenic effect but not tumorigenic transformation in erythrocyte lineage in the absence of Rb, which is distinct from the effect of Rb deficiency in neuroectodermal cells. The study supports the prevalent model that loss of the ubiquitously expressed tumor suppressor gene predisposes to only a limited spectrum of tumors.","['Hu, N', 'Gulley, M L', 'Kung, J T', 'Lee, E Y']","['Hu N', 'Gulley ML', 'Kung JT', 'Lee EY']","['Department of Molecular Medicine/Institute of Biotechnology, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, 78245-3207, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA49649/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD30625/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'U01-CA60432/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology', '*Erythropoiesis', '*Genes, Retinoblastoma', 'Heterozygote', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitosis', 'Osmotic Fragility', 'Tissue Distribution']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1997 Sep 15;57(18):4123-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Any chemical modification of Cbl decreased its ability to support cellular viability and proliferation, with several of the modifications abrogating activity completely. All of the Cbl analogues that promoted growth required the presence of apo-transcobalamin II for the optimal support of cell growth. Generally, Cbl analogues modified at the d-position of the corrin ring and, to a lesser degree, analogues modified at the b- position supported cell growth, whereas analogues with modifications at the e-position did not support cell growth. Mixing experiments demonstrated an inverse order of potency of Cbl analogues to inhibit cell growth. Thus, Cbl analogues with modifications at the e-position were potent inhibitors, whereas b-analogues exhibited only partial inhibitory activity at high molar excess, and d-analogues had no inhibitory activity at all. These results indicate that modifications at the e-position of Cbl abolish the ability of Cbl to support cell growth and generate potent inhibitors of Cbl-dependent cell growth.","['McLean, G R', 'Pathare, P M', 'Wilbur, D S', 'Morgan, A C', 'Woodhouse, C S', 'Schrader, J W', 'Ziltener, H J']","['McLean GR', 'Pathare PM', 'Wilbur DS', 'Morgan AC', 'Woodhouse CS', 'Schrader JW', 'Ziltener HJ']","['The Biomedical Research Centre, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcobalamins)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcobalamins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vitamin B 12/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1997 Sep 15;57(18):4015-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The steady-state level of long-chain MTX polyglutamates depends on the balance of activities of two enzymes: folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS), which adds glutamates to MTX in a gamma-carboxyl linkage, and gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH) or conjugase, which sequentially removes the terminal glutamate residue of MTX polyglutamates. FPGS and GGH activities as well as the formation of total and long-chain MTX polyglutamates were measured after incubation with [3H]MTX in 15 blast samples from patients with acute leukemias (myeloid and lymphoid). The ratio between GGH and FPGS activities was better at predicting the amount of polyglutamate accumulated in the 24-h [3H]MTX assay compared to the determination of either activity alone. The linear regression curve relating the relative levels of long-chain polyglutamates/total polyglutamates with the ratio of GGH/FPGS showed an r value of 0.81 (P < 0.001). These data suggest that the evaluation of both these enzymes at diagnosis may be used as a predictor of MTX polyglutamylation and therefore for response to MTX therapy and outcome.","['Longo, G S', 'Gorlick, R', 'Tong, W P', 'Lin, S', 'Steinherz, P', 'Bertino, J R']","['Longo GS', 'Gorlick R', 'Tong WP', 'Lin S', 'Steinherz P', 'Bertino JR']","['Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],['CA 09512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'EC 3.4.19.9 (gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Peptide Synthases/*metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase/*metabolism']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1997;9(5):259-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the precise molecular events leading to malignant expansion of the myeloid cell line are as yet undetermined, bcr-abl can induce cell proliferation, transformation of immature hemopoietic cells, and suppression of apoptosis in vitro. Abnormalities of stromal/progenitor cell interaction may be central to the pathogenesis of the abnormal hemopoiesis in CML. In chronic-phase CML, therapy with interferon-alfa (Intron A, Roferon-A) produces hematologic responses in up to 70% to 80% of patients and partial or complete cytogenetic responses in up to 50%, with many studies showing a significant overall survival advantage for responding patients. Allogeneic marrow transplantation can result in long-term survival and cure in patients with CML, particularly younger patients transplanted early in the course of the disease, and unrelated-donor or autologous marrow transplantation may be an option for patients without a matched sibling donor. Future therapy will likely involve selection and ex vivo expansion of nonleukemic stem cells for reinfusion as part of a strategy for autologous marrow transplantation.","['Giles, Francis J', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Giles FJ', 'Kantarjian HM']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Oncology (Williston Park),"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",8712059,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1997/10/27 00:00,1997/10/27 00:01,['1997/10/27 00:00'],"['1997/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['163119 [pii]'],ppublish,Oncology (Williston Park). 1997 Sep;11(9):1295-300; discussion 1302-10.,,,,,,,,,,163119 [pii],,,,,

Early studies demonstrated that resistance to RadLV-induced leukaemia in certain mouse strains is mediated by genes in the H-2D region of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Recent studies have shown that elevated H-2Dd expression on the thymocyte cell surface of resistance mouse strains results from increased mRNA transcription and is correlated with elevated levels of a DNA-binding activity that recognizes a short DNA sequence 5' of the start of transcription for the H-2Dd gene. This binding activity has been termed H-2 binding factor 1 (H-2 BF1) and is found exclusively in the thymus. In an effort to examine the H-2 genes of RadLV-susceptible mice for the presence of the H-2 BF1 binding target, we have cloned class I genes from the highly susceptible B10.S mouse strain and have identified both the Ds and the Ks genes. The entire genomic sequence for the Ds gene has been determined and is reported here. In addition, the 5' regulatory region of the previously cloned Dq gene has been sequenced; mice of the Dq haplotype are also susceptible to RadLV-induced leukaemia.

The second analog, CB-2, is identical to CB-1 except for the insertion of a Gly-Pro residue pair between Pro-24 and Ala-25. These peptides were used to investigate their anti-liposome, anti-bacterial and anti-cancer activities. The strength of anti-liposome activity is reduced two- to three-fold when the analogs are used instead of natural CB based on DL50 analysis. Similarly, the potency of these analogs on certain bacteria is about two- to four-fold lower than those of CB based on LC measurements. In contrast, on leukemia cancer cells, the potency of CB-1 and CB-2 is about two- to three-fold greater than that of natural CB based on IC50 measurements. All CB, CB-1 and CB-2 peptides have comparable helix contents according to CD measurements.

Its detection is prognostically significant. The Ph abnormality is usually detected through standard cytogenetic analysis but 20-30% of patients have insufficient metaphases (IM) with such analysis. To detect the BCR-ABL oncoprotein in peripheral blood specimen of patients with ALL at the time of diagnosis and at follow-up, a new sensitive technique of enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot (ECL-WB) analysis was investigated. Among 41 patients with newly diagnosed ALL, nine were Ph positive by cytogenetic studies; they were also BCR-ABL positive according to ECL-WB. Eight had p190 disease, and one had p210 disease. Among the 16 patients with IM, none demonstrated the oncoprotein through ECL-WB or through simultaneous Southern blot (SB) for p210 rearrangement. Follow-up studies were available for seven patients: four had detectable protein and three of them relapsed 4-20 weeks later; three had undetectable protein and one of them (who had low level protein at the time of diagnosis) relapsed 11 weeks later. Although none of the patients with IM at diagnosis had detectable protein according to ECL-WB, this was probably due to the small number of patients studied. One patient with IM studied at follow-up demonstrated the protein by ECL-WB. In summary, we describe a technique that is useful in the detection of p190/p210 ALL at diagnosis. It is less time consuming, and more cost effective than standard chromosome banding techniques. It may also detect the oncoprotein in cases with IM.

Recently, an increased incidence of GSTT1 null genotype was found in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) by comparison with a control population. We analyzed GSTT1 gene by PCR in 174 MDS cases and 100 controls. The incidence of GSTT1 null genotype was 22% in MDS in 19% in controls (P = 0.53). The incidence of GSTT1 null genotype in MDS did not differ according to gender, FAB classification, karyotype and whether MDS were therapy related or 'de novo'. In 86 of the de novo cases, data on previous occupational and environmental exposure to a list of 170 substances were available. In those MDS patients, a significantly lower frequency of GSTT1 null genotype was seen in cases with previous jobs exposed to chemicals, and with previous exposure to mineral dusts and exhaust gases. A lower frequency (but with only borderline significance) was seen in MDS patients who had been coal miners and those who had been exposed to any of the 70 substances analyzed. Overall, GSTT1 null genotype occurred at a similar incidence (19%) in controls and in MDS cases previously exposed to any substance, but tended to be higher in unexposed MDS patients (40%, P = 0.07). Our results do not confirm the higher incidence of GSTT1 null genotype observed in MDS. The lower incidence of GSTT1 null genotype in MDS cases exposed to some compounds previously found associated with MDS is apparently unexpected. However, it could be explained by the fact that GSTT1 enzyme, which has a detoxification role for some compounds, could also have an activating role for other substances, including solvents.","['Preudhomme, C', 'Nisse, C', 'Hebbar, M', 'Vanrumbeke, M', 'Brizard, A', 'Lai, J L', 'Fenaux, P']","['Preudhomme C', 'Nisse C', 'Hebbar M', 'Vanrumbeke M', 'Brizard A', 'Lai JL', 'Fenaux P']","['Inserm U124, Institut de Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Carcinogens)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['*Carcinogens', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics']",1997/09/26 00:00,1997/09/26 00:01,['1997/09/26 00:00'],"['1997/09/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/26 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400767 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Sep;11(9):1580-2. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400767.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasingly, peripheral blood (PB) stem cell transplants (PBSCT) are being used along with chemotherapy and total body irradiation as treatment for multiple myeloma. Although the majority of tumor cells are found within the bone marrow (BM), tumor cells circulate in the PB in patients with MM. Therefore, one potential problem with PBSCT is contamination of the stem cell harvests with tumor cells. Although substantial reduction in BM tumor load is achieved after chemotherapy and autologous transplantation, most patients still relapse. In an attempt to identify and quantitate the residual tumor within sequential BM and PB samples of patients with MM following autologous PB stem cell transplants we have used a tumor-specific detection assay, allele-specific oligonucleotide-PCR (ASO-PCR). We found that while the BM tumor burden may fluctuate in some patients by as much as 4-logs after transplant, the PB tumor remains quite stable, and does not reflect the tumor burden in the BM. Moreover, analysis of PB involvement over time was not predictive of marrow involvement or of potential relapse. These results suggest that the PB is frequently involved in MM and further indicate that it represents a compartment that is only minimally altered by intensive therapy.","['Billadeau, D', 'Prosper, F', 'Verfaillie, C', 'Weisdorf, D', 'Van Ness, B']","['Billadeau D', 'Prosper F', 'Verfaillie C', 'Weisdorf D', 'Van Ness B']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Institute of Human Genetics, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],['P01 CA65493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Time Factors']",1997/09/26 00:00,1997/09/26 00:01,['1997/09/26 00:00'],"['1997/09/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/26 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400773 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Sep;11(9):1565-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400773.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cells grow in a single cell suspension with doubling times of 48 h (JURL-MK1) and 72 h (JURL-MK2). Cytogenetic analysis has shown that JURL-MK1 is hypodiploid whereas JURL-MK2 is near triploid and that both cell lines retain t(9;22). Moreover, JURL-MK1 and JURL-MK2 have a bcr/abl-fused gene with the same junction found in the patient's fresh cells, and both cell lines express the b3/a2 type of hybrid bcr/abl mRNA. The morphology and immunophenotype of these cell lines are reminiscent of megakaryoblasts. In both lines, a limited but consistent percentage of cells expresses gpIIbIIIa (CD41a), gpIIIa (CD61) and CD36, with no expression of gplb (CD42b), glycophorin A, hemoglobin and CD34. Both cell lines are clearly positive for CD33, CD43, CD45RO and CD63, while CD13, CD44, CD54, CD30 and CD40 are specific features of JURL-MK2. Among cytokine receptors, CD117/SCF-R is strongly displayed by a large fraction of JURL-MK1 cells but is hardly detectable on about 20% JURL-MK2 cells. Both cell lines are clearly positive for CD25/IL2R alpha, while a marked expression of CD116/GM-CSF-R and CDw123/IL3R alpha is restricted to JURL-MK2. Induction of cell differentiation in vitro has demonstrated that TPA is able to modulate the JURL-MK1 phenotype, causing an increased expression of platelet-associated antigens. The JURL-MK2 phenotype is easily modulated by both TPA and DMSO, which cause an increased expression of CD41a and CD117 accompanied by a decreased expression of CD30. Proliferation studies demonstrated that JURL-MK1 cell growth is enhanced by stem cell factor, while JURL-MK2 proliferation is unaffected by this cytokine.

To evaluate the possibility that dietary phytochemicals with antioxidant potential would create an environment capable of affecting the differentiation of HL-60 leukemia cells, we measured the effects of vitamin E and other dietary antioxidants on the differentiation produced by low levels of vitamin D3 and analogs thereof. Vitamin E succinate and other antioxidant compounds (ie butylated hydroxyanisole, beta-carotene and lipoic acid) used alone had no significant effect on the differentiation of HL-60 cells; however, these agents markedly increased the differentiation produced by vitamin D3. Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that a sequence-specific antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide to the Rel A subunit of NF-kappaB enhanced the differentiation of HL-60 cells produced by several inducing agents. Consistent with these observations, vitamin E succinate caused a marked reduction in the nuclear content of NF-kappaB both in the presence and absence of vitamin D3. These findings suggest that NF-kappaB may be a factor in regulating the differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells.

The pattern of reoccurring chromosome abnormalities associated with the development of leukemia can be used as a guide in understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of these diseases. Therefore, a research project was designed to determine whether a metabolite of benzene, hydroquinone (HQ), could directly induce loss of chromosome 5 and/or 7 and gain of chromosome 8. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization with chromosome-specific 5, 7 and 8 probes we demonstrate that 42, 49 and 26 microM HQ induces monosomy 5, 7 and 8, respectively, in the human lymphoblast cell line GM09948. These results demonstrate for the first time that HQ induces a specific chromosome loss found in secondary MDS/AML.

KG1a and TF-1 cells were found to be 30-40-fold more resistant to mitoxantrone than HL-60 and U937 cells. Uptake and efflux of mitoxantrone were similar for all cell lines. Moreover, a potent P-glycoprotein blocker (PSC833) had no impact on either accumulation or efflux. No differences were found in the appearance and removal of mitoxantrone-induced DNA-protein complexes. These results suggest that resistance of KG1a and TF-1 cells is not related to a decreased interaction between mitoxantrone and topoisomerase II. Further studies showed that the mechanisms of cell death were different for sensitive and resistant cell lines. Thus, mitoxantrone induced rapid apoptotic cell death in sensitive cells as indicated by characteristic morphological changes and both high molecular weight and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. In contrast, mitoxantrone induced a G2-M block in resistant cells followed by a progressive loss of viability with necrotic features. Neither oligonucleosomal nor large DNA fragments were detected in these cells during a post-treatment period of up to 96 h. Finally, drug-induced activation of the AP-1 transcription factor was higher in resistant cell lines than in sensitive ones whereas activation of NF-kappaB was comparable. Therefore, our study provides evidence that certain AML cells display natural resistance to mitoxantrone which is independent of drug transport and drug-target interactions but appears to be associated with the inability of the drug to induce apoptosis in these cells.","['Bailly, J D', 'Skladanowski, A', 'Bettaieb, A', 'Mansat, V', 'Larsen, A K', 'Laurent, G']","['Bailly JD', 'Skladanowski A', 'Bettaieb A', 'Mansat V', 'Larsen AK', 'Laurent G']","['CJF INSERM 9503 and Centre Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Deoxyribonucleoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Apoptosis', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Deoxyribonucleoproteins/chemistry', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mitoxantrone/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/09/26 00:00,1997/09/26 00:01,['1997/09/26 00:00'],"['1997/09/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/26 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400762 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Sep;11(9):1523-32. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400762.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the effects of GG918 on leukemic cell were investigated using a 3 day MTT assay. Results showed that, in a highly resistant P-gp(+) leukemic cell line, 0.1 microM of GG918 gives rise to a 40-fold sensitization to daunorubicin (DNR) (residual resistance: 2.1), a 57-fold sensitization to mitoxantrone (residual resistance: 1.5), and a 3.3-fold sensitization to idarubicin (residual resistance: 2.9). When human AB serum was added to the incubation medium, 1 microM of GG918 was needed to observe the full P-gp modulation potency described above. The effect of 1 microM of GG918 was tested on 27 samples of poor prognosis acute leukemia (25 AML, two ALL). DNR sensitization (using the MTT assay) and modulation of rhodamine 123 uptake were monitored and used as criteria for comparing the in vitro modulation potency of this new compound to the potency of 10 microM of verapamil, which was used as reference. A good correlation (r = 0.8, P = 0.001) was observed between the results of the two tests. Eleven out of the 26 cases tested were MDR1(+) (42%), and showed a higher IC50 for DNR than the negative cases (861 +/- 1284 nM vs 187 +/- 246 nM, P = 0.05). GG918 was able to modulate the in vitro resistance to DNR in eight cases (seven MDR1(+), no MDR1(-), one non-tested). Verapamil did not increase DNR toxicity in four of these eight cases, but was more efficient in one other MDR1(+) case. In conclusion, the DNR sensitivity of the majority of the fresh AML samples expressing P-gp could be modulated in vitro by 1 microM of GG918.","['Zhou, D C', 'Simonin, G', 'Faussat, A M', 'Zittoun, R', 'Marie, J P']","['Zhou DC', 'Simonin G', 'Faussat AM', 'Zittoun R', 'Marie JP']","['Laboratoire de Cinetique et Cultures Cellulaires, Universite Paris VI, and Formation de Recherche Associee Claude Bernard, Hotel Dieu de Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Acridines)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tetrahydroisoquinolines)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'N488540F94 (Elacridar)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics', 'Acridines/*pharmacology', 'Acute Disease', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Tetrahydroisoquinolines', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1997/09/26 00:00,1997/09/26 00:01,['1997/09/26 00:00'],"['1997/09/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/26 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400761 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Sep;11(9):1516-22. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400761.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the leukemic cells typically express antigens associated with lymphoid maturation or activation (ie CD19, CD38, etc), it has been suggested that ALL blasts may evolve from a more primitive precursor. Increased understanding of the phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity of cells in ALL may provide clues to leukemogenesis and/ or impact prognostication or treatment. We utilized a phenotype/genotype approach to measure the prevalence and frequency of cytogenetically aberrant cells in a phenotypically defined primitive compartment (CD34+33-19-38-; CD34+Lin-). Bone marrow cells were flow cytometrically sorted into CD34-Lin+, CD34+Lin+ and CD34+Lin- subpopulations. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to quantify the frequency of cells with aneusomies in the sorted populations. Approximately 26% (5/19) of ALL cases at diagnosis contain cytogenetically aberrant CD34+Lin- cells. The frequency of cytogenetically aberrant cells in the CD34+Lin- compartment is independent of FAB, WBC and blast counts. These data indicate that cytogenetically aberrant cells may reside in a phenotypically defined primitive subpopulation and suggest that ALL blasts in some patients may evolve from a precursor compartment.","['Quijano, C A', 'Moore, D 2nd', 'Arthur, D', 'Feusner, J', 'Winter, S S', 'Pallavicini, M G']","['Quijano CA', 'Moore D 2nd', 'Arthur D', 'Feusner J', 'Winter SS', 'Pallavicini MG']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco 94115, USA.']",['eng'],['CA 60417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Adolescent', 'Aneuploidy', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",1997/09/26 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1997/09/26 00:00'],"['1997/09/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1997/09/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400754 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Sep;11(9):1508-15. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400754.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The myeloid antigens CD13 and/or CD33 were frequently lost (2/5 cases) or acquired (12/123 cases) at relapse. In 21 cases, the immunophenotype at relapse was more undifferentiated than at diagnosis, while it was more differentiated in 13 cases. Initial treatment intensity or preceding treatment with teniposide did not affect the phenotypic profile at relapse. Complete response (CR) rate to salvage therapy and event-free survival were not influenced by the immunophenotypic shifts, nor by the presence, at relapse, of leukemic cells expressing the myeloid antigens CD13 and/or CD33. Univariate analysis suggested that prognosis after relapse was dependent on the duration of 1st CR, patients' age and immunophenotype at the time of diagnosis, with a worse outcome for patients with T lineage ALL and for patients with the less differentiated subgroup of B lineage ALL (CD19+ and CD10-). Multivariate analysis showed that only two factors, duration of 1st CR and grade of immunologic differentiation at diagnosis, have independent prognostic value in relapsed ALL.","['Guglielmi, C', 'Cordone, I', 'Boecklin, F', 'Masi, S', 'Valentini, T', 'Vegna, M L', 'Ferrari, A', 'Testi, A M', 'Foa, R']","['Guglielmi C', 'Cordone I', 'Boecklin F', 'Masi S', 'Valentini T', 'Vegna ML', 'Ferrari A', 'Testi AM', 'Foa R']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, University La Sapienza, Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors']",1997/09/26 00:00,1997/09/26 00:01,['1997/09/26 00:00'],"['1997/09/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/26 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400772 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Sep;11(9):1501-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400772.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In such patients, the other allele of ETV6 could be disrupted by either a small deletion, a point mutation, or an epigenetic modification and it will be of interest to study the structure and expression of the remaining allele of ETV6 in these cases.

Genes for these proteins are immediate-early genes, and are inducible in diverse cell types by various stimuli. In the present study, we investigated the effect of mechanical agitation on the gene expression of these transcription factors in cultured suspension cells by the quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We found that mechanical agitation transiently induced NOR-1, NGFI-B and Nurr1 mRNAs in several leukemic cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. This induction was most pronounced in the HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line, but also occurred to a lesser extent in other cell lines including KG-1, THP-1 and U937 cells. The induction was attenuated by serum or albumin, which are shear stress protectants for suspension culture cells. These reagents did not suppress forskolin-induced NOR-1 gene expression. These findings suggest the involvement of fluid shear stress in agitation-induced immediate-early gene expression. Since even moderate agitation could cause the induction, investigators should be cautious when evaluating the expression of immediate-early genes in some leukemic cell lines.","['Bandoh, S', 'Tsukada, T', 'Maruyama, K', 'Ohkura, N', 'Yamaguchi, K']","['Bandoh S', 'Tsukada T', 'Maruyama K', 'Ohkura N', 'Yamaguchi K']","['Growth Factor Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NR4A1 protein, human)', '0 (NR4A2 protein, human)', '0 (NR4A3 protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '0 (Receptors, Thyroid Hormone)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 2', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*genetics', 'Receptors, Steroid', 'Receptors, Thyroid Hormone', 'Stress, Mechanical', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/09/26 00:00,1997/09/26 00:01,['1997/09/26 00:00'],"['1997/09/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/26 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400800 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Sep;11(9):1453-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400800.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia Study Group of the Ministry of Health and Welfare (Kohseisho).,1447-52,"FLT3 is a member of receptor tyrosine kinases expressed in leukemia cells, as well as in hematopoietic stem cells. Recently, a somatic alteration of the FLT3 gene was found in acute myeloid leukemia, as an internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD) which caused elongation of the juxtamembrane (JM) domain of FLT3. Here we characterized the FLT3/ITD and investigated its clinical significance in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Seventy-four newly diagnosed patients with APL, who were treated with the same protocol in a multi-institutional study, were studied for the FLT3/ITD. Genomic and message sequences of the FLT3 gene were amplified by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and elongated PCR products were sequenced. Fifteen patients (20.3%) had FLT3/ITD, all of which were transcribed in frame. Location of the duplicated fragments (six to 30 amino acids) varied from patient to patient. However, they always contained either Y591 or Y599, but the tyrosine kinase domain was not significantly affected. This finding implied that signal transduction of FLT3 is amplified by the duplication. Clinically, the presence of FLT3/ITD was related to high peripheral white blood cell counts as well as peripheral leukemia cell counts (P < 0.0001), high LDH level (P = 0.04), and low fibrinogen concentration (P = 0.04). These data suggest that FLT3/ITD plays a significant role in progression of APL.","['Kiyoi, H', 'Naoe, T', 'Yokota, S', 'Nakao, M', 'Minami, S', 'Kuriyama, K', 'Takeshita, A', 'Saito, K', 'Hasegawa, S', 'Shimodaira, S', 'Tamura, J', 'Shimazaki, C', 'Matsue, K', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Arima, N', 'Suzuki, R', 'Morishita, H', 'Saito, H', 'Ueda, R', 'Ohno, R']","['Kiyoi H', 'Naoe T', 'Yokota S', 'Nakao M', 'Minami S', 'Kuriyama K', 'Takeshita A', 'Saito K', 'Hasegawa S', 'Shimodaira S', 'Tamura J', 'Shimazaki C', 'Matsue K', 'Kobayashi H', 'Arima N', 'Suzuki R', 'Morishita H', 'Saito H', 'Ueda R', 'Ohno R']","['Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukocytosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",1997/09/26 00:00,1997/09/26 00:01,['1997/09/26 00:00'],"['1997/09/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/26 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400756 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Sep;11(9):1447-52. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400756.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study revealed the duplication at the juxtamembrane and the first tyrosine kinase domains of FLT3 in seven of 92 (8%) patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML with trilineage myelodysplasia (AML/TMDS), the diseases which may represent neoplastic changes of pluripotent stem cells.

Although the duplicated regions varied within exon 11 in each case, they occurred in-frame, and altered mRNA expressions were demonstrated by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Two cases of MDS with a FLT3 duplication transformed to overt leukemia within a few months. Longitudinal analyses in two other patients with leukemia revealed that the duplication was a late genetic event during the disease course; one of whom showed two independent duplications of FLT3 at the terminal therapy-resistant phase. Of seven patients with the FLT3 duplication, six had abnormal karyotypes, and four harbored a point mutation of the N-RAS and/or TP53 genes. Patients with FLT3 mutations have poor prognoses.

They may therefore have clinical potential for purging harvests from chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients, prior to autografting. Whilst ODN are highly effective in cell-free systems, their uptake into intact cells is very poor. We have previously reported that reversible permeabilisation of CML cell lines with Streptolysin-O (SL-O) can dramatically increase intracytoplasmic and nuclear ODN uptake. In this study, we examined whether SL-O permeabilisation could be used to enhance ODN uptake into bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvests from CML patients, without undue toxicity. All 19 harvests studied were from patients in stable chronic phase of CML. Samples studied were either fresh BM harvests following leucoconcentration, fresh PBSC collections, or from previously cryopreserved harvests. Cells were permeabilised by SL-O to load them with fluorescein-labelled ODN. The proportion of permeabilised and viable cells was assessed by fluorescein uptake and propidium iodide exclusion, respectively, by flow cytometry. The effect of SL-O on ODN uptake and cell toxicity was unpredictable on simple mononuclear fractions of harvests. In contrast, SL-O consistently significantly enhanced ODN uptake in samples which were first selected for CD34-positive cells, and this was achieved without either direct toxicity or inhibition of CFU-GM growth. The SL-O concentration required for optimal permeabilisation varied considerably from case to case, in line with previous data on cell lines. PBSC harvests positively selected for CD34-positive cells tended to achieve superior permeabilisation to CD34 positively selected BM harvests. SL-O can be used to safely enhance the intracellular uptake of antisense ODN. This is best achieved on harvests which are first selected for CD34-positive cells.","['Broughton, C M', 'Spiller, D G', 'Pender, N', 'Komorovskaya, M', 'Grzybowski, J', 'Giles, R V', 'Tidd, D M', 'Clark, R E']","['Broughton CM', 'Spiller DG', 'Pender N', 'Komorovskaya M', 'Grzybowski J', 'Giles RV', 'Tidd DM', 'Clark RE']","['University Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Streptolysins)', '0 (streptolysin O)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*administration & dosage', 'Streptolysins/*therapeutic use']",1997/09/26 00:00,1997/09/26 00:01,['1997/09/26 00:00'],"['1997/09/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/26 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400774 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Sep;11(9):1435-41. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400774.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were even less patients with a high leukocyte count (15 vs 38%, P=0.003), a characteristic associated with adverse prognosis while the incidence of Philadelphia-positive (Ph-positive) ALL was not significantly increased compared to younger adults (31 vs 20%, P=0.2). After completion of induction therapy, with or without salvage treatment, 85% (CI: 70-94%) obtained a complete response (CR) while treatment-related mortality during induction was 7.5% (CI: 2-20%). Median overall survival and disease-free survival were 14.3 months and 14 months, respectively, which, although inferior to results achieved in younger adults, compares favorably with available data in the elderly. Treatment with IFN proved feasible in most patients but had to be discontinued in eight patients because of toxicity. Age-adapted treatment improves the prognosis of ALL in the elderly even if, in most cases, a cure cannot be achieved.","['Delannoy, A', 'Sebban, C', 'Cony-Makhoul, P', 'Cazin, B', 'Cordonnier, C', 'Bouabdallah, R', 'Cahn, J Y', 'Dreyfus, F', 'Sadoun, A', 'Vernant, J P', 'Gay, C', 'Broustet, A', 'Michaux, J L', 'Fiere, D']","['Delannoy A', 'Sebban C', 'Cony-Makhoul P', 'Cazin B', 'Cordonnier C', 'Bouabdallah R', 'Cahn JY', 'Dreyfus F', 'Sadoun A', 'Vernant JP', 'Gay C', 'Broustet A', 'Michaux JL', 'Fiere D']","[""Groupe d'Hematologie de l'Universite Catholique de Louvain, Belgium.""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Steroids)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'LALA 87 protocol']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Daunorubicin/analogs & derivatives', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Steroids', 'Vincristine']",1997/09/26 00:00,1997/09/26 00:01,['1997/09/26 00:00'],"['1997/09/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/26 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400780 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Sep;11(9):1429-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400780.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Relative to normal c-abl, p210bc1/abl has elevated tyrosine kinase activity that is essential for its transforming activity. We recently reported a prominent 62 kDa GAP-associated P-tyr protein and five additional consistent but less prominent P-tyr proteins as well as five more minor P-tyr proteins that are constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in primary primitive lineage negative (lin-) chronic phase CML blasts but not in comparable primary lin- normal blasts. The GAP-associated p62 protein has now been purified, sequenced and its gene has been cloned; it is a previously unidentified protein and is currently being characterized. In analyzing P-tyr proteins in primary lin- normal blasts in response to various hematopoietic cytokines, we found a striking similarity in the tyrosine phosphorylation of four major and three minor proteins after stimulation with c-kit ligand (KL) and the P-tyr proteins that are constitutively phosphorylated in primary primitive lin- chronic phase CML blasts. Other cytokines tested (ie GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-3, FLT3 ligand, TPO, EPO) were much less active or stimulated phosphorylation of other proteins. KL/c-kit and bcr/abl have some similar activities including enhancing survival and expansion of hematopoietic progenitor cells, probably acting primarily on early progenitors at the time of lineage commitment rather than on self-renewing stem cells. Activation of growth factor receptors promote a cascade of protein phosphorylations that can ultimately result in a wide range of cellular responses. Sustained activation of discrete signaling pathways in some types of cells results in differentiation, whereas transient activation instead causes a proliferative response; in other cell types, the converse is true. It may be postulated that stem cells and primitive progenitors are at a particularly susceptible stage of development that renders them especially responsive to sustained bcr/abl-induced phorphorylation of a number of signaling proteins that are components of critical regulatory pathways, including c-kit. The affected pathways control and coordinate multiple diverse cell processes including proliferation, differentiation, maturation and apoptosis, processes that are normally tightly regulated and integrated. Perturbation of these key pathways in primitive progenitors would be expected to seriously disrupt orderly hematopoiesis and could also explain the multiple subtle pleiotropic biological abnormalities characteristically observed in later maturing CML compartments that we have collectively designated 'discordant maturation'. The true situation is undoubtedly very complex and involves interaction of multiple cytokines and signaling pathways that we are now trying to define. Constitutive downstream activation of critical pathways in susceptible early progenitors that normally require KL or other factors for activation could explain most if not all features of the disease.","['Clarkson, B D', 'Strife, A', 'Wisniewski, D', 'Lambek, C', 'Carpino, N']","['Clarkson BD', 'Strife A', 'Wisniewski D', 'Lambek C', 'Carpino N']","['Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA64593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology']",1997/09/26 00:00,1997/09/26 00:01,['1997/09/26 00:00'],"['1997/09/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/26 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400751 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Sep;11(9):1404-28. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400751.,179,,,"['Leukemia. 1998 Feb;12(2):136-8.

Conventional metaphase analysis is considered to be the ""gold standard"" for evaluating cytogenetic response. The frequency of cytogenetic analysis can be reduced considerably if patients are monitored by molecular methods, such as quantitative Southern blot, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), quantitative western blot, or competitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Molecular methods can be performed on peripheral blood specimens and are therefore less invasive than cytogenetic analyses of bone marrow metaphases. Furthermore these techniques are applicable to Ph-negative/BCR-AbL-positive cases. Results obtained by Southern blotting, western blotting, and FISH are readily quantifiable but their sensitivity is not generally superior to that of cytogenetic methods. RT-PCR is by far the most sensitive method. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis is the method of choice for monitoring patients after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Using competitive PCR in patients after BMT, reappearance and/or rising levels of BCR-ABL transcripts can be detected prior to relapse. All complete cytogenetic responders to interferon-alpha are positive for BCR-ABL transcripts. The level of residual disease spans a range over found orders of magnitude. In both interferon-alpha-treated patients and patients after BMT a good correlation between BCR-ABL transcript numbers per microgram of RNA and cytogenetic results has been found. Variables in the competitive PCR assay may be controlled for by quantification of transcripts of the normal ABL gene as an internal standard.

These cytokines include leukaemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neuronotrophic factor, oncostatin M, growth-promoting activity and cardiotrophin 1. They all have been found to regulate a number of properties of cells of the developing and mature nervous system in vitro and thus are neuroregulatory cytokines. The actions of these cytokines include regulation of neurotransmitter phenotype, differentiation of neuronal precursor cells both in the peripheral nervous system and in the spinal cord, survival of differentiated neurons, and regulation of development of both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. In addition, studies in animal models show that these factors can rescue sensory and motor neurons from axotomy-induced cell death, which suggests that they can act as trauma factors for injured neurons. Analysis of the expression patterns of the different neuroregulatory cytokines and their receptors reveals that the receptors are expressed throughout nervous system development and following trauma, whereas the cytokines show temporal and spatial specific expression patterns. This is consistent with the idea that specific cytokines have specific roles in neural development and repair, but that their signalling pathways are shared. The phenotypes of the receptor knockouts show clear deficits in nervous system development, indicating a crucial role for LIF receptor signalling. Knockouts of individual cytokines are less dramatic, but LIF and CNTF knockouts do reveal deficits in maintenance of motor neurons or following trauma. Thus, whereas LIF and CNTF have clear roles in maintenance and following trauma, it is unclear which of the cytokines is involved in nervous system development.

Study of 52 patients treated in a single center].,12-5,"BACKGROUND: A single-center experience review about accessibility to bone marrow transplantation (BMT) as postremission therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is analyzed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1988 to December 1994, 86 patients were diagnosed from de novo AML in our institution. A BMT was the treatment of choice for all patients younger than 55 years. An allogenic BMT (Allo-BMT) was offered for all patients younger than 35 years with a compatible sibling donor or those older patients, 35-55 years, with bad prognosis features. An autologus BMT (ABMT) was offered to those patients older than 35 years or those younger than 35 without an histocompatible donor. RESULTS: 52 out of 86 diagnosed patients were younger than 50 years (60%). 29 of them were candidates to Allo-BMT (24 patients younger than 35 years and 5 patients older than 35 with refractory disease) and the rest 23 to ABMT. 22 out of the 24 candidates to Allo-BMT entered complete remission (CR) and 12 of them had an HLA-identical donor. The Allo-BMT was performed in CR1 in 7 patients in CR2 in three patients and with refractory disease in two cases. An ABMT was finally planned in 30 patients, 18 patients older than 35 who entered CR and the rest 12 patients younger than 35 years in CR without a sibling donor. Only 11 out of this 30 patients underwent an ABMT in first CR. Reasons for this low number were: early relapse (B), toxicity (6), refuse (2), lost of follow-up (2) and suicide (1). Five out of this early relapse patients underwent an ABMT in CR2. Disease-free survival (DFS) at three years was 23 +/- 10% for the 52 patients included in the study. DFS obtained with Allo-BMT and AMBT were 39 +/- 16% and 63 +/- 22% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the new postremission treatment modalities available for AML the rate of longer survivals are still low. When data from BMT is analyzed we must be awared because only a small fraction of patients assigned to BMT will finally access to this treatment.","['Tomas, J F', 'Calvo, J M', 'Gomez-Garcia de Soria, V', 'Pinilla, I', 'Figuera, A', 'Fernandez-Ranada, J M']","['Tomas JF', 'Calvo JM', 'Gomez-Garcia de Soria V', 'Pinilla I', 'Figuera A', 'Fernandez-Ranada JM']","['Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Madrid.']",['spa'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis']",1997/05/31 00:00,1997/09/26 00:01,['1997/05/31 00:00'],"['1997/05/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/26 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/31 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1997 May 31;109(1):12-5.,,,,,,,,,Accesibilidad al trasplante de medula osea en la leucemia aguda mieloblastica.

To study its gene regulation, we isolated a genomic clone containing the human alpha6 integrin gene promoter. It includes 3 kb of the upstream flanking region, the first exon (385 bp), and 9 kb of the first intron. The alpha6 promoter directs transcription initiation from a primary site 202 nucleotides from the translation initiation codon. Unlike most other integrin gene promoters, the alpha6 promoter has a TATA box (GATAAA), which is located 22 nucleotides upstream from the primary transcription initiation site. A 190-bp region upstream from the TATA box is highly rich (78%) in C and G nucleotides and contains several Sp1 and AP2 binding sequences. However, full promoter activity (in the presence of the SV40 enhancer) requires only 78 bp of this C/G-rich sequence upstream from the TATA box. Slightly upstream from the C/G-rich region are a steroid receptor binding homolog and an epithelial-cell-specific E-pal sequence. Another possible epithelial cell-specific binding sequence (Ker1) is found immediately downstream from the TATA box. Cell-type-specific activities of the promoter paralleled the alpha6 mRNA levels in four tested cell lines. In the presence of the SV40 enhancer, alpha6 promoter activity increased approximately four-fold in primary keratinocytes and in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and 30-fold in T47D breast carcinoma cells, but remained undetectable in K562 leukemia cells. Genomic analysis that compared alpha6-expressing with non-alpha6-expressing cells suggested that DNA methylation is not involved in the silencing of the alpha6 gene in alpha6-negative cells. DNase I footprint analysis confirmed the binding of Sp1 and AP2 to their cognate sequences. A nuclear extract of high-alpha6-expressing HBL-100 cells also produced significant binding to these sites, suggesting that the two transcription factors are probably involved in the positive regulation of the alpha6 promoter.","['Lin, C S', 'Chen, Y', 'Huynh, T', 'Kramer, R']","['Lin CS', 'Chen Y', 'Huynh T', 'Kramer R']","['Department of Stomatology, University of California, San Francisco 94143-0512, USA.']",['eng'],['DE/CA 11912/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Integrin alpha6)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Integrin alpha6', 'Keratinocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Skin/cytology/metabolism', 'TATA Box', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/09/26 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/26 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/dna.1997.16.929 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 1997 Aug;16(8):929-37. doi: 10.1089/dna.1997.16.929.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The acute and severe hypertriglyceridemia was induced at 8 to 14 days after the end of the L-asparaginase therapy, with an earlier remarkable increase in the apoCIII/apoCII ratio and an extreme decrease of fibrinogen concentrations (a marker of the protein productivity of the liver). It is well known that apoCII and apoCIII have possible functions as an activator and an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), respectively.

Although leukaemia can arise as a de novo disease, it has become increasingly clear that therapies, including the use of irradiation and/or chemotherapy, can give rise to malignancy. Therapy-associated myelodysplasia (t-MDS) and therapy-associated acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) account for 10-20% of new cases of these diseases. Although these secondary malignancies have been recognised as a clinical entity for nearly 30 years, molecular studies are now pinpointing various regions of the genome that are susceptible to DNA damage by these chemotherapeutic/radiotherapeutic strategies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From October 1988 to September 1995, 1,092 patients underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy. RESULTS: Of 1,092 radical prostatectomy specimens, 13 (1.2%) were found to have hematologic malignancies involving the prostate and/or lymph nodes sampled during concomitant pelvic lymph node dissection. The malignancies detected included Hodgkin's disease (3) and hairy cell leukemia (1), which required further therapy. However, 9 of the 13 patients (62%) demonstrated either chronic lymphocytic leukemia (3) or low grade, small lymphocytic lymphoma (6), which requires symptomatic treatment only. The transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsies revealed suspicious lymphocytic infiltrate in addition to prostatic adenocarcinoma in 2 of the 13 patients (15%). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of hematologic malignancies discovered at radical prostatectomy do not require further treatment and should not delay treatment of prostatic adenocarcinoma.","['Terris, M K', 'Hausdorff, J', 'Freiha, F S']","['Terris MK', 'Hausdorff J', 'Freiha FS']","['Department of Urology, Stanford University Medical Center, California 94305-5118, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Urol,The Journal of urology,0376374,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*surgery', 'Aged', 'Hodgkin Disease/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*diagnosis/therapy', '*Prostatectomy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*surgery']",1997/09/25 00:00,1997/09/25 00:01,['1997/09/25 00:00'],"['1997/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0022-5347(01)64242-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Urol. 1997 Oct;158(4):1457-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fusion protein was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography and reassociated with chemically deglycosylated ricin toxin A chain (RTA). The resulting fusion toxin was found to react with antibodies to GMCSF, RTB and RTA and had the predicted molecular mass of 80 kDa. GMCSF-ricin bound poorly to asialofetuin (Kd = 10(6) M-1) and receptor negative cells indicating loss of lectin activity, but bound strongly to GMCSF receptor positive HL60 cells. Ligand displacement assays showed fusion toxin affinity 2.6-fold less than native GMCSF. Selective inhibition of protein synthesis was observed on receptor positive cells. Induction of apoptosis was also observed on receptor positive cells. Cells expressing multidrug resistance gene products (P-gp, Bcl2 and BclXL) were also sensitive to fusion toxin.

The TCR alpha and beta sequences were cloned and sequenced by reverse transcriptase-inverse polymerase chain reaction. Two T-ALL samples had a long complementarity determining region (CDR), three of the alpha chain and the other two T-ALL samples had long CDR3 of the beta chain, compared with normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Thus, a total of six T-ALL samples had unusual TCR gene structure, which was unrelated to the immunophenotype. On the other hand, CDR3 length in ATL samples was similar to normal PBL.

Erythropoietin (Epo), interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) accelerated the proliferation of these clones. Autonomous growth of the clones was independent of Epo because it was not altered by Epo anti-sense oligonucleotides, nor was Epo detectable in culture supernatants. Cells from the mutant clones could not be induced by Epo to express glycophorin A and haemoglobin synthesis was markedly reduced. Haemin reversed the block in Epo-induced haemoglobin synthesis. Acquisition of growth factor-independence appears to be linked with the selective loss of differentiation capacity.

For this purpose 34 patients were studied. Patients were classified into three groups according to CD34 antigen expression: (1) cases in which all blast cells (100%) were positive for the CD34 Ag (n = 9); (2) cases in which all blast cells lacked the expression of this antigen (n = 10); and (3) patients in whom both, CD34 positive and negative blast cell subsets coexisted (n = 15). In 15 cases immunomagnetic cell selection was performed and two subpopulations were separated: one, phenotypically more immature (CD34+), and another, theoretically more differentiated (CD34-/33+). In addition, in three cases both CD34+ and CD34- blast cell subpopulations were sorted using a FACStar flow cytometer. Blast colony assays were performed using 0.9% methylcellulose and two different recombinant human hematopoietic growth factors (HGFs), IL-3 and G-CSF, were used as growth stimulants. Either, a single or a combination of the growth factors was added to cultures. Colony formation was observed in both 100% positive or 100% negative cases for the CD34 antigen as well as in the CD34+ and CD34- cell fractions separated by immunomagnetic selection or flow cytometry. The effect of G-CSF and IL-3 on both cell fractions was as follows: cases with a uniform population according to CD34 expression (100% positive or negative) showed a better growth response with IL-3 especially for the CD34+ cases (87% vs 40% of CD34+ and CD34- cases, respectively). Within the CD34-/33+ selected fractions, IL-3 tended to induce a higher proliferative response than G-CSF while the opposite was found within the CD34+ cell selected fractions. In contrast it was observed that both IL-3 and G-CSF induced a higher PE on the CD34- blast cells (both selected and 100% negative), although the difference was not statistically significant. The existence of a possible synergistic effect (SE) between HGFs was also explored. Overall, a synergistic growth was observed in nine out of the 13 selected cases studied and this effect could be seen in both CD34- or CD34+ blast cell fractions. The analysis of the complete phenotypic characteristics of these cells revealed that cell fractions showing SE were more immature according to the expression of CD15 and HLA-DR antigens. We can conclude that in leukemic hematopoiesis, CD34 antigen expression does not have the same significance as it does in normal hematopoiesis since clonogenic cells are not restricted to the CD34+ acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blast cell fraction. Moreover, our study shows that the heterogeneous response to HGFs observed in AML patients may be associated with the existence of immunophenotypically different blast cell subsets.","['Del Canizo, M C', 'Galende, J', 'Mota, A', 'Orfao, A', 'Martinez, A', 'Almeida, J', 'San Miguel, J F']","['Del Canizo MC', 'Galende J', 'Mota A', 'Orfao A', 'Martinez A', 'Almeida J', 'San Miguel JF']","['Servicio de Hematologia Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Biomarkers', 'Blast Crisis', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/*pathology', 'Reference Values']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/09/25 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212697000313 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00031-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1997 Jul;21(7):651-6. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00031-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell survival was estimated using Trypan Blue supravital stain following a 24-h incubation and leukemic cell lines were studied in continuous cell cultures of 4 weeks duration. Our results showed that HA protects normal BM cells from Mc 540 mediated phototoxicity.

These data provide an interesting counterpoint to the effect of mutant RAS on monocytic cells, where it has a potentiating effect on differentiation and may indicate a causal link between the activation of RAS and erythroid lineage dysplasia in preleukaemia.","['Zaker, F', 'Darley, R L', 'al Sabah, A', 'Burnett, A K']","['Zaker F', 'Darley RL', 'al Sabah A', 'Burnett AK']","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, U.K.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Genes, ras', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Rats', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/09/25 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212697000222 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00022-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1997 Jul;21(7):635-40. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00022-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Myeloid blasts were tested by applying direct immunofluorescence staining using anti-CD34 fluorescein monoclonal antibody in flow cytometry. CD34 antigen was found in 73 out of 141 (51%) cases and in particular in M0, M1 and M4 French-American-British (FAB) cytotypes, while M3 and M5 cases were rarely positive. In patients whose blasts expressed CD34 antigen a significantly lower rate of complete remission (CR) was observed as opposed to CD34 negative cases (61% vs 88%) (P = 0.001). Furthermore, a negative correlation between high intensity of CD34 expression, measured as a mean fluorescence index (MFI), and CR rate was observed. In particular, patients with a higher CD34 fluorescence intensity (MFI > 23), showed a further reduction in CR rate (48%). Also, these patients had a significantly lower overall survival (P = 0.03) as compared to patients with no expression of CD34 and patients with CD34 MFI < 23. In conclusion, these findings confirm that CD34 expression is frequently associated with ""immature"" FAB cytotypes (M0, M1 and M4) and with a reduced probability to achieve CR. Furthermore, a high CD34 intensity of expression should be considered as a reliable poor prognostic factor.","['Raspadori, D', 'Lauria, F', 'Ventura, M A', 'Rondelli, D', 'Visani, G', 'de Vivo, A', 'Tura, S']","['Raspadori D', 'Lauria F', 'Ventura MA', 'Rondelli D', 'Visani G', 'de Vivo A', 'Tura S']","['Istituto di Ematologia e Oncologia Medica L. e A.

Here, we attempted to define the possible involvement of tie in the pathobiology of hematopoietic malignancies by examining tie mRNA expression in human leukemia and lymphoma cells. We used a large panel of 93 well-characterized human continuous leukemia-lymphoma cell lines as model systems for the various hematopoietic cell lineages. At the Northern blot level, none of the 27 lymphoid leukemia or lymphoma-derived cell lines (originating from four B-precursor leukemia, four B-cell leukemia, four B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, two myeloma, two Burkitt lymphoma, four T-cell leukemia, five Hodgkin lymphoma, two anaplastic large cell lymphoma) tested expressed tie transcripts, whereas 23/42 (55%) of the myeloid cell lines analyzed expressed tie mRNA: in detail, 15 of 20 (75%) megakaryocytic, five of 11 (45%) erythroid, three of seven (43%) myelocytic and none of four monocytic cell lines were tie mRNA positive. In the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, which can detect very low levels of mRNA expression, all 12 myeloid cell lines and 19 of 39 (48%) lymphoid cell lines were positive. In experiments aimed at inducing cellular differentiation over an incubation period of 4 days, the phorbol ester PMA strongly enhanced tie mRNA expression in one erythroid and in one myelocytic cell line, but (like thrombopoietin) down-regulated tie mRNA expression in two megakaryocytic cell lines. Taken together these results indicate that tie is predominantly expressed in leukemia cells derived from the myeloid cell lineages (and here in particular in megakaryoblastic cells) and not in lymphoid leukemia cells. These observations provide some evidence for the hypothesis that tie is a receptor for a regulatory factor involved in normal and plausibly also leukemic hematopoiesis.","['Bredoux, C', 'Uphoff, C C', 'Drexler, H G']","['Bredoux C', 'Uphoff CC', 'Drexler HG']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, TIE)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/*enzymology', 'Lymphoma/classification/*enzymology', 'Multiple Myeloma/enzymology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, TIE', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/09/25 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212697000143 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00014-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1997 Jul;21(7):595-601. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00014-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While 0.5 nM TPA had little if any effect, exposure of U937 cells to higher TPA concentrations (5-500 nM) revealed a complete growth arrest after 48 h. Cytosolic PKC activity decreased by 50% after exposure to 0.5 nM TPA and by 80 and 95% after stimulation with 5 nM and 50 nM TPA, respectively. Simultaneously, the PKC activity in the particulate fraction of U937 cells increased accordingly. These events were associated with induction of a differentiated monocytic phenotype. Expression of the c-myc gene was down-regulated and c-jun and c-fms transcripts increased following exposure to 5-500 nM TPA. In contrast, exposure to 0.5 nM TPA decreased c-myc expression and increased c-jun transcripts only transiently between 4 and 8 h while little if any effect was detectable on c-fms mRNA expression and subsequent differentiation. Taken together, these data suggest that a certain initial threshold of PKC activation is required for induction of a differentiated monocytic phenotype while beyond this threshold, a growth-arrested and differentiated state in these human leukemic cells can be maintained regardless of TPA concentrations.","['Hass, R', 'Prudovsky, I', 'Kruhoffer, M']","['Hass R', 'Prudovsky I', 'Kruhoffer M']","['Institute of Anatomy, University Clinic Charite, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Genes, fms', 'Genes, jun', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/09/25 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212697000106 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00010-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1997 Jul;21(7):589-94. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00010-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was an era in which many changes in medicine and nursing combined to alter the entire philosophy of managing malignant disease. More specifically, the fluid-phase tumors, which comprise myelodysplasia and the leukemias, were singled out for special attention. First there was the ease with which blood and bone marrow could be sampled, making serial investigations simple and practical. Second, cytotoxic drugs became available ranging from nitrogen mustard through cytosine arabinoside, the anthracycline antibiotics, and the epi-podophyllotoxins. Although cytomorphology of the hematopoietic tissue had been exquisitely defined with the use of Romanowsky stains coupled with electron microscopy, the diagnosis of leukemia was, before 1945, a death sentence for want of effective therapy. This changed dramatically with the introduction of the folate antagonists, and progress was unremitting as the range of new products expanded. Suddenly responses could be obtained with single agents, and fairly rapidly combinations were developed for cumulative antitumor effect. Many agents had undesirable toxicity among different organs. Although slightly different for myeloblastic or lymphoblastic variants, this approach produced apparent disease eradication. The concept of complete remission, both clinical and hematologic, was born. Some of our early enthusiasm has had to be tempered with the somber appreciation that not all patients can improve and many others experience relapses. Where then do we stand? Leukemic cells themselves seldom kill. It is the relentless and uncontrolled expansion of a neoplastic clone that leads to bone marrow failure, albeit at different rates in the various subtypes. In the acute forms, the common presentation remains symptomatic anemia, neutropenic sepsis, and thrombocytopenic bleeding. Differentiation from marrow aplasia may not be possible at first on clinical grounds, although bone tenderness, gingival hypertrophy, and skin infiltration are among the general useful differential signs. Findings in the circulation and the marrow are of cardinal importance in diagnosis; they provide the basis for classification. Improved accuracy has followed the introduction of cytochemical stains, and a widening range of monoclonal antibodies, and greater recourse to karyotyping, have enhanced diagnostic acumen. Treatment decisions rest on many variables or prognostic factors that include age, performance status, comorbidity, and disease category, with an ever increasing regard for the part played by cellular and molecular genetics. Despite skillful utilization of this wealth of information for optimal management, outcome often leaves much to be desired. Myelodysplasia encompasses a number of different syndromes in which the refractory anemias are indolent, whereas those with excess blasts progress toward overt leukemia. Considerable judgment is necessary in selecting patients for whom supportive therapy alone is appropriate and recognizing others, up to one third of patients for whom use growth factors that include erythropoietin, granulocyte or granulocyte monocyte-colony stimulating factors, and thrombopoietin can be justified. The often unfavorable result has been a stimulus to current investigations that examine the value of intensive chemotherapy or the more innovative bone marrow transplantation and its peripheral blood equivalent. Autografting is a newer alternative that does not have proved potential. Acute leukemia, whether myeloblastic or lymphoblastic, has been managed with mixed success. Remission rates have steadily increased and, notably among children, moved toward 100% in certain groupings. The downside of nonspecific drug regimens is that some patients simply may not respond, whereas others experience remissions and then relapses.

DESIGN: Retrospective survey of case series. SETTING: University hospital medical center. PATIENTS: Sixty-five patients with cutaneous lymphomas and related disorders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Detection of EBV genes and EBV-encoded small nuclear RNAs. RESULTS: Evidence of latent EBV infection was demonstrated in 15 patients: 3 had malignant lymphoma with clinical features mimicking cytophagic histiocytic panniculitis, 6 had facial vesiculopapular eruptions mimicking hydroa vacciniforme, 4 had angiocentric lymphoma, 1 had histiocytoid lymphoma associated with hemophagocytosis, and 1 had plasmacytoma. Hypersensitivity to mosquito bites was noted in a patient with hydroa vacciniforme-like eruptions and another with histiocytoid lymphoma. Angiocentric infiltration of atypical lymphoid cells was a common histological feature in the patients with hydroa vacciniforme-like eruptions and angiocentric lymphoma. No evidence of EBV infection was apparent in 19 patients with mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome, 7 with adult T-cell leukemia or lymphoma, 3 with lymphomatoid papulosis (type A), and 2 with lymphocytoma cutis.

In a previous study, it was shown that a Sjogren's syndrome-like systemic exocrinopathy is induced in the virus infected mice. AIMS: To examine lymphocyte functions of the virus infected mice. METHODS: Four-week old mice were inoculated with the virus and their spleen cells were transferred into syngeneic nu/nu mice. Their organs were examined by light and electron microscopy. Phenotypes of the colon infiltrating cells were examined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: All nu/nu recipients had died by six weeks after cell transfer, showing runting disease like cachexia with diarrhoea and anal bleeding. Histopathological examination revealed that systemic exocrinopathy was adoptively transferable and that the colon became thickened due to mononuclear cell infiltration into the mucosal and submucosal layer with hyperplasia of intestinal epithelial cells. No virus particles were found in the colon. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that most of the infiltrating CD4+ T cells showed CD45RBlow. No intestinal lesions were observed in the virus infected mice nor in nu/nu mice inoculated with normal lymphocytes. CONCLUSION: Lymphocytes of the virus infected mice induced colitis and hyperplasia of intestinal epithelial cells as well as systemic exocrinopathy in nu/nu mice.

Discrepancies in ABO grouping can be characterized by inappropriate results in either cell or serum grouping.

Fc epsilonRI-dependent exocytosis requires activation of protein kinase C and mobilization of calcium from intra- and extracellular stores. However, how these events ultimately regulate the membrane fusion step between cytoplasmic granules and the plasma membrane still remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of the small GTPases of the rab3 subfamily in the regulated exocytosis following stimulation of rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3). Analysis using reverse-transcriptase-based PCR showed that RBL-2H3 cells expressed rab3a and rab3d isoforms, with a predominance of rab3d at the mRNA level. Investigation of the subcellular distribution using isoform-specific Abs demonstrated that the majority of rab3a was expressed in the cytosol, whereas rab3d was found predominantly in the membrane fraction. To determine whether these proteins play a role in Fc epsilonRI-triggered exocytosis, we established RBL-2H3 transfectants that overexpressed wild-type and expressed GTP-binding mutant forms (N135I) of rab3a and rab3d. Whereas expression of rab3a proteins did not significantly affect degranulation as tested by beta-hexosaminidase release, those of both wild-type and mutant rab3d proteins inhibited degranulation. Calculations of the initial fast and of the second slow release rates showed that they are both inhibited about twofold, suggesting that rab3d interferes with a rate-limiting step in Fc epsilonRI-stimulated exocytosis.","['Roa, M', 'Paumet, F', 'Le Mao, J', 'David, B', 'Blank, U']","['Roa M', 'Paumet F', 'Le Mao J', 'David B', 'Blank U']","[""Unite d'Immuno-Allergie, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France. mroa@pasteur.fr""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Receptors, Fc)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rab3 GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Exocytosis/*immunology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Mast Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'rab3 GTP-Binding Proteins']",1997/09/23 00:00,1997/09/23 00:01,['1997/09/23 00:00'],"['1997/09/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1997 Sep 15;159(6):2815-23.,,,['GENBANK/U90206'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied the transcriptional regulation of the c-sis/PDGF-B gene in human K562 erythroleukemia cells that have been induced to undergo megakaryoblastic differentiation by treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Upon differentiation of these cells, c-sis/PDGF-B transcription is increased 50-100-fold. We show here that a minimal c-sis/PDGF-B promoter region, spanning nucleotides -64 to +6, retains full inducibility. Linker scanning mutagenesis within this minimal region identified four segments that were important for expression in differentiating K562 cells: a previously defined sis proximal element (SPE; -64 to -45), the TATA box, the 10 bp immediately downstream of the TATA box [TATA neighboring sequence (TNS); -24 to -15], and the mRNA start site region. Combined mutation of the SPE and TNS resulted in a greater impairment of induction than did mutation of either sequence alone. In contrast, combined mutation of the SPE and the start site or of the TNS and the start site did not lower induction beyond that displayed by the least inducible single mutants. The combination of the SPE and the TNS was sufficient to confer wild-type levels of inducibility to a heterologous promoter. Both the SPE and the TNS were sensitive to alterations in the helical spacing between these elements and the TATA box. Using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we demonstrated binding of Sp family members and of two additional unidentified nuclear factors to the TNS in both 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-treated and untreated cells. The TNS, therefore, appears to represent a target for a constitutively bound factor(s) that is required for cooperation with a differentiation-specific factor bound at the SPE to drive efficient c-sis/PDGF-B transcription in TPA-treated K562 cells.","['Kujoth, G C', 'Fahl, W E']","['Kujoth GC', 'Fahl WE']","['McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA07175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*biosynthesis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis', 'Sequence Deletion', 'TATA Box/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/09/23 00:00,1997/09/23 00:01,['1997/09/23 00:00'],"['1997/09/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1997 Sep;8(9):963-77.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the last three decades, new findings arising from dissection of the genetic abnormalities at a molecular level have received the most attention, but there have also been important new observations arising from studies of the biologic behaviour of normal and leukemic stem cells and, more recently, from clinical investigations. In this review we first report the most important observations relevant to understanding the oncogenic potential of the BCR-ABL chimeric gene, and the behaviour and the relationships of normal and leukemic stem cells. From a clinical point of view, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only procedure able to cure CML. The main issues are: who can receive this procedure, and when and how it can be given. The situation is more complex in unrelated transplants. In patients without HLA compatible donors, many large trials in different countries have demonstrated that interferon alpha therapy is indicated and effective in the majority of patients. On the other hand, autologous stem cell transplantation is still an experimental procedure. These aspects will be analyzed in detail and, at the end, a therapeutic algorithm of a possible approach to the patients with untreated CML is provided. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCES: The method used for preparing this review was an informal consensus development. All the authors of the present review have been working in the field of chronic myeloid leukemia, and have contributed original papers in peer-reviewed journals. In addition, the material examined in the present review includes articles and abstracts published in journals covered by the Science Citation Index and Medline. STATE OF ART AND PERSPECTIVES: The oncogenic potential of BCR-ABL has been demonstrated in a number of in vitro and in vivo model systems. Current research efforts are focused on defining the mechanism by which BCR-ABL transforms primary hematopoietic cells. The fact that BCR-ABL contains tyrosine residues, an SH2 domain, an SH3 domain, and proline-rich sequences raises the possibility of multiple protein-protein interactions. Indeed, BCR-ABL is reported to bind and/or phosphorylate more than 20 proteins. The insights into the signal transduction pathways activated by BCR-ABL will hopefully provide a new basis for the treatment of CML patients. Clinical evidence of the existence of a transplantable CML stem cell population has recently been extended to xenogeneic recipients of transplanted CML cells and by retroviral marking to autograft recipients. The potential of using immunodeficient mice as recipients of CML stem cells to create an in vivo model of chronic phase CML should be invaluable for testing novel therapies designed to eliminate residual disease in the patient. Current therapeutic options include conventional chemotherapy, IFN-a and allogeneic stem cell transplantation as established procedures, and autografting as an experimental procedure. While IFN-a as a first line therapy does not seem to jeopardize further treatments, autografting, according to the Genoa approach or other procedures, i.e. Ph-positive cells collected at diagnosis without mobilization therapy, raises the question of an ideal sequential strategy in the management of CML patients. There seems to be a general agreement that a patient less than 50 years old, with an HLA identical sibling, should receive an allogeneic stem cell transplant.

Therefore the K562 cell line has been proposed as a very useful in vitro model system for determining the therapeutical potential of new differentiating compounds as well as for studying the molecular mechanism(s) that regulate changes in the expression of embryonic and fetal human globin genes. In this study we explored whether nucleoside triphosphates and related compounds are able to induce differentiation of K562 cells. METHODS: K562 cell differentiation was studied using the benzidine test; hemoglobins were characterized by cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis and mRNA accumulation was investigated by Northern blot analysis. RESULTS: The main conclusion of this paper is that guanine, guanosine and guanine ribonucleotides are effective inducers of K562 cell differentiation. Expression of both Hb Portland and Hb Gower 1 is increased in GTP-induced K562 cells. This increase is associated with greater gamma-globin mRNA accumulation. By contrast, ATP, CTP and UTP are not able to induce erythroid differentiation. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that guanine, guanosine and guanine ribonucleotides are inducers of erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. This is of some relevance since differentiating compounds have been proposed as antitumor agents. In addition, inducers of erythroid differentiation that stimulate gamma-globin synthesis might be considered in the experimental therapy of hematological diseases associated with a failure in the expression of adult beta-globin genes.","['Osti, F', 'Corradini, F G', 'Hanau, S', 'Matteuzzi, M', 'Gambari, R']","['Osti F', 'Corradini FG', 'Hanau S', 'Matteuzzi M', 'Gambari R']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Erythrocytes/*pathology', 'Guanine/*pharmacology', 'Guanine Nucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Guanosine/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/09/23 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1997 Jul-Aug;82(4):395-401.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After having long been considered poorly able to transfect myeloid cells, adenoviral vectors have recently been demonstrated to be capable of introducing foreign DNA into purified CD34+ cells from human bone marrow or cord blood. In the present study we evaluated the feasibility of adenoviral-mediated gene transfer in two human leukemic cell lines, both at baseline and after differentiation induction by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). METHODS: We used a recombinant adenovirus expressing beta-galactosidase (Ad-RSV-beta-gal) to transfect K562 and HL-60 cell lines. The effects of 10(-6)M ATRA were evaluated after 8 days of exposure. The efficacy of transfection was verified by X-gal staining. RESULTS: Ad-RSV-beta-gal was able to transfect both the HL-60 and, to a minor extent, the K562 cell lines. The addition of ATRA had no effect on transfection of K562 cells, while a lower percentage of beta-gal-positive cells was detected in HL-60, which underwent differentiation upon ATRA treatment. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that adenoviral-mediated gene transfer could be feasible in myeloid leukemia cell lines and that it is inhibited by ATRA in differentiation-sensitive cells. The latter effect merits further investigation in order to verify whether this represents an ATRA-related or a differentiation-related phenomenon.","['Tosi, P', 'Pellacani, A', 'Visani, G', 'Ottaviani, E', 'Tura, S']","['Tosi P', 'Pellacani A', 'Visani G', 'Ottaviani E', 'Tura S']","['Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology Seragnon, University of Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Keratolytic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['*Adenoviridae', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Keratolytic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/09/23 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1997 Jul-Aug;82(4):387-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The predominant mechanism underlying its toxic action is thought to be inhibition of thymidylate synthetase (TS), and hence thymidine triphosphate (dTTP) synthesis, resulting in alteration of the balance of deoxynucleotide (dNTP) pools and disruption of DNA synthesis. Indeed, previously we demonstrated retarded cell-cycle progression concurrent with a 60% decrease in TS activity in rat whole embryos following maternal exposure to 40 mg/kg 5-FU on Gestational Day 14 and in the murine erythroleukemic cell (MELC) suspension culture following exposure to 5-25 microM 5-FU for 2 hr. In the study described herein, we used high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to demonstrate in both of these model systems that 5-FU exposure results in similar patterns of dNTP perturbations: a prolonged decrease in dTTP and dGTP levels and an increase in dCTP and dATP. In addition, we used centrifugal elutriation to synchronize MELC in the phases of the cell cycle (G0/G1 and early S) most sensitive to 5-FU to investigate the ability of nucleoside supplementation to mitigate 5-FU-induced toxicity. Our data indicate that following a 2-hr exposure to 5-25 microM 5-FU, supplementation with 1-10 microM thymidine (TdR) for 24 hr partially reverses 5-FU-induced toxicity as evidenced by increased cellular proliferation and cell-cycle progression and amelioration of 5-FU-induced perturbations of protein synthesis and cellular membrane permeability compared to unsupplemented 5-FU-exposed cells. However, TdR concentrations >/=100 microM inhibited growth or were cytotoxic. In comparison, supplementation with 10 microM-10 mM of deoxycytidine (CdR) was not toxic, but effected a dose-dependent recovery from 5-FU-induced toxicity. At 1-100 microM, neither deoxyadenosine nor deoxyguanosine supplementation reduced 5-FU-induced toxicity; at higher concentrations, both purine nucleotides inhibited cell growth. Although these results support the hypothesis that 5-FU disrupts the MELC cell cycle by depleting dTTP (a perturbation that is reversible by TdR supplementation), they also indicate that CdR supplementation offers an additional recovery pathway.","['Elstein, K H', 'Mole, M L', 'Setzer, R W', 'Zucker, R M', 'Kavlock, R J', 'Rogers, J M', 'Lau, C']","['Elstein KH', 'Mole ML', 'Setzer RW', 'Zucker RM', 'Kavlock RJ', 'Rogers JM', 'Lau C']","['National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, USA. elstein.kenneth@epamail.epa.gov']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Deoxyguanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Thymine Nucleotides)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '8C2O37Y44Q (deoxyguanosine triphosphate)', ""QOP4K539MU (thymidine 5'-triphosphate)"", 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Deoxycytidine/*pharmacology', 'Deoxyguanine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorouracil/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Pregnancy', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Thymidine/*pharmacology', 'Thymine Nucleotides/metabolism']",1997/09/23 00:00,1997/09/23 00:01,['1997/09/23 00:00'],"['1997/09/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0041-008X(97)98208-9 [pii]', '10.1006/taap.1997.8208 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 1997 Sep;146(1):29-39. doi: 10.1006/taap.1997.8208.,,,,,,,['Copyright 1997 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,

Treatment of the human promyelocytic leukaemia cell line U937 with actinomycin D resulted in the activation of caspase-3 also known as CPP32. Protease activity was measured in cytosolic extracts by fluorometric analysis of the time-dependent cleavage of acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin (DEVD-AMC), a caspase-3 substrate. Caspase activity was inhibited by thiol modifying agents such as N-ethylmaleimide or iodoacetamide and NO donors such as S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), BF4NO, and spermine-NO. NO-mediated enzyme inhibition was fully reversible upon the addition of DTT (dithiothreitol). NO. itself was not primarily responsible for downregulation of caspase-3, as we found no correlation between rates of NO* release and the magnitude of enzyme inhibition. It is likely that S-nitrosation accounts for enzyme inhibition by various NO donors. SIN-1 and peroxynitrite were inhibitory as well. In this case, however, enzyme activity was not restored upon DTT addition, suggesting oxidation as an additional thiol modification mechanism.

Three RFLPs (TaqI, ApaI, BsmI) define two common haplotypes: BAt and baT. None of these polymorphisms change the translated protein. Since sequence variations in the 3' UTR of VDR have been linked to the different haplotypes, investigators have proposed that the stability of VDR mRNA is influenced by allelic variations. Indirect evidence suggested that allele T is less stable than allele t. In this study, we used a RT-PCR based approach to compare the stability of the big T and small t allele in normal heterozygous lymphocytes and the heterozygous cell lines NB4 (myeloid leukemia) and PC-3 and DU 145 (prostate cancers). In all three cases, we did not find a significant difference in stability. Interestingly, we consistently observed 30% less RT-PCR product derived from the small t allele mRNA in steady state, a finding which also speaks against a higher stability of the small t allele mRNA. These results indicate a variation in transcriptional regulation rather than mRNA stability between the alleles. We hypothesize that an unknown gene or genes in linkage with the polymorphisms is (are) responsible for the relationship between risk of prostate cancer and VDR polymorphisms.","['Verbeek, W', 'Gombart, A F', 'Shiohara, M', 'Campbell, M', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Verbeek W', 'Gombart AF', 'Shiohara M', 'Campbell M', 'Koeffler HP']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA 42710/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 43277/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 70675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Taq Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (endodeoxyribonuclease BsmI)', 'EC 3.1.21.4 (Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics', 'Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', '*Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/*genetics', 'Taq Polymerase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/09/23 00:00,1997/09/23 00:01,['1997/09/23 00:00'],"['1997/09/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(97)97239-9 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1997.7239 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1997 Sep 8;238(1):77-80. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1997.7239.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The apoptosis-inducing effect of Lfcin-B increased with reduction of serum concentration, but was inhibited by addition of Zn2+, a inhibitor of Ca2+/Mg(2+)-dependent endonucleases in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, Lfcin-B-induced apoptosis in THP-1 cells was completely abolished by addition of antioxidants such as N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and glutathione (GSH), but not by various cytokines and mitogen which can activate monocytic cells. In addition, THP-1 cells treated with Lfcin-B, but not LF-B, showed high levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the early period (20 min) of Lfcin-B treatment. And the production of ROS by Lfcin-B was dependent upon the dose of Lfcin-B added. These results suggested that Lfcin-B, a LF-B-derived peptide, but not LF-B itself, is able to induce apoptosis in THP-1 human monocytic tumor cells, and that its apoptosis-inducing activity is related to the pathway mediated by production of the intracellular ROS and activation of Ca2+/Mg(2+)-dependent endonucleases.","['Yoo, Y C', 'Watanabe, R', 'Koike, Y', 'Mitobe, M', 'Shimazaki, K', 'Watanabe, S', 'Azuma, I']","['Yoo YC', 'Watanabe R', 'Koike Y', 'Mitobe M', 'Shimazaki K', 'Watanabe S', 'Azuma I']","['Institute of Immunological Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '146897-68-9 (lactoferricin B)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cattle', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Diploidy', 'Female', 'Glutathione/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lactoferrin/*analogs & derivatives/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Milk/*chemistry', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/28 00:00,1997/09/23 00:01,['1997/08/28 00:00'],"['1997/08/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X97971990 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1997.7199 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1997 Aug 28;237(3):624-8. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1997.7199.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within minutes of induction, the STAT proteins are phosphorylated on tyrosine and serine residues and translocated to the nucleus, where they bind to their DNA targets. The leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) mediates pleiotropic and sometimes opposite effects both in vivo and in cultured cells. It is known, for example, to prevent differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells in vitro. To get insights into LIF-regulated signaling in ES cells, we have analyzed protein-binding and transcriptional properties of STAT recognition sites in ES cells cultivated in the presence and in the absence of LIF. We have detected a specific LIF-regulated DNA-binding activity implicating the STAT3 protein. We show that STAT3 phosphorylation is essential for this LIF-dependent DNA-binding activity. The possibility that ERK2 or a closely related protein kinase, whose activity is modulated in a LIF-dependent manner, contributes to this phosphorylation is discussed. Finally, we show that the multimerized STAT3-binding DNA element confers LIF responsiveness to a minimal thymidine kinase promoter. This, together with our observation that overexpression of STAT3 dominant-negative mutants abrogates this LIF responsiveness, clearly indicates that STAT3 is involved in LIF-regulated transcriptional events in ES cells. Finally, stable expression of such a dominant negative mutant of STAT3 induces morphological differentiation of ES cells despite continuous LIF supply.

There were 23 male and 18 female patients with a median follow-up of 66.5 months (3-431 months). Median age was 62 (range: 37-85). The median hemoglobin level at diagnosis was 18.8 g/dl. Four patients were treated by venesection alone, 20 patients received hydroxyurea and intermittent venesection, 3 were treated with radioactive phosphorus alone, and 14 had both hydroxyurea and radioactive phosphorus. During the course of illness, 14 patients (34%) developed a total of 19 thrombotic events. Of the thrombotic events, 16 were arterial and 3 were venous. Two patients had both arterial and venous thrombosis sequentially. The probability of thrombosis-free survival after treatment was 83% at 10 years and 73% at 20 years. One patient developed post-polycythemic myeloid metaplasia 24 months after diagnosis. Of 17 patients exposed to radioactive phosphorus, only 1 developed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 9 years afterwards. Of the 20 patients treated with hydroxyurea for a median duration of 63.5 months (2-130 months), there is no case of secondary malignancy. Overall survival was 83% at 10 years and 62% at 20 years. In conclusion, PV in Chinese is a relatively benign disease with a low risk of thrombosis as compared to Caucasian patients. Hydroxyurea has a very low risk of secondary leukemia and is a safe drug to use in Chinese patients with PV.","['Chim, C S', 'Kwong, Y L', 'Chan, P T', 'Liang, R']","['Chim CS', 'Kwong YL', 'Chan PT', 'Liang R']","['Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Asians', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polycythemia Vera/ethnology/*physiopathology']",1997/09/23 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/09/23 00:00'],"['1997/09/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/09/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199709)56:1<59::AID-AJH12>3.0.CO;2-Y [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199709)56:1<59::aid-ajh12>3.0.co;2-y [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1997 Sep;56(1):59-62. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199709)56:1<59::aid-ajh12>3.0.co;2-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While it has been shown previously that the information obtained from each component is generally complementary, the inclusion of some or all components may vary between institutions. The components studied included aspirate smears, clot sections, biopsy cores, and touch imprints of biopsy and clot sections. Three clinical presentations accounted for the majority of cases: staging for carcinoma or lymphoma, cytopenias, and acute leukemia. We conclude that bilateral aspirates with biopsies are required for diagnosis in staging of neoplasms and that a unilateral aspirate with biopsy is sufficient to assess patients with cytopenia or leukemia. Only rarely were touch imprints of biopsy cores necessary to establish a diagnosis; however, their early availability prior to examining sections of the clot and core did provide immediate information, when positive, in the staging of patients with carcinoma. In a small percentage of staging and leukemia cases the diagnosis rested with the clot section alone. The findings in this study address common assumptions associated with routine diagnostic hematology and oncology procedures, and are important to both clinicians and pathologists concerned with accuracy, quality assurance, turnaround time, and cost containment.","['Barekman, C L', 'Fair, K P', 'Cotelingam, J D']","['Barekman CL', 'Fair KP', 'Cotelingam JD']","['Section of Hematology, Brooke Army Medical Center, San Antonio, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Microtomy', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",1997/09/23 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/09/23 00:00'],"['1997/09/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/09/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199709)56:1<37::AID-AJH8>3.0.CO;2-3 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199709)56:1<37::aid-ajh8>3.0.co;2-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1997 Sep;56(1):37-41. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199709)56:1<37::aid-ajh8>3.0.co;2-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patient (87a; male) was admitted to hospital with increasing left upper eyelid protrusion. Computed tomography revealed an unspecific accumulation of soft tissue within the orbit. A biopsy was taken. Light microscopical sections were stained with PAS, Giemsa and haematoxylin-eosin. Immunohistochemistry was performed following standard procedures. RESULTS: By means of light microscopy, Hodgkin's disease of the diffuse, lymphocyte predominance type was indicated. This initial diagnosis was mainly based on morphological criteria, e.g. the presence of H-RS-like cells. Since staging work-up produced no evidence of systemic disease, immunohistochemistry was performed. It revealed that the misleading cells were H-RS simulating cells. Finally, the diagnosis made was that of immunocytoma (IgM-kappa); stage I EA. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease of the diffuse, lymphocyte predominance type is normally based on morphological criteria. However, in very rare cases immunocytomas simulate this variant of Hodgkin's disease by expressing misleading H-RS simulating cells. Thus, immunohistochemical investigations should generally be included in the criteria for the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease of the diffuse, lymphocyte predominance type. As far as we are aware, primary immunocytoma mimicking this variant of Hodgkin's disease within the orbit has never been reported.","['Radner, W', 'Pfoser, P', 'Sega, W', 'Steinmair, W']","['Radner W', 'Pfoser P', 'Sega W', 'Steinmair W']","['University Eye Clinic, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Int Ophthalmol,International ophthalmology,7904294,['0 (Immunoglobulin M)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Hodgkin Disease/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Male', 'Orbital Neoplasms/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Reed-Sternberg Cells/*pathology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Visual Acuity']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/09/23 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1005893320516 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Ophthalmol. 1997;21(1):5-7. doi: 10.1023/a:1005893320516.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed this pattern in the light of improvements in donor selection and post-transplant supportive care. METHODS: We reviewed transplant outcome in 103 consecutive patients with childhood leukaemia who underwent allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation with HLA-matched sibling marrow (n = 52) or matched unrelated donor marrow (n = 51) between May, 1990, and March, 1996, at St Jude Children's Research Hospital. FINDINGS: Analysis of engraftment, frequency of procedure-related complications, and disease-free survival revealed no advantage from use of matched-sibling marrow. The 2-year disease-free survival estimate for standard-risk recipients of matched-sibling marrow was 81 [8.1]% compared with 73 [12.1]% in the unrelated donor marrow group (p = 0.77). In the high-risk category, patients with a matched-sibling donor had a 2-year disease-free survival of 31 [11.6]%, compared with 32 [15.1]% among recipients of matched unrelated donor marrow (p = 0.87). INTERPRETATION: We believe this improved result with unrelated donor marrow is a consequence of recent innovations in histocompatibility matching, prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), and antiviral prophylaxis. We suggest that such grafts can now be used in patients at both standard and high risk without compromising treatment outcome.","['Hongeng, S', 'Krance, R A', 'Bowman, L C', 'Srivastava, D K', 'Cunningham, J M', 'Horwitz, E M', 'Brenner, M K', 'Heslop, H E']","['Hongeng S', 'Krance RA', 'Bowman LC', 'Srivastava DK', 'Cunningham JM', 'Horwitz EM', 'Brenner MK', 'Heslop HE']","[""Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.""]",['eng'],"['CA 61384/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P 30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', '*Living Donors', 'Male', 'Postoperative Complications/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Virus Diseases/epidemiology']",1997/09/23 00:00,1997/09/23 00:01,['1997/09/23 00:00'],"['1997/09/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0140-6736(97)03098-5 [pii]', '10.1016/S0140-6736(97)03098-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1997 Sep 13;350(9080):767-71. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(97)03098-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The usefulness of neurophysiological investigations (e.g. EEG, evoked potentials (EP)) as part of these attempts is controversial. The present report focuses on this problem and the question whether and to what extent routinely performed EEG recordings and visual evoked potentials (VEP) were correlated with further measures of CNS integrity. EEGs and VEPs were recorded in 163 asymptomatic long-term survivors of ALL in childhood during a large retrospective multicentre study evaluating CNS late sequelae following antileukaemic therapy. Fifty-two ALL long-term survivors (4.5-10.6 years after end of therapy, median: 8.8 years), who had been treated according to BFM-81 SR-A (n = 30) or SR-B (n = 22) were selected for this analysis focusing on therapy-related CNS late effects. Therapy protocols differed with regard to the mode for CNS prophylaxis: SR-A, cranial irradiation with intrathecal methotrexate; SR-B, intrathecal and iv methotrexate. Neurophysiological findings were correlated with illness- and treatment-related parameters, as well as with data on the morphological, neurological and psychological status of the CNS. At the time of follow-up neurophysiological measures were abnormal in 28/52 cases (53.8%). Neither illness- nor therapy-specific differences in CNS prophylaxis showed any relationship to EEG/VEP outcome any relationship to EEG/VEP outcome in this reduced group of the whole study population. Children with EEG/VEP abnormalities showed a significantly higher incidence of structural CNS disturbances compared to those with inconspicuous neurophysiological recordings (60.9% vs 31.8%). However, in this special subject group there was no specific neurophysiological finding for a specific morphological substrate, neurological or psychological deficiency and vice versa. CONCLUSION: Routinely performed EEG/VEP investigations are not very helpful measures to predict the presence or degree of behavioural deficiencies, neurological disturbances, or morphological CNS abnormalities. Patients who received cranial irradiation or systemic methotrexate applications showed the same incidence of neurophysiological disturbances without evidence for specific neurotoxic correlates.","['Ueberall, M A', 'Skirl, G', 'Strassburg, H M', 'Wenzel, D', 'Hertzberg, H', 'Langer, T', 'Meier, W', 'Berger-Jones, K', 'Huk, W J', 'Korinthenberg, R', 'Beck, J D']","['Ueberall MA', 'Skirl G', 'Strassburg HM', 'Wenzel D', 'Hertzberg H', 'Langer T', 'Meier W', 'Berger-Jones K', 'Huk WJ', 'Korinthenberg R', 'Beck JD']","['Neuropaediatric Department, University Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cerebral Cortex/*drug effects/physiopathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Electroencephalography/*drug effects', 'Evoked Potentials, Visual/drug effects/physiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Reaction Time/drug effects/physiology', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1997/09/20 00:00,1997/09/20 00:01,['1997/09/20 00:00'],"['1997/09/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/20 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004310050700 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 1997 Sep;156(9):727-33. doi: 10.1007/s004310050700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Symptomatic radiation therapy can be delivered, but the best irradiation scheme is still unknown. Results of splenic irradiation in patients with myelofibrosis or chronic leukemia were retrospectively analyzed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: There were 24 patients: 15 presented with MF and 9 with CML. Median irradiation doses were 9.8 and 7.7 Gy, respectively. The hematologic toxicity was moderate (except for platelets in the acute phase of the disease). RESULTS: No toxicity was observed. Various factors predictive of the response to radiation therapy are described. While high (around 14 Gy) radiation therapy dose appears necessary for MF and should be started before the increase in transfusion need, huge splenomegalies should be excluded in regard to CML. As for other cases, the optimal dose is still unclear, but should probably be high enough, ie, around 10 Gy. CONCLUSION: To further study and better understand biological mechanisms underlying response to radiotherapy in patients with MF, prospective radio-chemotherapy phase II trials should be conducted in both CML and MF patients.","['Gonzague-Casabianca, L', 'Bouabdallah, R', 'Cowen, D', 'Alzieu, C', 'Richaud, P', 'Resbeut, M']","['Gonzague-Casabianca L', 'Bouabdallah R', 'Cowen D', 'Alzieu C', 'Richaud P', 'Resbeut M']","['Departement de radiotherapie, institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.']",['fre'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Cancer Radiother,Cancer radiotherapie : journal de la Societe francaise de radiotherapie oncologique,9711272,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/etiology', 'Pain/etiology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/complications/*radiotherapy', 'Radiation Injuries/prevention & control', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spleen/*radiation effects', 'Splenomegaly/etiology/radiotherapy', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/09/20 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/20 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1278321897897673 [pii]', '10.1016/s1278-3218(97)89767-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Radiother. 1997;1(3):213-21. doi: 10.1016/s1278-3218(97)89767-3.,,,,,,,,,Irradiation splenique dans les hemopathies myeloides: evaluation et toxicite.,,,,,,

Furthermore, hLIF binds with much higher affinity to the mouse LIFR (mLIFR) alpha-chain than does mLIF itself. To define the structural elements of the mLIFR alpha-chain conferring high affinity binding of hLIF and the species-specific interaction with mLIF, we first constructed C-terminally truncated extracellular domains of both the mLIFR and the human LIFR (hLIFR) alpha-chains, which contained only the two hemopoietin domains separated by an immunoglobulin-like domain. These recombinant truncated LIFR alpha-chains had identical binding and biological characteristics to either their naturally occurring or transfected counterparts. On the basis of this, we have generated eight interspecies receptor chimeras by combining different regions of the mouse and human LIFR sequence. Surprisingly, the immunoglobulin-like domain of the mLIFR alpha-chain played the predominant role in receptor-ligand interactions. Moreover, both high affinity binding for hLIF and the species-specific binding for mLIF mapped to the same domain of mLIFR molecule. These findings should enable the development of a ""humanized"" mouse LIFR that could act as a potent antagonist of hLIF biological activities in vivo.","['Owczarek, C M', 'Zhang, Y', 'Layton, M J', 'Metcalf, D', 'Roberts, B', 'Nicola, N A']","['Owczarek CM', 'Zhang Y', 'Layton MJ', 'Metcalf D', 'Roberts B', 'Nicola NA']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and the Cooperative Research Centre for Cellular Growth Factors, P.O.

C., Small, G. W., Pauig, S. B., and Daniel, L. W. (1994) J. Biol. Chem 269, 15493-15497). ara-C also causes apoptosis in HL-60 cells which can be mimicked by exogenous ceramide. However, the signaling role for ara-C-induced diacylglycerol (DAG) is not defined. We found that Bcl-2 levels were increased by treatment of HL-60 cells with exogenous DAG or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). In contrast, exogenous ceramide treatment caused a decrease in cellular Bcl-2 levels. Thus, ara-C stimulates the synthesis of two second messengers with opposing effects on Bcl-2. Since the effects of ara-C-induced DAG could be due to protein kinase C (PKC) activation, we determined the effects of ara-C on PKC isozymes. ara-C caused an increase in membrane-bound PKCbetaII (but not PKCalpha or PKCdelta). ara-C or TPA-induced translocation of PKCbetaII was inhibited by 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine (ET-18-OCH3), and ara-C-induced apoptosis was stimulated by pretreatment of the cells with ET-18-OCH3. ET-18-OCH3 also inhibited stimulation of Bcl-2 by TPA and enhanced the decrease in Bcl-2 observed in ara-C-treated cells. These data indicate that ara-C-induced apoptosis is limited by ara-C-stimulated PKCbetaII through effects on Bcl-2. To further determine the role of PKC, we used antisense oligonucleotides directed toward PKCbetaII. The antisense, but not the sense, oligonucleotide inhibited PKCbetaII activation and enhanced ara-C-induced apoptosis. These data demonstrate that the stimulation of apoptosis by ara-C is self-limiting and can be enhanced by inhibition of PKC.","['Whitman, S P', 'Civoli, F', 'Daniel, L W']","['Whitman SP', 'Civoli F', 'Daniel LW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27157-1016, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA43297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA48995/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA67717/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Biological Transport', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', '*Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Phospholipid Ethers/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C beta', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1997/09/20 00:00,1997/09/20 00:01,['1997/09/20 00:00'],"['1997/09/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/20 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.38.23481 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)65813-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Sep 19;272(38):23481-4. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.38.23481.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have introduced B7-1 (CD80) into M1 cells, spontaneously occurring mouse myelocytic leukemic cells, and assessed its potential to induce antitumor immunity to leukemia cells. Syngeneic, immunocompetent SL mice receiving two independent B7-1-transduced monoclonal sublines, M1-B7-1/F/clone F20 and M1-B7-1/F/clone F7, were rejected in 57% and 43% of SL mice, respectively. In vivo depletion of T cell subsets showed that both CD4+ and CD8 T cells were indispensable for the B7-1-dependent anti-leukemic immunity. Although a single exposure of irradiated monoclonal M1-B7/1/F cells was not fully effective, multiple exposures induced protective immunity against subsequent challenge with parental M1 cells. Furthermore, multiple vaccinations with irradiated monoclonal M1-B7-1/F/clone F7 cells could cure 67% of mice previously injected with a lethal number of M1 cells. These results emphasize that multiple exposures of irradiated B7-1-transduced myeloid leukemic cells can induce protective and therapeutic immunity against leukemia and that B7-1-mediated gene therapy may have therapeutic efficacy for patients with acute myelocytic leukemia.","['Hirano, N', 'Takahashi, T', 'Takahashi, T', 'Azuma, M', 'Okumura, K', 'Yazaki, Y', 'Yagita, H', 'Hirai, H']","['Hirano N', 'Takahashi T', 'Takahashi T', 'Azuma M', 'Okumura K', 'Yazaki Y', 'Yagita H', 'Hirai H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,['0 (B7-1 Antigen)'],IM,"['Animals', 'B7-1 Antigen/genetics/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'COS Cells', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Survival Analysis']",1997/07/20 00:00,1997/09/19 00:01,['1997/07/20 00:00'],"['1997/07/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/19 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1997.8.11-1375 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1997 Jul 20;8(11):1375-84. doi: 10.1089/hum.1997.8.11-1375.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-12 gene therapy was much more effective than treatment with any other tested cytokine gene for induction of tumor regression. Strong activation of antitumor immunity in response to IL-12 gene therapy was evidenced by an augmented CD8+ T cell-mediated cytolytic activity in the draining lymph nodes of tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, following the IL-12 gene therapy protocol, test mice were able to eradicate not only the treated but also the untreated solid tumors at distant sites. This systemic antitumor effect of IL-12 gene therapy was not associated with visible signs of toxicity or significantly elevated systemic levels of IFN-gamma. These results show that gene gun-mediated in vivo delivery of IL-12 cDNA clearly distinguishes itself from the other cytokine gene therapy approaches tested in parallel, suggesting that this delivery system may be employed as an efficient model for comparative studies of in vivo cytokine gene therapy.

The induction in vitro of leukemia-specific T cells reactive with p210(bcr-abl) is a strategy developed for an immunological therapeutic approach in CML. Peptides from the junction region of this chimeric protein have been considered as potential targets for a cytotoxic response against leukemic cells. However, only a few peptides encompassing the two p210(bcr-abl) breakpoints have been shown to bind to the most common HLA class I molecules, which limits the number of patients who could benefit from this approach. We assume that the presence of chimeric BCR-ABL protein in leukemic cells may affect processing and delivery of peptides, possibly giving rise to new epitopes at the cell surface. We selected 162 peptides from the whole sequence of this protein, including 14 peptides of the b2a2 and b3a2 junctions, which had an anchor motif for a common HLA class I molecule. We tested their ability to bind to eight HLA class I molecules (HLA-A1, -A2, -A3, -A11, -B7, -B8, -B27, -B44). We identified 48 peptides from outside the junction region, with intermediate or strong binding capacities to these HLA class I molecules contrasting with only six junction peptides with a moderate binding capacity to HLA-A3/A11, -B8, or -B44 molecules. Moreover, cytotoxic T lymphocyte lines specific for various peptides outside the junction were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HLA-A2 or -B7 healthy donors and from one CML patient. These results contribute to evaluation of immunity to the BCR-ABL chimeric protein. Further studies are required to investigate whether such epitopes are correctly processed and presented by leukemic cells.","['Buzyn, A', 'Ostankovitch, M', 'Zerbib, A', 'Kemula, M', 'Connan, F', 'Varet, B', 'Guillet, J G', 'Choppin, J']","['Buzyn A', 'Ostankovitch M', 'Zerbib A', 'Kemula M', 'Connan F', 'Varet B', 'Guillet JG', 'Choppin J']","['INSERM U445, Institut Cochin de Genetique Moleculaire, Universite Rene Descartes, Paris, France. buzyn@icgm.cochin.inserm.fr']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B7 Antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*metabolism', 'HLA-B7 Antigen/metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/immunology', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics/immunology', 'Protein Binding', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/09/19 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/19 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830270834 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1997 Aug;27(8):2066-72. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830270834.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the molecular mechanisms of Fc epsilonRI- and Thy-1-mediated transmembrane signaling and to map a step at which they converge into a common secretory pathway, we used a novel Src family-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, 4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP1), and analyzed its inhibitory activity on cell activation. Here we show that in RBL-2H3 cells PP1 demonstrates substrate specificity for a Src family kinase Lyn. In immunocomplex kinase assays in vitro, PP1 inhibited the Lyn kinase activity at nanomolar levels without any effect on Syk kinase activity. However, in RBL cells activated via aggregation of Fc epsilonRI, phosphorylation of both Syk and Lyn kinases was inhibited. Fc epsilonRI- and Thy-1-mediated early (protein-tyrosine phosphorylation) and late (release of beta-hexosaminidase) activation events were similarly affected by PP1. The inhibition was specific for membrane receptor-mediated signaling and was not observed in cells activated by an exposure to pervanadate. The combined data suggest that activation of Lyn is the early activation step at which the Fc epsilonRI- and Thy-1-mediated activation pathways of mast cells and basophils may converge.","['Amoui, M', 'Draber, P', 'Draberova, L']","['Amoui M', 'Draber P', 'Draberova L']","['Department of Mammalian Gene Expression, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(tert-butyl)pyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidine)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/*drug effects/enzymology/*immunology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/enzymology/immunology', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/enzymology/immunology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/metabolism', 'Thy-1 Antigens/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'src-Family Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/09/19 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/19 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830270810 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1997 Aug;27(8):1881-6. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830270810.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The understanding of its involvement in the biology of these cytokines is of importance since these systems have recently been shown to participate in major inflammatory and neoplastic processes such as myelomatosis (Rose-John, S., Heinrich, P.C., 1994. Soluble receptors for cytokines and growth factors: generation and biological function. Biochem. J. 300, 281). In addition, this family of receptors also shares the gp130 transducing chain, with the IL6 and IL11 receptors. Because IL6 and gp130 were the first members to be discovered, most of the available reagents are directed at them. In this respect, monoclonal antibodies have played a major role in elucidating these receptor/ligand interactions and exploring the pathophysiological aspects of their biology. So far, no such reagents have been described for the gp190. We now report the production and characterization of 16 monoclonal antibodies directed against human gp190.

LIF also plays a role in the response to injury of the peripheral nervous system, as indicated by an increase in the amount of its mRNA within nonneuronal injury response in LIF knock-out mice. To determine if LIF is regulated after injury to the central nervous system, we surgically lesioned the cortex in adult rat brain. Using a quantitative RNAse protection assay, we find that LIF mRNA increases 30-fold following injury. The amount of this transcript goes up within 6 h after injury, reaches a peak at 24 h and returns to baseline by 7 days postlesion. In situ hybridization analysis reveals LIF transcript-containing cells scattered throughout the ipsilateral cortex close, but not immediately adjacent to the lesion site. Double-labeling with a variety of antibodies reveals that LIF mRNA is induced in GFAP-positive astrocytes as well as in a small number of microglial cells. The striking induction of LIF transcripts in glia suggests that this cytokine may play a key injury-response role in the CNS as it does in the PNS, where LIF has been demonstrated to regulate neuropeptide expression both in vivo and in vitro.","['Banner, L R', 'Moayeri, N N', 'Patterson, P H']","['Banner LR', 'Moayeri NN', 'Patterson PH']","['Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena 92115, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Neurol,Experimental neurology,0370712,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/*metabolism', 'Brain Injuries/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cerebral Cortex/injuries/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Functional Laterality', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'In Situ Hybridization', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Microglia/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",1997/09/19 00:00,1997/09/19 00:01,['1997/09/19 00:00'],"['1997/09/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/19 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4886(97)96536-5 [pii]', '10.1006/exnr.1997.6536 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Neurol. 1997 Sep;147(1):1-9. doi: 10.1006/exnr.1997.6536.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PML/RARalpha and PLZF/RARalpha localize to the same microspeckled nuclear domains that appear to be common targets for the two fusion proteins in APL. Although PLZF/RARalpha does not affect the localization of PML, PML/RARalpha delocalizes the endogenous PLZF protein in t(15;17)-positive NB4 cells, pointing to a hierarchy in the nuclear targeting of these proteins.

Nuclear extracts from HL-60 and HL-60R cells were subjected to an identical, rapid purification protocol that efficiently captures heterodimeric hMutSalpha (hMSH2. hMSH6) and hMutSbeta (hMSH2.hMSH3). In HL-60 extracts the hMutSalpha to hMutSbeta ratio is roughly 6:1, whereas in methotrexate-resistant HL-60R cells the ratio is less than 1:100, due to overproduction of hMSH3 and heterodimer formation of this protein with virtually all the nuclear hMSH2. This shift is associated with marked reduction in the efficiency of base-base mismatch and hypermutability at the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) locus. Purified hMutSalpha and hMutSbeta display partial overlap in mismatch repair specificity: both participate in repair of a dinucleotide insertion-deletion heterology, but only hMutSalpha restores base-base mismatch repair to extracts of HL-60R cells or hMSH2-deficient LoVo colorectal tumor cells.","['Drummond, J T', 'Genschel, J', 'Wolf, E', 'Modrich, P']","['Drummond JT', 'Genschel J', 'Wolf E', 'Modrich P']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM045190/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM45190/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Heteroduplexes)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['DNA Repair/*genetics', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial/genetics', 'Fungal Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Amplification', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Mutation', '*Nucleic Acid Heteroduplexes', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*genetics']",1997/09/18 00:00,1997/09/18 00:01,['1997/09/18 00:00'],"['1997/09/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.94.19.10144 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Sep 16;94(19):10144-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.94.19.10144.,,PMC23329,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have demonstrated that enhancer-dependent activation of the globin promoters is dependent on the presence of both a TATA box in the proximal promoter and the binding site for the erythroid-specific heteromeric transcription factor NF-E2 in the enhancer. Mutational analysis of the transcriptionally active component of NF-E2, p45NF-E2, localizes the critical region for this function to a proline-rich transcriptional activation domain in the NH2-terminal 80 amino acids of the protein. In contrast to the wild-type protein, expression of p45 NF-E2 lacking this activation domain in an NF-E2 null cell line fails to support enhancer-dependent transcription in transient assays. More significantly, the mutated protein also fails to reactivate expression of the endogenous beta- or alpha-globin loci in this cell line. Protein-protein interaction studies reveal that this domain of p45 NF-E2 binds specifically to a component of the transcription initiation complex, TATA binding protein associated factor TAFII130.

For these experiments, a large number of human cell lines growing in SCID mice are a prerequisite. We describe a new Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive B cell line, designated BEVA, with a complex karyotype including translocations t(14:18)(q32;q21) and t(4;11) (q21;q23) that meets this need. As demonstrated by Southern blot analysis, BCL2 at 18q21, but not MLL/ALL1 at 11q23, was involved in these translocations. BEVA cells coexpressed lymphoid (IgG-kappa, CD19, CD20, CD21, and CD24) and myeloid (CD11b, CD15, and CDw65) markers. Interestingly, the cell line was established from the bone marrow culture of a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Examination of bone marrow biopsy specimens suggested the presence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in this patient in addition to AML. In vitro and in vivo growth characteristics of the BEVA cell line were compared with the previously described EBV-positive B cell line DoHH2, also carrying a translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21). These DoHH2 cells additionally expressed CD10, whereas, in contrast to BEVA cells, only a small population of DoHH2 cells showed expression of CD44. Both cell lines showed similar growth characteristics in vitro, but reacted differently to cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, IL-7, and alpha-interferon (IFN). Upon inoculation in SCID mice, marked differences were observed in the dissemination patterns of the BEVA or DoHH2 cells. Although both cell lines circulated in the blood and were predominantly found in murine bone marrow and lymphoid tissues, DoHH2 cells infiltrated the murine spleens, whereas BEVA cells could only rarely be detected in these tissues. In contrast to DoHH2 cells, BEVA cells gave rise to tumor masses in liver, kidney, and para-aortal or mesenteric lymph nodes. The relationship between these in vitro differences and the observed differences in dissemination of both cell lines is discussed.","['de Kroon, J F', 'Kluin-Nelemans, H C', 'Kluin, P M', 'Schuuring, E', 'van Bergen, C A', 'Oving, I', 'Wessels, H', 'Willemze, R', 'Falkenburg, J H']","['de Kroon JF', 'Kluin-Nelemans HC', 'Kluin PM', 'Schuuring E', 'van Bergen CA', 'Oving I', 'Wessels H', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics/pathology', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/09/18 00:00,1997/09/18 00:01,['1997/09/18 00:00'],"['1997/09/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/18 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1997 Sep;25(10):1062-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we found that CD34 downregulation during hematopoiesis occured at the level of transcriptional initiation. Two transcription initiation sites (TISs) were identified in each of three different CD34+ cell lines; these TISs were located at 120 and 80 bp 5' of the translation start site, respectively. The promoter lacks TATA elements and, like other TATA-less promoters, the TISs conform to the consensus sequence for an INR (PyPyCAPyPyPyPy). An additional 3000 bp of upstream genomic DNA were sequenced and found to contain consensus sites for transcription factors, suggesting their potential role in gene regulation. Transient transfection assays using CD34 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs, containing sequences up to 3 kb upstream and inclusive of the TIS, indicate that this promoter drives transcription in hematopoietic CD34+ cells but not CD34+ nonhematopoietic cells. Both cell type specific expression and full promoter activity are maintained in constructs that contain as little as 454 bp upstream of the TISs. Optimal promoter activity requires the 5' untranslated region of exon 1, which contains a 51-bp element that has the potential to form an extensive secondary structure. In the plasmid DNA, however, this secondary structure was not detectable by P1 nuclease digestion. At least three proteins present in uninduced M1 nuclear extracts bind to this element. Two of the three proteins were identified as Sp 1 and Sp 3 based on supershift experiments. These data suggest that CD34 expression by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells involves hematopoietic cell-specific factors that interact with regulatory elements within the first 230 bp of the promoter and that optimal expression requires a 60-bp segment of the 5' untranslated region.","['Krause, D S', 'Kapadia, S U', 'Raj, N B', 'May, W S']","['Krause DS', 'Kapadia SU', 'Raj NB', 'May WS']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['CA58492/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1997/09/18 00:00,1997/09/18 00:01,['1997/09/18 00:00'],"['1997/09/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/18 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1997 Sep;25(10):1051-61.,,,['GENBANK/U49383'],,,,,,,,,,,,

After incubation without HGF, apoptosis was noted in all but two patients. HGFs prevented, did not affect, or enhanced apoptosis in 39 (60%), 14 (22%), or 12 (18%) of 65 suspension cultures, respectively. HGFs that prevented apoptosis also stimulated and/or synergized blast colony formation in 35 of 39 corresponding methylcellulose cultures. HGFs that alone stimulated colony formation also prevented apoptosis in all but two of 28 corresponding suspension cultures. In contrast, HGFs that did not prevent apoptosis also failed to stimulate growth in 17 of 26 corresponding methylcellulose cultures. HGFs that enhanced apoptosis alone never stimulated colony formation. After incubation, we noted enhanced c-fos and cjun genes as well as induction of p21 protein. An appropriate dose of HGF elevated c-fos, reduced c-jun and p21, induced G1/S transition, and inhibited apoptosis. In two patients, apoptosis was not induced after incubation. Cells not treated with HGF expressed no c-fos, c-jun, or c-myc, and remained in G0/G1. Taken together, our results support the conclusion that not only c-fos, cjun, and c-myc, but also p53 and p21 are required for blast apoptosis. HGF differentially prevents apoptosis and induces mitosis, and both events seem to be integral to the self-renewal of AML clonogenic cells.","['Murohashi, I', 'Yoshida, K', 'Handa, A', 'Murayoshi, M', 'Yoshida, S', 'Jinnai, I', 'Bessho, M', 'Hirashima, K']","['Murohashi I', 'Yoshida K', 'Handa A', 'Murayoshi M', 'Yoshida S', 'Jinnai I', 'Bessho M', 'Hirashima K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Saitama Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",1997/09/18 00:00,1997/09/18 00:01,['1997/09/18 00:00'],"['1997/09/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/18 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1997 Sep;25(10):1042-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The response of bone marrow (BM) adherent cells to the same treatment was similar to that of MS-5 cells. The detached cells were unable to proliferate further, and genomic DNA of these cells showed fragmentation, suggesting that hematopoietic stromal cells died of apoptosis. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that STIL-3 C5 cells, but not STIL-3 DF cells expressed perforin, granzyme A & B, and Fas ligand. Fas was expressed in MS-5, BM adherent cells, MS-K and NIH/3T3 cells, which do not support hematopoiesis. These data suggest that the aforementioned factors mediate induction of apoptosis in MS-5 cells induced by direct cell-to-cell interaction with STIL-3 C5. This may explain the mechanism responsible for the destruction of the hematopoietic microenvironment by cytotoxic T cells in L8313 leukemia, from which STIL-3 cells are derived; it also suggests that destruction of hematopoietic tissue may be caused by leukemic cytotoxic T cells in some cases of leukemia.","['Takashita, E', 'Sugimoto, K', 'Adachi, Y', 'Aihara, Y', 'Inoue, H', 'Jiang, H', 'Katakai, T', 'Mori, K J']","['Takashita E', 'Sugimoto K', 'Adachi Y', 'Aihara Y', 'Inoue H', 'Jiang H', 'Katakai T', 'Mori KJ']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Science, Niigata University, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Gzmb protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Granzymes', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Serine Endopeptidases/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics', 'fas Receptor/genetics']",1997/09/18 00:00,1997/09/18 00:01,['1997/09/18 00:00'],"['1997/09/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/18 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1997 Sep;25(10):1034-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conversely, the percentages of CD3+ HLA x DR+, CD4+ and CD4+ CD45RO+ lymphocytes were higher in high BLC patients than in low BLC patients. The CD4/CD8 ratio was decreased in low BLC patients while it was increased in high BLC patients and a significant positive correlation was found between their CD4/CD8 ratio and their BLC.

Among the 64 patients who achieved a good response to initial therapy and who have entered the second part of the trial, there has been a rate of prolongation of remission in favour of maintenance alpha-IFN (p=0.02). FLU therapy is an effective drug inducing remission in pretreated B-CLL and LH-NHL patients. However, as with other therapeutic modalities, remission is rarely maintained beyond 2 yr. So far, maintenance alpha-IFN has not been shown to produce significantly longer remission after treatment with FLU in LG-NHL, and there is no trend towards prolonged remission in B-CLL patients. The role of FLU needs to be further evaluated in the management of lymphoproliferative disorders by introducing it in combination with other drugs (alpha-IFN) in the induction phase and in maintenance treatment.","['Zinzani, P L', 'Bendandi, M', 'Magagnoli, M', 'Rondelli, D', 'de Vivo, A', 'Benni, M', 'Zamagni, E', 'Cavo, M', 'Tura, S']","['Zinzani PL', 'Bendandi M', 'Magagnoli M', 'Rondelli D', 'de Vivo A', 'Benni M', 'Zamagni E', 'Cavo M', 'Tura S']","['Institute of Hematology and Oncology Seragnoli, University of Bologna,Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/09/18 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1997.tb00730.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1997 Aug;59(2):82-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1997.tb00730.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reactivity of YU-311 in normal organs, various non-hematopoietic tumors and in mast cell tumors in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens was examined using immunohistochemical methods. In normal organs, YU-311 reacted with fundic glands of the stomach, the intercalated duct of the pancreas, the distal portion and the loop of Henle of renal tubules and tissue mast cells. Benign neoplasms of various organs showed no immunoreaction with YU-311, except for mast cell tumors. Some types of malignant neoplasms were occasionally positive against YU-311, suggesting neoplasms arising from or differentiating along normal YU-311-positive counterparts. Some other types of malignancies were rarely positive for YU-311, although their normal counterparts showed no immunoreactivity with YU-311. None of the non-epithelial tumors reacted with YU-311, except for one case of malignant melanoma. In contrast, normal tissue mast cells and their related tumors, such as urticaria pigmentosa or solitary mastocytoma, were constantly positive for YU-311. None of the non-hematopoietic human tumor cell lines examined in the present study was reactive with YU-311. These findings indicate that YU-311 is a good marker of some types of tumors and mast cell tumors and that an aberrant expression of YU-311 rarely occurs.","['Fukuda, T', 'Kamishima, T', 'Kakihara, T', 'Yamada, T', 'Matsumoto, K', 'Uchiyama, M', 'Suzuki, T']","['Fukuda T', 'Kamishima T', 'Kakihara T', 'Yamada T', 'Matsumoto K', 'Uchiyama M', 'Suzuki T']","['Second Department of Pathology, Fukushima Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adenoma/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma/*immunology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/*immunology', 'Paraffin Embedding']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/09/18 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1827.1997.tb04533.x [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Int. 1997 Aug;47(8):512-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.1997.tb04533.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Novikoff hepatoma and human leukaemia cells, inactivation of RR by p-alkoxyphenols was monitored by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of the catalytically essential tyrosyl radical in the subunit R2 of RR. A significant inhibition of cellular growth of Novikoff hepatoma cells, human leukaemia cells and two human melanoma cell lines (MeWo and M5) by p-alkoxyphenols was also observed by growth inhibition assays. Inactivation of RR in whole tumour cells as well as inhibition of cellular growth of tumour cell lines by p-alkoxyphenols both show an increase in inhibition with increasing length of the alkyl side chain; the most effective inhibitors are p-isobutoxyphenol, p-butoxyphenol and p-propoxyphenol. The enzyme RR, and in particular the catalytically essential tyrosyl radical in the active site, is recognized as an important cellular target for growth inhibition of Novikoff hepatoma cells, human leukaemia cells and melanoma cells by p-alkoxyphenols.

Single-center analysis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's-lymphoma treated within 1984-1993.,235-42,"BACKGROUND: The administration of intensive, risk-adapted multiagent chemotherapy has markedly improved the event-free survival in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Current treatment protocols may achieve complete remission rates of more than 95% and event-free survival rates of approximately 70% in non-B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia/non-B-Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients. Due to a higher proliferation rate and aggressiveness of B-cells treatment of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia/B-Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma must be more intensive, but can be shorter to attain similar event-free survival rates. METHODS: Between 1984 and 1993 79 primarily admitted patients up to 18 years of age (range 0.6-17.9 years) received therapy according to the treatment protocols ALL A 84, ALL 86, NHL 86, ALL 90 and NHL 90 of the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Study Group. Intensive phases of treatment were given on an inpatient basis with maximum supportive care in order to achieve the prescribed doses. RESULTS: Median follow-up time from diagnosis is now 8 years (range 40 to 157 months) with a probability of event-free survival of 92% for the entire group. CONCLUSION: Multiagent chemotherapy tailored to the individual risk profile of each patient but given in the prescribed dose is currently the mainstay to achieve high complete remission rates with the aim to cure most acute lymphoblastic leukemia/Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients. The administration of intensive supportive care is important for the achievement of complete drug dosage and for the reduction of therapy-related toxicity.","['Urban, C', 'Benesch, M', 'Lackner, H', 'Schwinger, W', 'Kerbl, R', 'Gadner, H']","['Urban C', 'Benesch M', 'Lackner H', 'Schwinger W', 'Kerbl R', 'Gadner H']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Graz, Austria.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', '*Palliative Care', '*Patient Compliance', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/09/18 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1043956 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1997 Jul-Aug;209(4):235-42. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1043956.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High risk and relapsed leukemias engraft very well in these mice, however, good prognosis pediatric ALL often grow poorly if at all. Recently a new, even more immune-deficient mouse strain has been bred by crossing the scid mutation onto the NOD mouse background. As these NOD-SCID mice have been shown to be better recipients for human myeloid cells the goal of this study was to test these mice as hosts for human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bone marrow or peripheral blood cells from/pediatric and one adult patient with B-cell precursor ALL were transplanted onto immune-deficient NOD-SCID mice according to established protocols. MAIN RESULTS: ALL cells from 6 out of the 8 patients (75%) successfully engrafted the NOD-SCID mice and from 4 patients (50%) led to an extensive leukemic infiltration in the murine marrow (> 10%). High level human cell engraftment could be demonstrated by flow cytometry, Southern blot analysis and cytology. By cytology and immunophenotype the leukemia in the mice was indistinguishable from the original leukemia in the patients. The presence of few human eosinophils in the marrow of highly engrafted mice indicates minimal coengraftment of residual normal cells. Development of overt leukemia in the mice after transplantation of cells from different patients varied between 1.5 and 7 months. Interestingly and in contrast to myeloid cells, conditioning of the mice by sublethal irradiation was not necessary for successful engraftment. Limiting dilution experiments with leukemic blasts from one patient showed that as few as 10000 cells were sufficient to transfer the leukemia onto NOD-SCID mice. CONCLUSIONS: NOD-SCID mice are sensitive recipients for human ALL xenografts.","['Baersch, G', 'Mollers, T', 'Hotte, A', 'Dockhorn-Dworniczak, B', 'Rube, C', 'Ritter, J', 'Jurgens, H', 'Vormoor, J']","['Baersch G', 'Mollers T', 'Hotte A', 'Dockhorn-Dworniczak B', 'Rube C', 'Ritter J', 'Jurgens H', 'Vormoor J']","['Klinik und Poliklinik fur Kinderheilkunde, Westfalische Wilhelms-Universitat Munster.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/pathology', 'Child', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/physiology', '*Graft Enhancement, Immunologic', 'Graft Survival/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemic Infiltration/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/09/18 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1043947 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1997 Jul-Aug;209(4):178-85. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1043947.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tc1-type CD8 cells secreted the type I cytokines IL-2 and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), whereas Tc2-type cells primarily secreted the type II cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10.

Here, expression of SCL and two broadly expressed E proteins, E47 and HEB, was high early in erythroid differentiation and declined during maturation. Stimulation of erythroid progenitors/precursors with stem cell factor (SCF) enhanced SCL and E protein levels, one mechanism by which SCF may increase erythroid proliferation. Interactions between SCL and E proteins are competed by Id2, which binds and sequesters E proteins. Upregulation of Id2, demonstrated here late in erythroid differentiation, may downregulate genes involved in erythroid proliferation/differentiation. We examined expression of bHLH proteins in transfusion-dependent patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) to determine if these interactions are disrupted. In erythroblasts from patients, expression of SCL protein and mRNA was normal and SCL increased in response to SCF. However, E47 and HEB protein levels were significantly decreased. Id2 was strongly expressed in patients. Through reduction of SCL/E protein heterodimer formation, abnormal levels of bHLH transcription factors may affect expression of erythroid specific genes, such as beta globin. Stimulation of Diamond-Blackfan cells with SCF partially compensated for this defect, enhancing expression of E47, HEB, and SCL. SCF may function to increase SCL/E protein heterodimer formation, which may be one of the mechanisms through which SCF stimulates erythroid proliferation/differentiation in DBA.","['Zhang, M Y', 'Clawson, G A', 'Olivieri, N F', 'Bell, L L', 'Begley, C G', 'Miller, B A']","['Zhang MY', 'Clawson GA', 'Olivieri NF', 'Bell LL', 'Begley CG', 'Miller BA']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, The Milton S.

Leukemic cells disseminate to murine tissues in a clinicopathologic pattern similar to that seen in humans. Thus far, reports of engraftment of lymphoid leukemia in SCID mice have mainly been from patients with B-cell lineage ALL, for which engraftment occurs more frequently with cells from high-risk patients. There are few data on the engraftment of T-cell lineage ALL in SCID mice. Leukemic cells from 19 patients (16 adult and three pediatric) with T-cell lineage ALL were injected into SCID mice, with overt engraftment of 12 cases (63%). Engraftment of leukemia in SCID mice was associated with earlier death due to leukemia of the patient donors (P < .01, log-rank test). The recently developed non-obese diabetic (NOD)/SCID mouse may expand the uses of the SCID model. Cells from the seven patients with T-cell lineage ALL that failed to cause leukemia in SCID mice were injected into NOD/SCID mice. Overt leukemia engraftment was observed in all seven cases. Thus, growth of human T-cell lineage ALL cells in SCID mice was associated with a high-risk patient group. However, this association was not observed when NOD/SCID mice were used, suggesting that this model would no longer predict patients likely to die early of leukemia, but may provide a more realistic system for studying the biology and treatment of the disease.","['Steele, J P', 'Clutterbuck, R D', 'Powles, R L', 'Mitchell, P L', 'Horton, C', 'Morilla, R', 'Catovsky, D', 'Millar, J L']","['Steele JP', 'Clutterbuck RD', 'Powles RL', 'Mitchell PL', 'Horton C', 'Morilla R', 'Catovsky D', 'Millar JL']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, The Institute of Cancer Research and Royal Marsden National Health Service Trust, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",1997/09/18 00:00,1997/09/18 00:01,['1997/09/18 00:00'],"['1997/09/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58811-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Sep 1;90(5):2015-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNAs were extracted from slides of bone marrow smears or from freshly isolated bone marrow mononuclear cells. The DNAs from the same individuals in both chronic phase and either blast crisis or accelerated phase were analyzed at 82 microsatellite markers, which mapped to each of the autosomal arms except the short arms of the acrocentric chromosomes. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on at least one locus was observed in 21 of the 30 cases (70%) as the disease progressed. Frequent allelic loss of > or = 20% of the informative cases was observed on chromosome arms 1p (35%), 7p (21%), 19p (20%), and 20q (29%). Allelic losses were also analyzed according to phenotypes. LOH of > or = 20% was detected on 1p (29%), 18p (20%), and 20q (27%) in myeloid blast crisis, and on 1p (50%), 4p (25%), 7p (43%), 9p (29%), 18q (25%), 19p (43%), and 20q (33%) in lymphoid blast crisis. Serial cytogenetic information was available for most of our cases with LOH on these arms, and only one case had loss of both chromosomes 9 and 20. Fractional allelic loss, calculated for each sample as the total number of chromosomal arms lost/total number of arms with information, showed a median value of 0.06 and a mean of 0.098 (range 0 to 0.60).

In this study, we examined MDM2 expression and function in multiple myeloma (MM) cells. MDM2 is strongly and constitutively expressed in MM cell lines (ARH-77, RPMI 8226, and OCI-My5) and in the cells of plasma cell leukemia (PCL) patients, but is not expressed in normal bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM MNCs). Treatment of MM cells with MDM2 antisense, but not sense, nonsense, or scrambled, oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) decreased DNA synthesis and cell viability; it also induced G1 growth arrest, as evidenced by propidium iodide (PI) staining and induction of retinoblastoma protein (pRB) to E2F-1 binding. Moreover, inhibition of MDM2 using antisense ODNs also triggered MM cell apoptosis as evidenced by acridine orange-ethidium bromide staining. We next studied the association of MDM2 with wtp53 and/or mutant p53 (mtp53), E2F-1, CDK4, and p21. MDM2 constitutively binds to E2F-1 in all MM cells, to both wtp53 and mtp53, and to p21 in tumor cells lacking p53. These data suggest that MDM2 may enhance cell-cycle progression in MM cells both by activating E2F-1 and by downregulating cell-cycle inhibitory proteins (wtp53 and p21). Overexpression of MDM2 may therefore contribute to both growth and survival of MM cells, suggesting the potential utility of treatment strategies targeting MDM2 in MM.","['Teoh, G', 'Urashima, M', 'Ogata, A', 'Chauhan, D', 'DeCaprio, J A', 'Treon, S P', 'Schlossman, R L', 'Anderson, K C']","['Teoh G', 'Urashima M', 'Ogata A', 'Chauhan D', 'DeCaprio JA', 'Treon SP', 'Schlossman RL', 'Anderson KC']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],['CA50947/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/09/18 00:00,1997/09/18 00:01,['1997/09/18 00:00'],"['1997/09/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58807-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Sep 1;90(5):1982-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of NK cells has been described in which the expanded NK cells display a restricted phenotype and cytotoxic activity. These data raise the hypothesis that proliferating LGL in these patients result from discrete expansions of NK cells responding to an unknown, perhaps viral, antigen. Recently, it was found that mice transgenic for the tax gene of human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus (HTLV) develop NK leukemia. Therefore, we studied 15 patients with chronic NK lymphoproliferative disorder for evidence of HTLV infection. Sera were tested using an HTLV-I/II-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and a modified Western blot assay containing recombinant env proteins. None of the sera met conventional criteria for HTLV seroreactivity. However, sera from 11 patients (73%) reacted with the recombinant HTLV env protein p21E. The anti-p21E reactivity of these sera was then mapped employing the recombinant proteins GD21 and BA21. No reactivity to the immunodominant HTLV epitope GD21 was observed, suggesting that prototypical HTLV infection is unlikely in these patients. This was confirmed by finding no evidence for HTLV nucleic acids by PCR analyses employing primers specific for conserved regions in the env, pol, and pX genes.

Ara-C metabolism was assessed by the activities of deoxycytidine kinase (DCK), deoxycytidine deaminase (DCD), DNA polymerase alpha (Poly alpha), and overall polymerase (overall Poly). The fraction of cells in S phase (%S phase) and thymidine kinase (TK) activity were determined as a measure of proliferative activity. Early response to therapy was defined by the percentage of leukemic blasts in the bone marrow 5 to 7 days after completion of TAD-9 with less than 5% signaling an adequate response and greater than 5% indicating an inadequate early reduction, respectively. While neither %S phase, DCK, nor overall Poly activity were predictive for early response, TK and Poly alpha activities were significantly higher for cases with adequate blast cell clearance. The respective median values were for TK 3.8 versus 1.85 pmol/min/mg protein (P = .012), and for Poly alpha 1.9 versus 0.69 pmol/min/mg protein (P = .014). An inverse relation was detected for DCD activity which was significantly lower in responding patients with a median of 0.33 nmol/min/mg protein (range, 0.0 to 29.5) as compared to a median of 5.1 nmol/min/mg protein (range, 0.11 to 8.45) in early nonresponders, (P = .009). Taking the respective median values as arbitrary cut-points for high or low enzyme activities, responders and nonresponders could be discriminated prospectively. Hence, 14 of 16 cases (88%) with DCD activities below the median of 1.56 nmol/min/mg protein responded as compared to only 3 of 14 (22%) patients with higher DCD activities (P = .0004). From the 15 patients with TK activity above the overall median of 3.2 pmol/min/mg protein, 11 cases (73%) achieved an adequate blast cell clearance while only 6 of 17 cases (35%) with lower values responded (P = .035). Similarly, 12 of 15 patients (80%) with high Poly alpha levels (>1.22 pmol/min/mg protein) responded to induction therapy as compared to only 5 of 14 patients (36%) with lower enzyme activities (P = .02). By logistic regression analysis of enzyme activities, DCD activity was found to be the most sensitive parameter to predict an adequate blast cell clearance (P = .032). Activities of DCD and TK were not only associated with initial response but were also found predictive for remission duration. Hence, from 11 patients with low TK levels 8 (73%) relapsed within 1 year, whereas only 2 of 11 (18%) patients with high TK activity experienced a recurrence of their disease (P = .015). Six of 9 (66%) patients with higher than median DCD levels relapsed within 1 year, whereas 10 of 14 patients (71%) with lower DCD levels had a longer remission duration (P = .085). Analysis of DCD gene expression at the mRNA level by a semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method showed that a high transcription rate of the DCD gene was associated with high enzyme activities and vice versa. Hence, the observed intraindividual differences in DCD activity are a reflection of differences in gene activity and transcription rate rather than of variants in translation. Although further analyses are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that determine the variation of enzyme activities in individual patients, the present study strongly suggests that pretherapeutic determination of TK and Poly alpha as well as of DCD allows to predict response to TAD-9 + GM-CSF induction therapy and may provide the means for the development of a risk adapted treatment strategy.","['Jahns-Streubel, G', 'Reuter, C', 'Auf der Landwehr, U', 'Unterhalt, M', 'Schleyer, E', 'Wormann, B', 'Buchner, T', 'Hiddemann, W']","['Jahns-Streubel G', 'Reuter C', 'Auf der Landwehr U', 'Unterhalt M', 'Schleyer E', 'Wormann B', 'Buchner T', 'Hiddemann W']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Georg-August-University, Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase II)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (deoxycytidine deaminase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'DAT protocol 1']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'DNA Polymerase II/genetics/*metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/physiopathology', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Thioguanine/therapeutic use', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics/*metabolism']",1997/09/18 00:00,1997/09/18 00:01,['1997/09/18 00:00'],"['1997/09/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58805-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Sep 1;90(5):1968-76.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, lack of expression of conventional costimulator molecules means that these cells tend to induce specific T-cell anergy rather than activation. CD40 ligand (CD40L) is a costimulator molecule that directly activates T cells and may promote antigen presentation by CD40-expressing cells, which include professional antigen presenting cells and B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells from many patients. We determined whether transgenic expression of CD40L could enhance an antileukemia immune response using a CD40+ murine lymphoblastic (A20) leukemia and a CD40- myeloblastic (WEHI-3) leukemia in a tumor treatment model. Injection of otherwise nonimmunogenic A20 cells in the presence of CD40L induced an immune response active against preexisting A20 tumor at a distant site. Moreover, concomitant local secretion of transgenic interleukin-2 (IL-2) further amplified the antileukemic response induced and increased protection against preexisting tumor. In ex vivo studies, CD40 activation of A20 cells enhances the antigen presenting potential of A20 cells by upregulating expression of B7.1 (CD80), Class I and II MHC molecules, and increases expression of fas antigens. The importance of CD40 activation to the resulting antitumor response is further emphasized by the failure of transgenic CD40L to protect against the CD40- WEHI myeloblastic leukemia. Depletion studies showed the protective effects against A20 cells to be mediated by a combination of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and by natural killer (NK) cells. These results suggest a means by which CD40+ leukemia cells may be rendered immunogenic in vivo.","['Dilloo, D', 'Brown, M', 'Roskrow, M', 'Zhong, W', 'Holladay, M', 'Holden, W', 'Brenner, M']","['Dilloo D', 'Brown M', 'Roskrow M', 'Zhong W', 'Holladay M', 'Holden W', 'Brenner M']","[""Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cell and Gene Therapy Program, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 58211/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/genetics/immunology', 'CD40 Ligand', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C']",1997/09/18 00:00,1997/09/18 00:01,['1997/09/18 00:00'],"['1997/09/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58800-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Sep 1;90(5):1927-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notable in this context is the homeobox gene HOX-B8 (formerly known as HOX-2.4), which was shown to cooperate with hematokines to induce leukemia, and to enhance self-renewal of immature myeloid progenitors when expressed alone. How HOX-B8 may affect lineage specific development of hematopoietic progenitor cells is unknown. Here it is shown that ectopic expression of HOX-B8 specifically inhibited dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-induced granulocytic differentiation of autonomously proliferating HL-60 myeloid progenitor cells. HOX-B8 also inhibited the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-induced granulocytic developmental program of factor dependent 32Dcl3 hematopoietic progenitors, including survival, proliferation, and differentiation, as evident by rapid apoptosis of the cells following removal of interleukin-3 (IL-3) and addition of G-CSF. In sharp contrast, HOX-B8 had no effect on macrophage differentiation of M1 and HL-60 cells induced by IL-6 and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, respectively. Moreover, HOX-B8 expression endowed the 32Dcl3 cells with the ability to be induced by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for terminal differentiation exclusively along the macrophage lineage; this effect was at least partially mediated via expression of the zinc finger transcription factor Egr-1. Thus, ectopic expression of HOX-B8 in hematopoietic progenitor cells appears to differentially affect lineage specific development, negatively regulating granulocyte development and positively regulating macrophage development.","['Krishnaraju, K', 'Hoffman, B', 'Liebermann, D A']","['Krishnaraju K', 'Hoffman B', 'Liebermann DA']","['Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, and Department of Biochemistry, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['5P30CA12227/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'LROLCA43618/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'LROLCA51162/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxb8 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Lineage/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics']",1997/09/18 00:00,1997/09/18 00:01,['1997/09/18 00:00'],"['1997/09/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58790-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Sep 1;90(5):1840-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now report the identification of mRNA transcripts of full-length tyrosine kinase-containing trkA, trkB, and trkC neurotrophin receptor genes in HMC-1 human mast cell leukemia cells. Although HMC-1 cells lacked p75 mRNA, they expressed transcripts for the exon-lacking splice variant of trkA (trkAI), truncated trkB (trkB.T1), and truncated trkC. By flow cytometry, HMC-1 cells exhibited expression of TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC receptor proteins containing full-length tyrosine kinase domains. NGF stimulation of HMC-1 cells induced tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA protein, increased expression of the early response genes c-fos and NGF1-A, and activation of ERK-mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, results which indicate that TrkA receptors in HMC-1 cells are fully functional. Highly purified populations of human lung mast cells expressed mRNAs for trkA, trkB and trkC, whereas preparations of human umbilical cord blood-derived mast cells expressed mRNAs for trkA and trkC, but not trkB. Moreover, preparations of human umbilical cord blood-derived immature mast cells not only expressed mRNA transcript and protein for TrkA, but exhibited significantly higher numbers of chymase-positive cells after the addition of NGF to their culture medium for 3 weeks. In addition, HMC-1 cells expressed mRNAs for NGF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), the cognate ligands for TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC, whereas NGF and BDNF transcripts were detectable in human umbilical cord blood mast cell preparations. Taken together, our findings show that human mast cells express a functional TrkA receptor tyrosine kinase and indicate that NGF may be able to promote certain aspects of mast cell development and/or maturation in humans. Our studies also raise the possibility that human mast cells may represent a potential source for neurotrophins.","['Tam, S Y', 'Tsai, M', 'Yamaguchi, M', 'Yano, K', 'Butterfield, J H', 'Galli, S J']","['Tam SY', 'Tsai M', 'Yamaguchi M', 'Yano K', 'Butterfield JH', 'Galli SJ']","['Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['AI/CA-23990/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA/AI-72074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-56383/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, trkA)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptor, trkA', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1997/09/18 00:00,1997/09/18 00:01,['1997/09/18 00:00'],"['1997/09/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58787-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Sep 1;90(5):1807-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each translocation involving MLL results in loss of one functional copy of MLL and the generation of a chimeric fusion protein with potential dominant negative or neomorphic activity. Mll is a positive regulator of Hox genes, which have been implicated in both axial skeleton patterning and hematopoietic development. Previous studies indicated that Hox gene expression is altered in Mll heterozygous (+/-) and homozygous (-/-) deficient mice. To study the role of Mll in hematopoiesis and to obtain insights into leukemogenesis, we have examined the effects of haplo-insufficiency or absence of Mll by in vitro differentiation of Mll +/+, +/-, and -/- yolk sac progenitor cells. Mll -/- colonies were fewer in number, took longer to develop, and contained fewer cells than their wild-type and heterozygous counterparts. Formation of colony-forming unit-granulocyte, erythroid, macrophage, megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM), colony-forming unit-macrophage (CFU-M), and burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) was markedly decreased in Mll -/- cultures, while numbers of colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E), colony-forming unit-granulocyte (CFU-G), and colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) were essentially unaffected. Despite the decreased numbers of colonies present, Mll -/- cultures showed all cell types without morphologic evidence of maturation arrest.

Tax does not bind DNA directly, but does interact with cellular DNA binding proteins. These interactions bring Tax to a specific group of promoters and may help to determine the specificity of Tax transactivation. Previous studies have demonstrated that the activity of Tax, when tethered to a given promoter, is enhanced by the presence of adjacent transcription factor binding sites. To examine the specificity of this augmentation, a series of transcription factor binding sites was tested for the ability to enhance the activity of a Gal-Tax fusion protein. The greatest increase in Gal-Tax activity was observed when an octamer binding site was placed adjacent to the Gal4 binding sites. However, the octamer binding site failed to independently function as a Tax responsive element in the absence of an adjacent Tax-tethering element. Oct-2 was not required for augmentation of Gal-Tax activity as this enhancement was observed in BHK-21 cells, which lack Oct-2. The ability of octamer binding sites to augment transcription was specific for Gal-Tax, as compared to other transactivators. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the degree of Tax transactivation can be influenced by the elemental composition of the target promoter.","['Marriott, S J', 'Payne, K', 'Connor, L M']","['Marriott SJ', 'Payne K', 'Connor LM']","['Division of Molecular Virology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA. susanm@bcm.tmc.edu']",['eng'],"['R01CA55684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA09197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GAL4 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-2)', '0 (POU2F2 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-2', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics']",1997/09/18 00:00,1997/09/18 00:01,['1997/09/18 00:00'],"['1997/09/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-78-9-2259 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1997 Sep;78 ( Pt 9):2259-67. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-78-9-2259.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The data files from the incidence years 1989-1992 of the two registries were linked in order to evaluate accuracy and completeness and to calculate and equalise the incidence rates for childhood leukaemia in The Netherlands. Unlinked records or records with disagreements (birth date, sex, type of leukaemia and incidence date) were checked by the DCLSG and by the regional cancer registries. The DCLSG recorded 431 cases of childhood leukaemia, while the NCR recorded 434 cases. After record linkage and review of the cases, it was concluded the 445 records should have been recorded as childhood leukaemia. The NCR had recorded 425 of the 445 correct cases (95.5%), but had missed 20 cases (4.5%). The DCLSG had recorded 431 of the 445 correct cases (96.9%) and had missed 14 cases (3.1%). In addition, the NCR had recorded 9 cases incorrectly as childhood leukaemia. Part of the disagreement was caused by differences in coding rules (definition of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and the myelodysplastic syndrome versus leukaemia). It could be concluded that the quality and completeness of the two registries was very high. Regular comparison of the recorded data will help to reveal the inherently problematic disagreement between definitions and coding.","['Schouten, L J', 'Van der Does-van den Berg, A', 'Otter, R', 'Coebergh, J W']","['Schouten LJ', 'Van der Does-van den Berg A', 'Otter R', 'Coebergh JW']","['Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR), Association of Comprehensive Cancer Centres, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Databases, Factual/standards', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Registries/*standards', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/09/18 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0959804996005242 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(96)00524-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1997 May;33(6):891-4. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(96)00524-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This occurred consecutively after the administration of chemotherapy, during the ensuing period of myelosuppression. Thirty-six patients with AL received, in a three-month period, 51 cycles of combined chemotherapy which included, in all of them, cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C); among them, along with myelosuppression, five experienced fever, infectious complications, gastrointestinal tract symptoms and severe myalgias. Serum creatine kinase (CK), liver function tests and a light microscopy muscle biopsy were performed on all of them. Ten-17 days after receiving chemotherapy, five patients (4 males and 1 female) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia developed incapacitating myalgias in neck, thighs and arms. CK and/or alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were increased 5-24 times above the normal range in four of these patients, and the muscle biopsy showed focal RML in all five. Myalgias were self-limited and lasted 4-10 days. In addition to the chemotherapy, other factors known to be capable of producing RML, such as sepsis, other medications, and dehydration were found. In conclusion, myalgias were due to focal RML produced probably by a combination of factors, particularly the chemotherapy along with dehydration due to gastrointestinal complications, infection, and the use of diverse antibiotics. The endemic nature of the finding in such a short period of time is outstanding.","['Morales-Polanco, M', 'Javier Jimenez-Balderas, F', 'Butron, L', 'Gutierrez, L', 'Paredes-Gonzalez, E']","['Morales-Polanco M', 'Javier Jimenez-Balderas F', 'Butron L', 'Gutierrez L', 'Paredes-Gonzalez E']","['Departamento de Hematologia, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico D.F.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Med Res,Archives of medical research,9312706,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Rhabdomyolysis/chemically induced/*etiology']",1997/09/18 00:00,1997/09/18 00:01,['1997/09/18 00:00'],"['1997/09/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/18 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Med Res. 1997 Autumn;28(3):377-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preparation of the uterus for implantation is primarily under the control of the ovarian sex steroids, estrogen and progesterone. Increasing evidence is revealing that their effects on cell proliferation and differentiation in the uterus are medicated by locally produced growth factors and cytokines. In contrast, preimplantation development of the embryo to the blastocyst stage appears to be independent of exogenous growth factors. Implantation, the point at which the blastocyst forms a more intimate association with the maternal tissues, is regulated by the uterine expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). LIF is required both to promote embryo attachment and for decidualization of the uterus. In the absence of LIF, neither of these events occur. Uterine expression of LIF at the time of implantation has been described in many species, suggesting that LIF may be of general significance in regulating embryo implantation in mammals.","['Stewart, C L', 'Cullinan, E B']","['Stewart CL', 'Cullinan EB']","['Laboratory of Cancer and Developmental Biology, NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, MD 21702, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Dev Genet,Developmental genetics,7909963,['0 (Growth Substances)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*physiology', 'Embryonic Development/*physiology', 'Female', 'Growth Substances/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Pregnancy']",1997/01/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1520-6408(1997)21:1<91::AID-DVG11>3.0.CO;2-D [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1520-6408(1997)21:1<91::AID-DVG11>3.0.CO;2-D [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Genet. 1997;21(1):91-101. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1520-6408(1997)21:1<91::AID-DVG11>3.0.CO;2-D.,125,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blastomeres (2-13 per well) from embryos produced by in vitro maturation, fertilization, and culture of oocytes obtained from slaughterhouse ovaries were cultured for 10 days in 24-well culture plates on feeder layers in blastomere culture medium (BCM: equal parts tissue culture medium 199 and low-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum). Ovine embryonic fibroblasts and STO cells were superior to bovine and mouse embryonic fibroblasts as mitotically inactivated feeder cells. Over five studies in which four blastomeres from an embryo were added to each culture well, an average of one colony per well formed from the blastomeres. The colonies continued to grow throughout the culture period, and most colonies resembled trophectoderm in their cellular characteristics, although some cultures contained a mixture of trophectoderm and endoderm. When the number of blastomeres cultured in each well was varied from 2-8, the number of colonies formed was proportional to the number of blastomeres added. Blastomeres from day 5 and day 6 embryos produced fewer colonies than did those from day 4 embryos, perhaps as a result of differentiation and tighter blastomere adhesion resulting in damage during their separation. The absence of serum did not alter the number of colonies formed. A number of growth factors, including LIF, OM, PGDF alpha, and FGF4, had no effect on the number of colonies, the size of colonies, or their alkaline phosphatase staining score beyond that provided by the feeder layer on serum when present. Blastomeres did not form colonies in the absence of feeder layers.","['Rexroad, C E Jr', 'Powell, A M']","['Rexroad CE Jr', 'Powell AM']","['Gene Evaluation and Mapping Laboratory, United States Department of Agriculture, Beltsville, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Reprod Dev,Molecular reproduction and development,8903333,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Fgf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 4)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor alpha)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastomeres/*cytology/drug effects', 'Cattle', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Culture Media', '*Fertilization in Vitro', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 4', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor alpha/pharmacology']",1997/09/18 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/09/18 00:00'],"['1997/09/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/09/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2795(199710)48:2<238::AID-MRD11>3.0.CO;2-U [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1098-2795(199710)48:2<238::AID-MRD11>3.0.CO;2-U [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Reprod Dev. 1997 Oct;48(2):238-45. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2795(199710)48:2<238::AID-MRD11>3.0.CO;2-U.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to determine if splenectomy achieves a predictable hematologic and survival advantage over conventional chemotherapy in patients with CLL. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review was performed of 77 consecutive patients with CLL who underwent splenectomy between 1970 and 1994 at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Indications for splenectomy, pre- and postoperative hematologic profiles, response to splenectomy, and time to progression and death were recorded. Kaplan-Meier life tables were constructed, and a comparison to an age- and gender-matched cohort of CLL patients treated with fludarabine and no splenectomy was performed using log rank statistical analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-six percent of the patients studied were Rai stage III/IV. Twenty of 29 patients with hemoglobin counts (Hb) < or = 10 g/dL and 11 of 18 patients with platelet counts (plt) < 50 x 10(9)/L achieved an excellent hematologic response to splenectomy. Splenectomy significantly improved survival in patients with Hb < or = 10 g/dL or plt < or = 50 x 10(9)/L (p = 0.025). Thrombocytopenia did not significantly increase postoperative morbidity, and mortality rate was not significantly different between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Splenectomy significantly improves survival in selected subgroups of patients with advanced-stage CLL over that achieved with conventional chemotherapy. Based on these results, splenectomy should be performed early in the course of the disease in CLL patients with either an Hb < or = 10 g/dL or plt < or = 50 x 10(9)/L.","['Cusack, J C Jr', 'Seymour, J F', 'Lerner, S', 'Keating, M J', 'Pollock, R E']","['Cusack JC Jr', 'Seymour JF', 'Lerner S', 'Keating MJ', 'Pollock RE']","['Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas M.

This did not interfere with folding, S-ester formation or tetramerization of the mutant recombinant alpha 2M (r alpha 2M). Mutant r alpha 2M inhibited furin in vitro, by a similar mechanism to that used by plasma alpha 2M to inhibit high-molecular-mass proteases. The mutant alpha 2M was intracellularly active in COS-1 cells in inhibiting the endogenous processing of the soluble substrates for furin (von Willebrand factor, transforming growth factor beta1 and a soluble form of the envelope glycoprotein gp160 from HIV-1) but not the membrane-bound form of gp160. The intracellular activity of mutant alpha 2M strongly indicated that alpha 2M attains its native conformation, and thus that the unusual internal S-ester is formed, before alpha 2M passes through the cleavage compartment(s). Our results show for the first time that modulation of the bait region of alpha 2M allows the creation of an inhibitor against membrane-bound proteases. It can be expected that the use of alpha 2M-bait mutants will become important as a technique for the study of various proteolytic processes and for the identification of the proteases involved.","['Van Rompaey, L', 'Ayoubi, T', 'Van De Ven, W', 'Marynen, P']","['Van Rompaey L', 'Ayoubi T', 'Van De Ven W', 'Marynen P']","['Center for Human Genetics, Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology, University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Serine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (alpha-Macroglobulins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Subtilisins)', 'EC 3.4.21.75 (Furin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Furin', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Intracellular Fluid/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Protein Precursors/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Serine Proteinase Inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/pharmacology', 'Solubility', 'Subtilisins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'alpha-Macroglobulins/chemistry/*genetics/*pharmacology']",1997/09/18 00:00,1997/09/18 00:01,['1997/09/18 00:00'],"['1997/09/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3260507 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1997 Sep 1;326 ( Pt 2):507-14. doi: 10.1042/bj3260507.,,PMC1218698,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From analyses of mice deficient in transcription factor genes and from the characterizations of chromosome breakpoints in human leukemias, it has become evident that transcription factors are important regulators of hematopoiesis. During myelopoiesis, which includes the development of granulocytic and monocytic lineages, transcription factors from several families are active, including AML1/CBF beta, C/EBP, Ets, c-Myb, HOX, and MZF-1. Few of these factors are expressed exclusively in myeloid cells; instead it appears that they cooperatively regulate transcription of myeloid-specific genes.

Accordingly, we believe that most t(11;16)-associated leukemias may develop in patients who have been treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for primary malignant diseases.","['Satake, N', 'Ishida, Y', 'Otoh, Y', 'Hinohara, S', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Sakashita, A', 'Maseki, N', 'Kaneko, Y']","['Satake N', 'Ishida Y', 'Otoh Y', 'Hinohara S', 'Kobayashi H', 'Sakashita A', 'Maseki N', 'Kaneko Y']","['Third Clinical Department, Saitama Cancer Center Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Southern', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Child', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/*genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Remission Induction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', '*Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1997/09/18 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/09/18 00:00'],"['1997/09/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/09/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199709)20:1<60::AID-GCC9>3.0.CO;2-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1997 Sep;20(1):60-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytokine that initially was held responsible for causing these changes was tumor necrosis factor (TNF). However, from various studies it has become clear that the action of TNF can only be understood in the context of simultaneous presence of other cytokines, some of which have activities that are at the least equally important as TNF in bringing about cachexia. This review summarizes the experimental evidence for the involvement of cytokines in the pathogenesis of cachexia. Indirect evidence comes from the observation that cachexia can be induced in animals by repeated injections of cytokines or by inoculation of cytokine-producing cells. Thus, cachexia has been described in mice inoculated with tumor cells carrying and expressing genes for either TNF, interleukin-6 (IL-6), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). More direct evidence is provided by the observations that cachexia in experimental animal models can be mitigated by administration of specific antagonists of cytokines. These latter type of studies revealed that cachexia can rarely, if ever, be attributed to one single cytokine but rather to a set of cytokines that work in concert in cachexia. A pool of anticytokine antibodies or other cytokine inhibitors might, therefore, be considered as a potential intervention for the treatment of cachectic patients, but this approach may induce immunosuppression, and, therefore, danger exists that such treatment may benefit the infectious agent or tumor.","['Matthys, P', 'Billiau, A']","['Matthys P', 'Billiau A']","['Rega Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Nutrition,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",8802712,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cachexia/*etiology/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cytokines/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology']",1997/09/18 00:00,1997/09/18 00:01,['1997/09/18 00:00'],"['1997/09/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0899-9007(97)00185-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0899-9007(97)00185-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Nutrition. 1997 Sep;13(9):763-70. doi: 10.1016/s0899-9007(97)00185-8.,80,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, the capacity of nuclear alpha-RNP to direct interaction with DNA Alu repeats appearing after the induction of K-562 cells to differentiation along erythroid pathway is an inducible property.

We found that the blood and splenic CD4+ T cells of patients with CLL failed to express surface CD154 after CD3 ligation. However, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based quantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we noted that CD3 ligation could induce such T cells to express CD154 messenger RNA at levels similar to that of CD3-activated T cells from normal donors. Moreover, addition of increasing numbers of CLL B cells to activated normal donor T cells rapidly resulted in progressively greater down-modulation of CD154. Such down-modulation of CD154 could be blocked by addition of CD40 monoclonal antibody to cultures in vitro.

We concluded that LD Ara-C may be an alternative treatment to the conventional chemotherapy in children with APL, especially in whom conventional cytotoxic induction chemotherapy is thought to increase the risk of serious complications and early fatality during induction chemotherapy.","['Sung, K W', 'Choi, H S', 'Yoo, E S', 'Rhu, K H', 'Shin, H Y', 'Ahn, H S']","['Sung KW', 'Choi HS', 'Yoo ES', 'Rhu KH', 'Shin HY', 'Ahn HS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Korea (South),J Korean Med Sci,Journal of Korean medical science,8703518,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3346/jkms.1997.12.4.298 [doi]'],ppublish,J Korean Med Sci. 1997 Aug;12(4):298-304. doi: 10.3346/jkms.1997.12.4.298.,,PMC3054219,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present evidence that lipoic acid induces a substantial increase in cellular reduced glutathione in cultured human Jurkat T cells human erythrocytes, C6 glial cells, NB41A3 neuroblastoma cells, and peripheral blood lymphocytes. The effect depends on metabolic reduction of lipoic acid to dihydrolipoic acid. Dihydrolipoic acid is released into the culture medium where it reduces cystine. Cysteine thus formed is readily taken up by the neutral amino acid transport system and utilized for glutathione synthesis. By this mechanism lipoic acid enables cystine to bypass the xc- transport system, which is weakly expressed in lymphocytes and inhibited by glutamate. Thereby lipoic acid enables the key enzyme of glutathione synthesis, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, which is regulated by uptake-limited cysteine supply, to work at optimum conditions. Flow cytometric analysis of freshly prepared human peripheral blood lymphocytes, using monobromobimane labeling of cellular thiols, reveals that lipoic acid acts mainly to normalize a subpopulation of cells severely compromised in thiol status rather than to increase thiol content beyond physiological levels. Hence lipoic acid may have clinical relevance in restoration of severely glutathione deficient cells.","['Han, D', 'Handelman, G', 'Marcocci, L', 'Sen, C K', 'Roy, S', 'Kobuchi, H', 'Tritschler, H J', 'Flohe, L', 'Packer, L']","['Han D', 'Handelman G', 'Marcocci L', 'Sen CK', 'Roy S', 'Kobuchi H', 'Tritschler HJ', 'Flohe L', 'Packer L']","['Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley 94720-3200, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA 47597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK50430/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biofactors,"BioFactors (Oxford, England)",8807441,"['3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', '48TCX9A1VT (Cystine)', '73Y7P0K73Y (Thioctic Acid)', '7NV2KHU5JA (dihydrolipoic acid)', 'EC 6.3.2.2 (Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cystine/*metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase/metabolism', 'Glutamic Acid/pharmacology', 'Glutathione/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neuroblastoma/metabolism', 'Neuroglia/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Rats', 'Thioctic Acid/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/biof.5520060303 [doi]'],ppublish,Biofactors. 1997;6(3):321-38. doi: 10.1002/biof.5520060303.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations of the bcl-2 gene were studied at mRNA and DNA levels. The presence and abundance of the Bcl-2 protein in cells were also investigated. In earlier studies the p53 tumour suppressor gene was screened for point mutations, and the radiosensitivity of these cell lines was measured. We were able to amplify bcl-2 cDNA from 5 of the 9 cell lines, which shows that bcl-2 was expressed in these cells. No point mutations were found in the bcl-2 gene in any of these cell lines. Loss of heterozygosity was observed in 2 cell lines at the bcl-2 locus, and these cell lines had no detectable levels of bcl-2 mRNA or Bcl-2 protein. The Bcl-2 protein was abundant in the cell lines with the wild-type p53 gene, and these cell lines were radioresistant. The Bcl-2 protein was also found in many other cell lines in mitotic cells. It seems that cells expressing bcl-2 are radioresistant, and even functional p53 cannot induce apoptosis in these cells.","['Salo, A', 'Servomaa, K', 'Kiuru, A', 'Pulkkinen, J', 'Grenman, R', 'Pekkola-Heino, K', 'Rytomaa, T']","['Salo A', 'Servomaa K', 'Kiuru A', 'Pulkkinen J', 'Grenman R', 'Pekkola-Heino K', 'Rytomaa T']","['Finnish Centre for Radiation and Nuclear Safety, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Norway,Acta Otolaryngol Suppl,Acta oto-laryngologica.

In more than 99% of cases, this disruption results in the formation of a PML-RARA gene fusion. Two rare variants of APL have been described, in which RARA is fused to one of two other genes, PLZF and NPM. Although RARA dysregulation is evidently important in APL, the role of the various fusion partners remains unclear. We have characterized a fourth APL gene fusion, which links exons encoding the retinoic acid and DNA-binding domains of RARA to 5' exons of NuMA, a gene that encodes the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein. The NuMA-RARA fusion protein exists in sheet-like nuclear aggregates with which normal NuMA partly co-localizes. In contrast to t(15;17) APL, the intracellular distribution of PML is normal in these cells. Our results suggest that interference with retinoid signalling, and not disruption of PML organization, is essential to the APL phenotype and implicates for the first time an element of the mitotic apparatus in the molecular pathogenesis of human malignancy.","['Wells, R A', 'Catzavelos, C', 'Kamel-Reid, S']","['Wells RA', 'Catzavelos C', 'Kamel-Reid S']","['Department of Hematology, Toronto Hospital, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (NUMA1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Nuclear', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/*genetics', 'Organ Specificity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Spindle Apparatus', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1997/09/01 00:00,1997/09/01 00:01,['1997/09/01 00:00'],"['1997/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/ng0997-109 [doi]'],ppublish,Nat Genet. 1997 Sep;17(1):109-13. doi: 10.1038/ng0997-109.,,,"['GENBANK/AF012302', 'GENBANK/AF012303', 'GENBANK/AF012304']",['Acta Haematol. 2016;136(1):1-15.

The risk of cancer, especially lymphoid neoplasias, is substantially elevated in A-T patients and has long been associated with chromosomal instability. By analysing tumour DNA from patients with sporadic T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL), a rare clonal malignancy with similarities to a mature T-cell leukaemia seen in A-T, we demonstrate a high frequency of ATM mutations in T-PLL. In marked contrast to the ATM mutation pattern in A-T, the most frequent nucleotide changes in this leukaemia were missense mutations. These clustered in the region corresponding to the kinase domain, which is highly conserved in ATM-related proteins in mouse, yeast and Drosophila. The resulting amino-acid substitutions are predicted to interfere with ATP binding or substrate recognition. Two of seventeen mutated T-PLL samples had a previously reported A-T allele. In contrast, no mutations were detected in the p53 gene, suggesting that this tumour suppressor is not frequently altered in this leukaemia. Occasional missense mutations in ATM were also found in tumour DNA from patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHL) and a B-NHL cell line. The evidence of a significant proportion of loss-of-function mutations and a complete absence of the normal copy of ATM in the majority of mutated tumours establishes somatic inactivation of this gene in the pathogenesis of sporadic T-PLL and suggests that ATM acts as a tumour suppressor. As constitutional DNA was not available, a putative hereditary predisposition to T-PLL will require further investigation.","['Vorechovsky, I', 'Luo, L', 'Dyer, M J', 'Catovsky, D', 'Amlot, P L', 'Yaxley, J C', 'Foroni, L', 'Hammarstrom, L', 'Webster, A D', 'Yuille, M A']","['Vorechovsky I', 'Luo L', 'Dyer MJ', 'Catovsky D', 'Amlot PL', 'Yaxley JC', 'Foroni L', 'Hammarstrom L', 'Webster AD', 'Yuille MA']","['Karolinska Institute, Department of Bioscience at NOVUM, Center for Biotechnology, Huddinge, Sweden. igor.vorechovsky@cbt.ki.se']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Atm protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia/*genetics', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Genes, p53', 'Granulocytes', 'Humans', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Protein Biosynthesis', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1997/09/01 00:00,1997/09/01 00:01,['1997/09/01 00:00'],"['1997/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/ng0997-96 [doi]'],ppublish,Nat Genet. 1997 Sep;17(1):96-9. doi: 10.1038/ng0997-96.,,,"['GENBANK/L34075', 'GENBANK/U31109', 'GENBANK/U33841', 'GENBANK/U34925', 'GENBANK/U34994', 'GENBANK/U76308', 'GENBANK/X74857', 'GENBANK/Y09076', 'GENBANK/Z35849']",,,,,,,,,,,,

CNTFR can function in either membrane-bound or soluble forms. The membrane-bound form mediates the neuronal actions of CNTF, whereas the soluble form serves to confer cytokine responsiveness to non-neuronal cells expressing gp130 and LIFR. The objective of this work was to analyze whether the two receptor isoforms differ in their ability to interact functionally with CNTF and related proteins. Two new types of CNTF variants, characterized by weakened interactions with either CNTFR or both LIFR and gp130, were developed, and the biological activities of these and other mutants were determined in non-neuronal versus neuronal cells, as well as in non-neuronal cells transfected with an expression vector for CNTFR. Membrane anchoring of CNTFR was found to render the CNTF receptor complex relatively insensitive to changes in agonist affinity for either alpha- or beta-receptor subunits and to promote a more efficient interaction with a gp130-depleting antagonistic variant of CNTF. As a result of this phenomenon, which can be rationalized in terms of the multivalent nature of CNTF receptor interaction, CNTF variants display striking changes in receptor selectivity.","['Di Marco, A', 'Gloaguen, I', 'Demartis, A', 'Saggio, I', 'Graziani, R', 'Paonessa, G', 'Laufer, R']","['Di Marco A', 'Gloaguen I', 'Demartis A', 'Saggio I', 'Graziani R', 'Paonessa G', 'Laufer R']","['Istituto di Ricerche di Biologia Molecolare P.

Acute GVHD, mediated by alloreactive donor T lymphocytes originating from the transfused marrow is the most significant cause of transplant-related morbidity and mortality, despite the use of combined prophylaxis with cyclosporine and methotrexate. Effective prevention of GVHD can be accomplished by depletion of donor immunocompetent T cells from the marrow prior to its infusion. Depletion of lymphocytes, however, prevents the immune mediated interaction of donor T cells against residual host tumor cells--the graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect, which significantly contributes to the curative effect of allogeneic BMT. It is still unsettled to what extent GVH and GVL are unseparable or closely related phenomena, and a major question remains whether it would be possible to retain the beneficial antileukemic effects of donor T cells and at the same time prevent or control the risk of GVHD. We have adopted a policy by which an allogeneic BMT is conducted with T cell depleted marrow to minimize the risk of severe acute GVHD, followed by stepwise administration of fresh unirradiated donor lymphocytes for prevention of leukemic relapse. Our data show that the overall relapse free survival was significantly better for patients receiving preventive posttransplant donor lymphocytes, predominantly when transplant was performed in 1st or 2nd CR.","['Naparstek, E', 'Nagler, A', 'Or, R', 'Kapelushnik, J', 'Slavin, S']","['Naparstek E', 'Nagler A', 'Or R', 'Kapelushnik J', 'Slavin S']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Clin Transpl,Clinical transplants,8812419,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Infant', 'Israel', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*transplantation', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Transpl. 1996:281-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The plasmid pfosluc2 was genetically introduced into a mouse myeloid leukemia cell line NFS-60 which showed a growth dependency on contact with PA6 cells, and the mechanism by which stromal PA6 cells promote the proliferation of NFS-60 cells through the direct cell-to-cell interaction was analyzed. The direct cell-to-cell interaction with PA6 cells was found to cause a significant c-fos induction to NFS-60 cells within 1 h. Approximately 10(5) cDNA clones prepared from PA6 cells were screened for their activity to promote the c-fos expression in NFS-60 cells through the direct cell-to-cell interaction, and 13 positive clones were obtained. Of these positive clones, five clones encoded the stem cell factor, and the others encoded the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). The c-fos induction caused by the contact with PA6 cells in NFS-60 was completely inhibited by addition of both antagonistic anti-c-kit and anti-HGF antibodies. These results represent direct evidence for the action of HGF on the proliferation of hematopoietic cells through direct cell-to-cell interaction with stromal cells.

Myelofibrosis is not a feature of ET, may occur in PV, and constitutes a prominent feature of CMGM during the natural history of the disease.","['Michiels, J J']",['Michiels JJ'],"['Department of Clinical Haematology, Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdum, Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Neth J Med,The Netherlands journal of medicine,0356133,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/pathology', 'Polycythemia Vera/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/diagnosis/*pathology']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0300297797000181 [pii]', '10.1016/s0300-2977(97)00018-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Neth J Med. 1997 Aug;51(2):57-64. doi: 10.1016/s0300-2977(97)00018-1.,45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The detailed study of the biochemical and genetic pathways altered in human cancer requires the identification or development of models to allow the study and manipulation of cancer gene function. Recently, the breakpoint gene TCL1, involved in chromosome translocations observed mostly in mature T-cell proliferations and chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLL), was isolated and characterized, and showed to be part of a new gene family of proteins involved in these tumors. The murine Tcl1 gene, is similar in sequence to the murine and human MTCP1 gene also involved in T cell leukemias. The murine Tcl1 gene was shown to reside on mouse chromosome 12 in a region syntenic to human chromosome 14. Furthermore, we show that the murine Tcl1 gene is expressed early in mouse embryonic development and demonstrates expression in fetal hematopoietic organs as well as in immature T and B cells. Characterization of the murine Tcl1 gene will help in developing a mouse model of CLL and would provide the best opportunity to study and decipher the role of TCL1 in malignant transformation.","['Narducci, M G', 'Virgilio, L', 'Engiles, J B', 'Buchberg, A M', 'Billips, L', 'Facchiano, A', 'Croce, C M', 'Russo, G', 'Rothstein, J L']","['Narducci MG', 'Virgilio L', 'Engiles JB', 'Buchberg AM', 'Billips L', 'Facchiano A', 'Croce CM', 'Russo G', 'Rothstein JL']","[""Istituto Dermopatico dell' Immacolata-IRCCS, Rome.""]",['eng'],"['CA-21124/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39869/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-56336/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Lymphoid Tissue/embryology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogenes/*physiology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",1997/08/18 00:00,1997/08/18 00:01,['1997/08/18 00:00'],"['1997/08/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201246 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1997 Aug 18;15(8):919-26. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201246.,,,"['GENBANK/AF031956', 'GENBANK/Y15376']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the effect of Bmi1 overexpression on hematopoiesis and lymphomagenesis transgenic mice were generated that overexpress different forms of the Bmi1 protein in their lymphoid compartment. Emu Bmi1 transgenic mice, overexpressing the wild type Bmi1 protein showed a perturbed lymphoid development and were highly susceptible to B and T cell lymphomagenesis. Mutational analysis of the Bmi1 protein demonstrated that the conserved N-terminal RING finger and central part of Bmi1 are essential for its oncogenic potential whereas the C-terminal Pro-Ser rich region is not required. We have used provirus tagging in the Emu Bmi1 mice to identify genes that cooperate with Bmi1 in lymphomagenesis. MoMLV infection in Emu Bmi1 transgenic mice accelerated lymphoma development. Proviral activation of the Pim and Myc genes but not the Gfi1 gene were frequently observed in these tumors. These results demonstrate that Bmi1 is a potent oncogene and suggest that it plays an important role in early lymphoid development.","['Alkema, M J', 'Jacobs, H', 'van Lohuizen, M', 'Berns, A']","['Alkema MJ', 'Jacobs H', 'van Lohuizen M', 'Berns A']","['The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Division of Molecular Genetics, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Bmi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology/*physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*growth & development/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Oncogenes', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/physiology', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Sequence Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology/*physiology', '*Transgenes', 'Zinc Fingers']",1997/08/18 00:00,1997/08/18 00:01,['1997/08/18 00:00'],"['1997/08/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201262 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1997 Aug 18;15(8):899-910. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201262.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Engraftment was detected using immunofluorescent staining of class I human leukocyte antigens and flow cytometry. All the tumours grew as disseminated disease with engraftment of bone marrow preceding involvement of peripheral blood (PB). After treatment with G-CSF (250 microg/kg/day) for 5 days, mobilization of haemopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) was observed in non-engrafted SCID mice (40-fold) and in mice engrafted with human leukaemia (20-fold). G-CSF stimulated increases in PB HPCs and total numbers of host nucleated cells in leukaemia-bearing mice but did not induce rises in numbers of circulating HL60 colony-forming cells. Similarly, in mice engrafted with human CML or AML, G-CSF did not increase the number of malignant cells in the PB. These results provided evidence that the migration of normal and malignant haemopoietic cells into the PB are controlled by different mechanisms, and that contamination of PBSC harvests with leukaemic cells in SCID-human chimaeric mice is not enhanced by G-CSF-stimulated mobilization.","['Clutterbuck, R D', 'Newman, A', 'Powles, R', 'Catovsky, D', 'Millar, J L']","['Clutterbuck RD', 'Newman A', 'Powles R', 'Catovsky D', 'Millar JL']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden NHS Trust, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*blood', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700906 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Aug;20(4):325-32. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700906.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and UV light rapidly stimulated Ca2+-independent activity of CaM-KII in the monocytic leukemia, U937. Two mechanistically different inhibitors of CaM-KII blocked activation of CaM-KII and prevented DNA fragmentation and death. Activation of CaM-KII during apoptosis and inhibition of DNA fragmentation by the two CaM-KII inhibitors were reproduced in several other lines including KGla, HL-60, and YAC-1. However, K562, which is relatively resistant to apoptosis induced by either TNF or UV light, did not activate CaM-KII in response to these stimuli. A variant derived from U937 that is resistant to TNF- or UV light-induced apoptosis also lacked a CaM-KII response. Activation of Cam-KII was blocked by two protease inhibitors, VAD-fmk and TPCK, but not by other inhibitors of serine proteases. Both inhibitors of CaM-KII and the protease inhibitors blocked activation of AP24, a serine protease originally isolated from apoptotic cells that induces DNA fragmentation in nuclei. Our evidence supports a model in which proteolytic activity functions upstream of CaM-KII. This kinase then leads to activation of AP24, which transmits signals to the nucleus to initiate DNA fragmentation.","['Wright, S C', 'Schellenberger, U', 'Ji, L', 'Wang, H', 'Larrick, J W']","['Wright SC', 'Schellenberger U', 'Ji L', 'Wang H', 'Larrick JW']","['The Palo Alto Institute of Molecular Medicine, Mountain View, California 94043, USA.']",['eng'],['CA68223/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (AP24 apoptotic protease)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*physiology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Serine Endopeptidases/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1997/09/01 00:00,1997/09/01 00:01,['1997/09/01 00:00'],"['1997/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1096/fasebj.11.11.9285482 [doi]'],ppublish,FASEB J. 1997 Sep;11(11):843-9. doi: 10.1096/fasebj.11.11.9285482.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plain radiographs at presentation were normal in most joints, whilst bone scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were positive.

Patients experiencing bone or joint pains while receiving high dose steroids as part of a chemotherapy regimen could be investigated by bone scintigraphy but MRI is preferable as it is more sensitive and specific for AVN. In this series of patients multiple joints were involved and all the male patients proceeded rapidly from bone infarction to joint collapse.

Specific inhibition of deoxyhypusine synthase leads to growth arrest and cell death. The precise cellular function of eIF-5A and the physiological significance of hypusine modification are not clear. Although the methionyl-puromycin synthesis has been suggested to be the functional assay for eIF-5A activity in vitro, the role of eIF-5A in protein synthesis has not been established. Recent studies have suggested that eIF-5A may be the cellular target of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev and human T cell leukemia virus type 1 Rex proteins. Motif analysis suggested that eIF-5A resembles a bimodular RNA-binding protein in that it contains a stretch of basic amino acids clustered at the N-terminal region and a leucine-rich stretch at the C-terminal region. Using Rev target RNA, RRE, as a model, we tested the hypothesis that eIF-5A may be an RNA-binding protein. We found that both deoxyhypusine and hypusine-containing eIF-5A can bind to the 252-nt RRE RNA, as determined by a gel mobility shift assay. In contrast, the unmodified eIF-5A precursor cannot. Deoxyhypusine-containing eIF-5A, but not its precursor, could also cause supershift of the Rev stem-loop IIB RRE complex. Preliminary studies also indicated that eIF-5A can bind to RNA such as U6 snRNA and that deoxyhypusine modification appears to be required for the binding. The ability of eIF-5A to directly interact with RNA suggests that deoxyhypusine formation of eIF-5A may be related to its role in RNA processing and protein synthesis. Our study also suggests the possibility of using a gel mobility shift assay for eIF-5A-RNA binding as a functional assay for deoxyhypusine and hypusine formation.","['Liu, Y P', 'Nemeroff, M', 'Yan, Y P', 'Chen, K Y']","['Liu YP', 'Nemeroff M', 'Yan YP', 'Chen KY']","['Department of Chemistry, Rutgers-State University of New Jersey 08855-0939, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA49695/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Biol Signals,Biological signals,9210083,"['0 (Gene Products, rev)', '0 (Peptide Initiation Factors)', '0 (RNA, Small Nuclear)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A)', '0 (rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '3874VXF092 (hypusine)', '82543-85-9 (deoxyhypusine)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Gene Products, rev/genetics/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Lysine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Peptide Initiation Factors/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Small Nuclear/*metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/*metabolism', '*RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Virus Replication/physiology', 'rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000109123 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Signals. 1997 May-Jun;6(3):166-74. doi: 10.1159/000109123.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interferon-alpha mRNA could not induce the expression of the env gene of HIV, and its expression was resistant to TAgRex.

In this study, the rearranged third complementarity-determining-region (CDR-III) of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) was used as a surrogate tumour marker for MRD evaluation. DNA obtained from marrows at diagnosis was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a pair of consensus primers. After 2 rounds of DNA amplification and polyacrylamide gel separation, the nucleotide sequences of 87.5% (21/24) consecutive children with B-lineage ALL were obtained by automated sequencing. There were between 1-4 rearrangements per patient. Although the J5 and J6 joining regions were preferentially used, the rearranged sequences were unique for all 25 sequences obtained. Oligoprobes to the DNJ region were constructed and quantitation in 7 patients showed a detection sensitivity of 1 leukaemic cell in 10(4) to 10(5) normal cells compared to 3 in 100 using conventional morphological criteria. Serial bone marrow showed progressive decrease in the quantity of leukaemic cells, and no leukaemic sequences were detected during cessation of therapy in 4/7 patients. One patient with detectable MRD, absconded treatment and eventually relapsed. These results are consistent with the need to eliminate the leukaemic clones below MRD detection levels before the end of therapy at 2 years.

In a serum-free medium with or without different cytokines, limbal fibroblasts consistently produced greater levels of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) transcript and protein than corneal fibroblasts, whereas corneal fibroblasts produced greater levels of hepatocyte growth factor/ scatter factor (HGF/SF) transcript and protein than limbal fibroblasts. Expression of HGF/SF transcript and protein was up-regulated mildly by epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), or platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-BB) but markedly by interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and was more pronounced in limbal than in corneal fibroblasts. Expression of KGF transcript was down-regulated by EGF, TGF-alpha, and PDGF-BB, was markedly up-regulated by IL-1 beta, and was more pronounced in limbal than in corneal fibroblasts. Expression of KGF protein was up-regulated markedly by IL-1 beta and moderately by PDGF-BB, especially in limbal fibroblasts. TGF-beta 1 uniquely turned off transcript and protein expression of HGF/SF and KGF in corneal fibroblasts. Although its transcript levels were similarly down-regulated in limbal fibroblasts, KGF protein levels were paradoxically up-regulated by TGF-beta 1 when added alone or with TGF-alpha or IL-1 beta. These data indicate that KGF and HGF/SF, two fibroblast-derived epithelial mitogens, are expressed differentially by limbal and corneal fibroblasts and are modulated by cytokines activated during epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, suggesting that they may play a different role in modulating corneal epithelial stem cells and transient amplifying cells.","['Li, D Q', 'Tseng, S C']","['Li DQ', 'Tseng SC']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, Miami, Florida 33101, USA.']",['eng'],['EY-06810/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (FGF7 protein, human)', '0 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 10)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor alpha)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '126469-10-1 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 7)', '1B56C968OA (Becaplermin)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Becaplermin', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cornea/cytology/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 10', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 7', '*Fibroblast Growth Factors', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Limbus Corneae/cytology/*metabolism', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis', 'Transforming Growth Factor alpha/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology']",1997/09/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/09/01 00:00'],"['1997/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199709)172:3<361::AID-JCP10>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199709)172:3<361::AID-JCP10>3.0.CO;2-9 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1997 Sep;172(3):361-72. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199709)172:3<361::AID-JCP10>3.0.CO;2-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arachidonic acid stimulated protein kinase C activity of erythroleukemia cells and promoted their adhesion, an effect that was also inhibited by dl-alpha-tocopherol. Introduction of a protein kinase C-neutralizing antibody or a protein kinase C-inhibitor substrate into permeabilized HEL cells inhibited phorbol ester-induced adhesion and shape change. dl-alpha-Tocopherol also affected the cellular distribution of protein kinase C, shifting the major portion of the enzyme to the cytosol fraction and reducing phorbol ester-induced membrane association of the enzyme.

The duration of symptoms at presentation in AML-TMDS was similar to those observed in de novo AML (p = 0.29). Hemoglobin values and platelet counts were similar in both groups of patients (p = 0.45, p = 0.44, respectively). However, peripheral white blood cell and neutrophil counts, as well as blast counts in AML-TMDS patients were lower than those observed in AML without TMDS patients (p < 0.001 for all of them). Bone marrow blast counts in de novo AML were higher than the values observed in AML-TMDS patients (p < 0.001). TMDS occurred predominantly in M2 and M6 FAB types, and was absent in the M3 type. Bone marrow histology showed no particular feature that could be of diagnostic relevance. The remission rates were similar in both groups of patients (p = 0.55). The same was true for the probability of disease-free survival and overall survival during the period of study (p = 0.50, p = 0.33, respectively). These results suggest that: 1) in AML-TMDS patients, leukemia transformation occurs in a more undifferentiated pluripotent stem cell, leading to a dysplastic residual hemopoiesis besides the blast proliferation; 2) the incidence of TMDS in our group of patients did not influence the clinical outcome after treatment of the disease.","['Lima, C S', 'Vassalo, J', 'Lorand-Metze, I', 'Bechelli, A P', 'Souza, C A']","['Lima CS', 'Vassalo J', 'Lorand-Metze I', 'Bechelli AP', 'Souza CA']","['Hematology and Hemotherapy Center, Faculty of Medical Sciences, State University of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Haematologia (Budap),Haematologia,0130266,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/pathology/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/pathology/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Prospective Studies']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologia (Budap). 1997;28(2):85-95.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In two out of 17 patients with RAEB in whom very high c-myc score values were found, acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL) was diagnosed 30 and 45 days later, respectively. Furthermore, we found high c-myc score values in three patients with RAEB and in two patients with RAEB-t during the ANLL phase which was diagnosed six to ten months after the initial study.

ES cells maintained an undifferentiated phenotype when cultured in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or with fibroblast feeder cells; > 90% of cells reacted positively to an antibody (ECMA-7) that marks undifferentiated ES cells. Using flow cytometry, high concentrations of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and NCAM antigens were detected on undifferentiated ES cells, but their specific receptors, Mac-1, LFA-1, and VLA-4, were not detected. There was also no class I or II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen expression. The ICAM-1 expressed was functional, since anti-ICAM-1 significantly (p < 0.0001) blocked ES cell-lymphocyte binding. Ig-CAM and MHC-1 expression on undifferentiated ES cells was not up-regulated by treatment of cells with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor alpha, or flavivirus infection, agents that up-regulate these molecules in other embryonic cell types. Twelve hours after LIF withdrawal, ICAM-1 and NCAM expression decreased significantly, while VCAM-1 was undetectable. However, morphology and ECMA-7 expression remained unchanged. Similar patterns of expression were seen on ES cells maintained on fibroblast feeder cells. This suggests that LIF or other cytokines may maintain the expression of Ig-CAMs on undifferentiated cells. Differentiation was induced by dimethyl sulfoxide treatment for 14 days. Cells changed from a colony-forming to a monolayer morphology, and approximately 60% of the cell population no longer expressed ECMA-7. In these cells, VCAM-1 was undetectable and ICAM-1 and NCAM had declined to low levels. In these differentiated cells, ICAM-1 and MHC-1 were inducible by IFN-gamma. This study suggests that the pattern of expression of the Ig-CAMs in ES cells may have a role in defining the phenotype of differentiated and undifferentiated cells.","['Tian, L', 'Catt, J W', ""O'Neill, C"", 'King, N J']","['Tian L', 'Catt JW', ""O'Neill C"", 'King NJ']","['Department of Pathology, University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulins/metabolism', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Stem Cells/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'West Nile virus/pathogenicity']",1997/09/01 00:00,1997/09/01 00:01,['1997/09/01 00:00'],"['1997/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1095/biolreprod57.3.561 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Reprod. 1997 Sep;57(3):561-8. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod57.3.561.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More (p < 0.05) 1/4 blastomeres developed to the blastocyst stage than did 1/8 blastomeres. In the serum-supplemented medium, the percentage of inner cell mass (ICM)/total cells in 8-cell- and 1/8-derived blastocysts was higher (p < 0.05) than that in 4-cell- and 1/4-derived embryos. Development to blastocysts was similar in BSA-supplemented and defined medium as compared to that in serum-enriched medium in intact 4-cell and 8-cell embryos, and 1/4 blastomeres. More (p < 0.05) 1/8 blastomeres developed to the blastocyst stage in serum-supplemented medium than in defined medium. The high hLIF concentration (1000 IU/ml) decreased (p < 0.05) blastocyst development in 1/4 blastomeres in defined medium, but fewer blastocysts (p > 0.05) lacked an ICM (blastocyst-like vesicles) than in defined medium without hLIF. It is concluded that 1) porcine intact embryos and isolated blastomeres can be cultured individually in defined medium up to the blastocyst stage from the 4-cell stage onwards; 2) more 1/4 isolated blastomeres develop to blastocysts with more total cells but with a lower ratio of ICM to total cells than blastocysts derived from 1/8 blastomeres; 3) the effects of hLIF are dependent on proteins present in the culture medium and on the embryonic stage; and 4) in defined medium, high concentrations of hLIF are inhibitory to blastocyst formation, but fewer blastocyst-like vesicles are formed.

Using a MPSV-based retroviral vector with hygromycin resistance gene as a selectable marker, we have studied retrovirus-mediated gene transfer of an immune costimulator, B7.1, into primary human acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells and the subsequent induction of immune costimulatory function. AML blasts from 10 patients were transduced by co-culture for 48 h with or without haemopoietic growth factors (HGFs). In the absence of HGFs, transduction efficiency (TE), as judged by % B7.1 expressing cells, was low, varying from 0.3 to 8.2% (median 1.5%). Addition of HGFs increased the median TE 1.8-fold with stem cell factor alone and 2.6-fold with SCF, interleukin-3 and GM-CSF. Effects on cell cycling alone could not explain this difference, suggesting other factors such as virus binding and promoter activity, are also involved. CFU-AL assays indicated a higher transduction efficiency of clonogenic cells, which was not improved by growth factors. Limited duration of cell growth prevented significant expansion of transduced populations by culture in the presence of hygromycin. Although not increasing transduction efficiency, CD34 enrichment enhanced drug selection, by targeting cells with the greatest self-renewal capacity. Immunoselection of B7.1 expressing cells produced transduced populations with 30-60% expressing B7.1. In an allogeneic mixed leukaemic cell/T lymphocyte reaction (MLLR) transduced AML cells enriched by immunoselection were able to stimulate allogeneic T cells (CD4 and CD8 positive), which could be inhibited by a solubilised B7 receptor, CTLA4.Ig. Our results demonstrate that using a replication incompetent retroviral vector, it is possible to introduce the immune costimulator B7.1 into primary AML-blasts and by immunoselection, enrich the transduced cells, which may be used for subsequent administration as an autologous cellular vaccine.","['Hirst, W J', 'Buggins, A', 'Darling, D', 'Gaken, J', 'Farzaneh, F', 'Mufti, G J']","['Hirst WJ', 'Buggins A', 'Darling D', 'Gaken J', 'Farzaneh F', 'Mufti GJ']","[""Departments of Haematological Medicine and Molecular, King's College School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, UK.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['B7-1 Antigen/*genetics', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-3/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', '*Retroviridae', 'Stem Cell Factor/therapeutic use', '*Transfection']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3300437 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 1997 Jul;4(7):691-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3300437.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Strong telomerase activity is found in progenitor stem cells and activated lymphocytes in vitro as well as in vivo, indicating that cells with high growth requirements can readily upregulate telomerase. Despite detection of telomerase activity, a gradual telomere erosion occurs in stem cells and lymphocytes, with significantly shortened telomeres at higher ages, a phenomenon that might be of importance for developing immunosenescence and exhausted haematopoiesis. In malignant haematopoietic disorders telomerase activity is a general finding with large differences in activity levels. The strongest telomerase expression has been shown in acute leukaemias and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, especially high grade cases. There are indications that the level of activity might parallel tumour progression and be of prognostic relevance, but studies of larger patient materials are needed. An association between the cell cycle and telomerase activity exists, especially for normal haematopoietic cells, and induction of a differentiation programme in immortalised cell lines downregulates telomerase activity. The expression of telomerase activity seems to be regulated at different levels, since for immature bone marrow cells the level of activity seemed to parallel better the phenotype than the proliferation state. The frequent expression of telomerase in leukaemias and lymphomas makes these disorders interesting targets for future anti-telomerase therapy.","['Norrback, K F', 'Roos, G']","['Norrback KF', 'Roos G']","['Department of Pathology, Umea University, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Hematopoietic Stem Cells/enzymology/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/enzymology/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'Telomere/*physiology']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0959-8049(97)00059-2 [pii]', '10.1016/S0959-8049(97)00059-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1997 Apr;33(5):774-80. doi: 10.1016/S0959-8049(97)00059-2.,57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Counterparts of both of these pathogenic human retroviruses have been identified in various simian species indigenous to Asia and Africa, including sooty mangabey monkeys (Cercocebus atys). Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a mangabey naturally infected with both SIV and STLV-I, T-cell lines were established and maintained continuously for more than 3 years; these cell lines harbored only a newly identified mangabey STLV-I(sm) or both STLV-I(sm) and the acutely lethal variant SIVsmmPBj14. The dually infected cell line (FEd-P14) was established by de novo infection of mangabey PBMC with SIVsmmPBj14. This cell line was characterized by multiple assays which showed that structural proteins encoded by both viruses were produced in large quantities, but that the predominant viral glycoprotein on the cell surface was the STLV-I(sm) Env. Unusual interactions of the two retroviral glycoproteins were suggested by the formation of syncytia between Raji and the FEd-P14 cells, but not between Raji and simian cells infected with only one retrovirus or human cells infected with HTLV-I. The STLV-I(sm) strain obtained from the sooty mangabey was transmitted to normal macaque and mangabey PBMC and was shown to be unique by sequencing of the entire env gene. STLV-I(sm) from this African species was more closely related to ""cosmopolitan"" HTLV-I strains than to the prototypic STLV-I from an Asian pig-tailed macaque. In vitro and in vivo studies of STLV-I(sm) and SIVsmm, both isolated from a naturally infected mangabey monkey, may provide insight into disease induction and manifestations associated with coinfection by their human counterparts.","['Fultz, P N', 'Su, L', 'May, P', 'West, J T']","['Fultz PN', 'Su L', 'May P', 'West JT']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama School of Medicine, Birmingham, Alabama, 35294, USA.']",['eng'],"['AI32377/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA67386/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-00165/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cercocebus atys', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Giant Cells/virology', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Alignment', '*Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/metabolism', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",1997/09/01 00:00,1997/09/01 00:01,['1997/09/01 00:00'],"['1997/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(97)98705-5 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1997.8705 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1997 Sep 1;235(2):271-85. doi: 10.1006/viro.1997.8705.,,,['GENBANK/U94516'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Using three-color flow cytometry, we examined immune changes in KD, especially previously unassessed markers of T-lymphocyte activation, memory, and adhesion. The percentage of cells positive for CD19, CD25, CD38, and CD71 was significantly lower during convalescence compared with pre-IVIG (medians: CD19, 18% vs 26%, P = 0.0004; CD25, 6% vs 9% for CD3(+) cells, P = 0.0074; CD38, 78% vs 89% for CD8(+) cells, P = 0.0015; CD71, 1% vs 6% for CD4(+) cells, P = 0.0024).

This release is known to be negatively regulated by Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL proteins. We show here that treatment of human leukemia cells HL60 with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) results in progressive increases in the levels of cellular antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1, a transient increase in Al protein level, but no increases in Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL proteins. The increase in Mcl-1 protein levels correlates with a reduced extent of apoptotic cell death induced by etoposide or the calcium ionophore A23187. The Mcl-1 protein is primarily localized in the mitochondria, and etoposide- or A23187-induced cytochrome c release is reduced in cells in which the mitochondria contain the Mcl-1 protein demonstrable by immunoblots. Raf-1 protein can also be detected in the mitochondrial fractions that contain Mcl-1 protein but not in the Mcl-1-negative fractions. These findings suggest that in these promyelocytic leukemia cells Mcl-1 has a function analogous to that of Bcl-2 in other cells, i.e., to target Raf-1 to mitochondria and to reduce cell damage-induced release of mitochondrial cytochrome c. Our findings provide a potential mechanism for the antiapoptotic action of 1,25D3 and show that differentiation and apoptosis signaling pathways not only interact but involve a proliferation-associated gene, Raf-1.","['Wang, X', 'Studzinski, G P']","['Wang X', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, 185 South Orange Avenue, Newark, New Jersey 07103, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA 44722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/biosynthesis', 'Cytochrome c Group/*metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Enzyme Precursors/biosynthesis', 'Etoposide/toxicity', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Kinetics', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Multigene Family', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf', 'bcl-X Protein']",1997/08/25 00:00,1997/08/25 00:01,['1997/08/25 00:00'],"['1997/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(97)93667-3 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1997.3667 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1997 Aug 25;235(1):210-7. doi: 10.1006/excr.1997.3667.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike an apoptotic fragmentation of nuclear DNA, the formation of HMW-DNA fragments in nonapoptotic cells is rapidly induced, has no correlation with the cell death, and is not associated with the development of oligonucleosomal ""ladder"" or apoptotic changes in nuclear morphology. The disintegration of DNA into HMW-fragments is also observed in nuclei isolated from healthy, nonapoptosizing tissues of various eukaryotes. We show that the formation of HMW-DNA fragments in the absence of apoptotic inducers is strongly dependent on the ionic detergents, is responsive to the topoisomerase II-specific poison, teniposide, and is completely reversible under conditions that favor topoisomerase II-dependent rejoining reaction. Also, we demonstrate that the formation of HMW-DNA fragments in continuously growing cell lines caused either by serum deprivation or monolayer establishment is of a transient nature and rapidly reverses to the control level following serum addition or dilution of monolayer. The results suggest that the cleavage of nuclear DNA into HMW-DNA fragments is associated not only with apoptosis but also accompanies changes in functional activity of nonapoptotic cells.","[""Solov'yan, V T"", 'Andreev, I O', 'Kolotova, T Y', 'Pogribniy, P V', 'Tarnavsky, D T', 'Kunakh, V A']","[""Solov'yan VT"", 'Andreev IO', 'Kolotova TY', 'Pogribniy PV', 'Tarnavsky DT', 'Kunakh VA']","['Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics, National Academy of Science of Ukraine, Kyiv, 252627, Ukraine.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/analysis/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/*physiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Weight', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Teniposide/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/25 00:00,1997/08/25 00:01,['1997/08/25 00:00'],"['1997/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(97)93651-X [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1997.3651 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1997 Aug 25;235(1):130-7. doi: 10.1006/excr.1997.3651.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ceramide is formed as a result of sphingomyelinase (SMase) activation in the sphingomyelin cycle, and ligation of TNF and Fas receptors has been reported to stimulate SMase activity. We have studied the effects of D609, a xanthogenate compound with antitumoral properties, on TNF- or Fas-induced apoptosis of monocytic U937 cells. First, the effects of D609 on SMase activity were assessed using in vitro assays for neutral and acidic SMase, and the results suggested that D609 caused a modest stimulation of the activity of both SMases in U937 cells. Exposure of U937 cells for 6 h to TNF or anti-Fas mAb induced apoptosis in 40-45% of the cells, as measured by fluorescent staining of nuclear chromatin. Cotreatment with D609 potentiated TNF- as well as Fas-mediated apoptosis up to 70 and 90%, respectively. Furthermore, in incubations with D609 alone, 60% of the cells became apoptotic within 16 h. Since D609 has been reported to inhibit protein kinase C (PKC) activity, the effect of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) on D609-induced apoptosis was investigated. PMA was found to inhibit D609-induced apoptosis in U937 cells as well as cell death induced by TNF and anti-Fas mAb. Thus, PKC inactivation may play an important role in the regulation of apoptosis in U937 cells. In summary, the present results show that D609 stimulates SMase activity, potentiates TNF- and Fas-induced apoptosis, and induces apoptosis on its own in U937 cells.","['Porn-Ares, M I', 'Chow, S C', 'Slotte, J P', 'Orrenius, S']","['Porn-Ares MI', 'Chow SC', 'Slotte JP', 'Orrenius S']","['Division of Toxicology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, 17177, Sweden.

Cell shrinkage was evident as early as 12 h, while cell death was not evident until after 24 h. It mounted rapidly after that, and by 72 h, virtually all cells were dead. Electron microscopic analysis shows that by 24 h after treatment and before the onset of cell death, early ultrastructural features typical of apoptosis were present. DNA breaks were detected by TUNEL assay prior to the onset of cell death. Two types of specific DNA pieces often associated with apoptosis were found as increasing numbers of cells died.

The polyamines inhibited MAT II activity at concentrations equal to or greater than 5 mm. Combinations of polyamines were more effective than individual polyamines in inhibiting MAT activity; maximum inhibition approached 80% with combinations of all three polyamines. S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), Pi, and PPi, the products of the MAT reaction, are known to be synergistic inhibitors of the nonhepatic form of the enzyme. Combinations of polyamines plus Pi and/or PPi induced an additive inhibition of the enzyme. AdoMet plus polyamines also resulted in significant inhibition, but inhibition plateaued at about 80%, indicating the presence of a protective mechanism to maintain AdoMet synthesis. Extrahepatic MAT from human and rat tissues was inhibited by the polyamines, indicating that this phenomenon is not species specific. In addition, we examined the effect of polyamines on MAT activity in resting and activated human lymphocytes that were shown to differ in the relative expression of MAT II subunits. Although MAT from mitogen (phytohemagglutinin, PHA)- and superantigen (Staphylococcal enterotoxin B, SEB)-stimulated lymphocytes were similarly inhibited by 10 mM polyamines, at lower concentrations of polyamines (1-5 mM), MAT from SEB-stimulated cells appeared to be more susceptible to inhibition by the polyamines. Inasmuch as SEB is a more physiological stimulator of T cells than PHA, the data suggest a possible role of polyamines in regulating MAT activity.","['Geller, A M', 'Legros, H L', 'Wherry, K', 'Kotb, M Y']","['Geller AM', 'Legros HL', 'Wherry K', 'Kotb MY']","['Department of Biochemistry, The University of Tennessee, Memphis, Tennessee 38163, USA. ageller@physio1.utmem.edu']",['eng'],"['EY06540/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM54892-06/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Polyamines)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', 'EC 2.5.1.6 (Methionine Adenosyltransferase)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Lens, Crystalline/enzymology', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Methionine Adenosyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Phosphates/pharmacology', 'Polyamines/*pharmacology', 'Putrescine/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Retina/enzymology', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/pharmacology', 'Spermidine/pharmacology', 'Spermine/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology']",1997/09/01 00:00,1997/09/01 00:01,['1997/09/01 00:00'],"['1997/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(97)90216-2 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1997.0216 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1997 Sep 1;345(1):97-102. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1997.0216.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, a relation between cancer of the cervix and this retrovirus has been described. A recent study has demonstrated a low prevalence of HTLV-I/II infection in Yucatan, Mexico. However, cancer of the cervix is the most frequent oncological disease in this region. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between cancer of the cervix and the HTLV-I/II infection. Sera from 123 patients with cancer of the cervix and 662 healthy women were screened for antibodies against HTLV-I/II by ELISA and agglutination test (PA). Results were confirmed by Western blot (WB). In the confirmed cases the differentiation between HTLV-I and HTLV-II was made by synthetic peptides. Only one woman (0.8%) had positive results in the patients group and two women (0.3%) had reactivity in the control group. In all these cases the antibodies were positive for HTLV-II. The prevalence in the group of patients with cancer of the cervix was similar to that of the control group. We therefore concluded that in Yucatan, Mexico there is no relation between HTLV-I/II infection and cancer of the cervix.","['Gongora-Biachi, R A', 'Gonzalez-Martinez, P', 'Castro-Sansores, C', 'Bastarrachea-Ortiz, J']","['Gongora-Biachi RA', 'Gonzalez-Martinez P', 'Castro-Sansores C', 'Bastarrachea-Ortiz J']","['Laboratorio de Hematologia, Centro de Investigaciones Regionales Dr. Hideyo Noguchi, Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan, Merida, Mexico.']",['spa'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Mexico,Ginecol Obstet Mex,Ginecologia y obstetricia de Mexico,0376552,['0 (Deltaretrovirus Antibodies)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Deltaretrovirus Antibodies/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*epidemiology', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Uterine Neoplasms/*epidemiology']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ginecol Obstet Mex. 1997 Apr;65:141-4.,,,,,,,,,"Infeccion por virus linfotropico de celulas T humanas tipo I/II en pacientes con cancer cervicouterino de la peninsula de Yucatan, Mexico.",,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT scans were obtained 1 week or less before bronchoscopic sampling or biopsy in 48 pediatric patients (age range, 8 months to 18 years at diagnosis) undergoing treatment for leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloproliferative disease. Radiographs were obtained less than 1 week before CT. Pulmonary complications comprised fungal (n = 11), viral (n = 4), and bacterial (n = 5) pneumonias; cryptogenic organizing pneumonia ([COP] n = 4); and pulmonary tumor (n = 4). Chest radiographs and CT scans were rated independently by three radiologists who were unaware of these diagnoses. RESULTS: Satisfactory diagnostic accuracy, defined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, was noted for fungal pneumonia (radiography, ROC area = 0.82; CT, ROC area = 0.78), COP (radiography, ROC area = 0.75; CT, ROC area = 0.75), and pulmonary tumor (radiography, ROC area = 0.73; CT, ROC area = 0.83). Generalizability was good for fungal pneumonia (radiography, generalizability coefficient [GC] = 0.84; CT, GC = 0.84) and COP (radiography, GC = 0.75; CT, GC = 0.99).

In this study, we used several complementary methods to detect a cluster and to conduct an initial investigation regarding its cause. The analyses included three stages, and were based on the time interval between consecutive diagnoses. First, we applied the sets monitoring technique to detect clustering. Following the detection (alarm), a confirmatory analysis was conducted in order to confirm or refute it as a true alarm. We applied this analysis to the first five cases diagnosed subsequent to the alarm. With a graphical display of the temporal pattern of the diagnoses, we considered the possible causes leading to the cluster. The data included registered diagnoses of leukaemia cases made from 1960 to 1990 among residents of Ashkelon, Israel. Clustering was detected for acute lymphatic leukaemia and for chronic myeloid leukaemia. We found that the temporal patterns of the diagnoses consistent with the possibility that these two clusters are due to exposure to a common local carcinogen.

My standard of evidence, called the persuasion probability, is based on the Bayesian posterior probability that the experimental treatment is superior to the standard.

Two genetically distinct isoforms have been discovered, COX-1 and COX-2. While COX-1 is thought to account for homeostatic amounts of eicosanoids, COX-2 is induced during inflammation leading to pathologic amounts of eicosanoids. Since NSAIDs inhibit both COX isoforms, antiinflammatory drug research has refocused to discovering COX-2 inhibitors that do not inhibit COX-1. For this purpose, we have developed a whole cell assay system using the human erythroleukemic cell line HEL as a source for COX-1 and the human monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 as a source for COX-2. Mono Mac 6 cells express high amounts of COX-2 upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the absence of any detectable COX-1 protein. On the other hand, we find HEL cells to naturally express COX-1 protein, but not COX-2. Testing of a panel of NSAIDs as well as some COX-2 specific inhibitors showed that this assay system is suitable for identifying compounds that selectively inhibit either COX-1 or COX-2. This test system offers the advantage of assessing COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors within the human species, within a similar test set-up, and circumvents the need for tedious purification of either platelets or peripheral blood monocytes.","['Berg, J', 'Christoph, T', 'Widerna, M', 'Bodenteich, A']","['Berg J', 'Christoph T', 'Widerna M', 'Bodenteich A']","['Department of Pharmacology, Topcro Pharma Research GmbH, Linz, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods,Journal of pharmacological and toxicological methods,9206091,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '54397-85-2 (Thromboxane B2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 1)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*toxicity', 'Arachidonic Acid/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclooxygenase 1', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Monocytes', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/*biosynthesis', 'Thromboxane B2/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1056-8719(97)00016-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s1056-8719(97)00016-6 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods. 1997 Jun;37(4):179-86. doi: 10.1016/s1056-8719(97)00016-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was carried out to determine the trends in premature mortality due to selected causes in Italy. METHODS: Data from the Italian Mortality Data Base, for the ten years from 1984 to 1993 (the first decade of the AIDS epidemic) were analysed. Premature mortality was measured in terms of years of potential life lost before the age of 70 years (YPLL), excluding infant mortality. Trends in premature mortality due to AIDS were compared with those of the principal causes of premature death: lung cancer, colon-rectum cancer, stomach cancer, leukaemia, female breast cancer, uterine cancer, myocardial infarction, stroke, liver diseases, suicide, road accidents and overdose. RESULTS: In this period there has been a marked increase in premature mortality from AIDS both among males aged 1-69 years (from a rate of YPLL of 0.01 per 1000 in 1984 to 3.71 in 1993) and females of the same age group (from 0 deaths in 1984 to a rate of YPLL of 1.02). Throughout the same period all the other causes of premature death have been declining, with the exception of suicide and overdose among males, and overdose and lung cancer among females. For people aged 25-44 years, AIDS has become the greatest cause of premature death. The increasing trend in premature mortality due to AIDS is most pronounced in the northern and central areas of Italy. CONCLUSIONS: AIDS is the leading cause of death among males aged 25-44 years in Italy and is having an important impact on premature mortality among females in the same age group.","['Conti, S', 'Masocco, M', 'Farchi, G', 'Rezza, G', 'Toccaceli, V']","['Conti S', 'Masocco M', 'Farchi G', 'Rezza G', 'Toccaceli V']","['Laboratory of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*mortality', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cause of Death/trends', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality/trends', 'Population Surveillance']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ije/26.4.873 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 1997 Aug;26(4):873-9. doi: 10.1093/ije/26.4.873.,,,,,,,,,,,"['IND: RH79118', 'POP: 00270888']",['PIP'],"['*Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', '*Age Specific Death Rate', '*Causes Of Death', 'Death Rate', 'Demographic Factors', 'Developed Countries', 'Diseases', 'Europe', '*Geographic Factors', 'Hiv Infections', 'Italy', 'Mediterranean Countries', 'Mortality', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Population Dynamics', '*Premature Mortality', '*Sex Factors', 'Southern Europe', 'Viral Diseases']",['PIP: TJ: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY'],

We used this clone, designated pSA-17, as a probe restriction enzyme and Southern blot analyses to examine the arrangement of homologous sequences in BALB/c deoxyribonucleic acid (endogenous Abelson sequences). The endogenous Abelson sequences within the mouse genome were interrupted by noncoding regions, suggesting that a rearrangement of the cell sequences was required to produce the sequence found in the virus. Endogenous Abelson sequences were arranged similarly in mice that were susceptible to A-MuLV tumors and in mice that were resistant to A-MuLV tumors. An examination of three BALB/c plasmacytomas and a BALB/c early B-cell tumor likewise revealed no alteration in the arrangement of the endogenous Abelson sequences. Homology to pSA-17 was also observed in deoxyribonucleic acids prepared from rat, hamster, chicken, and human cells.

The proportion of cells containing hemoglobin was relatively high (> 25%) in newly isolated cell lines derived from CFU-FV-P colonies, whereas cell lines derived from CFU-FV-A colonies had only low levels (0 to 2%) of hemoglobin-containing cells. A high proportion of the cell lines derived from CFU-FV-A colonies responded to pure erythropoietin and accumulated spectrin and hemoglobin, whereas the cell lines derived from CFU-FV-P colonies did not. A cytogenetic analysis indicated that primary CFU-FV-P colony cells were diploid, whereas chromosomal aberrations were observed in the immediate progeny of CFU-FV-A. The presence of unique chromosomal markers in the majority of the cells within individual colonies derived from CFU-FV-A suggested that these colonies originated from single cells. Finally, leukemic progenitor cells transformed by strain FV-A appeared to have an extensive capacity to self-renew (i.e., form secondary colonies in methylcellulose), whereas a significant proportion of the corresponding cells transformed by strain FV-P did not. In addition, the self-renewal capacity of both CFU-FV-A and CFU-FV-P increased as the disease progressed. From these observations, we propose a model for the multistage nature of Friend disease; this model involves clonal evolution and expansion from a differentiating population with limited proliferative capacity to a population with a high capacity for self-renewal and proliferation.","['Mager, D', 'MacDonald, M E', 'Robson, I B', 'Mak, T W', 'Bernstein, A']","['Mager D', 'MacDonald ME', 'Robson IB', 'Mak TW', 'Bernstein A']","['Ontario Cancer Institute, University of Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Clone Cells', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1981/08/01 00:00,1981/08/01 00:01,['1981/08/01 00:00'],"['1981/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.1.8.721-730.1981 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1981 Aug;1(8):721-30. doi: 10.1128/mcb.1.8.721-730.1981.,,PMC369352,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of THP-1 cells with Bryostatin 1 (bryo 1), a potent protein kinase C (PKC) activator, caused a major fraction of them to become adherent (AD) with distinct monocyte/macrophage characteristics. The differentiation was associated with an enhanced expression of M-CSFR and fyn tyrosine kinase activity, occurring primarily on cells in the AD fraction. Scatchard plot analysis showed that the enhanced expression of M-CSFR binding activity was due to an increase in total receptor number per AD cell, rather than an increase in the binding affinity. Fyn antisense (AS) phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (s-oligos) inhibited the up-regulation of both M-CSFR and c-fms transcripts in bryo 1-treated THP-1 cells. In contrast, fyn sense s-oligos did not affect the up-regulation of either M-CSFR or c-fms mRNA in bryo 1-treated cells. In addition, fyn AS s-oligos blocked the expression of AD capacity in bryo 1-treated THP-1 cells. The efficacy of fyn AS s-oligos as macromolecular inhibitors was verified by their ability to lower fyn-associated tyrosine kinase and in vitro autophosphorylation activity in bryo 1-treated THP-1 cells. Taken together, our results show a strong correlation between M-CSFR expression and monocytic differentiation in THP-1 cells, and suggest a possible role of c-fyn tyrosine kinase in mediating these processes.","['Li, Y', 'Chen, B']","['Li Y', 'Chen B']","['Department of Immunology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['AI 23499/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 73212/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FYN protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn)']",IM,"['Bryostatins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lactones/pharmacology', 'Macrolides', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Up-Regulation']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212697000040 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00004-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1997 Jun;21(6):539-47. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00004-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analysis of cell surface antigens and ploidy showed that AP-217 was an erythro-megakaryocytic cell line. The effects of inducers of differentiation were studied and focused on retinoic acid (RA). Uninduced AP-217 cells produced a low level of hemoglobin (Hb) that showed a moderate but significant dose-dependent increase after 13 cis-RA induction (four times above the control at 10(-5) M). To outline this effect, AP-217 cells were cloned at limiting dilution. A subclone (clone 2) was isolated which expressed glycophorin A on 12% of cells, and showed a marked sensitivity to RA. After a 4 day induction with increasing concentrations of RA (1-10 x 10(-6) M) Hb production by clone 2 cells was enhanced 12 times over the control at the highest concentration (10(-5) M). No effect of RA on the Hb production of K-562 and HEL was observed. This increased Hb production occurred simultaneously with a growth inhibition in clonogenic cultures (20% reduction) associated with a drastic reduction of the colony size. Moreover, we demonstrated the expression of mRNA for the beta globin gene in clone 2 and AP-217-cells.

The proteins and enzymatic activities thus far identified to co-purify with the leukemia cell DNA synthesome include the DNA polymerases alpha and delta, DNA primase, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), replication factor C (RF-C), replication protein A (RP-A), and DNA topoisomerases I and II. We have demonstrated that the DNA synthesome is fully competent to replicate simian virus 40 (SV40) replication origin containing DNA in vitro in the presence of the viral large T-antigen. This result implies that all of the cellular activities required for large T-antigen-dependent in vitro SV40 DNA synthesis are present in the isolated human leukemia cell DNA synthesome. Since SV40 is extensively dependent on the host cell's DNA synthetic machinery for its own DNA replication, our results indicate that the isolated leukemia cell DNA synthesome may play a role not only in viral DNA synthesis but also in human leukemia cell DNA replication. We recently proposed a model to represent the DNA synthesome that was isolated from HeLa and murine cells. Our data indicate that the organization of the DNA synthesome from HL-60 cells also fits this proposed model. The purified DNA synthesome will not only allow the further study of the molecular mechanisms required to carry out human leukemia cell DNA replication, but may also provide a tool for eventually dissecting some of the regulatory controls of the cell's DNA synthetic machinery.","['Lin, S', 'Hickey, R J', 'Malkas, L H']","['Lin S', 'Hickey RJ', 'Malkas LH']","['Toxicology Program, University of Maryland at Baltimore 21201, USA.']",['eng'],['CA57350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA synthesome)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Chromatography, Ion Exchange', '*DNA Replication', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*isolation & purification/metabolism']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212696001038 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00103-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1997 Jun;21(6):501-12. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00103-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: In hyperkalaemic AL patients, after basal blood collection for cortisol, rapid adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test was performed with human a1-24-ACTH 0.25 mg, intravenously. Sixty minutes following injection, additional plasma was obtained for cortisol. Normal response was a peak cortisol level greater than 15 micrograms dL-1 with an increment greater than 5 micrograms dL-1. SETTING: Hacettepe University Hospital, Ankara, Turkey. SUBJECTS: Newly diagnosed AL patients with plasma K+ values exceeding 4.5 mmol L-1, who had never received antileukaemia therapy were eligible for entry into the trial. Thirteen patients fulfilled these criteria. Twenty AL patients with normal serum K+ levels were studied as controls. RESULTS: In six patients with hyperkalaemia, adrenal cortical response to rapid ACTH test was inadequate. One patient died during induction chemotherapy due to sepsis. Five of the remaining patients entered remission. Repeat ACTH tests during remission revealed normalization of the adrenocortical function in these patients. However, in only one patient with normal serum K+ level, adrenocortical reserve was decreased. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that in any AL patient with hyperkalaemia, adrenal reserve function should be evaluated with rapid ACTH stimulation test. In states of resistant hypotension and hyperkalaemia, steroids may be life saving.","['Demiroglu, H', 'Dundar, S']","['Demiroglu H', 'Dundar S']","['Department of Haematology, Hacettepe University Medical School, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Intern Med,Journal of internal medicine,8904841,"['9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex/*physiopathology', 'Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/administration & dosage', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/blood/*deficiency', 'Hyperkalemia/*blood/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2796.1997.00154.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Intern Med. 1997 Aug;242(2):111-5. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2796.1997.00154.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In newborn animals in which CNTF is not yet expressed, exogenous CNTF that is locally administered very effectively protects motoneurons from degeneration by axotomy. To evaluate whether endogenous CNTF, released after nerve injury from the cytosol of Schwann cells, supports motoneuron survival, we transected the facial nerve in 4-week-old pmn mice. In this mouse mutant a rapidly progressing degenerative disease of motoneurons starts by the third postnatal week at the hindlimbs and progresses to the anterior parts of the body, leading to death by the seventh to eighth week. Apoptotic death of motoneurons can be observed during this period, as revealed by TUNEL staining. In 6-week-old unlesioned pmn mice approximately 40% of facial motoneurons have degenerated. Facial nerve lesion dramatically increased the number of surviving motoneurons in pmn mice. This protective effect was absent in pmn mice lacking endogenous CNTF. Quantitative analysis of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) mRNA expression revealed that the dramatic upregulation seen in wild-type mice after peripheral nerve lesion did not occur in pmn mice. Therefore, endogenous LIF cannot compensate for the lack of CNTF in pmn crossbred with CNTF knock-out mice. Thus, endogenous CNTF released from lesioned Schwann cells supports the survival of axotomized motoneurons under conditions in which motoneurons are in the process of rapid degeneration.","['Sendtner, M', 'Gotz, R', 'Holtmann, B', 'Thoenen, H']","['Sendtner M', 'Gotz R', 'Holtmann B', 'Thoenen H']","['Clinical Research Unit for Neuroregeneration, Department of Neurology, University of Wurzburg, D-97080 Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Axons/*physiology', 'Cell Survival', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Facial Nerve/metabolism', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Motor Neurons/*metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Sciatic Nerve/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",1997/09/15 00:00,1997/09/15 00:01,['1997/09/15 00:00'],"['1997/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Neurosci. 1997 Sep 15;17(18):6999-7006.,,PMC6573270,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) encodes a transcription factor with nine Kruppel-like zinc fingers, seven of which are retained in the t(11;17) fusion protein RARalpha-PLZF. We identified a specific DNA-binding site for the PLZF protein and showed that PLZF binds to this site through its most carboxyl seven zinc fingers. In co-transfection experiments, PLZF repressed transcription through its cognate binding site. This repression function of PLZF was mapped to two regions on the protein, including the evolutionarily conserved POZ domain. In contrast, the RARalpha-PLZF protein activated transcription of a promoter containing a PLZF response element. These results suggest that RARalpha-PLZF, generated in acute promyelocytic leukemia, is an aberrant transcription factor that can deregulate the expression of PLZF target genes and contribute to leukemogenesis.","['Li, J Y', 'English, M A', 'Ball, H J', 'Yeyati, P L', 'Waxman, S', 'Licht, J D']","['Li JY', 'English MA', 'Ball HJ', 'Yeyati PL', 'Waxman S', 'Licht JD']","['Brookdale Center for Developmental and Molecular Biology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029, USA.']",['eng'],['CA 59936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic', '*Zinc Fingers']",1997/09/05 00:00,1997/09/05 00:01,['1997/09/05 00:00'],"['1997/09/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.36.22447 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)65914-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Sep 5;272(36):22447-55. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.36.22447.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Schiff base-forming molecules that mimic the natural carbonyl donor potently enhance immune responses and provide the first mechanism-based, orally active immunopotentiatory agents. In the present study, costimulation by the Schiff base-forming molecule tucaresol was investigated at the level of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in T cell lines. Both TCR-directed stimulation by anti-CD3 and Schiff base stimulation by tucaresol produced a distinct mobility shift in MAPK, characterized by direct immunoblotting of cell lysate proteins subjected to SDS-PAGE, that corresponded with increased phosphorylation. Combined TCR-CD3 and tucaresol stimulation substantially enhanced and prolonged the MAPK response, providing a biochemical basis for the costimulatory nature of the pathway utilized by Schiff base signaling. The MAPK affected was identified by immunoprecipitation as ERK2. Both the direct effects and the TCR signal-enhancing effects of tucaresol on MAPK activation were also demonstrated in a functional MAPK assay measuring substrate phosphorylation. Borohydride reduction of tucaresol's Schiff base-forming carbonyl group abolished both enhancement of MAPK phosphorylation and IL-2 production, as did a selective inhibitor of the MAPKK, MEK1. Tucaresol had no effect on TCR-mediated rises in intracellular free Ca2+ or inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate generation, while tucaresol signaling occurred normally in the lck-deficient J.CaM1.6 T cell line, consistent with convergence of tucaresol- and TCR-induced signals downstream of early TCR-mediated events.","['Chen, H', 'Hall, S', 'Heffernan, B', 'Thompson, N T', 'Rogers, M V', 'Rhodes, J']","['Chen H', 'Hall S', 'Heffernan B', 'Thompson NT', 'Rogers MV', 'Rhodes J']","['Immunology Unit, Glaxo Wellcome Medicines Research Centre, Stevenage, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Benzaldehydes)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Borohydrides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Muromonab-CD3)', '0 (Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Schiff Bases)', '87L0B9CPPA (sodium borohydride)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'JH368G5B9M (tucaresol)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Benzaldehydes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Benzoates/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Borohydrides/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*physiology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Muromonab-CD3/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Potassium/metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell/drug effects/*immunology', 'Schiff Bases', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Sodium/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/09/01 00:00,1997/09/01 00:01,['1997/09/01 00:00'],"['1997/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1997 Sep 1;159(5):2274-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regulated IL-12 production is crucial for the generation of protective Th1 responses to infectious agents. In contrast, IL-12 excess contributes to the pathogenesis of a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. To further understand the processes regulating IL-12 production, we determined whether IL-11 regulated monocyte/macrophage production of this cytokine moiety. IL-11 did not alter the IL-12 (p70) production of unstimulated THP-1 monocytic cells or human blood monocytes. It did, however, inhibit, in a dose-dependent fashion, the IL-12 production of IFN-gamma plus Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain 1-stimulated THP-1 cells and stimulated blood monocytes. This inhibition of IL-12 protein production was associated with a proportionate decrease in IL-12 p35 and p40 mRNA accumulation. Nuclear run-on assays revealed comparable decreases in IL-12 p35 and p40 gene transcription. IL-11 did not similarly regulate monocyte/macrophage production of IL-8 or macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) and IL-6 did not similarly inhibit IL-12 elaboration. These studies demonstrate that IL-11 is a potent inhibitor of monocyte/macrophage IL-12 production and that this inhibitory effect is, at least in part, transcriptionally mediated. They also demonstrate that this inhibition is not the result of a generalized suppression of macrophage effector function and that the ability to inhibit monocyte/macrophage IL-12 production is not a generalized property of all IL-6-type cytokines.","['Leng, S X', 'Elias, J A']","['Leng SX', 'Elias JA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['AI-34953/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-36708/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-54989/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Depression, Chemical', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-11/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-12/*biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics', 'Interleukins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/09/01 00:00,1997/09/01 00:01,['1997/09/01 00:00'],"['1997/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1997 Sep 1;159(5):2161-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation-induced cell death is thought to involve CD95/CD95 ligand interactions in vivo. Here we report that stimulated, CD45RO+ human T cell lines specific for myelin basic protein or tetanus toxoid from multiple sclerosis patients and healthy individuals resist apoptosis induced by soluble recombinant CD95 ligand in vitro. In contrast, the same CD95 ligand effectively kills Jurkat T lymphoma and human malignant glioma cells. The resistance of the T cell lines is not due to a lack of CD95 expression at the cell surface and is not overcome by coexposure to CD95 ligand and inhibitors of RNA or protein synthesis. The expression level of BCL-2 is lower in Jurkat than in Ag-specific T cells. After exposure to soluble CD95 ligand, Jurkat T cells, but not Ag-specific T cells, exhibit loss of BCL-2 and BCL-X expression whereas BAX expression is not affected. Surprisingly, Ag-specific T cells are rather sensitive to CD95 ligand expressed at the cell surface of N2A neuroblastoma cells. Accessory molecules expressed by the CD95 ligand-expressing effector cell are dispensable for apoptosis since the T cells are equally sensitive to agonistic APO-1 Ab. Further studies are required to determine whether resistance to soluble CD95 ligand-mediated apoptosis is a possible escape mechanism for T cells from peripheral deletion that may have relevance for autoimmune disorders.","['Zipp, F', 'Martin, R', 'Lichtenfels, R', 'Roth, W', 'Dichgans, J', 'Krammer, P H', 'Weller, M']","['Zipp F', 'Martin R', 'Lichtenfels R', 'Roth W', 'Dichgans J', 'Krammer PH', 'Weller M']","['Department of Neurology, University of Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*immunology/pathology', 'Autoimmunity', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Drug Resistance', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Glioma/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Multiple Sclerosis/immunology/pathology', 'Neuroblastoma/pathology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Prednisolone/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein', 'fas Receptor/immunology/physiology']",1997/09/01 00:00,1997/09/01 00:01,['1997/09/01 00:00'],"['1997/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1997 Sep 1;159(5):2108-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparable analysis of p53 status with sensitivity to oxidative stress induced by photodynamic therapy has not been reported. In the current study we examined photosensitivity in human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells exhibiting either wild-type p53, mutated p53 or deleted p53 expression. Experiments were performed using a purpurin, tin ethyl etiopurpurin (SnET2)-, or a porphyrin, Photofrin (PH)-based photosensitizer. Total SnET2 accumulation was comparable in all three cell lines. Uptake of PH was highest in cells expressing wild-type p53 but incubation conditions could be adjusted to achieve equivalent cellular PH levels during experiments that analyzed photosensitivity. Survival measurements demonstrated that HL60 cells expressing wild-type p53 were more sensitive to PH- and SnET2-mediated photosensitization, as well as to UVC irradiation, when compared to HL60 cells exhibiting deleted or mutated p53 phenotypes. A rapid apoptotic response was observed following purpurin- and porphyrin-induced photosensitization in all cell lines. Results of this study indicate that photosensitivity is increased in HL60 cells expressing wild-type p53 and that photosensitizer-mediated oxidative stress can induce apoptosis through a p53-independent mechanism in HL60 cells.","['Fisher, A M', 'Danenberg, K', 'Banerjee, D', 'Bertino, J R', 'Danenberg, P', 'Gomer, C J']","['Fisher AM', 'Danenberg K', 'Banerjee D', 'Bertino JR', 'Danenberg P', 'Gomer CJ']","['Clayton Ocular Oncology Center, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01-CA-60859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37-CA-31230/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (Porphyrins)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '466G63QE7G (tin etiopurpurin)']",IM,"['Cell Survival', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Porphyrins/metabolism', '*Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1751-1097.1997.tb08653.x [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1997 Aug;66(2):265-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-1097.1997.tb08653.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This result has been achieved using a time-gated video camera and a suitable mathematical processing that led to the so-called ""lifetime images."" Extensive experimental tests have been performed on mice bearing the MS-2 fibrosarcoma or the L1210 leukemia. Lifetime images of mice show that the fluorescence decay of HpD is appreciably slower in the tumor than in healthy tissues nearby, allowing a reliable detection of the neoplasia. The lengthening of the lifetime in tumors depends little on the drug dose, which in our experiments could be lowered down to 0.1 mg/kg body weight, still allowing a definite tumor detection. In order to ascertain the results achieved with the imaging apparatus, high-resolution spectroscopy, based on a time-correlated single photon counting system, has also been performed to measure the fluorescence lifetime of the drug inside the tumor and outside.
