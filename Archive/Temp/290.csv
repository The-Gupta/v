At higher concentrations, reduced ricin was even more toxic than native ricin.

Their stability and solubility in organic solvents are increased by forming crown ether complexes. While E and Z forms are configurationally stable in solution the Z form cyclizes at greater than or equal to -20 degrees C to a 1,2,3-oxadiazoline. The E isomers cross-link DNA, in contrast to the Z isomers. However, both E and Z (2'chloroethyl)thioethyldiazotates (neither of which may cyclize) cross-link DNA extremely efficiently.

The overall mean NK activity of both the mononuclear and T cell fractions was reduced compared to that of normal controls (466 lytic units (lu) v 573 lu and 226 lu v 381 lu, respectively), though this difference did not reach statistical significance (P less than 0.05). Individual analysis of the data showed that in five out of 15 and in seven out of 16 cases the K562 killing by the mononuclear and T cells respectively was below the lowest s.d. limit for normal subjects. This reduced NK function was associated with a decreased ability of the effector cells to bind the target. The NK response to exogenous human leucocyte interferon was also generally depressed in cases with a low basal NK activity. The functional studies were complemented with the evaluation of the membrane expression of NK associated antigens. The percentage of circulating T cells recognized by the monoclonal antibody (MoAb) Leu-7 was significantly higher (P less than 0.001) in HCL than in normal blood (25.2% +/- 10.2 v 11.9 +/- 5.9 s.d.). However, the reactivity with two other NK-related MoAb, Leu-11 and AB8.28, was significantly lower (7.1% +/- 6.9 and 9.8% +/- 8.5; P less than 0.002) than with Leu-7 and moderately reduced compared with that of normal circulating T cells (11.7% + 6.1 & 12% + 5.5). These findings suggest that in a proportion of patients with HCL there is an impairment of the NK compartment, which may contribute towards the occurrence of the infective complications which are the primary cause of death in this disease.","['Foa, R', 'Lauria, F', 'Lusso, P', 'Raspadori, D', 'Fierro, M T', 'Tazzari, P L', 'Caudana, L', 'Matera, L']","['Foa R', 'Lauria F', 'Lusso P', 'Raspadori D', 'Fierro MT', 'Tazzari PL', 'Caudana L', 'Matera L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Interferon Type I)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology', 'Rosette Formation']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1986 May;64(2):392-8.,,,PMC1542334,,,,,,,,,

Further prospective studies are required to determine the cause of the long T50 values in untreated CLL and to confirm that the DTPA transfer test is a sensitive indicator of the damage which eventually leads to pulmonary fibrosis.","[""O'Doherty, M J"", 'Van de Pette, J E', 'Page, C J', 'Bateman, N T', 'Singh, A K', 'Croft, D N']","[""O'Doherty MJ"", 'Van de Pette JE', 'Page CJ', 'Bateman NT', 'Singh AK', 'Croft DN']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['7A314HQM0I (Pentetic Acid)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/physiopathology', 'Lung/*physiopathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Pentetic Acid/metabolism', 'Permeability']",1986/09/15 00:00,1986/09/15 00:01,['1986/09/15 00:00'],"['1986/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19860915)58:6<1286::aid-cncr2820580618>3.0.co;2-t [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1986 Sep 15;58(6):1286-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19860915)58:6<1286::aid-cncr2820580618>3.0.co;2-t.,,,,,,,,,,,,

This hematological disorder resembles that of refractory anemia with excess of blasts as seen in man. The hematological profile in man is one of peripheral cytopenia in one or all of the marrow cell lines which occurs despite a normal to hypercellular bone marrow. Quantitatively, the marrow has a preponderance of blasts (up to 20%). Qualitative abnormalities consist of dysthrombopoiesis and/or dyserythropoiesis and/or dysgranulopoiesis. Myelodysplastic disorders in the cat are a form of marrow failure often associated with infection with feline leukemia virus.

This procedure results in enrichment of cellular phospholipids by the supplemented fatty acid. Enrichment with polyunsaturated fatty acids resulted in a marked increase in sensitivity to adriamycin as compared to enrichment with monounsaturated fatty acids. The increased cytotoxicity was directly proportional to the extent of unsaturation of the inserted fatty acid, but there was no difference in cells enriched with n-3 compared with n-6 family fatty acids. To explore the mechanism of this observation, we examined whether augmented uptake of the drug might explain the increased cytotoxicity. The uptake of [14C]adriamycin, which was approximately linear at later time points, was only partially temperature dependent and never reached a steady state. Initial uptake at time points prior to 60 s could not be measured due to high and variable rapid membrane adsorption. Cellular accumulation of drug was greater in the docosahexaenoate 22:6-enriched L1210 cells as compared to oleate 18:1-enriched cells and was about 32% greater after 20 min. When L1210 cells were enriched with six fatty acids of variable degrees of unsaturation, the accumulation of adriamycin was directly correlated with the average number of double bonds in the fatty acids contained in cellular phospholipids. There was no difference in efflux of drug from cells pre-loaded with adriamycin. We conclude that the greater accumulation of adriamycin by the polyunsaturated fatty acid-enriched L1210 cells likely explains the increased sensitivity of these cells to adriamycin compared to 18:1-enriched cells.","['Burns, C P', 'North, J A']","['Burns CP', 'North JA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Doxorubicin/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Exocytosis', 'Fatty Acids/*physiology', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/*physiology', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phospholipids/*physiology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Temperature']",1986/08/29 00:00,1986/08/29 00:01,['1986/08/29 00:00'],"['1986/08/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/29 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(86)90064-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(86)90064-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1986 Aug 29;888(1):10-7. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(86)90064-9.,"['CA 31526/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR59/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The binding of nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBTI) to high-affinity sites on these cells (Kd approximately equal to 0.5 nM) was inhibited by hexobendine and dilazep in a similar pattern. Furthermore, these drugs, just as dipyridamole and papaverine, inhibited the dissociation of NBTI from high-affinity binding sites but only at concentrations 10-100 times higher than those inhibiting uridine transport. In contrast, high uridine concentrations (greater than 2 mM) accelerated the dissociation of NBTI. Dilazep also inhibited the transport of hypoxanthine, but only in those cell lines whose transporter is sensitive to inhibition by uridine and dipyridamole. Adenine transport was not inhibited significantly by dilazep in any of the cell lines tested, except for a slight inhibition in Novikoff cells. [14C]Hexobendine equilibrated across the plasma membrane in human erythrocytes within 2 sec of incubation at 25 degrees, but accumulated to 6-10 times the extracellular concentration in cells of the various cultured lines. Uptake was not affected by high concentrations of uridine, NBTI or dipyridamole. Hexobendine inhibited the growth of various cell lines to a lesser extent (IC50 = greater than or equal to 100 microM) than dipyridamole (IC50 = 15-40 microM).

Skin biopsies were also taken from these patients and, in order to rule out non-specific histological change, from 29 controls with inflammatory skin disease; the slides were examined blind by two independent observers for evidence of mycosis fungoides or poikiloderma and graded accordingly. Both observers were able to differentiate significantly histological grades of mycosis fungoides corresponding to the clinical diagnosis although exact histological grades only corresponded on 35 per cent of slides. Features graded as classical or probable mycosis fungoides were found in between 22 and 67 per cent of patients with parapsoriasis and between 67 and 100 per cent of those with poikiloderma. We found no evidence of extracutaneous disease in any of our patients. Lymphangiograms were abnormal in 30 of 31 examinations but the changes were non-specific and did not correspond to disease type, duration or extent. Four patients had apparently unrelated co-existing disease including chronic lymphatic leukaemia in two, a monoclonal gammopathy and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. This study shows that in its early stages mycosis fungoides is predominantly if not primarily a cutaneous disease. The findings also suggest that parapsoriasis and poikiloderma are part of the same disorder as mycosis fungoides or evolve into it. Aggressive treatment to prevent progression to mycosis fungoides plaque and tumour stage should therefore be tried. The findings support the idea that mycosis fungoides is a reactive rather than a neoplastic disorder.","['Lawrence, C M', 'Marks, J M', 'Burridge, A', 'Moss, C', 'Ive, F A', 'McGibbon, D', 'Parker, S', 'Coburn, P', 'Shuster, S']","['Lawrence CM', 'Marks JM', 'Burridge A', 'Moss C', 'Ive FA', 'McGibbon D', 'Parker S', 'Coburn P', 'Shuster S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Q J Med,The Quarterly journal of medicine,0401027,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphography', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycosis Fungoides/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Parapsoriasis/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Skin/pathology', 'Skin Diseases/*diagnosis']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Q J Med. 1986 Mar;58(227):281-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,

RadLV/VL3(T+L+)-specific proviral sequences were found adjacent to the c-myc gene in several virus-induced thymic lymphomas of the rat, suggesting that the enhancer elements might play a role in lymphomagenesis. However, we found that the presence of a provirus at a specific DNA site can lead to an in-vitro growth advantage and to clonal cell selection independently of a lymphomagenic process.

At the molecular level, the process of carcinogenesis may involve the activation of oncogenes and/or the inactivation or loss of anti-oncogenes, through chromosomal rearrangements, point mutations, and other effects of radiation on DNA. In contrast to these mechanisms of carcinogenesis, which result from the absorption of radiation by the tumor-forming cells themselves, abscopal effects resulting from irradiation of other cells may contribute to carcinogenesis under certain conditions, e.g. in the induction of tumors of endocrine target cells through radiation-induced disturbances of hormonal balance. Effects of the latter type, which require the killing of substantial numbers of cells, are not elicited at low doses, thus contrasting with effects of the former type, which may be presumed to have no thresholds. Because radiation carcinogenesis may be mediated through a diversity of effects, the relationship between incidence and dose can vary accordingly. The relationship between the incidence of radiation-induced tumors and the time elapsing after irradiation also varies, depending on the type of tumor in question, species, age at irradiation, exposure conditions, and other factors. Although the variations with dose and time are consistent with multistage models of tumor initiation, tumor promotion, and tumor progression, the precise nature of the successive steps that are involved remains to be determined. The tendency for the tumors to resemble their spontaneous counterparts in age-distribution points to interactions between radiation and other carcinogenic risk factors which are as yet poorly understood. Also poorly understood are species- and organ-differences in susceptibility to radiation carcinogenesis, which bear no consistent relationship to corresponding 'spontaneous' cancer rates.","['Upton, A C']",['Upton AC'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Chromosomes/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Gene Expression Regulation/radiation effects', 'Genes/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Distribution']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(86)90282-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1986;10(7):727-34. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(86)90282-1.,"['CA 13343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES 00260/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Seven of the 8 children had polymicrobial infections, usually containing both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The success of medical treatment by antibiotics and chest physiotherapy was age related; 3 of the 8 children, aged 10 to 17 years, recovered on this regimen, whereas five children, aged 7 weeks to 7 years, required catheter drainage or resection for cure. Drainage by catheter pneumonostomy was performed for solitary peripheral bacterial abscesses. A large intercostal catheter was inserted into the cavity, either operatively or percutaneously. Wedge resection was performed for multiple, central, or fungal abscesses. Pneumonostomy was curative in 3 of 4 children. One chronic abscess recurred after pneumonostomy and required resection. Wedge resection was curative in the two children who came to thoracotomy; lobectomy was not necessary. Although all eight children recovered from their lung abscesses, three of them died within a year of sepsis. Lung abscess today occurs in immunocompromised children who are vulnerable to fatal infections. Chest physiotherapy is unlikely to achieve good drainage in children under 7 years of age.

Long-term selective irradiation of the spleen and lymph nodes by deposition of indium-114m.,359-64,"Recirculating lymphocytes were used to carry an isotope of indium, In-114m. The isotope has a half-life of 50 days, and emits both gamma and beta particles, properties that may be useful clinically. In-114m-labelled rat thoracic duct lymphocytes (TDL), injected intravenously, migrated to traffic areas in spleen and lymph nodes. The radioactivity was transferred selectively to a resident, radioresistant phagocytic population located within the marginal zone and red pulp of spleen, where it remained for at least 6 weeks. That the isotope was relatively concentrated in traffic areas, but not elsewhere, suggested that In-114m-TDL could be used as a means of producing total lymphoid irradiation without damaging bone marrow. Recipients of In-114m-TDL developed a profound lymphocytopenia within 2-3 weeks of injection but gained weight at a comparable rate to control rats. The effect of In-114m-TDL injection was also examined in rats injected with a rapidly growing, malignant rat leukaemia. In-114m-TDL delayed the onset of the proliferative phase of the leukaemia from 10 days to 20 days in a dose-dependent fashion. Repeated weekly injections of In-114m-TDL prevented the onset of the leukaemia until the injections ceased after 11 weeks. The potential use of In-114m-labelled lymphocytes in diagnosis (by external imaging) or in treatment (by localized lymphoid irradiation) is considered.","['Birch, M', 'Sharma, H L', 'Bell, E B', 'Ford, W L']","['Birch M', 'Sharma HL', 'Bell EB', 'Ford WL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Radioisotopes)', '045A6V3VFX (Indium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Movement', 'Indium/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*radiotherapy', 'Lymph Nodes/*radiation effects', 'Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Radioisotopes/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Spleen/*radiation effects', 'Tissue Distribution']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1986 Jul;58(3):359-64.,,,PMC1453466,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the glycolipids from 13 lymphoid and nonlymphoid human cell lines were examined for the presence of unsialylated and sialylated 3-fucosyllactosamine sequences using a thin-layer chromatography immunostaining method. Nine of the cell lines were also tested by indirect immunofluorescence both before and after neuraminidase treatment. None of the six B-cell and T-cell lines had detectable neutral or sialylated glycolipid antigen. In contrast, six out of seven and five out of seven nonlymphoid cell lines had neutral and sialylated glycolipid antigens, respectively. These results agreed, in general, with those found by indirect immunofluorescence. They also represent the first direct demonstration of these sialylated glycolipids on human leukemic cells.

In bacteriologically proven, and in clinical sepsis-suspected cases, CRP values increased in all cases to levels above 100 mg/l (normal values less than 5 mg/l). Effective antibiotic therapy resulted in a prompt decline in CRP. Viral infections resulted in a much smaller increase.

Preliminary results suggest that the human tumour model may be more relevant clinically. It has also been demonstrated that prior exposure to fractionated X-irradiation in vitro can result in the expression of resistance or collateral sensitivity, depending on the drug evaluated.

II. 3-Methylcholanthrene-induced lymphoid malignancies in rat Peyer's patches.,1257-65,"To determine whether B or T lymphoid malignancies could be induced following the exposure of lymphoid cells within different lymphoid organs to a potential chemical carcinogen, 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) was directly injected into surgically exposed Peyer's patches (PP), mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), axillary lymph nodes (ALN) or spleens (SP) of Copenhagen rats. A high incidence of lymphoproliferative disorders was observed within rats which received 3-MC injections into the PP, but not in MLN, ALN or SP injected groups of rats. In addition to the PP environment, the dose of 3-MC and exposure to pristane were important factors in the induction of T versus B cell disorders. Whereas the B cell diseases were observed in pristane-treated rats which also received PP injections of low doses (5 or 50 micrograms) of 3-MC, in animals receiving a higher dose (500 micrograms) a much higher incidence of T cell disorders was detected. The observed lymphoproliferative diseases were categorized as B lymphocytic leukemias, B lymphomas or thymic lymphomas on the basis of histological examination of the tissues, white blood cell numbers and differentials, and the morphological and phenotypic characteristics of cell isolates. Abnormal DNA staining characteristics, increased soft agar cloning frequencies and metastasis of the leukemia or tumor cells indicated that malignant cells were associated with the proliferative diseases. Collectively the data indicate that primary lymphoid malignancies of either B or T cell origins may be preferentially and reproducibly induced by localizing low or high doses respectively, of 3-MC within the PP of rats exposed to pristane. These results suggest that PP may have a possible role in the carcinogenesis of lymphocytes following the exposure to chemical carcinogens via the gastrointestinal tract.","['Bost, K L', 'Garrett, L R', 'Cuchens, M A']","['Bost KL', 'Garrett LR', 'Cuchens MA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,['56-49-5 (Methylcholanthrene)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/chemically induced/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymph Nodes/drug effects', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*chemically induced', 'Methylcholanthrene', ""Peyer's Patches/drug effects/*physiology"", 'Phenotype', 'Rats', 'Spleen/drug effects', 'Thymus Neoplasms/chemically induced/pathology']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/7.8.1257 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1986 Aug;7(8):1257-65. doi: 10.1093/carcin/7.8.1257.,"['CA33111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-05386/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that 10(5) and 10(6) KMT-17 cells also grew progressively to kill rats, but when 10(5) KMT-17 cells were administered with BCG the tumor cells did not grow in the majority of rats. The strength of immunogenicity (ETD50), as measured by the number of immunizing cells required for a suppression of growth of 10(7) KMT-17 cells in 50% of the rats, was 2.1 X 10(3) for FV-KMT-17 and 36.3 X 10(3) for BCG + KMT-17. The tumor cell dose (LTD50) which was required to kill 50% of the rats immunized with 10(5) FV-KMT-17 was more than 10,000 times higher than that found in normal rats, whereas the number of tumor cells required to kill 50% of the rats immunized with the same number of BCG + KMT-17 was only 3,680 times higher than the amount found in normal rats. Thus the immunogenicity of FV-KMT-17 is much stronger than that of BCG + KMT-17. The difference in immunogenicity between the two vaccines was also observed in the tumor-neutralizing activities of spleen cells obtained from rats which had been immunized with both vaccines, as measured by a Winn assay. Moreover, the antitumor activity of spleen cells from rats immunized with FV-KMT-17 was concentrated in the carrageenan-resistant and plastic nonadherent cells, while that of spleen cells from rats immunized with BCG + KMT-17 was observed in carrageenan-sensitive and plastic adherent cells as well as in nonadherent cells. The involvement of different effector cells indicates that different mechanisms operate in the antitumor resistance in rats immunized with either FV-KMT-17 or BCG + KMT-17.","['Suzuki, Y', 'Suzuki, K', 'Hosokawa, M', 'Kobayashi, H']","['Suzuki Y', 'Suzuki K', 'Hosokawa M', 'Kobayashi H']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (BCG Vaccine)', '9000-07-1 (Carrageenan)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'BCG Vaccine/*immunology', 'Carrageenan/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fibrosarcoma/immunology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Immunization', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Spleen/immunology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00200034 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1986;22(3):204-10. doi: 10.1007/BF00200034.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of the study was to produce a platinum complex with activity against cisplatin-resistant tumor cells and with suitable pharmaceutical properties for formulation development. The isomers had the following solubilities in saline: cis-, 2 mg/ml; d,l-trans-, 6.5 mg/ml; and d-trans- and l-trans-, 15-16 mg/ml. The four complexes showed slightly better activity than cisplatin against the ip implanted murine L1210 leukemia. In contrast to cisplatin, all complexes produced significant increases in life span against L1210/cisplatin, a subline of L1210 with acquired resistance to cisplatin. However, the cis- isomer was less active against L1210/cisplatin. The d,l-trans- isomer (tetraplatin) was selected for further studies based on greater ease for large-scale synthesis. It showed superior activity to cisplatin against P388/cisplatin and like cisplatin showed significant and reproducible activity against the ip implanted B16 melanoma, ip implanted M5076 sarcoma, ip implanted P388 leukemia, and MX-1 human breast xenograft implanted under the renal capsule. Purity and stability (greater than 24 hours in saline) were evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography and found to be suitable for development of a parenteral dosage form.

In the production of the MeCCNU-resistant line full resistance to MeCCNU was obtained after 15 generations with a gradual increase of the treatment dose. Treatment of L1210 with MNU (40 mg/kg i.p. on days 1, 3, and 5) produced after five or more treatment generations a MNU-resistant subline with reduced tumor growth in the untreated controls. Therapeutic responses of L1210, L1210-MeCCNU and L1210-MNU to MeCCNU, MNU, cyclophosphamide, 2,2'-dichloro-N-methyldiethylamine hydrochloride, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, methotrexate, and 6-mercaptopurine were compared in both non-and X-irradiated (400 R) mice. The L1210 and L1210-MeCCNU lines reacted similarly except that L1210-MeCCNU was resistant to Me-CCNU and MNU. However, the L1210-MNU line differed greatly from the parent line. The survival times in nonirradiated mice were increased in all except the MNU- and MeCCNU-treated groups, and in irradiated mice they were less than 30 days and only cyclophosphamide and 2,2'-dichloro-N-methyldiethylamine hydrochloride caused long-term survivors. The different behavior of L1210-MNU and L1210-MeCCNU is apparently due to the fact that at maximum tolerated doses the monofunctional alkylating agent MNU is more mutagenic than the bifunctional MeCCNU. Antigenic change and loss of growth potential presumably are the reasons for the different sensitivity of L1210-MNU as indicated by tests in X-irradiated and nude mice. Apparently this host-related sensitivity is not directly related to the development of drug resistance.","['Schmid, F A', 'Otter, G M', 'Chen, C F']","['Schmid FA', 'Otter GM', 'Chen CF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Mutagens)', '13909-09-6 (Semustine)', '684-93-5 (Methylnitrosourea)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', '*Drug Resistance', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/genetics/radiotherapy', 'Methylnitrosourea', 'Mice', 'Mutagens/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Semustine']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Sep;46(9):4469-71.,"['CA 08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

With this method, we showed the induction of 16 proteins, which ranged from Mr 140,000 to 12,000. Exposure to alpha-interferon caused very rapid induction of specific proteins in hairy cells, and induction continued for at least 9 days. Proteins were induced at extremely low interferon concentrations, and a dose-response effect was seen with increasing concentrations. A larger number of proteins was induced in hairy cells than in other lymphoid cells under the same conditions. Induction of most proteins was inhibited by actinomycin D, showing that new messenger RNA synthesis was required for their induction to occur.

Following a 1-h exposure, MRA-CN was found to be 1400-fold more cytocidal than DOX which correlated with the drugs' inhibitory effects on DNA and total RNA synthesis. Treatment with MRA-CN resulted in a dose-dependent production of DNA interstrand cross-links as quantified by alkaline elution. One-h treatments with DOX or 3'-deamino-3'-(4-morpholinyl) doxorubicin (the non-cyano-containing analogue of MRA-CN) produced no DNA-DNA cross-links; rather they produced protein-concealed DNA single-strand breaks. After removal of MRA-CN, the DNA of KBM-3 cells displayed time-dependent fragmentation as indicated by rapid DNA filter elution during the pH 10 lysis step which preceded pH 12 elution. Within 4 h of MRA-CN exposure (10 nM, 1 h), 50% of the cellular DNA was in the lysis fraction. By 24 h, all the cellular DNA was in this fraction. MRA-CN (10 nM), 3'-deamino-3'-(4-morpholinyl)doxorubicin (1 microM), and actinomycin D (1 microM), but not DOX (3 mircroM), each produced distinctive nucleolar macrosegregation, indicating an effect on rRNA synthesis. The alpha-CN substituent on the morpholinyl moiety of MRA-CN appears to be responsible for the unique antitumor potency of this anthracycline. Nucleolar macrosegregation is probably associated with the morpholinyl moiety and is independent of the alpha-CN substituent.","['Wassermann, K', 'Zwelling, L A', 'Mullins, T D', 'Silberman, L E', 'Andersson, B S', 'Bakic, M', 'Acton, E M', 'Newman, R A']","['Wassermann K', 'Zwelling LA', 'Mullins TD', 'Silberman LE', 'Andersson BS', 'Bakic M', 'Acton EM', 'Newman RA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', ""88254-07-3 (3'-deamino-3'-(3-cyano-4-morpholinyl)doxorubicin)""]",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleolus/*drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Aug;46(8):4041-6.,['K04 CA 01135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

This apparent clinical effect of hydroxyurea led to an examination of hydroxyurea effects on GR binding and sensitivity in the glucocorticoid-sensitive human lymphoblast cell line GM4672A. GR binding levels in GM4672A cells were measured following a 3-day exposure to 50 microM hydroxyurea, a concentration chosen to have a minimal but measurable effect on cellular growth rates with little or no effect on cellular viability. Under these conditions, nuclear [3H]dexamethasone receptor binding measured by Scatchard analysis using a whole-cell assay was elevated 2.4-fold over control values (P less than 0.05), while cytosolic residual receptor binding (measured at 37 degrees C) remained unchanged. Thus, the total cellular content of measurable GR was increased, and this increase was totally accounted for by GR capable of nuclear binding. Hydroxyurea treatment of GM4672A cells had no effect on the affinity of nuclear or cytosolic GR for [3H]dexamethasone. The increase in measurable nuclear-bound receptors occurred in a time-dependent manner over a period of 3 days and was fully reversible within 3 days following removal of hydroxyurea. The increase in receptor binding could not be explained by the slight alterations in cell cycle kinetics which occur at this low level of hydroxyurea. Despite increased receptor binding, cellular glucocorticoid responsiveness was unaltered as assessed by dexamethasone inhibition of cell growth and dexamethasone inhibition of a urokinase-like plasminogen activator. Thus, increased nuclear and total cellular GR binding levels in hydroxyurea-treated GM4672A cells are not associated with increased glucocorticoid responsiveness.","['Littlefield, B A', 'Hoagland, H C', 'Greipp, P R']","['Littlefield BA', 'Hoagland HC', 'Greipp PR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/analysis', 'Dexamethasone/metabolism', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Plasminogen Activators/analysis', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*metabolism', 'Thioredoxins/metabolism', 'Tritium']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Aug;46(8):3945-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of 105 cases.,630-4,"Peripheral blood changes preceding therapy-related leukemia were studied in 105 patients who had received cytotoxic therapy, 53 for Hodgkin's disease and 52 for other cancers. Preleukemic anomalies were observed in 74.3% of the cases, appearing after a mean interval of 68.7 months after diagnosis of the initial cancer. This interval was only 57.5 months in patients aged 50 years or older and only 42.3 months in patients with Hodgkin's disease having received cytotoxic therapy for 6 months or less. The first changes most frequently observed were pancytopenia (24.8%) and isolated erythrocyte abnormalities such as anemia or macrocytosis (18.1%). Involvement of two cell lines, isolated thrombocytopenia or leukopenia, circulating immature cells, monocytosis, leukocytosis, or thrombocytosis were also observed. Therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome was recognized in 19 patients and myelofibrosis in 3. Median duration of the preleukemic phase was 6 months; 9 months in cases of isolated erythrocyte involvement and 5 months in the other cases. Myelomonocytic or monoblastic leukemia appeared less frequently when the first sign involved erythrocytes only. Hematological surveillance thus appears necessary in all patients having received cytotoxic therapy. Bone marrow study with cytogenetic examination should be performed in cases of persistent peripheral blood abnormalities.","['De Gramont, A', 'Louvet, C', 'Krulik, M', 'Smadja, N', 'Donadio, D', 'Laporte, J P', 'Brissaud, P', 'Smith, M', 'Delage, J M', 'Drolet, Y']","['De Gramont A', 'Louvet C', 'Krulik M', 'Smadja N', 'Donadio D', 'Laporte JP', 'Brissaud P', 'Smith M', 'Delage JM', 'Drolet Y', 'et al.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/etiology', 'Pancytopenia/blood/etiology', 'Preleukemia/blood/*etiology', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Time Factors']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19860801)58:3<630::aid-cncr2820580306>3.0.co;2-e [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1986 Aug 1;58(3):630-4. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19860801)58:3<630::aid-cncr2820580306>3.0.co;2-e.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twelve of 13 patients with retroperitoneal or mediastinal adenopathy obtained remissions of tumor masses. All seven patients with splenomegaly showed prompt reduction in the size of the spleen to normal size. The incidence of complete remissions was significantly higher (P = .02) in previously untreated patients (5 of 7) than in those in whom splenectomy had been performed (4 of 23), a result presumed to be related to the pretreatment tumor burden. rIFN alpha A was well tolerated; mild fatigue was the most frequent complaint.

Cases treated with aggressive chemotherapy were either younger individuals with refractory anaemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) or patients, irrespective of age in advanced stages of MDS (RAEB in transformation or after evolution to frank AML), who did not have a major infection at the time of presentation. Age seemed to be the most important factor in determining the outcome of aggressive remission induction chemotherapy in MDS: 86% of the patients less than 50 years entered complete remission, compared to only 25% in the older age group.

To study chemical-retroviral co-carcinogenesis in this cells they were infected with a low multiplicity of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MLV). Using a single cell cloning procedure, a virus-producing clone was isolated from the infected cells, which was shown to carry only one integrated M-MLV provirus per cell. It was found that this single provirus was sufficient to render the clone susceptible to transformation by 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC). However this clone responded differently to the carcinogen at different passages after infection. When exposed to 3-MC at a low passage postinfection (passage 5), cell transformation was evident only after 11 subsequent subcultures. On the other hand when it was chemically treated at a high passage postinfection (passage 29), cell transformation could clearly be detected already at the next subculture after the chemical treatment. It is suggested that an M-MLV-mediated cumulative effect is necessary to complement the action of the carcinogen in order to complete the carcinogenic process in these cells. This cumulative viral effect appeared to be associated with a change in the control of the virus expression, since 3-MC was found to stimulate virus replication in this clone also only at the high passage postinfection. Indeed virus release by cells of isolated transformed foci, produced by the chemical-M-MLV co-carcinogenesis, was extremely higher than by untransformed cells.","['Hassan, Y', 'Huleihel, M', 'Priel, E', 'Rosner, K', 'Aboud, M']","['Hassan Y', 'Huleihel M', 'Priel E', 'Rosner K', 'Aboud M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,['56-49-5 (Methylcholanthrene)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/chemically induced/*etiology', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', '*Cocarcinogenesis', 'Kidney', 'Methylcholanthrene/*toxicity', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Virus Replication']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01314145 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Virol. 1986;90(1-2):63-71. doi: 10.1007/BF01314145.,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, when a relatively high concentration of 100 micrograms/ml was applied, MC induced irreversible inhibition of cell growth even if the exposure time was comparatively short.

The presumptive factors for multiple primary neoplasms suggested radiotherapy-associated cancers in 30%, radiochemotherapy-associated in 13%, chemotherapy-associated in 34%, and genetic factor-related in 36% of cases. Chromosomal analysis was performed in 12 cases. Three of 4 leukemias revealed major karyotypic abnormalities in the leukemic cells.

Underlying diseases consisted of cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis (125 cases), skin diseases (41 cases), benign thyroid diseases (19 cases), hemangioma (18 cases) and others (33 cases).

Multiple primary cancers in the radiation field were observed in 7 cases. Average latent period was 28.9 years. It was demonstrated that the older the age at irradiation the shorter the latent period. Based on the population irradiated for benign diseases before 1977, which was collected in the first mail survey, incidence of radiation-induced cancers was estimated to be about 0.9%. The incidence varied with the period of radiotherapy; 1.9% for the period of radiotherapy before 1955, 0.4% for 1956-1965, 0.1% for 1966-1977. Although radiotherapy is now rarely indicated for benign diseases, it was shown in the first mail survey that more than 15,000 cases of benign diseases had been irradiated after 1956.

CNS infections in immunocompromised patients are usually caused by organisms different from those found in the general population. The organism causing CNS infection in an immunocompromised host can often be predicted if the type of immune abnormality of the patient is known. The common causes of CNS infection in immunocompromised hosts are reviewed here. Meningitis in patients with neutropenia is usually due to enteric Gram negative bacilli that live in the patient's own digestive tract. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is most common and is followed by E. Coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter and Proteus. A major risk in patients with abnormal immunoglobulins or splenectomy is infection with encapsulated bacteria, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis. Meningitis caused by any of the encapsulated bacteria can be fulminant. Listeria monocytogenes is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in patients with impaired cellular immunity. Nocardia asteroides is a leading cause of brain abscess in patients with hematologic malignancy. Most patients have evidence of concomitant pulmonary lesions. Fungi are among the most common organisms involving the CNS in immunocompromised hosts. Susceptible patients include those with lymphoma or leukemia and those who receive therapies aimed at suppressing delayed hypersensitivity. Cryptococcus neoformans is a common fungal cause of CNS infection in immunocompromised hosts. The primary site of infection is the lung. Spread to the CNS is via the blood stream. The clinical course is highly variable: meningitis, meningoencephalitis and focal mass lesions. Candida causes meningitis or meningoencephalitis characterized by multiple small abscesses in neutropenic hosts. Organisms reach the CNS via the blood stream usually from the digestive tract or infected intravenous catheters. Aspergillus causes brain abscess, cerebral infarction and focal meningitis in patients with neutropenia. The primary infection is in the lung. The parasites that infest the CNS of immunocompromised patients are usually those that exploit a T-lymphocyte, mononuclear phagocyte host defect. The most common are Toxoplasma gondii and Strongyloides stercoralis. There have been a few cases of amebiasis with dissemination to the brain in patients with hematologic malignancies. Toxoplasma gondii causes major CNS disease in immunocompromised hosts: meningoencephalitis or mass lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Escudier, E', 'Cordonnier, C', 'Poirier, J']","['Escudier E', 'Cordonnier C', 'Poirier J']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Rev Neurol (Paris),Revue neurologique,2984779R,,IM,"['Bacterial Infections/etiology/microbiology', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/diagnosis/*etiology/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Lymphoma/*complications', 'Mycoses/etiology/microbiology', 'Parasitic Diseases/etiology/parasitology', 'Virus Diseases/etiology/microbiology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Neurol (Paris). 1986;142(2):116-25.,,Les infections du systeme nerveux central au cours des hemopathies malignes.,,,,,,,,,,

Among the immunocompromised children, those receiving chemotherapy for cancer and those with immunodeficiency disease had more severe RSV disease, with pneumonia occurring at all ages, and a higher mortality rate. Children receiving long-term steroid therapy did not appear to have more severe clinical manifestations than normal children. Viral shedding, however, was significantly greater and more prolonged in the children receiving steroid therapy, and particularly in those receiving chemotherapy or with an immunodeficiency disease. Giant-cell pneumonia was documented in one child with leukemia. Over half the immunocompromised children acquired the RSV infection nosocomially.

A DNA synthesis inhibition assay previously identified p-benzoquinone as the most potent overall cellular toxin and inhibitor of DNA synthesis, but failed to discriminate among the hydroxylated metabolites. Therefore, the ability of benzene and its metabolites to induce DNA strand breaks in the mouse lymphoma cell line, L5178YS, was examined in order to provide a more accurate indication of the DNA damage associated with benzene and its metabolites. Cells were exposed to benzene, hydroquinone, catechol, phenol, 1,2,4-benzenetriol, or p-benzoquinone over a 1000-fold concentration range (1.0 microM-1.0 mM). Concentrations of benzene, phenol, or catechol as high as 1.0 mM did not increase the percentage of single-stranded DNA observed. Concentrations of hydroquinone as high as 0.1 mM were also ineffective. In contrast, both p-benzoquinone and 1,2,4-benzenetriol produced DNA breaks in a dose-related fashion. Of the two, benzoquinone proved to be more potent with an ED50 of approximately equal to 2.5 microM compared with 55.0 microM for benzenetriol. The DNA damage induced by 6.0 microM benzoquinone was maximal within 3 min of exposure and yielded approximately 70% single-stranded DNA after alkaline denaturation. By contrast, the single-stranded DNA observed after benzenetriol exposure required 60 min of exposure to achieve the same extent of damage as that found with benzoquinone. These results suggest that the benzene metabolites, benzenetriol and benzoquinone, may cause DNA damage and that the mechanisms responsible for the damage associated with these two compounds may be different.","['Pellack-Walker, P', 'Blumer, J L']","['Pellack-Walker P', 'Blumer JL']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Catechols)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Quinones)', '173O8B04RD (hydroxyhydroquinone)', '339NCG44TV (Phenol)', '3T006GV98U (quinone)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'LF3AJ089DQ (catechol)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/metabolism/*pharmacology', '*Benzoquinones', 'Catechols/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hydroquinones/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L5178/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'NADP/metabolism', 'Phenol', 'Phenols/pharmacology', 'Quinones/pharmacology']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1986 Jul;30(1):42-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explain its efficacy on HCL, we investigated the ultrastructural changes caused by alpha-IFN in hairy cells. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) were separated from the peripheral blood of eight HCL patients in the leukemic phase. Aliquots of 1 X 10(6) MNCs in 2.5 ml of RPMI 1640 medium were cultured with a recombinant DNA-derived alpha-2 interferon (RD alpha 2-IFN) for 1, 3, and 7 days. The concentrations of IFN added were 10, 100, 1,000, and 10,000 IU/ml culture medium. Electron microscopic examination revealed that RD alpha 2-IFN induced the formation of tubuloreticular structures in cultured hairy cells and increased the frequency of hairy cells having annulate lamellae (ALs), probable precursors of the nuclear pore. Hairy cells from various patients showed a variability in the extent of tubuloreticular structure (TRS) formation. Excellent clinical responses, as judged by hematologic parameters, were observed among patients whose leukemic cells were susceptible to RD alpha 2-IFN with respect to TRS formation in vitro. from these findings, we propose that the induction of TRS formation, in combination with the increase of ALs, may be a morphologic expression of a direct antitumor action of IFN on malignant cells.","['Hiraoka, A', 'Golomb, H M']","['Hiraoka A', 'Golomb HM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Response Mod,Journal of biological response modifiers,8219656,['0 (Interferon Type I)'],IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Granulocytes', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/drug therapy/*ultrastructure', 'Leukocyte Count/drug effects', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count/drug effects']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Biol Response Mod. 1986 Jun;5(3):270-81.,['CA19266/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

In a rat leukemia model (BNML) we investigated the combined administration of nitrous oxide, inactivating vitamin B12, and methotrexate (MTX), a folate antagonist inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. Through different mechanisms, both agents decrease the availability of tetrahydrofolate, and subsequently of other reduced folates, with increased impairment of folate-dependent synthesis of thymidylate. Effects on leukemic growth and on hematological values in rats demonstrated enhancement of the therapeutic effect of MTX by exposure to nitrous oxide. With several treatment schedules, the results of combined treatment were seen to be better than additive when compared with the effects of single agents. In particular, pretreatment of leukemic rats with nitrous oxide for 3 days before administration of MTX appeared effective. With higher doses of MTX, concomitant exposure to nitrous oxide even resulted in toxic effects.

Cytogenetic analysis of constitutional cells can be used to determine the genetic risk of developing certain cancers, such as retinoblastoma and Wilms' tumor in high-risk families. Urinary metabolites of neuroblastoma have been studied not only for accurate diagnostic ability in children with ""small round cell"" tumors, but as a screen for the presence of the tumor in large normal populations. Markers are valuable as prognostic factors at the time of cancer diagnosis; for example, the use of cell surface antigens and cytogenetics in leukemia phenotyping, leading to alterations in initial therapy. Once found at diagnosis, both specific and nonspecific markers can then be utilized to follow the regression and recurrence of a malignancy, such as serum ferritin in neuroblastoma or lactate dehydrogenase in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Presence of cell surface antigens to which monoclonal antibodies can be directed are becoming increasingly helpful in both tumor localization, such as in radioisotope scanning, and in therapeutic intervention, such as in purging autologous bone marrow of malignant cells prior to use as a rescue after massive cytoreduction. Finally, cellular markers have lead to a better understanding of the basic biology of particular neoplasms; for example, gene rearrangements in lymphoma, which will ultimately lead to better diagnostic and therapeutic ability.","['Woods, W G']",['Woods WG'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Child', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Mass Screening', 'Neoplasm Staging/methods', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology/metabolism/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk']",1986/07/15 00:00,1986/07/15 00:01,['1986/07/15 00:00'],"['1986/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19860715)58:2+<442::aid-cncr2820581306>3.0.co;2-t [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1986 Jul 15;58(2 Suppl):442-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19860715)58:2+<442::aid-cncr2820581306>3.0.co;2-t.,['CA07306/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Tissue from an orbital metastasis was biopsied and transplanted into a nude mouse. Histologically the tumor was composed of pleomorphic cells with single convoluted nuclei or multilobed nuclei and prominent granular cytoplasm and had an alveolar histologic pattern in some areas. The ultrastructural features of the tumor cells include multilobed nuclei with prominent nucleoli and cytoplasmic granules with the characteristics of alpha-granules. The tumor has been successfully passaged over a 1-year interval and appears to be a stable megakaryoblastic tumor cell line (CHRF-288).

Seventeen marrows from ANLL patients were studied, 13 of which were from patients who were considered to be clinically refractory to DNR. We took care to include such patients in this study since, in the P388 model, verapamil enhancement of DNR uptake is observed only in cells resistant to DNR. Intracellular accumulation of DNR was studied by exposing blast cells to DNR (1 microgram/mL) +/- verapamil (6.6 mumol/L) for up to 4 hours. Following a 2-hour exposure of cells to DNR +/- verapamil, intracellular retention of DNR was studied by incubating the cells in DNR-free medium for 3 hours. Intracellular DNR/10(6) cells was quantified by fluorometry. In 12 of 15 patient marrows, verapamil failed to enhance intracellular accumulation of DNR. Three patient marrows had a very small increment in DNR uptake in response to verapamil (approximately 14% greater than DNR alone) that was significant (P less than .05) by paired t test. Intracellular retention of DNR (t 1/2) and the area under the intracellular DNR v time curve (AUC) were studied in 17 patients marrow specimens. No significant alterations in these parameters were observed in response to verapamil. These data indicate either that verapamil did not substantially enhance DNR uptake or retention in blast cells obtained from ANLL patients who are clinically resistant to DNR, or that the frequency of DNR-resistant cells (ie, verapamil-responsive cells) among the blast cells obtained from these patients was too low to influence the population mean of intracellular DNR as measured in these studies.","['Ross, D D', 'Joneckis, C C', 'Schiffer, C A']","['Ross DD', 'Joneckis CC', 'Schiffer CA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Daunorubicin/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69910-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1986 Jul;68(1):83-8.,"['1-P50-CA32107-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1-RO1-CA40188-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We studied 23 untreated patients who subsequently achieved complete remission (CR) with a regimen using daunorubicin and conventional doses of ara-C (ara-C-sensitive group), and 30 patients judged to be ara-C-resistant either by failing initial induction therapy (16 patients) or by having relapsed on an ara-C-containing maintenance regimen (14 patients). In both patient groups, ara-C incorporation into DNA and intracellular ara-CTP both displayed statistically significant increases in response to increasing extracellular concentrations of ara-C (P = .0001 in both cases), with the rate of increase of ara-CTP greater than that of ara-C incorporation. Moreover, blast cells from all patients, even those who were most clinically resistant to ara-C, were able to form ara-CTP and to incorporate ara-C into DNA. Each tenfold increment in extracellular ara-C concentration caused an 8.5-fold increase in ara-CTP, but only a 3.6-fold increase in ara-C incorporation into DNA. Thus, the efficiency of incorporation of ara-C into DNA (defined as the ratio of ara-C incorporation to ara-CTP pools) decreased by 58% with each tenfold increment in the extracellular concentration of ara-C (P less than .0001), presumably as a result of the inhibitory effect of ara-CTP on DNA polymerase. Using an analysis of covariance, modest differences were found in the levels of the ara-C metabolite variables in the ara-C-sensitive group as compared with the resistant group. However, because there was considerable overlap in ara-C metabolite formation among the patient groups, it was not possible to predict clinical outcome by these in vitro assessments of ara-C metabolism.","['Ross, D D', 'Thompson, B W', 'Joneckis, C C', 'Akman, S A', 'Schiffer, C A']","['Ross DD', 'Thompson BW', 'Joneckis CC', 'Akman SA', 'Schiffer CA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69909-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1986 Jul;68(1):76-82.,"['1-P50-CA32107-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1-RO1-CA40188-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Non-respiratory cancers.,381-6,"In a search for clues to previously unrecognised industrial carcinogens the occupational and smoking histories of young and middle aged men with different types of cancer have been compared. The study population comprised men aged 18-54 and resident in the counties of Cleveland, Humberside, and Cheshire (including the Wirral). Within this population 2942 patients in whom cancers were first diagnosed during the period 1975-80 were identified retrospectively from hospital and cancer registration records. Lifetime occupational and smoking histories were then sought from these subjects (or if they had died by proxy from their next of kin), using a postal questionnaire. The overall response rate was 52.1%. Analysis of limited occupational data obtained from the hospital notes of 89% of the patients suggests that no serious bias arose from the incomplete response to the questionnaire. The present paper describes the findings for non-respiratory cancers. Some tumours did not occur with sufficient frequency to warrant formal statistical analysis. Nevertheless, examination of the histories of patients with these cancers showed several interesting occupational clusters. In particular, five out of 29 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia had worked in electrical trades. The more common cancers were studied by statistical techniques. A large number of possible occupational associations were examined, and some will probably have achieved conventional levels of statistical significance by chance. The results should therefore be interpreted with caution, taking into account evidence from other studies and the biological plausibility of suggested hazards. Among the more interesting findings were an excess of bladder cancer in lorry drivers (RR=1.6, CI 1.0-2.4) and in men employed in the manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats (RR = 4.8, CI 1.8-12.9).","['Coggon, D', 'Pannett, B', 'Osmond, C', 'Acheson, E D']","['Coggon D', 'Pannett B', 'Osmond C', 'Acheson ED']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Ind Med,British journal of industrial medicine,0370637,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'England', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Risk']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.43.6.381 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Ind Med. 1986 Jun;43(6):381-6. doi: 10.1136/oem.43.6.381.,,,PMC1007667,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, MGUS with normal OR remained stable (median follow-up = 28 months), with one exception who developed a systemic amyloidosis. In MM, excessive OR was only observed in areas invaded by myeloma cells. OR was frequently normal in active MM lacking myeloma cells in UTBB. Active MM without lesions on radiography had excessive OR. IgA and pure Bence Jones MM appeared more osteoclastic than IgG cases (P less than 0.05). Of major interest was the finding that one third of MM presented histological bone changes similar to osteoporosis, osteosclerosis or osteoblastic metastasis. Two major findings must be emphasized from the current data: UTBB could be of major interest for the early detection of a B cell malignancy; heterogeneity of myeloma bone condition is unexpected. If some changes appear directly related to the tumour (i.e. excessive OR or osteoblastic dysfunction), some others are probably accidentally associated with it (i.e. osteoporosis), both needing treatment other than chemotherapy.","['Bataille, R', 'Chappard, D', 'Alexandre, C', 'Dessauw, P', 'Sany, J']","['Bataille R', 'Chappard D', 'Alexandre C', 'Dessauw P', 'Sany J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Resorption/etiology', 'Bone and Bones/*pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance/diagnosis', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis/pathology', 'Paraproteinemias/complications/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Prospective Studies']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1986.136 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1986 Jun;53(6):805-10. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1986.136.,,,PMC2001420,,,,,,,,,

When labeled tiazofurin was incubated with leukocytes obtained from healthy volunteers or from leukemic patients (acute non-lymphocytic leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia), the TAD production was 27.0 +/- 8.3, 551.3 +/- 71.8 and 755.9 +/- 94.1 pmoles/10(9) cells per hr, respectively. Thus, the leukemic cells produced over 20-fold higher concentrations of TAD than the normal leukocytes. Incubation with tiazofurin in leukemic leukocytes decreased the GTP pools (to 48-79%), whereas there was no change in the normal leukocytes. These results indicate a selectivity of response to tiazofurin in human normal and leukemic leukocytes. The procedure reported in this work may be suitable as a rapid predictive test for the sensitivity of leukemic leukocytes to tiazofurin. Such a diagnostic test should be helpful in identifying neoplastic cells sensitive to tiazofurin in the Phase II trials now being developed.","['Jayaram, H N', 'Pillwein, K', 'Nichols, C R', 'Hoffman, R', 'Weber, G']","['Jayaram HN', 'Pillwein K', 'Nichols CR', 'Hoffman R', 'Weber G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '83285-83-0 (thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/analysis/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Ribonucleosides/*metabolism']",1986/06/15 00:00,1986/06/15 00:01,['1986/06/15 00:00'],"['1986/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(86)90737-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(86)90737-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1986 Jun 15;35(12):2029-32. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(86)90737-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The radiation responses of the very radiosensitive, repair-deficient S/S variant during the G1- and early S phases of the cell cycle were found to be unlike those of normally radioresistant cells in culture: the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) did not increase with the linear energy transfer (LET infinity) of the incident radiation. Such behavior could be anticipated for a cell which is lacking the repair system that operates in other (normal) cells when they are exposed to ionizing radiations in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The S/S variant does exhibit a peak of radioresistance to X-photons mid-G1 + 8 h into the cell cycle, however, and as the LET infinity was increased, the repair capacity responsible for that radioresistance was reduced progressively. Sensory cells (photoreceptors) in the retina of the New Zealand white (NZW) rabbit are very radioresistant to ionizing radiations, and several years elapsed after localized exposure (e.g., 5-10 Gy) to heavy ions (20Ne, 40Ar) before photoreceptor cells were lost from the retina. During the first few weeks after such irradiations, damage to DNA in the photoreceptor cells was repaired to a point where it could not be demonstrated by reorienting gradient sedimentation under alkaline conditions, a technique that can detect DNA damage produced by less than 0.1 Gy of X-photons. Restitution of DNA structure was not permanent, however, and months or years later, but before loss of photoreceptor cells from the retina could be detected, progressive deterioration of the DNA structure began. Age dependencies of late sequelae from densely ionizing radiations are matters of concern both for the therapeutic uses of radiation and the risk/benefit considerations of environmental exposure, especially in outer space. A pilot experiment with a single acute exposure to 20Ne ions has illustrated the need for careful examination of the role of animal age at the time of irradiation in subsequent tissue responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Lett, J T', 'Cox, A B', 'Bergtold, D S']","['Lett JT', 'Cox AB', 'Bergtold DS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,"['0 (Ions)', '4VB4Y46AHD (Neon)', '67XQY1V3KH (Argon)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'Z4152N8IUI (Silicon)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Argon/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Epithelium/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Ions', 'Iron/*pharmacology', 'Lens, Crystalline/drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Leukemia L5178/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neon/*pharmacology', 'Photoreceptor Cells/drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Rabbits', 'Silicon/*pharmacology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01209679 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 1986;25(1):1-12. doi: 10.1007/BF01209679.,"['CA 10714/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 15184/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NASA: 86234041'],,,,,,,

These results suggest that cases diagnosed in a well-defined population are less severe than those reported in hospital statistics.","['Carli, P M', 'Milan, C', 'Bordes, M', 'Bonhomme, J']","['Carli PM', 'Milan C', 'Bordes M', 'Bonhomme J']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,7909092,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Demography', 'Female', 'France', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/classification/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Sex Ratio']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1986;28(1):23-6.,,Etude de l'incidence de la leucemie lymphoide chronique dans le departement de la Cote-d'Or.,,,,,,,,,,

It is the drug of preference in treatment of chronic myelogenous or granulocytic leukemia because its cytotoxic activity results in primary damage or destruction of hematopoietic cells. Additional effects resulting from the cytotoxicity of busulfan in hematological and other tissues, as documented by both human and animal model studies, include lethality, sterility, teratogenicity, and alteration of immune function. Busulfan has been shown to be mutagenic to microorganisms, mammalian cells in culture, Drosophila, and rodents. This agent is also considered potentially carcinogenic to humans. Various tissue hyperplasia and preneoplastic cells have been observed in animal model studies with busulfan, and case reports on human patients implicate busulfan as the causative agent in induction of secondary malignancies. Reports from human and animal studies of busulfan's cytotoxicity, teratogenicity, carcinogenicity, and mutagenicity have been reviewed. This information may be useful in a quantitative assessment of the effects of this agent and the identification of significant deficiencies in the data base. Demonstration that busulfan induces mutations in both somatic and germ cells suggests the need to assess its risk to humans.","['Bishop, J B', 'Wassom, J S']","['Bishop JB', 'Wassom JS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Teratogens)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Busulfan/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Carcinogens', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Immunity/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mutagens', 'Pregnancy', 'Reproduction/drug effects', 'Teratogens']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-1110(86)90020-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1110(86)90020-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1986 Jul;168(1):15-45. doi: 10.1016/0165-1110(86)90020-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resistance to ADM is associated with an increased number of metacentric chromosomes. With increasing level of drug resistance additional metacentric chromosomes and several chromosomal markers were observed. Furthermore, the C-banding patterns and the heterochromatin distribution differed in resistant, as compared to sensitive cells. When sensitive cells were exposed to a toxic dose of ADM, multiple chromosomal breaks were observed in 62% of cells. In contrast, when ADM resistant cells were exposed to cytotoxic concentrations, the pulverization phenomenon was not observed and 75-80% of cells were without breaks.

We studied and compared phenotypic characteristics of HDLM-2 and L-428 cells before and during induction of differentiation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) using a number of parameters. TPA-treated HDLM-2 and L-428 cultures did not show adhesion to plastic surface or aggregation of cells; the cells did not develop pseudopodia and were not phagocytic. Only a slight increase in the percentage of NBT-positive cells was observed for L-428 cells. TPA led to a cessation of cell proliferation and to a dose-dependent decrease in the number of viable cells in both cell lines. In HDLM-2 and L-428, treatment with TPA induced distinct morphological changes indicative of a partial differentiation along the myeloid cell lineage. In addition, the production and expellation of benzidine-positive, unnucleated particles were observed in HDLM-2 and L-428 cells. The induced isoenzyme profiles of carboxylic esterase and acid phosphatase resembled those found in myelomonocytic leukemia cell lines. Both cell lines were negative for immunological markers of the T- and B-cell lineages, but reacted with several markers associated with the myelomonocytic cell lineages. HDLM-2 cells produced a factor which could induce differentiation in 12 leukemia cell lines. The overall results suggest that Hodgkin and Sternberg-Reed cells constitute a unique cell type and might be derived from cells of the myelomonocytic cell lineage.","['Drexler, H G', 'Gaedicke, G', 'Lok, M S', 'Diehl, V', 'Minowada, J']","['Drexler HG', 'Gaedicke G', 'Lok MS', 'Diehl V', 'Minowada J']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Hexosaminidases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/analysis', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/analysis', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Hexosaminidases/analysis', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Hodgkin Disease/enzymology/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*analysis', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/analysis', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(86)90084-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1986;10(5):487-500. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(86)90084-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,

These recombinant viruses were constructed in an attempt to identify the sequence(s) in the genome of ts1 which contains the critical mutation(s) responsible for the neurovirulence of ts1. Two functionally distinct sequences in the genome of ts1 were found to be responsible for its paralytogenic ability.

The overall risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was 1.3% +/- 0.6% and of solid tumors was 8.3% +/- 1.5% when basal cell carcinomas were included and 6.7% +/- 1.4% when basal cell carcinomas were excluded. No cases of leukemia were documented in patients treated with radiation therapy only. The 12-year estimate of leukemia by treatment was as follows: chemotherapy only 1.4% +/- 2.3%; radiation plus MOPP (mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone) 10.2% +/- 5.2%; radiation plus ABVD (Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) 0; and radiation plus other drug regimens 4.8% +/- 1.6%. The risk of leukemia was particularly high (15.5% +/- 7.4%) in patients who received salvage MOPP after radiation failure.

The capacity of B700 to function as a tumor-specific transplantation antigen (TSTA) is demonstrated in this study. This activity has been titrated, and it is shown that mice immunized with B700 are able to significantly inhibit the growth of B16 F10 melanomas after subcutaneous challenge; immunized mice can also inhibit the establishment and growth of experimental metastases in the lungs after i.v. challenge with B16 melanoma cells. The TSTA was found to cross-protect also against challenge with two other murine melanoma lines, JB/RH and K1735, but was specific in that the growth of two nonmelanoma lines (RBL-5 leukemia and MCA-105 sarcoma) was not affected. B700 is also shown in this study to be unrelated to other known murine tumor antigens, or to murine leukemia virus antigens.

The evidence suggesting this was derived from experiments with C57BL/6 in equilibrium DBA/2 allophenic mice. Within the first few weeks following infection of these mice with the polycythemic NB-tropic strain of Friend virus (FV-P), we observed a rapid shift in the genotypic composition of both red cells and platelets in favor of those of the DBA/2 genotype. Infection with the anemia-inducing strain of Friend virus (FV-A) also resulted in preferential production of DBA/2 strain erythrocytes, but its effect on platelet kinetics was nil. The FV-P- and FV-A-induced change in red cell composition is consistent with the view that erythroid precursors are target cells for Friend virus and that viral infection preferentially stimulates proliferation of susceptible strain (DBA/2) erythroid precursors. As for the platelet shifts induced by FV-P (and not FV-A), we believe the changes in platelet mosaicism also could be caused by viral-induced proliferation of DBA/2 platelet precursors, or more primitive progenitors, over the C57BL/6 ones. Thus, these results implicate the existence of nonerythroid target cells for FV-P-induced proliferation, as well as the existence of genetic differences between strains C57BL/6 and DBA/2 that modulate the responsiveness of such cells to infection.","['Eldridge, P W', 'Dewey, M J']","['Eldridge PW', 'Dewey MJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['EC 5.3.1.9 (Glucose-6-Phosphate Isomerase)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Platelets/*physiology', 'Erythrocytes/enzymology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Genotype', 'Glucose-6-Phosphate Isomerase/blood', 'Growth', 'Helper Viruses', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL/genetics', 'Mice, Inbred DBA/genetics', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/*genetics', 'Mosaicism', 'Platelet Count']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1986 Jun;14(5):380-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The compounds studied were phthalic anhydride, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, butyl benzyl phthalate, diallyl phthalate, di(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate, and 2-ethylhexyl sulfate (sodium salt). Estimated maximum tolerable doses and fractionally lower doses of each compound were administered to groups of 50 male and 50 female rats and mice for 2 years, followed by sacrifice, necropsy, and histopathological examination of major organs and tissues. The low toxic potencies of most of the compounds allowed for relatively high doses to be given during the chronic studies. In general, the toxic manifestations of the PAEs were closely correlated with their ester substituents. Although many of the PAEs possessed some carcinogenic activity, target sites for such effects were dissimilar, suggesting the absence of a common mode of action. In contrast, all of the 2-ethylhexyl-containing compounds studied possessed some hepatocarcinogenic activity, indicating that this moiety may have a propensity for causing hepatocarcinogenesis in mice, particularly those of the female sex. The 2-ethylhexyl compound that caused the greatest hepatocarcinogenic response in mice, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, was also hepatocarcinogenic in rats. Similarly, those with a relatively greater effect in female mice were also active in male mice. Thus, sex and species differences in 2-ethylhexyl-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents are probably quantitative rather than qualitative in nature.","['Kluwe, W M']",['Kluwe WM'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Adipates)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Hexanols)', '0 (Organophosphates)', '0 (Phthalic Acids)', '0 (Plasticizers)', '126-92-1 (tergemist)', '2BD76YG9SI (dioctyl adipate)', 'BQC0BKB72S (tris(2-ethylhexyl)phosphate)', 'C42K0PH13C (Diethylhexyl Phthalate)']",IM,"['Adipates/toxicity', 'Animals', '*Carcinogens', 'Diethylhexyl Phthalate/toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Hexanols/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/chemically induced', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/chemically induced', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/chemically induced', 'Organophosphates/toxicity', 'Phthalic Acids/*toxicity', 'Plasticizers/*toxicity', 'Rats', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.8665271 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1986 Mar;65:271-8. doi: 10.1289/ehp.8665271.,,,PMC1474699,,,,,,,,,

In order to obtain PG derivatives which have more potent antitumor activity than PGA1 and PGJ2, we synthesized a number of alkylidenecyclopentenone PGs and studied the antitumor activity of these compounds in vitro and in vivo. delta 7-PGA1, 12-epi-delta 7-PGA1, and delta 12,14-PGJ2 showed 50% inhibitory concentrations of 0.3 microgram/ml against the growth of L1210 culture cells. These compounds are several times more cytotoxic than parent compounds. From a structure-activity relationship analysis, we concluded that, as for PGA derivatives: (a) a double bond in C7-8 potentiates the cytotoxicity; (b) a 15-hydroxy group is not essential for cytotoxicity; (c) the stereochemistry of R2 chain is not essential, while 12-epi derivatives also have full activity; (d) a double bond in C12-13 seems to be essential for full activity, and for PGJ derivatives a double bond in C12-13 and C14-15 potentiates the cytotoxicity. These compounds showed marked antitumor activity against Ehrlich ascites tumor in vivo. At doses of 20-30 mg/kg/day three or five consecutive i.p. treatments with these compounds resulted in a 66 to 111% increase in life span with long-term survivors. A single i.p. injection with 12-epi-delta 7-PGA1 (100 mg/kg) resulted in 73% increase in life span with 33% of long-term survivors, indicating an activity comparable to that of cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg). However, delta 7-PGA1 and 12-epi-delta 7-PGA1 were marginally effective against P388 leukemia.

Previous work in our laboratories had revealed indications of collateral sensitivity and therapeutic synergism for selected murine tumor models treated with tiazofurin alone or in combination with an antimetabolite or an alkylating agent. Elucidation by others of biochemical indicators of tiazofurin activity provided the rationale for extending our studies to include the tiazofurin combinations reported here. Young, adult, female, BALB/c X DBA/2 F1 mice bearing body burdens of about 4 X 10(7) cells at the start of treatment were used. Cells were implanted either i.p. or s.c. Tiazofurin plus cisplatin or the 5'-palmitate of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) was evaluated against the parent P388/O leukemia line. Tiazofurin plus 6-thioguanine was evaluated against the ara-C-resistant P388. All drug treatments were i.p. injections given daily for 9 days. The experimental design permitted comparison of optimal nontoxic single-agent and two-drug combination regimens on the basis of the estimated log10 change in tumor cell burden at the end of treatment. Concurrent untreated control mice bearing tumor burdens ranging from approximately one to 10(7) cells permitted estimates of cells surviving treatment. Optimal treatment with each of these combinations afforded tumor burden reductions that were greater by 1 to 7 orders of magnitude than the effects of the respective single agents. Optimal single-agent and combination dosages (mg per kg per dose) were as follows: tiazofurin, 500; cisplatin, 2.0; the 5'-palmitate of ara-C, 25; 6-thioguanine, 0.8; tiazofurin, 330 plus cisplatin, 0.58; tiazofurin, 220 plus the 5'-palmitate of ara-C, 20; tiazofurin, 100 plus 6-thioguanine, 0.8. The observed therapeutic synergism of these drugs with tiazofurin in animal models suggests the possibility that treatment with tiazofurin combinations may yield clinical results superior to those obtained with the single agents alone. Therapeutic synergism can be most readily maximized when biochemical markers of drug action are available to provide appropriate clinical-laboratory correlations. Extension of these approaches to the use of tiazofurin, for which biochemical markers and experimental combination chemotherapy leads are now available, would support the rational clinical development of tiazofurin combinations.","['Harrison, S D Jr', ""O'Dwyer, P J"", 'Trader, M W']","['Harrison SD Jr', ""O'Dwyer PJ"", 'Trader MW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '78QVZ7RG8L (sparfosic acid)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'N919E46723 (Phosphonoacetic Acid)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Aspartic Acid/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Phosphonoacetic Acid/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Ribavirin/*administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Ribonucleosides/*administration & dosage', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage']",1986/07/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Jul;46(7):3396-400.,"['N01-CM-47580/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-97309/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of MBL-2 tumor-bearing mice with CY (50-200 mg/kg) caused a dose- and time-dependent decrease in the i.p. tumor burden, which correlated with a significant increase in their median survival time. CY increased also the sensitivity of the residual MBL-2 tumor cells to Mo-mediated immunotherapy. The therapeutic efficacy of Mo-mediated immunotherapy with MVE-2, however, was restricted due to adverse effects of CY on the host's immune and hematopoietic functions. The time sequence with which these CY related positive effects on tumor burden and s(Tu)I, as well as the adverse effects on macrophages and hematopoietic functions occurred, gives sufficient explanation for the narrow window in time for successful immunotherapy with MVE-2 after preceding chemotherapy with CY.

Females tend to be susceptible and die sooner than males, where a significant proportion of animals survives longer than age-matched controls. This prolongation of life appears to be due to a failure of the leukemic state to be mobilized in the TS-exposed males. Exposure of both the females and the males to the TS does not induce significant detectable immunological reactivity against the leukemic cells for several parameters tested, possibly due to a significant enhancement of suppressor activity in the serum of the chronically exposed animals over and above that which also occurs in age-matched control animals.","['Nguyen, D T', 'Keast, D']","['Nguyen DT', 'Keast D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['0 (Smoke)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Antibody Formation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*etiology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR/*physiology', '*Plants, Toxic', 'Sex Factors', 'Smoke', '*Tobacco']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Jul;46(7):3334-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resting PMNL oxidized a mean of 6.8 attomoles (amol) DCFH/cell/15 min, with no difference between normal or patients' PMNL. PMA-stimulated normal PMNL oxidized 183 +/- 35 amol/cell (mean +/- SD, n = 120). In patients' PMNL obtained before chemotherapy, the mean DCFH oxidation was not significantly different from controls (216 +/- 78 amol/cell). However, 11 of 22 samples revealed populations of granulocytes with increased (primed) oxidative responses; seven of these 11 patients had proven or suspected infection at presentation. At recovery from chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, PMNL from 19 of 21 patients possessed one or more significant subpopulations with primed oxidation in response to PMA. In these 19 patients, 61% +/- 8% of PMNL comprised primed populations that oxidized 503 +/- 46 amol/cell. Oxidative activity was most pronounced in patients with proven or clinically suspected infections (with 41% +/- 9% of PMNL oxidizing 615 +/- 79 amol/cell). However, oxidative responses to PMA were also significantly increased in recovery PMNL from ten patients without clinical or laboratory evidence of active infection (79% +/- 11% of PMNL primed to oxidize 402 +/- 29 amol/cell). The peak responses of the primed subpopulations were short-lived and generally lasted three days or less, although oxidative responses remained elevated above normal for a week or more. All of the patients with increased PMNL responsiveness survived their hospitalization. In contrast, PMNL from four patients had a significant population (18% to 82% of cells) with reduced responsiveness. Two of these four patients (with 71% and 75% subnormal cells) died during this induction attempt; the third died during a second induction attempt; only one survived to discharge. The clinical significance of these phenomena is yet to be determined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Powell, B L', 'Olbrantz, P', 'Bicket, D', 'Bass, D A']","['Powell BL', 'Olbrantz P', 'Bicket D', 'Bass DA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Agranulocytosis/*chemically induced', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/blood/*chemically induced', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Time Factors']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69928-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1986 Jun;67(6):1624-30.,"['AI10732/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI14929/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Serum protein electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis revealed the presence of monoclonal gammopathy in 12 patients (12.5%). Of the remaining 84 patients, a polyclonal rise in serum immunoglobulins was present in 27 (32%) while a further 16 (19%) had low immunoglobulin levels. The direct antiglobulin test was positive in eight out of 98 patients tested (8.1%), and organ and non-organ specific autoantibodies were present in 15 out of 67 patients tested (22.3%).

When treated cells are washed free of the ligand with fresh media they cascade into a high S phase in 5 hrs. Furthermore, after exposure of L1210 cells to vibriobactin (10 microM) for 5 hrs followed by removal of the drug, cells display different doubling times relative to untreated controls, with lower bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation and no apparent cell death as shown by a 51Cr release assay.

In this report, the effects of THP on cell growth, cell cycle traverse and colony-forming ability of RPMI-8402 cells were investigated in comparison with ADM. The growth-inhibitory effect of THP was equal or superior to that of ADM in this system. Analysis of the DNA histogram obtained by flow cytometry showed that THP exerted its growth-inhibitory effect by blocking cells at the G2 phase. At higher concentrations, THP inhibited the traverse of cells through the S phase and further through the whole cell cycle completely. These effects were quite similar to those of ADM, which suggested a similar mechanism of action for the two drugs from the aspect of the cell cycle. A follow-up study of cells accumulated at the G2 phase and a study on colony-forming ability revealed that the G2 phase accumulation was an irreversible and fatal effect of THP, so that G2-phase accumulation could be considered as a cytocidal effect of THP, indicating the clinical usefulness of this system for evaluation of the drug effect. From these results and the low cardiotoxicity, it was suggested that THP could be a good candidate for use as an antitumor agent in clinics.","['Takamoto, S', 'Ota, K']","['Takamoto S', 'Ota K']",['jpn'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

This study also provides the opportunity for serial studies of numerous sequential biopsies. Large numbers of cases with sequential biopsies covering the entire long course are essential to appreciate the full spectrum of tissue changes in this disease. The PVSG was initiated in 1967 and in mid-1985 approximately one third of the patients are alive and on protocol. For these reasons, the results must still be considered preliminary. Pretreatment biopsies from patients randomized in the PVSG have been analyzed for total cellularity, megakaryocyte concentration, and reticulin content. Considerable variation in these elements was found in these biopsies. Sequential posttreatment biopsies from these patients have also been studied and correlated with the clinical course of the disease. None of the morphologic parameters analyzed was shown to be of prognostic significance. Early in the course of PV the marrow reticulin content is almost always normal. The length of the developmental stage is unknown and the precise timing of the clinical onset may be difficult. Therefore, the 11% of patients that showed a significant increase in reticulin on initial evaluation may have had PV longer than was indicated clinically. If large numbers of sequential biopsies are studied, an increase in reticulin content can frequently be demonstrated during the active phase of the disease and before the onset of the spent phase. Currently 39 patients (9%) have developed the spent phase, or PPMM. PPMM occurred in about the same incidence in the patients treated with myelosuppressive therapy as by phlebotomy alone, the spent phase occurring in 16 patients treated by phlebotomy alone, 11 with chlorambucil, and 12 with 32P. The course of the reticulin fibrosis is slowly progressive. There is some evidence for regression in a few patients in the erythrocytotic phase, but sampling variation cannot be completely ruled out. At this time in the study, AL has developed in 37 patients (8.6%). The incidence of AL is quite low in the phlebotomy group (three cases). Presumably this represents the natural incidence in PV unmodified by therapeutic agents. The frequency is approximately equal and quite high in the chlorambucil and 32P groups. There are 19 cases in the chlorambucil-treated group and 15 in the 32P-treated group. The leukemias that developed in the PV patients occurred either de novo or following PPMM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Ellis, J T', 'Peterson, P', 'Geller, S A', 'Rappaport, H']","['Ellis JT', 'Peterson P', 'Geller SA', 'Rappaport H']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '0 (Reticulin)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Bloodletting/trends', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Chlorambucil/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*complications', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced/*complications', 'Megakaryocytes/physiopathology', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes/therapeutic use', 'Polycythemia Vera/complications/*pathology/therapy', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*etiology/pathology', 'Reticulin/analysis/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Hematol. 1986 Apr;23(2):144-55.,['CA 10728/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Although polycythemia vera and the other myeloproliferative diseases are relatively uncommon, the PVSG was able to accumulate well over 1,000 patients with these various disorders and to study them according to a total of 15 different protocols. PVSG-01, a long-term randomized controlled study of phlebotomy alone compared with the myelosuppressive agents, 32P or chlorambucil supplemented by phlebotomy, continues to receive follow-up data on 93% of surviving patients 18 years after initiation of the study. During its lifetime, PVSG has developed a widely accepted and highly effective set of criteria for the specific diagnosis of polycythemia vera as well as useful criteria for the diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia. It has gathered an enormous volume of data on the natural history of the myeloproliferative diseases and in particular on the nature of the prevalent complications, such as thrombotic events and hematologic and nonhematologic malignancies. With respect to the final question, the optimal treatment for polycythemia vera, it is apparent that the expectation of a single optimal therapy that would apply to all patients at all ages and stages of the disease was naive. Nevertheless considerable progress has been made. Moreover, the group has defined more precisely than ever before the nature of the complications of the disease and the association of the risks of specific complications with specific forms of therapy. It thus has made it possible to pose the next series of therapeutic questions that must be addressed in this disorder with a greater degree of sophistication than was previously possible.","['Berk, P D', 'Goldberg, J D', 'Donovan, P B', 'Fruchtman, S M', 'Berlin, N I', 'Wasserman, L R']","['Berk PD', 'Goldberg JD', 'Donovan PB', 'Fruchtman SM', 'Berlin NI', 'Wasserman LR']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Age Factors', 'Bloodletting/trends', 'Chlorambucil/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/complications', 'Gout/complications/drug therapy', 'Hematocrit', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Platelet Aggregation/drug effects', 'Platelet Count', 'Polycythemia Vera/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pruritus/complications/drug therapy', 'Skin Neoplasms/complications', 'Thrombosis/etiology']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Hematol. 1986 Apr;23(2):132-43.,['CA-10728/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The inhibitory activity is produced and secreted by CLL cells in vitro. In the present study the inhibitory activity was partially purified from short-term cultures of monoclonal leukaemic B-CLL cells. On gel filtration the calculated molecular weight was apparently 30,000. By anion exchange chromatography, the inhibitory factor was recovered in the fractions that eluted with 0.3 mol/l NaCl. The active material applied to preparative agarose gel electrophoresis migrated towards the anode. The inhibitory factor was totally destroyed by trypsin. In addition it bound to concanavalin A-Sepharose. These properties indicate that the inhibitory factor is a glycoprotein. Antibodies against the isolated inhibitory factor were raised in rabbits. CLL serum was separated by means of gel filtration and the inhibitory activity was recovered in the pool with a molecular weight of approximately 30,000. The activity was completely neutralized by the antibodies raised against the CLL-cell-derived inhibitor, indicating the similarity between this and the serum-derived inhibitor.

The more increased PC III values were observed in spent polycythaemia cases initially treated by phlebotomy alone. Follow-up showed a transformation into myeloid metaplasia. In contrast, PC III remained stable in patients treated with radiophosphorus 32P or hydroxyurea who did not transform. In myeloid metaplasia, results of PC III were significantly higher than in controls or polycythaemia vera cases. Myelofibrosis of recent onset (less than 2 years) gave higher values than chronic myelofibrosis. Increased PC III values were also emphasized in chronic myelocytic leukaemia, and in a few cases of refractory anaemia with excess of blasts, hairy cell leukaemia and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.","['Arrago, J P', 'Poirier, O', 'Chomienne, C', ""D'Agay, M F"", 'Najean, Y']","['Arrago JP', 'Poirier O', 'Chomienne C', ""D'Agay MF"", 'Najean Y']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,"['0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Procollagen)']",IM,"['Bone Diseases/blood/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Peptide Fragments/blood', 'Polycythemia/blood/diagnosis', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/blood/*diagnosis', 'Procollagen/*blood']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1986.tb01736.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1986 Mar;36(3):288-94. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1986.tb01736.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the remaining cells often have long generation times or may even be in G0 condition, they may form a new tumor mass. This can be explained by cell kinetics alone, or by an escape from immunologic or other control mechanisms, or by a new promoting event. Maintenance chemotherapy beyond the first 6 months seemed only to have an effect where induction chemotherapy was weak and palliative, but not since it has become intensive and sometimes curative: it only increases the relapse incubation time, not the survival. Relapse cells may be refractory to cytostatics previously not given, in part because of alternative metabolic pathways or enzyme induction, in part because of tumor cell progression, and any chemotherapy seems to be able to play a significant role in this progression. The result is a relatively high residual tumor mass and a short duration of rare second remissions. Adjuvant immunotherapy, despite controversies about its results, seems to work in some tumors, but the statistical methods applied and the monitoring have been criticized. The strategy proposed for potentially 'curable' tumors (leukemias, lymphomas, embryomas) with short cell generation times is therefore intensive remission induction aiming at the smallest possible residual disease cell number. It is conceivable that this induction might mean accepting risks comparable to those accepted for transplant patients. Manipulation of the bioimmunological response can be effective even against cells in the G0 phase.

The following tests were performed: mitotic and metaphasic index, doubling time of tumor, incorporation of tritiated thymidine into DNA, cell cycle parameters and growth fraction. The increased rate of cell proliferation measured was predominantly due to the higher speed of DNA biosynthesis with a minor contribution by an increase of the growth fraction. In the animals with hypothalamic lesions we demonstrated a slight decrease in the secretory activity of the adenohypophysis. Because it is generally stated that failure of hypophysis function hinders cell multiplication in normal and neoplastic tissues, we think that heightened cell proliferation after hypothalamic lesions is due to suppression of an inhibitory mechanism located in the hypothalamus and which is independent of the hypophysis.","['Bindoni, M', 'Belluardo, N', 'Marchese, A E', 'Cardile, V', 'Mudo, G', 'Cella, S', 'Laguidara, A', 'Denatale, G']","['Bindoni M', 'Belluardo N', 'Marchese AE', 'Cardile V', 'Mudo G', 'Cella S', 'Laguidara A', 'Denatale G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Neuroendocrinology,Neuroendocrinology,0035665,['9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Growth Hormone/blood', 'Hypothalamus, Middle/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/blood/*pathology', 'Radio Waves', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Sarcoma, Yoshida/pathology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000124479 [doi]'],ppublish,Neuroendocrinology. 1986;42(5):407-15. doi: 10.1159/000124479.,,,,,,,,,,,,

We measured the DNA content of bone marrow cells with flow cytometry in 19 hematologically normal subjects and in 70 patients who had recently been diagnosed as having myelodysplasia. Thirty-four of the patients were found to have aneuploidy. This was not related to the percentage of blast cells in the bone marrow, and there was no demarcation in terms of DNA content between patients with a high percentage of blast cells and those with a low percentage of such cells. Patients with hypodiploid marrow cells had a significantly shorter survival time than other patients (P = 0.001). Patients with hyperdiploid marrow and those whose marrow had a normal DNA content had similar survival times. Hypodiploidy appears to be a better indicator of poor survival than the marrow blast-cell count. Patients with sideroblastic anemia invariably had cells with a normal or high DNA content; none of these patients died during the study. Our data suggest that there is a relation between the loss of chromosomal material and progression toward a leukemic phenotype.

We have compared the metabolism and some of the metabolic effects of neplanocin A and synthetic (+/-)-aristeromycin (C-Ado) in murine leukemia L1210 cells in culture. C-Ado, as shown earlier, was not only converted to its own phosphates but also was metabolized to phosphates of carbocyclic guanosine. Both rapidly proliferating and slowly proliferating or resting cells phosphorylated C-Ado, but C-Ado was not converted to phosphates of carbocyclic guanosine in detectable amounts in cells whose growth had reached a plateau. When the metabolism of neplanocin and C-Ado was examined in the same experiment, both analogs were converted to the triphosphate analogs of ATP; no conversion of neplanocin A to the corresponding carbocyclic analogs of guanine nucleotides was detected, whereas C-Ado was converted to the carbocyclic analog of GTP in amounts that approximated the GTP pool. This difference in metabolism was associated with a marked difference in effects of the two analogs on the utilization of hypoxanthine and guanine which was inhibited by C-Ado but not by neplanocin. The failure of neplanocin A to be converted to analogs of guanine nucleotides apparently is the result of poor capacity of its monophosphate to serve as a substrate for AMP deaminase; the Vmax for deamination of neplanocin-5'-monophosphate by this enzyme was only 5% of that for C-Ado monophosphate. In contrast, neplanocin A was a better substrate than C-Ado for adenosine deaminase.","['Bennett, L L Jr', 'Allan, P W', 'Rose, L M', 'Comber, R N', 'Secrist, J A 3rd']","['Bennett LL Jr', 'Allan PW', 'Rose LM', 'Comber RN', 'Secrist JA 3rd']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Hypoxanthines)', '19186-33-5 (aristeromycin)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '72877-50-0 (neplanocin A)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.6 (AMP Deaminase)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['AMP Deaminase/metabolism', 'Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Adenosine Deaminase/metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Guanine/metabolism', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Hypoxanthine', 'Hypoxanthines/metabolism', 'Isomerism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice']",1986/04/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1986 Apr;29(4):383-90.,['R01 CA35671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to aldophosphamide (3a), which readily interconverts with its cyclic isomer 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide (2a), phenylketophosphamide (14a: R1 = H, R2 = R3 = CH2CH2Cl) exhibited an apparent ""resistance"" toward an intramolecular addition reaction such that 4-hydroxy-4-phenylcyclophosphamide (13a) could not be detected either spectroscopically (31P or 13C NMR) or chemically (NaCN trapping experiment). Control studies that compared the relative reactivities of 14a and methylketophosphamide [20: CH3C(O)CH2CH2OP(O)NH2N-(CH2CH2Cl)2] revealed that the factors that modulate the ring closure/opening reactions were not peculiar to the phenyl group; however, differences between phenyl and methyl profoundly influenced the rates of fragmentation of 14a and 20. 31P NMR spectroscopy was used to determine the rates at which each compound generated a cytotoxic alkylating agent.

Whereas compounds 1, 2, and 4-6 had no inhibitory effect on the replication of murine L1210 cells in cell culture, compound 3 [(3'-AdThd)2PtCl2] inhibited these cells with an ED50 of 0.8 microM. Incubation of L1210 cells with 10-20 microM compound 3 for 2 h produced less than 18% inhibition of RNA, DNA, or protein synthesis, which is of questionable significance. However a 16-h incubation resulted in an increased uptake of labeled thymidine into DNA (77%), labeled uridine into RNA (17%), and labeled amino acids into protein (100%). These unexpected results indicate that inhibition of macromolecules may not be involved in the inhibition of the replication of L1210 cells. The increased incorporation of labeled metabolites into macromolecules may be related to the increase in cell volume after a 2-h incubation of L1210 cells with compound 3 plus a marked increase after 2 h in the proportion of cells in their S phase. Compound 3 appears to delay the progression of cells through their cell cycle. A marked inhibitory effect on the transport of methionine or aminoisobutyric acid into L1210 cells was found with compound 3, which was slightly greater than that produced with cisplatin. Compound 3 had a dose-dependent effect on the survival of mice bearing the L1210 ascites neoplasm, with a T/C X 100 of 175 at a dose of 320 mg/kg. Investigation of the kinetics of decomposition in aqueous systems demonstrated that the primary UV-absorbing decomposition product is 3'-amino-3'-deoxythymidine and that only a limited amount of the compound is formed (less than 8%). Although 3'-amino-3'-deoxythymidine could account for a part of the inhibition of the replication of L1210 cells in culture, it cannot account for the inhibition of amino acid transport by compound 3, the platinum complex of 3'-amino-3'-deoxythymidine. Compound 3 has been shown to limit part of the amino acid uptake into L1210 cells in a similar manner to cisplatin.","['Lin, T S', 'Zhou, R X', 'Scanlon, K J', 'Brubaker, W F Jr', 'Lee, J J', 'Woods, K', 'Humphreys, C', 'Prusoff, W H']","['Lin TS', 'Zhou RX', 'Scanlon KJ', 'Brubaker WF Jr', 'Lee JJ', 'Woods K', 'Humphreys C', 'Prusoff WH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Nucleosides', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Sarcoma 180/drug therapy']",1986/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00155a017 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1986 May;29(5):681-6. doi: 10.1021/jm00155a017.,"['CA-05262/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28852/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA-09085/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Probit analysis was used to derive lethalities (LD50s) from data obtained in the process of testing anti-cancer agents in mice. These data were compared with those derived from testing those same agents in normal mice and it was found that a correlation exists between the two toxicities. Toxicities derived from NCI testing in normal animals were compared with published values and a similar correlation was found.

Male weanling rats were injected i.p. with DEN (200 mg/kg body wt). Control rats were injected with saline. Five days after the injection, the rats were placed on different diets containing 0.05% PhB or 0.05% DDT with or without added 1.5% DL-methionine or 1.0% choline chloride. Each diet was administered for 72 weeks, when the animals were placed on the unsupplemented chow diet for an additional 30 weeks. Rats treated with DEN and then fed PhB or DDT developed an 85-100% incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Single injection of DEN alone produced a 60% incidence of HCCs. Dietary feeding of methionine and choline either alone or in combination with PhB or DDT did not have any significant effect on the incidence of HCC's. Liver tumor formation was negligible in uninitiated rats. Lung metastases developed in 42% and 46% of the DEN + PhB- and DEN + DDT-treated groups, respectively. Supplementation of methionine in the diet lowered the incidence of lung metastases to 14% in the DEN + PhB-treated rats and to 19% in DEN + DDT-treated rats. Choline was not effective in inhibiting the development of lung metastases in either case. The injection of DEN alone produced a 54% incidence of lung tumors. PhB and DDT feeding lowered the DEN-induced lung tumor incidence to 23% and 14% respectively. Further, when the data from different diet groups were combined it was found that single injection of DEN also doubled the incidence of leukemia normally seen in F344 rats. The present report constitutes the first evidence that a single injection of DEN induces lung tumors and enhances the incidence of leukemia in rats.","['Shivapurkar, N', 'Hoover, K L', 'Poirier, L A']","['Shivapurkar N', 'Hoover KL', 'Poirier LA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Phb protein, rat)', '0 (Prohibitins)', '3IQ78TTX1A (Diethylnitrosamine)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'CIW5S16655 (DDT)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)', 'YQE403BP4D (Phenobarbital)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/chemically induced', 'Animals', 'Choline/*pharmacology', '*Cocarcinogenesis', '*DDT', '*Diethylnitrosamine', 'Liver Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Lung Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Methionine/*pharmacology', '*Phenobarbital', 'Prohibitins', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Weaning']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/7.4.547 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1986 Apr;7(4):547-50. doi: 10.1093/carcin/7.4.547.,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate whether metabolic inactivation ov the compounds might be a factor in the lack of in vivo cytotoxicity we have co-cultured rat hepatocytes with A204 rhabdomyosarcoma and murine P388 leukemia cell lines in the soft agarose colony formation assay for 24 h during exposure to the compounds. Twenty compounds with a range of in vitro activities were studied. Thirteen compounds exhibited cytotoxicity against A204 cells in culture; nine of them were less active when co-cultured with hepatocytes, two were activated by hepatocyte co-culture, and two showed no effect of hepatocyte co-culture. P388 cells were more sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of the compounds than A204 cells. Two compounds that were not active against A204 cells exhibited cytotoxicity against P388 cells. One compound was inactivated by hepatocyte co-culture and one showed no effect. Five compounds showed no cytotoxicity toward either A204 cells or P388 cells. Two of the compounds showing hepatocyte inactivation in vitro possess activity in one or more in vivo tumor models. Thus, evidence for metabolic inactivation in hepatocyte co-culture is not always an indication for lack of in vivo antitumor activity. Hepatocyte co-culture methodology provides a simple and objective means, amenable to large-scale screening, of distinguishing metabolic activation or inactivation of a given compound from other pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors with a minimum of material.","['Appel, P L', 'Alley, M C', 'Lieber, M M', 'Shoemaker, R', 'Powis, G']","['Appel PL', 'Alley MC', 'Lieber MM', 'Shoemaker R', 'Powis G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Humans', 'Inactivation, Metabolic', 'Leukemia P388', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma', '*Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00299865 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1986;17(1):47-52. doi: 10.1007/BF00299865.,"['CA 36512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CMO-7419/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Activities of two lysosomal (acid phosphatase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase) and one cytoplasmic non-lysosomal (LDH) enzymes were determined. It has been found that in cells arrested by HU or excess dThR, a progressive cell volume increase with protein/DNA imbalance is correlated with a progressive increase in lysosomal and non-lysosomal hydrolase activities in the cells and in the medium and with a marked lethal effect. Cell volume increase, enhancement of enzyme activities and cell killing could be prevented in HU-arrested cells by concomitant addition of excess dNR (deoxyadenosine, deoxyguanosine, thymidine, deoxycytidine) leading to equal inhibition of DNA and protein synthesis. Control-like values of all parameters were achieved also in cells in which the dThR-inhibiting effect was reversed by dCR addition. It is suggested that a common pathway in the mode of action of the chemotherapeutic agents inducing cell killing through the state of unbalanced growth can be the over-production, abnormal accumulation and progressive leakage of numerous hydrolytic enzymes through the cell membranes, leading in consequence to 'lytic' cell death.","['Malec, J', 'Przybyszewski, W M', 'Grabarczyk, M', 'Sitarska, E', 'Czartoryska, B']","['Malec J', 'Przybyszewski WM', 'Grabarczyk M', 'Sitarska E', 'Czartoryska B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Hexosaminidases)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (Acetylglucosaminidase)']",IM,"['Acetylglucosaminidase/*metabolism', 'Acid Phosphatase/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Cytoplasm/enzymology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Hexosaminidases/*metabolism', 'Hydrolysis', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Lysosomes/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0009-2797(86)90006-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0009-2797(86)90006-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 1986 Mar;57(3):315-24. doi: 10.1016/0009-2797(86)90006-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,

B. Townsend et al, INSERM 81:37, 1978). Growth of L1210 cells in vitro was inhibited equally by TCN and TCN-P. A requirement for adenosine kinase activity for activation of both TCN and TCN-P was established by the observation that growth inhibition by either compound was decreased 200-fold by the adenosine kinase inhibitor 5-iodotubercidin and greater than 5000-fold in L1210/T, an adenosine kinase-deficient subline. The TCN/TCN-P resistance of L1210/T cells was correlated with lack of formation of intracellular TCN-P from either TCN or TCN-P. Thus, it appeared that TCN-P was hydrolyzed to TCN and then rephosphorylated intracellularly. Both the horse serum-containing culture medium and the intact cells possessed nucleotide phosphatase activity, which may contribute to the hydrolysis of TCN-P to TCN in the L1210 cell cultures. The requirement for hydrolysis of TCN-P to TCN for formation of intracellular TCN-P from exogenous TCN-P was also shown directly by the observation that human erythrocytes, which lack ectophosphatases, readily formed intracellular TCN-P from TCN but not from TCN-P when incubated in buffer.","['Wotring, L L', 'Crabtree, G W', 'Edwards, N L', 'Parks, R E Jr', 'Townsend, L B']","['Wotring LL', 'Crabtree GW', 'Edwards NL', 'Parks RE Jr', 'Townsend LB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,"['0 (Acenaphthenes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '5L5GE3DV88 (triciribine phosphate)', 'EC 2.7.1.20 (Adenosine Kinase)']",IM,"['Acenaphthenes', 'Adenosine Kinase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Biotransformation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nucleotides/biosynthesis', 'Ribonucleotides/*metabolism/pharmacology']",1986/04/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1986 Apr;70(4):491-7.,"['CA-13943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28381/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28756/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibiting DNA synthesis, TCN-P was more toxic during S-phase of cell cycle. A phase I study was conducted in 24 patients with advanced solid cancers. The drug was given as a slow i.v. injection over 5 min on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 42-day cycle with a 2-week rest. Five dose levels ranging from 12 to 96 mg/m2 were studied with 3 to 12 patients treated at each level; a total of 106 doses was administered. The major hematological toxicity was thrombocytopenia, with a median nadir occurring at Day 34 of the cycle and first appearing at doses greater than 24 mg/m2. Anemia was seen at each dose level occurring between Days 8 and 34. Non-myelosuppressive toxic effects included stomatitis, anorexia, transient fever, nausea and vomiting, and dose-limiting hyperglycemia and diarrhea. The highest tolerated dose was 48 mg/m2. Plasma, pleural fluid, urine, and tissue samples were analyzed for TCN-P and tricyclic nucleoside (TCN) in selected patients by high-performance liquid chromatography.

Autopsy specimens obtained 61 days after therapy showed the highest residues of TCN-P in liver metastases and of TCN in gall bladder, bile, and pancreas. No drug was detected in urine samples of two patients. Prolonged retention and erratic plasma levels of the drug are probably due to extensive enterohepatic circulation, as well as repeated interconversion between TCN-P and TCN within cells.

A marker chromosome M1 was found in all cells in the heterogeneous resistant P388/ADR parental line as well as in the cloned resistant lines P388/ADR/3 and P388/ADR/7; a different marker chromosome M2 was present in the heterogeneous sensitive P388 parental line as well as the cloned sensitive line P388/4. Dose-survival studies showed that D0, the dose of Adriamycin reducing survival to 1/e (i.e., 37% of the initial population), was 33 +/- 5 (SE) nM for sensitive P388/4 cells, 169 +/- 17 nM for resistant P388/ADR/3 cells, and 336 +/- 28 nM for the more resistant P388/ADR/7 cells. Drug uptake in sensitive P388/4 cells was 1.6-fold greater than in resistant P388/ADR/3 cells and 2.1-fold greater than in resistant P388/ADR/7 cells. The number of DNA single-strand breaks produced per microM Adriamycin was 131 +/- 9 rad equivalents in sensitive clone 4 cells, 41 +/- 8 rad equivalents in resistant clone 3 cells, and 33 +/- 11 rad equivalents in resistant clone 7 cells. The number of DNA double-strand breaks per microM Adriamycin was 1721 +/- 126 rad equivalents in sensitive cells, 117 +/- 36 rad equivalents in resistant P388/ADR/3 cells, and 194 +/- 16 rad equivalents in resistant P388/ADR/7 cells. Differences in drug uptake were insufficient to explain the higher incidence of DNA single- and double-strand breaks in sensitive cells. These findings strongly support the concept that resistance to Adriamycin in P388 leukemia cells is multifactorial; however, this study did not resolve whether these changes arise from a single pleiotropic mutation or from multiple mutations. In sensitive P388/4 cells the number of DNA single-strand breaks formed could all be attributed to double-strand breaks. However, in both resistant cell lines the level of induction of single-strand breaks was in excess of that due to double-strand breaks, and this excess of single-strand breaks appeared to vary directly with the degree of resistance, being greater in the more resistant clone 7 cells than in the less resistant clone 3 cells. In both sensitive and resistant cell lines the ratio of true single- to double-strand breaks varied inversely with the concentration of Adriamycin. Finally, the cytotoxic activity of Adriamycin appeared to correlate more closely with formation of DNA double-strand breaks than with single-strand lesions.","['Goldenberg, G J', 'Wang, H', 'Blair, G W']","['Goldenberg GJ', 'Wang H', 'Blair GW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', '*DNA, Neoplasm', '*DNA, Single-Stranded', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Jun;46(6):2978-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have compared the uptake and intracellular effects of cis-1,2-diaminocyclohexanemalonatoplatinum(II) [Pt(mal)(cis-DACH)] and cis-1,2-diaminocyclohexanedichloroplatinum(II) [PtCl2(cis-DACH)] in the L1210 cell line. In the 3-h colony formation assay, PtCl2(cis-DACH) is almost 10 times more cytotoxic than Pt(mal)(cis-DACH). However, when the time of incubation with platinum drug is increased from 3 to 24 h the cytotoxicity of PtCl2(cis-DACH) changes relatively little while the cytotoxicity of Pt(mal)(cis-DACH) increases over 10-fold. As a consequence, Pt(mal)(cis-DACH) is only slightly less cytotoxic than the dichloro compound by 24 h. These data can readily be explained by differences in the time course of uptake. Pt(mal)(cis-DACH) is initially taken by the cell at a much slower rate than PtCl2(cis-DACH), but the uptake continues linearly for at least 24 h with the malonate compound, while uptake for the dichloro compound begins to plateau between 5 and 8 h. The earlier plateauing of PtCl2(cis-DACH) uptake is most likely to be due to a quicker approach to equilibrium between intracellular and extracellular concentrations of unchanged drug which is caused by a more rapid inactivation of PtCl2(cis-DACH) in the media coupled with the more rapid uptake of PtCl2(cis-DACH) by the cells. When compared at equal cytotoxicity, the uptake of platinum into the intracellular pool of low molecular weight platinum compounds is significantly greater for Pt(mal)(cis-DACH) even though the rate of platinum incorporation into DNA is essentially the same for both compounds at early times. These data suggest that a smaller percentage of the low molecular weight platinum is in a reactive form inside the cell for Pt(mal)(cis-DACH). While the inhibition of cell survival exactly parallels incorporation of platinum into DNA for both compounds, there is a significant lag before the onset of inhibition of DNA synthesis for Pt(mal)(cis-DACH). This observation suggests that the conversion of monoadducts to diadducts may be slower for platinum compounds with bidentate leaving ligands.","['Mauldin, S K', 'Husain, I', 'Sancar, A', 'Chaney, S G']","['Mauldin SK', 'Husain I', 'Sancar A', 'Chaney SG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '52351-07-2 (platinum(II) 1,2-diaminocyclohexane malonate)', '52691-24-4 (dichloro-1,2-diaminocyclohexane platinum complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*metabolism/pharmacology']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Jun;46(6):2876-82.,"['5 T32 ES-07126/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 34082/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with DXR (14 mg/kg) significantly decreased myocardial non-protein sulfhydryl content (P less than 0.02) and administration of GSH (500 mg/kg) prevented the drop of non-protein sulfhydryl levels due to DXR treatment. Thus it was considered that administration of exogenous GSH contributes to prevention of the acute myocardial toxicity of DXR by increasing extracellular GSH levels and intracellular GSH synthesis, which detoxifies DXR-oxygen metabolites.

The mean density of T65 antigen on malignant cells was found to influence dramatically the sensitivity of target cells to T101 immunotoxin.","['Laurent, G', 'Kuhlein, E', 'Casellas, P', 'Canat, X', 'Carayon, P', 'Poncelet, P', 'Correll, S', 'Rigal, F', 'Jansen, F K']","['Laurent G', 'Kuhlein E', 'Casellas P', 'Canat X', 'Carayon P', 'Poncelet P', 'Correll S', 'Rigal F', 'Jansen FK']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cell Survival', 'Coloring Agents', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Ricin/*administration & dosage']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 May;46(5):2289-94.,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 5319 cases of primary cancer in childhood were followed until patient death or the end of 1980, and the number of secondary tumors were observed, specifying on diagnosis, age, sex, and time since first tumor diagnosis. A total of 23 secondary tumors was observed (O) against an expected (E) figure of 6.5, corresponding to an O/E ratio of 4.4. The risk varies greatly according to time elapsed since first diagnosis, with the highest risk in close relation to the primary tumor. The second tumor is probably more frequently localized to the skin and brain than elsewhere, and the risk of a second tumor is particularly associated with leukemia and osteosarcoma in childhood.

The decrease of the Na+/K+ value from 3.8:1 to 1:1 leads to inhibition of mRNA synthesis in mRNA cells hybridized at 10(3) greater than Dot greater than 10(4), but weakly affects the transcription of mRNA sequences hybridized with DNA within the Dot interval of 10(3.4)-10(3.8). A similar phenomenon is observed during hybridization of hnRNA with homogeneous fractions of unique and averagely repeating sequences of DNA. The hybridization rate constants of hnRNA synthesized by cells at different values of Na+/K+ and the limit values of hybridization (H infinity) were calculated. It was shown that the rate constants for RNA hybridization with DNA decrease by more than two orders of magnitude during the transition of the averagely repeating DNA fraction to the unique one; however, in both cases these constants give equal values for the RNA synthesized by cells at different cationic balance. The H infinity values for the RNA synthesized by cells at higher Na+ ratio appeared to be 1.5-2.0 times as high as compared with those for the RNA in the cells, in which the Na+/K+ ratio was 1:1. Thus, the monovalent cation ratio seems to exert a strong influence on the expression of sequences of different repeatedness in the genome and to play a role in the regulation of proliferative activity of the cell.","['Danko, I M', 'Prima, V I', ""Kaz'min, S D"", 'Pinchuk, V G']","['Danko IM', 'Prima VI', ""Kaz'min SD"", 'Pinchuk VG']",['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Biokhimiia,"Biokhimiia (Moscow, Russia)",0372667,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Heterogeneous Nuclear)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Leukemia P388/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Potassium/*metabolism', 'RNA, Heterogeneous Nuclear/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sodium/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biokhimiia. 1986 Mar;51(3):458-62.,,Vliianie monovalentnykh kationov na sootnoshenie RNK-transkriptov s raznykh po povtorennosti posledovatel'nostei DNK v kletkakh leikemii P-388.,,,,,,,,,,

Pain is the most common presenting symptom, and neurological function is usually normal at this early stage. The clinical challenge is to detect and treat the spinal disease before the onset of neurological compromise. Myelography has been the standard test for identification of epidural metastases, but the invasive nature of myelography carries inherent risk and produces patient discomfort. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been useful in the evaluation of other spinal diseases, is noninvasive, and is tolerated well by patients. We evaluated and compared MRI (64 studies in 58 patients) to conventional studies (myelography, computed tomography, bone scanning, plain films) and determined its accuracy in diagnosis and efficacy in clinical decision making. MRI proved superior in detecting bone and epidural involvement by tumor and was valuable in clinical decision making. In addition, MRI provided better visualization of paravertebral soft tissue involvement by tumor. MRI is recommended as the initial study in patients with suspected metastatic spinal disease.","['Godersky, J C', 'Smoker, W R', 'Knutzon, R']","['Godersky JC', 'Smoker WR', 'Knutzon R']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Neurosurgery,Neurosurgery,7802914,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Spinal Cord/pathology', 'Spinal Cord Compression/*pathology', 'Spinal Neoplasms/pathology/*secondary', 'Spine/pathology']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1227/00006123-198711000-00013 [doi]'],ppublish,Neurosurgery. 1987 Nov;21(5):676-80. doi: 10.1227/00006123-198711000-00013.,,,,,,,"['Department of Surgery, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City.']",,,,,

In patients with stable disease a significantly lower number of DPP II positive lymphocytes was found. On the other hand, a high number of DPP II positive lymphocytes indicated a progressive disease. Lys-Ala-MNA proved to be a better substrate for these purposes. When comparing these results with the stage of the disease proposed by Rai et al., a good correlation was found for Stages 0, I and II. However, in the Stages III, and particularly in the Stage IV, there was a wide range of DPP II values, although the average value calculated from the data of all patients of this group was high. Patients with low DPP II values had usually a stable disease in spite of thrombocytopenia which precluded them from allocation to Stage IV. It is concluded that the assessment of the number of DPP II positive lymphocytes represents a simple and reliable prognostic criteria in patients with B type CLL.","['Klener, P', 'Lojda, Z', 'Haber, J', 'Kvasnicka, J']","['Klener P', 'Lojda Z', 'Haber J', 'Kvasnicka J']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['EC 3.4.14.- (Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases)', 'EC 3.4.14.2 (dipeptidyl peptidase II)']",IM,"['Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*enzymology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Substrate Specificity']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 1987;34(5):581-6.,,,,,,,"['2nd Department of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czechoslovakia.']",,,,,

It has been isolated from gonadal fluids and characterized as a protein heterodimer consisting of an alpha subunit and one of two beta subunits (beta A or beta B). FSH-releasing protein (FRP), also named activin, is a dimer consisting of two inhibin beta-chains. A factor from conditioned medium of a leukaemia cell line has been isolated which can induce mouse Friend cells to become benzidine-positive, and which shares a similar N-terminal sequence with porcine FRP. In this report, we find that FRP and inhibin modulate both the induction of haemoglobin accumulation in a human erythroleukaemic cell line, K562, and the proliferation of erythroid progenitor cells in human bone marrow culture. These two proteins could constitute a novel humoral regulatory control of erythropoiesis which would involve two types of related protein dimers with functionally opposite effects.","['Yu, J', 'Shao, L E', 'Lemas, V', 'Yu, A L', 'Vaughan, J', 'Rivier, J', 'Vale, W']","['Yu J', 'Shao LE', 'Lemas V', 'Yu AL', 'Vaughan J', 'Rivier J', 'Vale W']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['104625-48-1 (Activins)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)']",IM,"['Activins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Inhibins/*pharmacology']",1987/12/24 00:00,1987/12/24 00:01,['1987/12/24 00:00'],"['1987/12/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/24 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/330765a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1987 Dec 24-31;330(6150):765-7. doi: 10.1038/330765a0.,,,,,,,"['Department of Molecular Biology, Research Institute of Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, California 92037.']",,,,,

In 8 episodes AMPH were used prophylactically for severe neutropenia, and in the remaining 2 it was given when the patients were feverish. A daily dose of 2,400 mg of AMPH was given orally once a day and serum concentrations of AMPH were determined serially with bioassay. Two hours after administration, the mean serum concentration of AMPH rose to 0.15 microgram/ml, and reached 0.27 microgram/ml after 24 hours. The concentration was maintained between 0.23 microgram/ml and 0.39 microgram/ml through the following 7 days. These concentrations exceed the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most strains of Candida albicans. In 8 occasions of prophylactic use, no fungal infection was encountered. In a patient with pneumonia, chest X-ray and physical findings improved with administration of oral AMPH. Side effect of AMPH was seen in 1 patient, which was mild proteinuria and was eased rapidly after the withdrawal of AMPH. Clinical laboratory tests showed 1 case of proteinuria and disorder of kidney but did not clear under influence of AMPH. These results suggest that oral administration of AMPH is clinically and therapeutically effective and relatively safe for the prophylaxis or the treatment of fungal infection in patients with leukemia or related disorders.","['Okuda, T', 'Nishigaki, H', 'Yokota, S', 'Horiike, S', 'Yashige, H', 'Nishida, K', 'Maekawa, T', 'Tsuda, S', 'Taniwaki, M', 'Sonoda, Y']","['Okuda T', 'Nishigaki H', 'Yokota S', 'Horiike S', 'Yashige H', 'Nishida K', 'Maekawa T', 'Tsuda S', 'Taniwaki M', 'Sonoda Y', 'et al.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Jpn J Antibiot,The Japanese journal of antibiotics,0154402,['7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)'],IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Amphotericin B/adverse effects/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/drug therapy/prevention & control']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Jpn J Antibiot. 1987 Sep;40(9):1644-50.,,,,,,,"['3rd Department of Internal Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural, University of Medicine.']",,,,,

In order to evaluate the metabolic stability of the lipid mediators, several radiolabeled diacylglycerols were synthesized and their uptake and intracellular fate in cultured HL-60 (human promyelocytic leukemia) cells was compared with TPA. In addition to whole cell assessment, the stability of diacyl lipids and TPA was evaluated in a buffer/water system and in the presence of serum and subcellular fractions. The compounds studied include 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol (DiOG), 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OaG), 1-palmitoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (PaG), the ether-linked analog 1-palmityl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (ePaG), and TPA. TPA was comparatively stable to lipase hydrolysis in all systems examined. First, the data show that within 5 min at pH 7.9, nearly 50% of the PaG (originally greater than 92% 1,2-isomer) had isomerized, and rapid formation of the 1,3-isomer also occurred with OaG and ePaG. The metabolism of OaG and PaG by serum hydrolases, using a reaction medium containing 10% serum, was chiefly by acetate hydrolysis; however, fatty acid was also liberated. After a 60-min incubation 68% of the [14C]OaG was converted, by serum enzymes, to monooleoylglycerol plus oleic acid. Heat-inactivation of serum reduced the enzymatic formation of fatty acid by 60-70%. ePaG was also metabolized by serum enzymes, but the ether-linked alkylglycerol product was stable. The results of cell-free studies (postmitochondrial supernatant) showed that cellular enzymes were present that could, like serum, convert the diacylglycerols to monoacylglycerols and free fatty acids. Studies using cultured cells showed that radiolabeled OaG, PaG, and ePaG were rapidly taken up by the cells and metabolized. Labeled metabolic products from the diacylglycerols appeared, in a time-dependent manner, in cellular phospholipids and triacylglycerols. The results from experiments employing 1-acyl-2-acetyl-sn-[3H]glycerol and [3H]acyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol indicate that the intracellular mode of mediator metabolism is via complete hydrolysis with subsequent incorporation of 3H-acyl groups into complex lipids. Data are also presented which show that a substantial amount of cellular lipid acyl group modification occurs and large amounts of glycerol are produced when cells are cultured with OaG. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the diacylglycerol mediators, when compared with TPA, are not stable and are metabolized by both serum and cellular enzymes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Welsh, C J', 'Cabot, M C']","['Welsh CJ', 'Cabot MC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Glycerides)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)']",IM,"['Cell-Free System', 'Diglycerides/*metabolism', 'Glycerides/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Phorbol Esters/*metabolism']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.240350306 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1987 Nov;35(3):231-45. doi: 10.1002/jcb.240350306.,,,,,,,"['W.

Both patients had recurrences interpreted as mixed cellularity Hodgkin's disease, 10 and 15 years after initial therapy and both died with lymphocyte depleted Hodgkin's disease. The atypical cells in the initial biopsies and in subsequent recurrences failed to express Leu-M1, but did express leukocyte common antigen. The initial biopsy from the final patient was histologically interpreted as focal involvement by LPHD, but interfollicular Hodgkin's disease was considered after the Leu-M1 stain revealed additional atypical cells. The disease relapsed and the patient died with typical nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease.

All patients promptly responded to induction of remission with 2 X 10(6) U/m2 interferon alpha 2 b, three times a week, sc. In order to achieve a more detailed insight into the mode of action of interferon in this disease, we determined the influence of IFN alpha 2 on the incorporation of radiolabeled thymidine and uridine into hairy cells. While both 3H-thymidine and 3H-uridine incorporation were unaffected by IFN alpha 2 in a 3-hour incubation period, a significant increase in uridine incorporation into hairy cells, but not CLL cells, was observed after 24 h. Cell surface marker analysis performed with monoclonal antibodies did not reveal a quantitative alteration of the immunophenotype of hairy cells in vitro. In addition, natural killer cells, assessed by monoclonal antibodies and a cytotoxicity assay against K 562 cells, were found to be decreased in 9 out of 10 patients prior to therapy. Although IFN alpha 2 could stimulate natural killer cells in vivo, we did not find a consistent correlation between the activation of these cells and the response to therapy. We conclude, therefore, that NK cells play no major role in the regression of hairy cells. Furthermore, IFN alpha 2 does not alter antigenic determinants in vitro, but leads to an enhanced incorporation of 3H-uridine into hairy cells in vitro, thus indicating a possible role for the induction of RNA synthesis in vivo.","['Schwarzmeier, J D', 'Schwabe, M', 'Prischl, F', 'Wagner, L', 'Lion, T', 'Micksche, M', 'Koller, U']","['Schwarzmeier JD', 'Schwabe M', 'Prischl F', 'Wagner L', 'Lion T', 'Micksche M', 'Koller U']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1987.tb01449.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1987 Nov;39(5):418-25. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1987.tb01449.x.,,,,,,,"['First Medical Clinic, University of Vienna, Austria.']",,,,,

Use of the MAC-method in present studies has yielded new information about the cytogenetics of CLL. Although most of the interphase cells from patients with B-CLL were positive for B-cell markers, many of the mitotic cells turned out to be T cells, supporting the notion that the cells studied by conventional chromosome analysis are often non-neoplastic T cells. In some B-CLL cases with normal karyotype in the conventional chromosome study, however, most of the mitotic cells were B cells, indicating that neoplastic B cells may also have a normal karyotype. The patient with T-CLL had normal karyotype even though most of the mitoses were T cells. The chromosome abnormalities found were restricted to cells with light chain clonality.

The first mechanism is the amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchange system. The second system involves bicarbonate ions. Its properties have been defined from intracellular pH (pHi) recovery experiments, 22Na+ uptake experiments, 36Cl- influx and efflux experiments. Bicarbonate induced pHi recovery of the cells after a cellular acidification to pHi = 6.3 provided that Na+ ions were present in the assay medium. Li+ or K+ could not substitute for Na+. The system seemed to be electroneutral. 22Na+ uptake experiments showed the presence of a bicarbonate-stimulated uptake pathway for Na+ which was inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate. The bicarbonate-dependent 22Na+ uptake component was reduced by depleting cells of their internal Cl- and increased by removal of external Cl-. 36Cl- efflux experiments showed that the presence of both external Na+ and bicarbonate stimulated the efflux of 36Cl- at a cell pHi of 6.3. Finally a 36Cl- uptake pathway was documented. It was inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (K0.5 = 10 microM) and bicarbonate (K0.5 = 2 mM). These results are consistent with the presence in U937 cells of a coupled exchange of Na+ and bicarbonate against chloride. It operates to raise the intracellular pH. Its pHi and external Na+ dependences were defined. No evidence for a Na+-independent Cl-/HCO3- exchange system could be found. The Na+-dependent Cl-/HCO3- exchange system was relatively insensitive to (aryloxy)alkanoic acids which are potent inhibitors of bicarbonate-induced swelling of astroglia and of the Li(Na)CO3-/Cl- exchange system of human erythrocytes.

One Pd(II) ion is bound to the two nitrogens of the side chain on C-5 of molecule D1 and to the two nitrogens of the side chain on C-5 of molecule D2, whereas the second Pd(II) ion is bound to the nitrogens of the side chain on C-8 of molecule D1 and of molecule D2.

They display antitumor activity against P 388 leukemia which compares with that of the free drugs. Interactions of the free drugs with DNA have been studied. Mitoxantrone and ametantrone are not optically active by themselves. However, through interaction with DNA, there is an induction of optical activity within the electronic transitions of both drugs. At a nucleotide/drug molar ratio lower than about 5 a CD signal of the couplet type is observed, suggesting that there is a coupling between the pi----pi transitions of the molecules of drugs intercalated between the base pairs. This coupling disappears when the molar ratio is increased. The interactions of the Pd(II) complexes with DNA do not give rise to induction of optical activity within the electronic transition of the drugs, indicating that the presence of the metal ion prevents the intercalation of the drugs between the base pairs.","['Kolodziejczyk, P', 'Garnier-Suillerot, A']","['Kolodziejczyk P', 'Garnier-Suillerot A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['5TWQ1V240M (Palladium)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'PNT6041ST1 (ametantrone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Circular Dichroism', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Mitoxantrone/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Models, Chemical', 'Palladium/*metabolism', 'Spectrophotometry']",1987/12/07 00:00,1987/12/07 00:01,['1987/12/07 00:00'],"['1987/12/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/07 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304-4165(87)90210-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-4165(87)90210-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1987 Dec 7;926(3):249-57. doi: 10.1016/0304-4165(87)90210-8.,,,,,,,"['Laboratoire de Chimie Bioinorganique (UA CNRS 198), Universite Paris-Nord, Bobigny, France.']",,,,,

To determine whether commonly used cancer chemotherapeutic agents could alter protein kinase C (PKC) and thereby modify the calcium-messenger system, we studied the effect of anthracyclines and vinca alkaloids on the activity of PKC. Doxorubicin, daunomycin, vincristine and vinblastine inhibited the activity of PKC by 50% at concentrations of 150, 120, 350 and 140 microM respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated the potential for this interaction to occur in intact cells, since doxorubicin blocked the binding of the phorbol ester, PDBu, to its receptor, PKC. The mode of inhibition of PKC was due, at least in part, to interference with the activation of the enzyme by phosphatidylserine. The activity of PKC was increased 15 fold in a highly resistant human breast cancer line, but this increase in enzymic activity was not seen in all lines tested. These studies demonstrate that anthracyclines and vinca alkaloids inhibit PKC, and suggest that chronic antagonism could lead to changes in its activity and function.","['Palayoor, S T', 'Stein, J M', 'Hait, W N']","['Palayoor ST', 'Stein JM', 'Hait WN']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors/isolation & purification', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",1987/10/29 00:00,1987/10/29 00:01,['1987/10/29 00:00'],"['1987/10/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/29 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-291X(87)90935-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-291x(87)90935-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1987 Oct 29;148(2):718-25. doi: 10.1016/0006-291x(87)90935-1.,['CA43888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,"['Department of Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510.']",,,,,

The yield of antigen was estimated at 71%, and a 3160-fold purification was achieved relative to the homogenate. The antigen preparation from brain showed a very high degree of purity when analysed by SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and was composed of a single polypeptide of Mr 94,000. Amino-sugar and neutral-sugar analyses indicated that the protein was not glycosylated. The amino acid composition of the purified protein from brain was compared with that of the analogous protein purified from an acute-lymphoblastic-leukaemic cell line, HOON. The compositions were very similar, suggesting that the two proteins were closely related. Both purified proteins were equivalent in their ability to inhibit the reactivity of monoclonal antibodies 44E3 and 44H4 with leukaemic cells. These two antibodies appear to recognize spatially related, if not identical, epitopes on the same molecule. The antibodies were shown to cross-react with a polypeptide of Mr 94,000 in homogenates of human, bovine and guinea-pig brain white matter. Indirect immunoperoxidase staining of human grey- and white-matter acetone-fixed tissue sections incubated with either antibody indicated that the antigen was present on neuronal and glial cells; the staining was seen as clusters in the cytoplasm, starting at the plasma membrane, but leaving the nucleus unstained. The concentration of the protein in human brain was shown to be similar throughout postnatal development and aging.","['Cruz, T F', 'Girgrah, N', 'Quackenbush, E J', 'Letarte, M', 'Moscarello, M A']","['Cruz TF', 'Girgrah N', 'Quackenbush EJ', 'Letarte M', 'Moscarello MA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (brain protein antigen p94)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acids/analysis', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Binding, Competitive', '*Brain Chemistry', 'Cattle', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*isolation & purification', 'Species Specificity', 'Tissue Distribution']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2460401 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1987 Sep 1;246(2):401-7. doi: 10.1042/bj2460401.,,,PMC1148289,,,,"['Division of Biochemistry, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",,,,,

Malignant tumor autopsy cases are gradually increasing and now comprise more than 60% of total autopsy cases. The percentage of lung cancer cases among all autopsy cases was 7% in males and 4% in females. The percentage of lung cancer in autopsies of patients with malignancies was about 13% for males and 9% for females. The most frequent fatal malignant tumors were gastric cancer, lung cancer, and leukemia. The relative incidence of gastric cancer was decreasing, while that of lung cancer was increasing. In the distribution of the histological types of lung cancer, adenocarcinomas were the most frequent types in both sexes. As has been noted in mortality statistics, we noticed a gradual shift in the peak age of lung cancer autopsy cases towards older patients. During the period under study, the peak shifted from patients in their sixties to patient in their seventies; this was true for most of the major histological types in both sexes. The male/female ratio of all lung cancer cases was 2.9, which was much lower than the ratio found in the United States and Europe, and very similar to the ratio of the mortality rates in Japan and other Asian countries. It was pointed out that the male/female ratios by age-group in each country is a very good reflection of the histological distribution.","['Morita, T', 'Yamaguchi, K', 'Shimamine, T', 'Mori, W', 'Urano, Y']","['Morita T', 'Yamaguchi K', 'Shimamine T', 'Mori W', 'Urano Y']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Acta Pathol Jpn,Acta pathologica japonica,0372637,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Autopsy', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Lung Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sex Factors', 'Time Factors']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1827.1987.tb02260.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Pathol Jpn. 1987 Sep;37(9):1375-88. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.1987.tb02260.x.,,,,,,,"['Department of Pathology, Hamamatsu National College of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan.']",,,,,

The system introduced by Binet et al offers an advantage that it consists only of three stages and, therefore, is more practical for initiation of controlled therapeutic trials than the five-stage Rai system. However, when we take into consideration the survival curves, it is important to note that the Rai system has three groups (and not five), low risk (stage O), intermediate risk (stages I and II), and high risk (stages III and IV). These groups are roughly equivalent to Binet's A, B, and C stages, respectively. Although the IWCLL has recommended a unified, integrated method of combining Binet and Rai systems, in practice, however, such a combination is cumbersome and unusable. Both systems, however, suffer from an important limitation--they cannot predict for the large majority of patients in the low and intermediate risk groups (Binet's stages A and B and Rai's O, I, and II) who will have an indolent course and good prognosis in contrast to those in the same stages whose disease will progress rapidly. It is necessary, therefore, to combine the bone marrow histology findings, the lymphocyte doubling time and the threshold values of blood lymphocyte count with the clinical staging systems to distinguish between indolent disease course and aggressive disease on a prospective basis within a given clinical stage.","['Rai, K R', 'Montserrat, E']","['Rai KR', 'Montserrat E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', '*Lymphocytes', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0037-1963(87)90004-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Hematol. 1987 Oct;24(4):252-6.,,,,,,,"['Long Island Jewish Medical Center, New Hyde Park, NY 11042.']",,,,,

This finding suggested that the maintenance of undifferentiated state and self-renewal in vivo may be related to the inability of the host to generate an appropriate level of differentiation factor (DF). Evidence for this hypothesis was derived from experiments in vitro and in vivo with myeloid leukemia of rat. The following results were obtained: (i) in vitro, the percentage of cell differentiation at a fixed concentration of DF was inversely related to the concentration of cells; (ii) leukemic cell inoculates that were lethal to 7-day-old rats were rejected by 21-day-old rats; (iii) leukemic cells in diffusion chambers underwent differentiation in 21-day-old rats but not in 7-day-old rats; (iv) organs from 21-day-old rats contained more DF activity than those of 7-day-old rats; (v) treatment of rats with DF in diffusion chambers resulted in leukemic cell differentiation inside the chamber; and (vi) the development of leukemia in 7-day-old rats was aborted by treatment with DF. These results show that the differentiation of rat leukemia cells requires the appropriate level of DF. The proliferation of transplanted leukemia cells in 7-day-old rats goes unchecked because of inadequate generation of DF. Conversely, in the 21-day-old rats, rejection is accomplished by differentiation of the transplanted cells.","['Jimenez, J J', 'Yunis, A A']","['Jimenez JJ', 'Yunis AA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', '*Graft Rejection', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phagocytosis', 'Rats']",1987/11/27 00:00,1987/11/27 00:01,['1987/11/27 00:00'],"['1987/11/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/27 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1126/science.3685979 [doi]'],ppublish,Science. 1987 Nov 27;238(4831):1278-80. doi: 10.1126/science.3685979.,['AM 07114/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,"['Department of Medicine, University of Miami School of Medicine, FL 33101.']",,,,,

This model was used to examine the role of Ca2+ in LTC4 formation, and inhibition by hydrocortisone (HC). HC, at a physiological concentration (2 x 10(-7) M), selectively prevented the stimulatory effect of the antigen on LTC4 production whereas the response to calcium ionophore (A23187) remained unimpaired. The inhibition by HC was time-dependent: half maximal response was reached at 2 hour and maximal response at 3 hours. Addition of arachidonic acid (3 micrograms/ml) did not overcome the inhibitory action of HC. An elevated [Ca2+]i is known to be essential for the activation of both 5-lipoxygenase and phospholipase A2. The stimulatory effect of the antigen on LTC4 production was abolished when the cells were incubated in Ca2+-deficient medium. Likewise, calcium ionophore stimulation shows dependence on extracellular Ca2+. Half maximal stimulation by the antigen and calcium ionophore was observed at external Ca2+ concentration of 150 microM and 40 microM respectively. Treatment with HC largely prevented the antigen-induced rise in [Ca2+]i, measured by Quin 2. In addition, HC reduced by 70% the accumulation of 45Ca2+ induced by the antigen. Collectively, these results demonstrate for the first time that HC reduces antigen-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i, and this may be associated with the inhibitory action of HC on LTC4 formation. This property could be partly responsible for the antiallergic and antiinflammatory activities of HC.","['Zor, U', 'Her, E', 'Talmon, J', 'Kohen, F', 'Harell, T', 'Moshonov, S', 'Rivnay, B']","['Zor U', 'Her E', 'Talmon J', 'Kohen F', 'Harell T', 'Moshonov S', 'Rivnay B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Prostaglandins,Prostaglandins,0320271,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (SRS-A)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/*immunology', 'Basophils/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Hydrocortisone/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'SRS-A/*biosynthesis', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0090-6980(87)90260-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0090-6980(87)90260-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Prostaglandins. 1987 Jul;34(1):29-40. doi: 10.1016/0090-6980(87)90260-7.,,,,,,,"['Department of Hormone, Research, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",,,,,

Transient expression data and drug resistance frequencies support the findings that the M-MuLV enhancer is not active in EC cells but that promoter sequences are functional. In addition, a proviral DNA fragment that encodes the leader RNA sequence of a M-MuLV recombinant retrovirus was found to restrict expression specifically in EC cells. Deletion analysis of the leader fragment localized the inhibitory sequences to a region that spans the M-MuLV tRNA primer binding site.

This increased rejection was further enhanced by a transfer of peritoneal exudate T (PET) cells, but not of spleen cells. Spleen cells incubated in vitro for 3 or more days were as effective as PET cells in stimulating tumor rejection, and were cytotoxic in vitro as tested by a 4-hr 51Cr-release assay. This cytotoxicity was closely related to the OK-432-mediated augmentation of L1210 rejection in vivo. In vitro treatment with OK-432 of spleen cells from intact mice generated nonspecific cytotoxic cells. The cells were nonadherent to plastic, radioresistant, and of Thy-1+, Lyt-1,2-, and asialoGM1+ phenotypes, and were tentatively named OK-432-induced killer (OIK) cells. They were cytotoxic to tumor cells resistant to natural killer (NK) cells, and different from NK cells or lymphokine-activated killer cells. For their generation, macromolecular synthesis and participation of plastic-adherent cells (probably macrophages) were needed. The in vivo growth of L1210 leukemic cells could not be inhibited by simultaneous administration of PET cells primed in vivo with OK-432, of spleen cells primed in vivo with OK-432 and then cultured, or of spleen cells primed in vitro with OK-432 and then cultured (OIK cells). However, a prophylactic adoptive transfer of these cells was effective in immunocompetent mice as well as in athymic nu/nu mice, but not in mice irradiated with 400 rad.

Antemortem diagnosis was accomplished in 14, and 13 of 15 (87%) survived the infection. Because of the high success rate, we reviewed the courses of the 15 patients to assess factors associated with this favorable outcome. Eleven presented with pulmonary IA; early symptoms occurred at a mean 21.6 days of granulocytopenia (less than 100/muL) and included refractory fever in 14 and pulmonary signs or symptoms in 11. Primary necrotic chest wall lesions associated with Hickman catheters developed in four at a mean 11 days of granulocytopenia, followed by pulmonary involvement. All 15 patients had chest radiographs during granulocytopenia, with 14 (93%) demonstrating pulmonary infiltrates and/or nodules at a mean 20.6 days of aplasia. Nine patients had lung computerized tomography (CT) scans, revealing nodular infiltrates in one patient and a characteristic zone of low attenuation surrounding a mass-like infiltrate in seven other patients, which was found to be diagnostic of IA. Subsequent CT scans performed during and following bone marrow recovery showed progression to cavitation followed by either complete resolution or minimal pulmonary scarring. Eleven patients developed IA during empiric amphotericin B (Amp-B) therapy (0.5 mg/kg/d) for fever refractory to antibacterial antibiotics. Fourteen patients received high-dose Amp-B (1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg/d), which was started within a mean of 2.2 days of first clinical findings; 13 survived. Ten patients received 5-fluorocytosine in addition to high dose amp-B. Survival was similar regardless of presentation, as 91% with primary pulmonary IA and 75% presenting with chest wall lesions survived. All 13 surviving patients had complete granulocyte recovery at a mean 33.8 days. Nephrotoxicity (creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dL) was observed in seven patients during therapy for IA, but was transient in all seven.

This defect in transport has been attributed to the lack of a cytoplasmic domain, and possible loss of signals required for transport to the cell surface. The mature form of gp52, designated gp65, is also reported to be secreted from SFFV-infected cells. To determine the specific changes in the envelope protein which may lead to its lack of transport and to its lack of stability in associating with membranes, the 3' end of the F-SFFV envelope gene, which encodes the transmembrane domain, was inserted in place of the normal 3' end of the Friend murine leukemia virus genome. This chimeric envelope gene was expressed using the vaccinia virus expression system. The chimeric gp70/p15E glycoprotein molecule lacks the cytoplasmic tail residues and as a consequence is about 3300 daltons smaller. The chimeric PrEnv molecule was found to be cleaved efficiently as indicated by pulse-chase experiments. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that the chimeric molecule is efficiently transported to the surface of cells, unlike the SFFV gp52 glycoprotein. The chimeric molecule was found to be unstable in its membrane association and is released into the culture medium. These results indicate that the changes in the membrane spanning region and the lack of a cytoplasmic tail do not determine the defective transport of gp52, but may determine the stability of its association with membranes.","['Kilpatrick, D R', 'Srinivas, R V', 'Stephens, E B', 'Compans, R W']","['Kilpatrick DR', 'Srinivas RV', 'Stephens EB', 'Compans RW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Chimera', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics', '*Genes', '*Genes, Viral', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",1987/11/25 00:00,1987/11/25 00:01,['1987/11/25 00:00'],"['1987/11/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/25 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)47704-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Nov 25;262(33):16116-21.,"['CA 07841/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18611/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 40440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,"['Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham 35294.']",,,,,

When these cells were subsequently exposed to DMSO, onset of G1/0 growth arrest but not phenotypic differentiation occurred within 24 h. Since in these cells retinoic acid or DMSO normally requires 48 h of continuous exposure for onset of significant G0 growth arrest and phenotypic differentiation, it appears that retinoic acid and DMSO induce similar early cellular events needed for subsequent G0 growth arrest but not for phenotypic differentiation. While onset of growth arrest and differentiation occur together when the cells are exposed for 48 h to retinoic acid, the present results indicate that their occurrence can be uncoupled by this split dosage to inducers.

Nine patients with acute myeloid (n = 1), acute monocytic (n = 1), acute myelomonocytic (n = 6) and acute undifferentiated (n = 1) leukemia were treated. Their median age was 52 (range, 27-78) years. Six of the nine patients were pretreated with cytostatic agents. Sodium butyrate was administered i.v. at a dosage of 500 mg/kg/day as continuous infusion over 10 days. A sensitive and reproducible high-performance liquid chromatographic separation was developed after derivatization of sodium butyrate with 2,4'-dibromoacetophenone employing crown ether catalysis. Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of sodium butyrate were monitored during the 10 days of continuous infusion and for 2 days thereafter. During infusion, plasma concentrations increased 6-fold over the endogenous butyrate level and reached 39-59 microM. The area under the curve of the exogenous butyrate was 384 +/- 50 microM X day (mean +/- S.D.). After the end of infusion, concentrations declined rapidly with a half-life of 6.1 +/- 1.4 min, and reached pretreatment values within 1 hr. The total clearance rate was 83 +/- 12 ml/kg/min and the volume of distribution 738 +/- 245 ml/kg. The excreted amounts of butyrate in the urine were minimal as compared to the infused dose. Although excretion by other organs was not ruled out, it is suggested that the infused sodium butyrate was rapidly metabolized. A significant increase in peripheral blast cells was observed, whereas bone marrow cytologies before and after treatment did not reveal a significant change in blasts.

A difference in uptake is observed as early as 6 min after addition of cis-[14C]DEP and increases to approximately 3-fold after 30 min. This reduction in uptake is reflected in a decrease in the binding of platinum to DNA isolated from cis-DDP-treated cells as measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy and in the quantity of intracellular cis-DEP metabolites as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Similar differences in uptake are observed between ascitic L1210/0 and L1210/DDP (SRI) cells in vitro and in vivo, showing that the differences in uptake are not due to an artifact of the culturing process. The differences in cis-DEP uptake between the two cell lines were relatively unchanged during 7 mo in culture; however, both cell lines exhibited altered sensitivities to cis-DEP during extended culturing. No difference was observed in the efflux of cis-DEP by the two cell lines. Similarly, no difference in nonprotein and total sulfhydryl contents was observed between L1210/0 and L1210/DDP (SRI) cells. The difference in uptake (3-fold) of cis-DEP between L1210/0 and L1210/DDP (SRI) cells may not account fully for the observed differences in sensitivity of the two cell lines to cis-DDP (18-fold) and cis-DEP (19-fold).

After tumor nodules had developed, TNF or bovine serum albumin was injected intratumorally.

NMHE has a methyl group at nitrogen 2 on the ellipticine ring while DHE possesses a basic diethylaminoethyl chain at this position. Compared to NMHE, the presence of the diethylaminoethyl side chain results in the following: a significant increase in the lipophilicity of the drug; no significant modification in either the binding constant values to DNA or the ability to intercalate between DNA base pairs; a marked decrease in the unwinding angle value of supercoiled DNA; and no significant change in the alteration of the catalytic activity of topoisomerase II in vitro. DHE appears to act as a simple reversible intercalating agent as shown by the selective mutagenic effect on Salmonella TA 1977 tester strain and by its inability to induce the SOS functions in a sfiA lac fusion containing Escherichia coli strain. From a pharmacological point of view, the presence of the diethylaminoethyl chain results in a 2-fold increase in the cytotoxicity to L1210 cultured cells, a strong increase in the antitumor efficiency on experimental murine tumors such as L1210 and P388 leukemia, B16 melanoma, M 5076 reticulosarcoma, and colon 38 adenocarcinoma, and finally an objective decrease in the acute and subacute toxicity in mice, rat, and macaque. The absence of significant differences in the interaction of NMHE and DHE with their potential targets in vitro leads to the hypothesis that the superiority of DHE in terms of cytotoxicity and antitumor efficiency may be due to an increase in the diffusion across cellular membrane and a more favorable biodistribution in vivo.","['Auclair, C', 'Pierre, A', 'Voisin, E', 'Pepin, O', 'Cros, S', 'Colas, C', 'Saucier, J M', 'Verschuere, B', 'Gros, P', 'Paoletti, C']","['Auclair C', 'Pierre A', 'Voisin E', 'Pepin O', 'Cros S', 'Colas C', 'Saucier JM', 'Verschuere B', 'Gros P', 'Paoletti C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ellipticines)', '117VLW7484 (ellipticine)', '81531-57-9 (detalliptinium)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy', 'Alkaloids/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Ellipticines/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Melanoma/drug therapy', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Salmonella/drug effects']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Dec 1;47(23):6254-61.,,,,,,,"['Laboratoire de Biochimie Enzymologie, INSERM U 140, CNRS LA 147, Villejuif, France.']",,,,,

LDT is defined as the period of time needed for lymphocytes to double in number the amount found at diagnosis. When the analysis was extended to the whole population, it showed clear differences in the life expectancy of patients with LDT of less than or equal to 12 months (median survival, 36 months; relative death rate [O/E]1.57) compared with those with LDT of more than 12 months (median survival not yet reached; O/E, 0.37) (P less than 0.001). The significance of LDT remained even after adjustments were made for age, sex, lymphocyte count, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The lack of statistical significance after adjustment for Binet's clinical stage corresponds to the fact that clinical stages are not distributed homogeneously, high LDT being more frequently associated with earlier stages and low LDT with more advanced forms of the disease (P less than 0.001). In this study LDT was a useful parameter in predicting disease progression. Patients in Stages A and B and with rapidly increasing lymphocytes counts became worse more frequently (33.3% and 29.1%, respectively, at 12 months after diagnosis) than those with a slow increase (no change in clinical stage at 12 months). It is concluded that since LDT appears to predict the progression of the disease, it is useful in the clinical management of CLL.","['Molica, S', 'Alberti, A']","['Molica S', 'Alberti A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/*mortality/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/pathology/*physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Time Factors']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19871201)60:11<2712::aid-cncr2820601122>3.0.co;2-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1987 Dec 1;60(11):2712-6. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19871201)60:11<2712::aid-cncr2820601122>3.0.co;2-1.,,,,,,,"['Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedale Regionale A.

A direct field or two opposite fields covered the palpable spleen area in most patients. 100 cGy were administered weekly for a total dose of 10 Gy, given over 10 weeks. The stage arrangement (according to Rai) for the 32 evaluable patients was as follows: Stage I: 11 patients, Stage II: nine patients, Stage III: three patients, and Stage IV: nine patients. Patients in Stages I and II were treated when symptomatic. Twenty-five patients (78%) achieved hematologic response (HR), defined as normalization of the differential leukocyte count, of the total blood cell count, and of bone marrow infiltration. However, no complete response according to the standard criteria of response has been obtained. The median response time of HR was 7 months (range, 1.5 months to greater than 120 months). The overall median survival time from the start of splenic irradiation (SI) was 40 months. More than 50% splenomegaly reduction was obtained in 63% of patients, whereas no benefit was verified in the lymphadenopathy. The incidence of second tumor was 29%. Fourteen patients benefited from a further 21 SI cycles. SI does not result in a complete remission and therefore cannot modify the course of CLL. This treatment is most advisable for elderly patients with predominant bone marrow lymphocytosis, for patients with previous extensive chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and for patients with poor marrow reserve. Moreover, because of the absence of toxicity subsequent treatment is not compromised.","['Roncadin, M', 'Arcicasa, M', 'Trovo, M G', 'Franchin, G', 'de Paoli, A', 'Volpe, R', 'Carbone, A', 'Tirelli, U', 'Grigoletto, E']","['Roncadin M', 'Arcicasa M', 'Trovo MG', 'Franchin G', 'de Paoli A', 'Volpe R', 'Carbone A', 'Tirelli U', 'Grigoletto E']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Spleen/*radiation effects']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19871201)60:11<2624::aid-cncr2820601109>3.0.co;2-f [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1987 Dec 1;60(11):2624-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19871201)60:11<2624::aid-cncr2820601109>3.0.co;2-f.,,,,,,,"['Department of Radiotherapy, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, Aviano, Italy.']",,,,,

Cellular turnover in all FAB groups was characterized by reduced labelling index and prolonged DNA synthesis time indicating reduced proliferative activity. Two more parameters were derived from the measurements. (1) The relative cell production rate, which is increased in proerythroblasts and myeloblasts in most cases. This could be attributed to an increased number of divisions in early recognizable precursors in the absence of maturation, and (or) an increased influx from the progenitor compartments. (2) The maturation index of a cell lineage was determined by the ratio of relative cell production rate increase from the first to the last proliferative compartment over the corresponding normal value. It showed a high degree of abnormality in all FAB subgroups, indicating premature cell death in the bone marrow. None of the kinetic parameters proved to be of value in predicting the evolution of leukaemia. In contrast, an excellent correlation was found between the myeloid maturation index and survival (P less than 0.0001). No correlation, however, was found between survival and the erythroid maturation index, which was relatively normal in the worst prognostic group. These findings indicate that although in vitro cell kinetic studies can not predict the evolution of overt leukaemia, the myeloid maturation index is a useful predictor of survival in patients with MDS and SML.","['Dormer, P', 'Hershko, C', 'Wilmanns, W']","['Dormer P', 'Hershko C', 'Wilmanns W']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb02318.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1987 Oct;67(2):147-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb02318.x.,,,,,,,"['Institut fur Experimentelle Hamatologie, Munchen, F.R.G.']",,,,,

Overt leukaemia developed in seven patients. Two distinct patterns of leukaemic evolution were identified. The first was characterized by a gradual increase in blast cell count and in the frequency of labelled blasts, and a corresponding reduction in myeloid maturation index indicating increased intracompartmental myeloblast divisions and premature myeloid cell death. A second pattern of leukaemic evolution was marked by a sudden rise in the blast cell population in a previously stable MDS. This rise was attributed both to an increased rate of blast proliferation, and the accumulation of non-proliferating blasts. In an additional patient with smouldering ANLL and multiple karyotype abnormalities, transient clinical remission took place following prednisone and oxymetholone therapy, characterized by a sideroblastic morphology, normal karyotype, and persistence of a highly abnormal myeloid maturation index. The sudden emergence of overt leukaemia in previously stable MDS in some of our patients and the temporary reversal of overt leukaemia into sideroblastic anaemia in one case, lend support to the notion of leukaemic evolution by several steps of transformation. On the other hand, the gradual transition of MDS into overt leukaemia in other patients is compatible with a single step leukaemia transformation, although the possibility of clonal disease prior to the development of MDS cannot be excluded with certainty.","['Dormer, P', 'Hershko, C', 'Voss, R', 'Wilmanns, W']","['Dormer P', 'Hershko C', 'Voss R', 'Wilmanns W']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Aged', '*Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/genetics/pathology', 'Prospective Studies']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb02317.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1987 Oct;67(2):141-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb02317.x.,,,,,,,"['Institut fur Experimentelle Hamatologie, Munchen, F.R.G.']",,,,,

The primary growth was carcinoma of the lung in 2, of the prostate, ovarium, stomach in one case each, and in one case a chronic myelogenous leukemia and in one case a malignant lymphoma. The female to male ratio was 2:1. Though cases were seen in all age groups, the largest number was in the sixth decade. The presenting symptoms and signs were essentially similar to those reported before. Proximal lower and upper limb weakness was the most frequent symptoms (91.7 and 83.3 per cent respectively). Other characteristic symptoms were skin changes, muscle pain, arthralgia and Raynaud's phenomenon. The CK was measured at the time of presentation in 58 of the 60 cases. Normal values were found in 18.3 per cent of cases. In general, muscle biopsy was performed in the first stage of the disease. A diagnostically abnormal biopsy was 55 cases (92 per cent), but 8 per cent of cases had normal biopsy. The characteristic changes in the biopsies from 60 cases were muscle fiber necrosis, inflammatory infiltration, fibrosis, basophilia and increase of internal nuclei. We could not get a significant difference between the two groups. However all of the cases of Group IV had muscle fiber necrosis, inflammatory infiltration and fibrosis.","['Fukunaga, H', 'Osame, M', 'Sakashita, I', 'Sameshima, H', 'Igata, A']","['Fukunaga H', 'Osame M', 'Sakashita I', 'Sameshima H', 'Igata A']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,No To Shinkei,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,0413550,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscles/pathology', '*Myositis/pathology']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,No To Shinkei. 1987 Jul;39(7):657-61.,,,,,,,"['Department of Neurology, Minamikyushu National Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.']",,,,,

USA). Initially, the patients received either AMSA-NCL or AMSA-lactate, 75-90 mg/m2 daily, for 3-7 days as a 1-h infusion. Eight patients subsequently crossed over to receive the other formulation. Plasma samples for drug determination were collected during the first 3 days. A new method for determination of AMSA is described. Acidified plasma samples containing an internal standard were extracted with hexane, then made alkaline, whereafter, AMSA was extracted with ethylacetate. Extracts were reconstituted in absolute ethanol and analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a reverse-phase C-18 column and UV detection at 254 nm. There were no clear differences in clinical effects and toxicity between the two formulations. Patients with the highest total area under the drug concentration-versus-time curves (AUCs) for plasma concentrations versus time had significantly lower nadir for white blood cell count, suggesting a relation between plasma levels and bone marrow toxicity for AMSA. The pharmacokinetics showed a biphasic elimination for both formulations. The mean terminal elimination half-life of AMSA-NCL and AMSA-lactate was 7.1 and 6.3 h, respectively, and the mean volume of distribution was 105 and 99 L/m2, respectively.

The present studies show that MP is a moderately active mutagen in the L5178Y/TK +/-----TK-/- mouse lymphoma assay (MLA) in the presence of aroclor-induced rat-liver S9, and that it induces predominantly small-colony thymidine kinase-deficient (TK-/-) mutants of demonstrated chromosomal origin. 10 of 12 small colony TK-/- mutants analyzed by banded karyotype (230-band level of resolution) show aberrations to chromosome 11b, the known location of the single functional TK gene in these cells. The observed aberrations from nine of the mutants included insertions, deletions and translocations while the tenth mutant had highly rearranged, multiple copies of chromosome 11 segments. By varying the concentrations of the S9 protein and cofactors it was shown that our standard S9 composition was close to optimum for activating MP to a mutagen. The activity and stability of various lots of S9 prepared in-house or purchased from a contract laboratory revealed significant differences. The ability of 2 lots of in-house S9 to activate a standard concentration of MP increased rapidly over the first 4 weeks of liquid nitrogen storage then declined slowly over the next 16 weeks. Three separate lots of purchased S9 were essentially inactive for the first 2 weeks of liquid nitrogen storage then increased in activity thereafter; these were the only occasions in which MP was not mutagenic in our hands. The mutagenic activity of pyrilamine (PYR), a structurally related antihistamine which is far less carcinogenic in rats, but easily detected in short-term tests as being genotoxic, was also investigated in the MLA. PYR was slightly less mutagenic than MP over a comparable range of concentrations, and also induced predominantly small-colony mutants. These studies fail to adequately explain the great carcinogenic differences between these two compounds, but are consistent with the potent hepatocarcinogenicity of MP resulting through a mutagenic mechanism.","['Turner, N T', 'Woolley, J L Jr', 'Hozier, J C', 'Sawyer, J R', 'Clive, D']","['Turner NT', 'Woolley JL Jr', 'Hozier JC', 'Sawyer JR', 'Clive D']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'A01LX40298 (Methapyrilene)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'HPE317O9TL (Pyrilamine)']",IM,"['Aminopyridines/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Biotransformation', 'Carcinogens/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Leukemia L5178/enzymology/genetics', 'Methapyrilene/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Microsomes, Liver/metabolism', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Preservation, Biological', 'Pyrilamine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1987/11/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-1218(87)90060-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1218(87)90060-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1987 Nov;189(3):285-97. doi: 10.1016/0165-1218(87)90060-7.,,,,,,,"['Wellcome Research Laboratories, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.']",,,,,

Because factors controlling normal bcr expression might also be involved in the expression of this aberrant bcr-abl transcript, we studied the patterns of expression of the normal bcr gene in different cell types. We found that the normal bcr gene was expressed in many different types of human cells. Moreover, the bcr gene was evolutionarily conserved, and homologous bcr genomic sequences and RNA transcripts were readily detected in chick tissue. The highest level of bcr expression in chick tissue was in brain tissue, the lowest level was in liver tissue, and a truncated bcr mRNA was noted in chick testes. Normal bcr transcripts, in addition to the aberrant bcr-abl hybrid transcripts, have been found in all Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML cells studied to date. Within a given CML sample, the relative amounts of normal bcr RNA and aberrant bcr-abl RNA were similar. In addition, the normal bcr and the aberrant bcr-abl hybrid transcripts demonstrated similarly prolonged half-lives compared with that of the normal abl-related transcripts in CML cells.

A 22-bp oligonucleotide fragment defined solely by the 21-bp footprint binds a protein in vitro and displays enhancer activity in vivo, suggesting that this protein is a major determinant of GALV enhancer activity. The protein is present in three cell lines which are positive for enhancer activity and is not detected in Jurkat cells, which are negative for enhancer activity. Only GALV long-terminal-repeat variants which support high levels of enhancer activity in vivo compete with this protein for specific binding in vitro, suggesting a potential role for the protein in determining enhancer activity.

Murine skin and bone marrow-derived fibroblasts were similar with respect to their abilities to support granulopoiesis and release colony-stimulating activity. Detailed analysis of skin fibroblast cultures 1 week after seeding with stromal cell-depleted bone marrow demonstrated that both multipotential hemopoietic stem cells and erythroid stem cells were maintained, while granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming units far exceeded inoculum values. Immunostaining demonstrated the presence of foci of T200 positive hemopoietic cells on the surface of the fibroblasts with less frequent scattered M1/70 and F4/80 positive macrophages. The majority of cells (greater than 90%) released from the stromal layer were of the granulocytic series.

An important shortcoming of these studies has been the lack of information on the expression of these genes in normal hematopoietic cells. To address this question we analyzed both the transcript size and level of expression of six oncogenes in fresh hematopoietic cells obtained from hematologically normal individuals and compared the results to those found in fresh samples obtained from patients with various forms of leukemia (acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and chronic myelogenous leukemia). We found low level expression of c-myc, c-myb, c-fes, and c-raf in normal bone marrow in sharp contrast to the high levels of expression found in some forms of leukemia. C-fos was highly expressed in both normal bone marrow and certain leukemias. We were unable to detect c-sis expression in our normal samples. With the exception of c-fes, there was no variation in transcript size when comparing normal and leukemic samples. Having defined the transcript sizes and levels of expression for these proto-oncogenes in normal hematopoietic cells, we know that aberrant transcript size for the genes we have studied is not a common event in leukemias.

Proliferation of fresh marrow cells, which are almost entirely entering terminal differentiation, depends on oxidative phosphorylation as determined by oxygen uptake, lactic acid production, and effect of mitochondrial poisons which within minutes completely prevent incorporation of thymidine. However, marrow progenitors responding to growth factors in in vitro assays can proliferate in the presence of high concentrations of mitochondrial poisons, with mixed granulocyte/macrophage colonies being almost refractory to inhibition.

A consistent and significant change was found in the relative amounts of stearic and oleic acid components, which is expressed as the saturation index (SI), the ratio of stearic to oleic acid content. In all patients, SI was reduced in the erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets. On extended treatment with interferon, the hematological improvement was accompanied by an increase in SI. In two patients, one deteriorating after cessation of treatment and the other on a low maintenance dose of interferon, concurrent influenza infection induced temporary improvements in the blood cell counts, as well as increase in SI values. These results indicate that endogenous interferon can also be effective in inducing hematological and SI improvement in this disease. The relevance of low SI values and concomitant increase in membrane fluidity to the malignant transformation is discussed. It is proposed that one effect of interferon is to reduce the production of growth factors by reducing the malignant cell mass.","['Worman, C P', 'Barker, W R', 'Apostolov, K']","['Worman CP', 'Barker WR', 'Apostolov K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Oleic Acids)', '0 (Stearic Acids)', '2UMI9U37CP (Oleic Acid)', '4ELV7Z65AP (stearic acid)']",IM,"['Blood Cells/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism', 'Fatty Acids/*blood', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*blood/therapy', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Membrane Lipids/*blood', 'Oleic Acid', 'Oleic Acids/blood', 'Stearic Acids/blood']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1987 Apr;1(4):379-82.,,,,,,,"['Department of Haematology, University College Hospital, London, U.K.']",,,,,

After therapy with alpha-interferon (IFN-alpha) NK activity in vitro was equivalent to that of normal controls. It is suggested that the low activity often seen before treatment is attributable to dilution of NK cells by large numbers of inactive HCs and that this diluting effect is reduced as HCs disappear from the blood during IFN-alpha treatment. HCs was consistently resistant to NK lysis by normal or hairy cell leukemia allogeneic and autologous mononuclear cells, despite whether effector or target cells had been pretreated with IFN-alpha. Cold-target inhibition and direct binding experiments showed that HCs do not bind to NK effectors. It is therefore concluded that NK cells play no direct role in the progressive disappearance of HCs seen in patients receiving IFN-alpha.","['Griffiths, S D', 'Cawley, J C']","['Griffiths SD', 'Cawley JC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Interferon Type I)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/immunology/*therapy']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1987 Apr;1(4):372-6.,,,,,,,"['Department of Haematology, University of Liverpool, Royal Liverpool Hospital, U.K.']",,,,,

Induction of neopterin excretion was chosen as the marker to define biological response and the dose of IFN-alpha 2c applied was on average only one tenth of that in group A cases. Average time of treatment in group B was 42 weeks. The data indicate that both dose levels are effective in the treatment of advanced hairy cell leukemia but that the low dose regimen is free of toxicity. Laboratory investigations on the mechanism of IFN-mediated remission in HCL further revealed that hairy cells are resistant to lysis by IFN-alpha activated large granular lymphocytes and that improved natural killer function subsequent to IFN-alpha treatment in vivo is primarily due to the disappearance of leukemic hairy cells which dilute the natural killer effector cells. These findings support the view of a direct antitumor activity of IFN-alpha as the main therapeutic principle.","['Huber, C', 'Aulitzky, W', 'Tilg, H', 'von Luttichau, I', 'Troppmair, J', 'Nachbauer, K', 'Gastl, G']","['Huber C', 'Aulitzky W', 'Tilg H', 'von Luttichau I', 'Troppmair J', 'Nachbauer K', 'Gastl G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Interferon Type I)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1987 Apr;1(4):355-7.,,,,,,,"['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",,,,,

Only 20% of the patients required reinitiation of treatment, and in all, reinduction of remission was readily obtained. Toxicity to IFN-alpha in patients with hairy cell leukemia was minimal. IFN-alpha production by patients in remission was studied. Only those patients in complete remission showed adequate IFN-alpha production. The role of endogenous IFN-alpha in the induction and sustenance of remission in hairy cell leukemia is discussed.","['Quesada, J R', 'Lepe-Zuniga, J L', 'Gutterman, J U']","['Quesada JR', 'Lepe-Zuniga JL', 'Gutterman JU']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferon Type I/biosynthesis/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1987 Apr;1(4):317-9.,,,,,,,"['Department of Clinical Immunology and Biological Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute, Houston 77030.']",,,,,

Concurrent pretreatment coronal images of the proximal femurs and pelvis using MR revealed extensive marrow involvement that varied in distribution from patchy to diffuse. At 6 months, all patients had responded to alpha 2-interferon with improvement in peripheral blood counts and decrease in lymphoid infiltration on marrow biopsy to 15-40%.

The examination of the cells by cytofluorography included the expression of surface antigens (such as B1, HLA, transferrin receptors, surface immunoglobulins, TAC), and cytofluorometric measurement of light scatter including forward (which correlates with cytoplasmic size and shape) and perpendicular (which correlates with nuclear size and shape) directions. Although the entire lymphocyte population from these patients was examined initially to look for changes in phenotype with treatment, in later studies an enriched leukemic population was examined and alterations in response to interferon treatment became more apparent. The monoclonal antibody M5 was used to enrich the hairy cell population via a panning technique. The enriched population contained greater than 90% tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive hairy lymphocytes. By cytofluorographic analysis of these cells serially in four responding patients and one refractory, all of whom had been followed longer than 11 months, several observations were made: 1) leukemic cells from responding patients showed a rapid decline in the forward and perpendicular light scatter indicative of cell differentiation; 2) coexisting normal B cells showed no changes in the above features; and 3) leukemic cells exhibited a definite increase in the HLA antigen density and a slight decrease in transferrin receptors in responding patients but not in the refractory patient. The increase in HLA antigen expression by hairy cells indicates progression toward differentiation, and decrease in transferrin receptors correlates with growth reduction. These data indicate that the administration of IFN-alpha is associated with cellular changes toward differentiation. We can not exclude, however, the possibility of other actions of IFN-alpha in HCL as proposed by other investigators.","['Huang, A T', 'Mold, N G']","['Huang AT', 'Mold NG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/pathology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Transferrin/analysis']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1987 Apr;1(4):308-11.,,,,,,,"['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710.']",,,,,

However, enzyme activity has been reported to be absent from the hairy cells of rare cases of HCL and to be present in the neoplastic cells of diseases other than HCL. In order to fully utilize T-AcP for the diagnosis of HCL, it is necessary to maximize the sensitivity and specificity of the staining method, to have adequate quality control to ensure technical and interpretative accuracy, and to prepare optimal cytologic and histologic materials for study. In blood, only the presence of cells with intense T-AcP activity is diagnostic of HCL (positive T-AcP test). In tissues other than blood, the presence of cells with intense enzyme activity may not be diagnostic for HCL; assessment of cell morphology and appreciation of the pattern of enzyme localization are also important. In studying the blood of over 1,000 patients, we have found a negative T-AcP test in two of 200 cases of HCL and a positive T-AcP test in three of 800 patients with diseases other than HCL. We believe that the T-AcP test, when performed and interpreted properly, is a useful diagnostic test for HCL.","['Yam, L T', 'Janckila, A J', 'Li, C Y', 'Lam, W K']","['Yam LT', 'Janckila AJ', 'Li CY', 'Lam WK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Tartrates)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/antagonists & inhibitors/*blood', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*diagnosis/enzymology/pathology', 'Leukocytes/*enzymology', 'Liver/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Tartrates/pharmacology']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1987 Apr;1(4):285-8.,['CA 34881/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,"['Veterans Administration Medical Center, Department of Medicine, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Kentucky 40202.']",,,,,

Treated cells underwent approximately two divisions prior to reaching plateau phase, with approximately 55% of the cell population expressing nitro blue tetrazolium positivity (NBT+) by day 3. Decreased cellular proliferation was paralleled by a progressive increase in morphologically mature granulocytic cells. Maturation was also characterized by a 4.4-fold increase in Fc receptors on the cell surface. An increase in the size of adriamycin-treated cells occurred and correlated with residency in the G2M phase of the cell cycle. Adriamycin-induced NBT+ cells, which contained the highest levels of Fc receptors, were also found to reside in G2M. Adriamycin blocked cells in the G2M phase of the cell cycle by 8 hr (125% above control), and this arrest reached its maximum by 20 hr (194% above control). Concomitant with the block in the cell cycle was the commitment by these cells within 8 hr to the granulocytic pathway of differentiation. Fractionation of cells by centrifugal elutriation into enriched phases of the cell cycle was consistent with the hypothesis that induction of the differentiation program was initiated either in G1 or very late in the cell cycle. Immobilized adriamycin, which does not gain access to the cell interior, did not induce the maturation of WEHI-3B D+ cells, nor did it block their replication in a specific phase of the cell cycle; however, immobilized adriamycin was 30-fold more toxic to WEHI-3B D+ cells than free drug. Incubation of WEHI-3B D+ cells with the semisynthetic adriamycin analog N-trifluoroacetyl adriamycin-14-valerate (AD-32) resulted in approximately 50% of the cell population being NBT+ by day 3. The findings suggest that adriamycin must be able to enter cells to induce maturation, and that at least some portion of its toxicity is associated with an effect at the surface membrane. Furthermore, the results obtained with AD-32 imply that intercalation into DNA is not necessary for induction of the differentiated phenotype.","['Gamba-Vitalo, C', 'Blair, O C', 'Tritton, T R', 'Lane, P A', 'Carbone, R', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Gamba-Vitalo C', 'Blair OC', 'Tritton TR', 'Lane PA', 'Carbone R', 'Sartorelli AC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Receptors, Fc)', '2C6NUM6878 (valrubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA/analysis', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1987 Mar;1(3):188-97.,"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28852/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,"['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",,,,,

Anemia was common to all patients, with nine showing leukocytosis, seven thrombocytopenia, and one thrombocytosis. There was a striking predominance of males (M/F ratio, 10:1) and a young median age (3 years). Preleukemia evolved to acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia in five patients and to myelofibrosis in one. In vitro studies of bone marrow progenitor cells cultured in leukocyte feeder-stimulated agar revealed abnormal cell proliferative patterns, most often an increased number of small clusters, for all 11 subjects. The cells of some preleukemic patients showed increased growth even in the absence of an exogenous source of colony-stimulating factor, suggesting autonomous growth or possibly autocrine stimulation. Combination chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation failed to induce complete remission in the seven patients who were treated. Our findings in these 11 cases confirm the poor prognosis of monosomy 7 presenting as preleukemia in children.

Only with FA6 152, which identifies a structure shared by erythroblasts, platelets, and monocytes, was labeling obtained on membranes of both platelets and monocytes from normal blood. With all the other monoclonal antibodies, platelets were highly labeled but monocytes lacked quantitatively significant label; however, focal microparticles which exhibited gold particles were adherent to the membrane of monocytes. This localized labeling, interpreted as resulting from the fragmentation of platelet membranes during monocyte isolation with adhesion of the fragments to monocyte surfaces, was verified by two approaches. First, double staining with C17 visualized by an anti-IgG coupled to 40 nm gold particles and MO2 recognizing exclusively a surface monocyte antigen, as visualized by an anti-IgG coupled to 15 nm gold particles, was performed. The absence of colocalization of large and small gold particles either on monocytes or on microparticles confirmed the exclusive cell origin. Second, when analyzed by quantitative x-ray analysis, monocyte associated gold following C17 treatment was restricted to platelet pseudopods and fragments on whole mount spread cells. Finally, when monocytes were spread immediately after blood collection in the absence of sedimentation and centrifugation to prevent platelet activation, platelet rosetting was avoided and the number of microparticles markedly decreased. Thus, the attachment to monocyte membranes of microparticles originating from platelets may be confused with true labeling of monocytes by antibodies to platelet glycoproteins if analysis is limited to immunofluorescence.","['Breton-Gorius, J', 'Lewis, J C', 'Guichard, J', 'Kieffer, N', 'Vainchenker, W']","['Breton-Gorius J', 'Lewis JC', 'Guichard J', 'Kieffer N', 'Vainchenker W']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Adsorption', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*metabolism', 'Blood Platelets/immunology/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Monocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Platelet Adhesiveness', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1987 Feb;1(2):131-41.,,,,,,,"['INSERM U.91, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.']",,,,,

Platelets from A subjects were HPA-labeled and so were platelets from an O subject preincubated in A plasma. Megakaryocytes obtained in CFU-MK-derived colonies were weakly and heterogeneously labeled by the HPA lectin. Cultures from A1 and A2 subjects were the reflection of the genetic differences only when investigations were performed on mature erythroblasts. In contrast, the great majority of immature erythroblasts both from A2 and A1 subjects were equally labeled by both lectins; during further erythroid maturation, binding of both lectins markedly diminished only on A2 erythroblasts. When marrow erythroblasts were investigated at electron microscopic level, heterogeneity of labeling among all stages of maturation was clearly observed in A2 subjects, with staining stronger on immature than on mature erythroblasts.

Cell lineage was identified as erythroid by surface glycophorin A, granulocytic by Sudan black B and PM-81, and monocytic by lysozyme. Marrow examined sequentially showed granulocytic mitoses to initially decrease from a mean of 40% at 1.75 hr to 6% at 3.5 hr and then increase, being 46% by 6 hr and 82% after 1 day, and remain high for the 10 days studied. Erythroid mitoses were most frequent (mean, 72%) at 3.5 hr and then decreased rapidly, being 16% by 6 hr, 7% at 1 day, and absent thereafter. When granulocytic mitoses were least frequent, 20-36% of mitoses were also unreactive with glycophorin A. Double staining experiments to identify these cells found some to be monocytic, but most remained unidentified. The authors conclude that mitoses of different hematopoietic lineages predominate when normal marrow is studied cytogenetically at different times following aspiration, and that the major changes occur during the first 8 hours.

The equilibration of dipyridamole with these sites on human erythrocytes was compatible with a second-order process which proceeded at 22 degrees C with a rate constant of about 6 X 10(6) M-1 sec-1. Binding of dipyridamole to these sites correlated kinetically with the inhibition of the equilibrium exchange of 500 microM uridine in these cells and was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by nucleosides and other inhibitors of nucleoside transport, such as nitrobenzylthioinosine, dilazep and lidoflazine, but not by hypoxanthine, which is not a substrate for the nucleoside transporter of human erythrocytes. The results indicate that the substrate binding site of the transporter is part of the high-affinity dipyridamole binding site. Bound [3H]dipyridamole became displaced from these sites on human erythrocytes by incubation with an excess of unlabeled dipyridamole or high concentrations of nucleosides and inhibitors of nucleoside transport, but neither by hypoxanthine nor sugars. Dissociation of [3H]dipyridamole behaved as a simple first-order process, but the rate constant was about one order of magnitude lower (about 3 X 10(-3) sec-1) than anticipated for typical ligand-protein binding on the basis of the measured association rate and equilibrium constants. The reason for this discrepancy has not been resolved. No high-affinity dipyridamole binding sites were detected on Novikoff rat hepatoma cells, P388, L1210 and S49 mouse leukemia cells or Chinese hamster ovary cells, and their absence correlated with a greater resistance of nucleoside transport in these cells to inhibition by dipyridamole. All cells expressed considerable low affinity (Kd greater than 0.5 microM) and nonspecific binding of dipyridamole.","['Woffendin, C', 'Plagemann, P G']","['Woffendin C', 'Plagemann PG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Membr Biol,The Journal of membrane biology,0211301,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/blood/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dipyridamole/blood/*metabolism', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Membrane Proteins/blood/*metabolism', 'Nucleoside Transport Proteins', 'Uridine/metabolism']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01871048 [doi]'],ppublish,J Membr Biol. 1987;98(1):89-100. doi: 10.1007/BF01871048.,"['AM 35211/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 09138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 22268/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,"['Department of Microbiology, Medical School, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455.']",,,,,

As expected, dimerization of the methyl-substituted pyridocarbazoles yielded DNA bisintercalators with affinity slightly higher than that of the unsubstituted parent compounds. These dimers, characterized by a relatively better therapeutic index, have the same mechanism of action as ditercalinium.

The peptide was analogous to amino acid sequences 735 to 752 from the human T cell leukemia virus-IIIB isolate of HIV. Characteristics of the anti-Id preparation included: 1) detection of a shared determinant present on a second chimpanzee and one of three rabbit antibody preparations directed against the synthetic peptide, 2) failure to recognize an idiotype (Id) in BALB/c mouse antisera to the peptide, and 3) partial inhibition of the homologous chimpanzee Id preparation from binding either peptide or a recombinant HIV gp160 preparation. Immunization of BALB/c mice with the anti-Id induced an antipeptide response which bound a recombinant gp160 preparation without subsequent peptide or gp160 exposure. The anti-gp160 containing sera from mice immunized with anti-Id were able to inhibit the Id-anti-Id reaction indicating that an Id-positive antibody response was induced. This Id is not normally expressed in the murine anti-gp 160 immune response to the synthetic peptide and suggests that this anti-Id may activate normally silent clones. This study indicates that Id networks may be operational during the immune response to HIV epitopes. Alternatively, anti-Id may be useful in altering the serologic characteristics of an antibody response to HIV and may offer potential for modulating the immune response in this viral infection.","['Zhou, E M', 'Chanh, T C', 'Dreesman, G R', 'Kanda, P', 'Kennedy, R C']","['Zhou EM', 'Chanh TC', 'Dreesman GR', 'Kanda P', 'Kennedy RC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody/immunology', 'Glycoproteins/immunology', 'HIV/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Pan troglodytes/immunology', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*immunology']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Nov 1;139(9):2950-6.,"['AI-23472/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-23619/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,"['Department of Virology and Immunology, Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research, San Antonio, TX 78284.']",,,,,

Calibration curves in the range 0.1-1000 ng/ml showed good linearity (r = 0.998) and precision (coefficient of variation less than 10%). This HPLC method utilized a reproducible and inexpensive liquid-liquid extraction procedure. Using methylene chloride, the extraction efficacy of mitoxantrone from plasma was 85.3% with a coefficient of variation less than 2.1%.

Cellular uptake of L-[U-14C]cystine and its incorporation into GSH of the resistant tumor are correspondingly elevated. Synthesis of gamma-glutamylcysteine, GSH, and GSSG is elevated 1.5-2.0-fold in cell-free preparations of the resistant tumor. This increased synthesis of GSH is attributed to increased cellular content (1.6-fold) of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase. GSH synthetase activity is equivalent in both drug-sensitive and -resistant cells. Investigation into the hydrolysis of selected peptides by cell-free preparations of both sensitive and resistant tumors suggest that aminopeptidase M participates in the formation of L-cysteine from L-Cys-Gly. This is supported by the observation that these preparations readily degrade L-Leu-p-nitroanilide and L-Ala-L-Ala-L-Ala, known substrates for aminopeptidase M, but not dipeptidase. The failure of the tumors to degrade Gly-D-Ala, a dipeptidase substrate, and the marked inhibition of L-Ala-Gly, L-Cys-Gly, and L-Ala-L-Ala-L-Ala hydrolysis by Bestatin further support a role for aminopeptidase M in the generation of L-cysteine from L-Cys-Gly. These results suggest that the drug-resistant tumor cell has developed an efficient mechanism for maintenance of elevated GSH which involves both gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase-initiated catabolism of GSH to cysteine and its reutilization by gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase.","['Ahmad, S', 'Okine, L', 'Le, B', 'Najarian, P', 'Vistica, D T']","['Ahmad S', 'Okine L', 'Le B', 'Najarian P', 'Vistica DT']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Dipeptides)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)', 'M984VJS48P (gamma-glutamylcysteine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'ULW86O013H (Glutathione Disulfide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cysteine/metabolism', 'Dipeptides/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Glutathione/analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Glutathione Disulfide', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Melphalan/*pharmacology', 'Mice']",1987/11/05 00:00,1987/11/05 00:01,['1987/11/05 00:00'],"['1987/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)48136-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Nov 5;262(31):15048-53.,,,,,,,"['Laboratory of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",,,,,

We expected that cell lines originating from human solid tumors, because of their slower growth rate and lower S phase fraction, would be more drug resistant than L1210. Therefore, we compared ten human tumor cell lines (5 melanomas, 4 colon carcinomas and 1 small cell lung carcinoma) to L1210 growth inhibition by 9 antitumor drugs. Not one human tumor cell line was consistently more resistant to all nine drugs than L1210 when the cells were exposed to drugs for about 2 doubling times. The drug sensitivity of 2 cell lines (L1210 and SK MEL 28) was again determined after a short term (2 hr) exposure and using growth inhibition and cell survival as end points. For both end points these two cell lines exhibited a random pattern of sensitivity to the drugs tested. Cell kill showed an order of sensitivity different than growth inhibition.

Earlier studies indicated that two presumed agouti alleles, lethal yellow (Ay) and lethal light-bellied nonagouti (ax), are pseudoallelic. We present genetic data showing probable recombination between Ay and three agouti mutations (at, a, and ax), which suggest that Ay is a pseudoallele of the agouti locus. The close linkage of an endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia provirus, Emv-15, to Ay provides a molecular access to genes at or near the agouti locus. However, previous studies suggested that the Emv-15 locus can recombine with some agouti alleles and therefore we analyzed mice from recombinant inbred strains and backcrosses to measure the genetic distance between various agouti alleles and the Emv-15 locus. Our data indicate that the Emv-15 locus is less than 0.3 cM from the agouti locus.

Potential for anticancer drug development.",937-48,"The colony formation of human tumor xenografts from nude mice, of murine tumors, and of human bone marrow (CFU-C) has been investigated in vitro using a modification of the double-layer agar assay described by Hamburger and Salmon. Systematic modification of growth conditions and careful selection of viable tumor tissue enhanced the growth rate (at least 30 colonies per dish) of human tumor xenografts to 86% (98/114). The median plating efficiency was 0.07% which is comparable to the results observed by others using fresh human tumors. The growth of human bone marrow was stimulated with a placenta-conditioned medium, which allowed growth of granulocytic stem cell colonies (CFU-C). The median plating efficiency of the bone marrow was 0.08%. The murine tumors P388, L1210, B16 melanoma, Lewis lung carcinoma and colon carcinoma 38 grew very well in vitro. Excluding the Lewis lung carcinoma, the plating efficiency of these tumors was markedly higher than that of the human tumor xenografts and human bone marrow. The colony assay may have potential as a secondary screening system for identifying new active structures and also for indicating which tumor types are most responsive to a new antitumor agent. We test new structures in 20 well-selected human tumor xenografts and in the P388 mouse leukemia in dose-response relationships. The two most responsive xenograft tumors are subsequently studied in vivo in nude mice in order to determine if a new compound presents antitumor activity in an in vivo organism at a dose around the LD10 level. If a remission or at least no change is observed in the subcutaneously growing tumor, the new compound undergoes large disease-oriented testing usually in 60 xenografts. The in vivo studies are necessary in determining whether a compound has a more specific effect on tumor cells than on the dose-limiting normal tissue. The comparison of in vitro/in vivo activity allows an assessment of the relevant in vitro dose based on in vivo pharmacological behavior of a drug. It seems justifiable to apply the conclusions of this approach to the clinical setting because mouse toxicity data, e.g. the LD10, correspond well to the maximal tolerable doses in man. Moreover, for compounds whose dose-limiting toxicity is bone marrow suppression, the comparison of drug dosages effective in vitro on human bone marrow and tumor xenografts may prove helpful. The proposed testing strategy has been applied to TGU and Tiazofurin. At the relevant dosages TGU exhibited very limited activity in 67 human tumor xenografts studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Fiebig, H H', 'Schmid, J R', 'Bieser, W', 'Henss, H', 'Lohr, G W']","['Fiebig HH', 'Schmid JR', 'Bieser W', 'Henss H', 'Lohr GW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol,European journal of cancer & clinical oncology,8112045,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '36R61Y789T (anaxirone)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*pathology', 'Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Triazoles/pharmacology']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0277-5379(87)90339-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol. 1987 Jul;23(7):937-48. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(87)90339-7.,,,,,,,"['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Freiburg, F.R.G.']",,,,,

The present study was undertaken to determine if chromosomal breakage, aneuploidy or both reflect differences in BD leukemogenicity observed between B6C3F1 and NIH Swiss mice. Mice were exposed to a single concentration of BD (1250 p.p.m.) for 6 h. Bone marrow cell preparations were made at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after cessation of exposure. In both strains comparable increases in the frequency of chromosomal aberrations (of the chromatid type) were observed following exposure to BD. Significant differences in the number of chromosomes were not observed, although a pattern of chromosomal loss in cells from treated animals was observed. These results indicate that BD-treatment in vivo produces significant increases in chromatid aberrations but not aneuploidy in both strains.

The purpose of our study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of this drug as well as the possible mechanisms that produce sparsomycin toxicity. Tests on beagle dogs revealed that about 60% of the drug is eliminated by metabolic clearance, while 40% is eliminated by the kidneys. After a single bolus injection of 0.1 mg/kg sparsomycin without narcosis, sparsomycin was eliminated with a t beta 1/2 of 0.6-0.7 h, the AUC being 0.32-0.38 mg.h.l-1, and the volume of distribution (Vd) 0.26 l/kg. In addition to being subject to glomerular filtration, sparsomycin is probably also actively excreted and actively reabsorbed by the renal tubuli. Sparsomycin itself may inhibit its active tubular excretion, thus resulting in a decrease in the drug's renal clearance and its accumulation in the plasma. Sparsomycin appeared to be toxic primarily in the liver, disturbing its function and the synthesis of plasma proteins. Two out of five dogs developed hemorrhagic diathesis due to hypofibrinogenemia and deficiency of other blood-coagulation factors.

When its activity against L1210 was compared with that of CPT and known derivatives, CPT-11 was most effective, giving the highest maximum increase in life span (ILS) and showing good activity over a wide dose range. The antitumor activity of CPT-11 was shown against tumors not only in the ascites form but also in the solid form. Included among the more susceptible murine tumors are S180, Meth A fibrosarcoma, Lewis lung carcinoma, Ehrlich carcinoma, MH134 hepatoma, mammary carcinoma of C3H/HeN mice, L1210, and P388 leukemia. Probable cures of these tumors were induced frequently by CPT-11. The antitumor activity of CPT-11 against i.p.-implanted L1210 was superior to that of Adriamycin in maximum ILS, the number of cured mice, and the therapeutic ratio. CPT-11 at a dose of 100 mg/kg produced an ILS in excess of 300% with five of six mice surviving tumor free, and effected 100% tumor regression at 200 mg/kg, whereas the optimum dose of Adriamycin, 12.5-25 mg/kg, brought about 114-129% ILS with one of six mice surviving.

In the present study, the pharmacokinetics and toxicology of 4-HC were studied following intraventricular administration of 0.4 mg to rhesus monkeys with chronic indwelling Ommaya reservoirs. 4-HC was measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma with a high-performance liquid chromatography assay utilizing a fluorometric detector following derivatization with m-aminophenol. The mean peak level of 4-HC in ventricular CSF was 100 microM 5 min after administration. The drug was cleared rapidly and the elimination was monoexponential with a mean half-life of 22 min. The mean clearance from CSF (0.33 ml/min) was 10-fold higher than CSF bulk flow. The drug was distributed throughout the subarachnoid space with lumbar levels approaching ventricular levels by 60 min. Neither acute nor chronic neurotoxicity or systemic toxicity was observed during the 6-wk observation period. Concentrations of 4-HC demonstrated to be cytocidal in vitro against human breast cancer, lymphoid leukemia, and rhabdomyosarcoma were readily achieved in CSF following intraventricular administration.

Bropirimine alone was marginally active against some experimental tumors such as B16 melanoma but was ineffective against others such as P388 or L1210 leukemia. However, it produced statistically significant synergistic activity against P388 leukemia when used in combination with cyclophosphamide (CY). The aim of this investigation was to determine whether the synergism could be achieved with different types of cytotoxic drugs. Actinomycin D (act D), adriamycin, 5-azacytidine, cisplatin, melphalan, mitomycin C, and vincristine were selected. Using an experimental protocol identical to that of CY and bropirimine combination therapy, and using a more or less equally effective dosage of the drug for the initial reduction of tumor burden (i.e., around 100% increase of life span), cisplatin and bropirimine also produced a statistically significant synergism over the treatment with cisplatin alone. The combination of bropirimine with either adriamycin, mitomycin, or vincristine was beneficial but the effect was not as consistent or as striking as that seen with the CY and bropirimine combination. It is clear, however, that the combination of act D and bropirimine was not synergistic under the experimental conditions. Since the antitumor activity of pyrimidinone has been reported to be mediated in part by its stimulation of natural killer cell activity, the effect of these cytotoxic drugs on the immunomodulatory activity of bropirimine was investigated. Like CY, cisplatin did not alter the augmentation of natural killer cell activity by bropirimine. However, adriamycin, mitomycin, or vincristine showed a marked inhibition (25-50%) of the augmentation. Act D completely inhibited the immunomodulating activity of bropirimine 4 days after drug administration and continued to show marked inhibition 18 days later. This may partially explain the reasons for lack of synergism between act D and bropirimine. A prolonged immunosuppressive effect exhibited by act D and the degree of tumor repopulation during this period could render bropirimine ineffective. In addition to the magnitude of initial tumor burden reduction by the chemotherapeutic drugs, the present results indicate that the immunosuppressive property of these drugs may also affect the outcome of chemoimmunotherapy.","['Li, L H', 'DeKoning, T F', 'Wallace, T L']","['Li LH', 'DeKoning TF', 'Wallace TL']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'J57CTF25XJ (bropirimine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Cytosine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains']",1987/11/15 00:00,1987/11/15 00:01,['1987/11/15 00:00'],"['1987/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Nov 15;47(22):5894-900.,,,,,,,"['Cancer and Viral Diseases Research, Upjohn Company, Kalamazoo, Michigan 49001.']",,,,,

Tetrahydrouridine (THU) and the deamination product, uracil arabinoside (ara-U) are potent inhibitors of Cyt DA. We investigated whether ara-U or THU pretreatments can protect ara-C from excessive deamination in tumor- (L1210) bearing mice. In order to determine this, plasma concentrations of ara-C, ara-U, and the intracellular levels of ara-CTP, the active anabolite of ara-C, were assayed. The control peak plasma levels of ara-C and ara-U were 3.3 and 0.78 mM and they were eliminated with a half life (t 1/2) of 1.26 and 1.43 hours, respectively. One hour pretreatment with a nontoxic dose of ara-U (single dose of 300 mg/kg intraperitoneally), resulted in increased ara-C levels by 5.9-fold, while ara-U increased 14.3 fold in comparison with controls. A 24-hour (every 8 hours) pretreatment with ara-U increased ara-C plasma levels by 3.0-fold and it was eliminated with a t 1/2 of 1.21 hours. One hour pretreatment with THU (single dose 25 mg/kg intraperitoneally) enhanced ara-C plasma levels by 5.3-fold. In control L1210/0 acid extracts, ara-CTP peaked at 2 hours and reached 2030 +/- 85 microM; ara-CTP was eliminated with a t 1/2 1.47 hours. The ara-CTP cellular concentrations after 1- and 24-hour pretreatments were 1875 +/- 534 and 2624 +/- 429 microM at 4 hours; the t 1/2 were 2.20 and 1.44 hours, respectively. The THU pretreatment resulted in a peak concentration of ara-CTP of 2208 +/- 366 microM at 2 hours and was eliminated with a t 1/2 of 2.54 hours. We concluded that all pretreatments increased both the peak plasma ara-C concentrations and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). One hour ara-U pretreatment did not enhance the peak ara-CTP cellular concentration, but did extend the t 1/2. The 24-hour ara-U and the 1-hour THU pretreatments increased, to some extent, the cellular ara-CTP concentrations, but these differences were not statistically significant. THU pretreatment increased the time the peak occurred and the t 1/2 of ara-CTP. The area under the cellular ara-CTP concentration-time curve (AUC) in L1210 cells was either the same or increased by a small amount after the pretreatments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Avramis, V I', 'Powell, W']","['Avramis VI', 'Powell W']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '18771-50-1 (Tetrahydrouridine)', '3083-77-0 (Arabinofuranosyluracil)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Arabinofuranosyluracil/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'Deamination', 'Leukemia L1210/blood/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Tetrahydrouridine/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Uridine/*analogs & derivatives']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Invest. 1987;5(4):293-9.,,,,,,,"['Department of Pediatrics, USC School of Medicine, Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles 90027.']",,,,,

The compound, a radioiodinated 4-azidosalicylyl derivative of the lysine analogue of methotrexate, is transported into murine L1210 cells in a temperature-dependent, sulfhydryl reagent inhibitable manner with a Kt of 506 +/- 79 nM and a Vmax of 17.9 +/- 4.2 pmol min-1 (mg of total cellular protein)-1. Uptake of the iodinated compound at 200 nM is inhibited by low amounts of methotrexate (I50 = 1.0 microM). The parent compounds of the iodinated photoprobe inhibit [3H]methotrexate uptake, with the uniodinated 4-azidosalicylyl derivative exhibiting a Ki of 66 +/- 21 nM. UV irradiation, at 4 degrees C, of a cell suspension that had been incubated with the probe results in the covalent modification of a 46K-48K protein. This can be demonstrated when the plasma membranes from the labeled cells are analyzed via sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Labeling of this protein occurs half-maximally at a reagent concentration that correlates with the Kt for transport of the iodinated compound. Protection against labeling of this protein by increasing amounts of methotrexate parallels the concentration dependence of inhibition of photoprobe uptake by methotrexate. In addition, no labeling occurs when a cell line that has a defective methotrexate transport system is similarly treated. Evidence that, in the absence of irradiation and at 37 degrees C, the iodinated probe is actually internalized is demonstrated by the labeling of two soluble proteins (Mr 38K and 21K) derived from the cell homogenate supernatant.","['Price, E M', 'Freisheim, J H']","['Price EM', 'Freisheim JH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Azides)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (methotrexate transporter protein, mouse)', '108919-01-3', '(N(alpha)-(4-amino-4-deoxy-10-methylpteroyl)-N(epsilon)-(4-azido-5-iodosalicylyl)', 'lysine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', '*ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters', 'Affinity Labels/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Azides/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1987/07/28 00:00,1987/07/28 00:01,['1987/07/28 00:00'],"['1987/07/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/28 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00389a024 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1987 Jul 28;26(15):4757-63. doi: 10.1021/bi00389a024.,['CA41461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Ohio 45267-0522.']",,,,,

Irradiation of the enzyme in the presence of an equimolar concentration of the 125I-labeled analogue ultimately leads to an 8% incorporation of the photoprobe. A 100-fold molar excess of methotrexate essentially blocks this incorporation. Cyanogen bromide digestion of the labeled enzyme, followed by high-pressure liquid chromatography purification of the generated peptides, indicates that greater than 85% of the total radioactivity is incorporated into a single cyanogen bromide peptide. Sequence analysis revealed this peptide to be residues 53-111, with a majority of the radioactivity centered around residues 63-65 (Lys-Asn-Arg).

Maturation index of a cell lineage was defined as the ratio of cell production rate increase from the first to the last proliferative compartment over the corresponding normal value. The myeloid maturation index was reduced in all cases, but CFU-C progenitor frequency was increased by a factor of 3. Erythroid maturation index was also reduced in most cases, and BFU-E progenitor frequency was reduced by a factor of 2. Similarly, CFU-E cloning efficiency corrected for the erythroid maturation index was 2.5-10-fold lower than normal. Comparison of the erythroid maturation index with ferrokinetics revealed a constant ratio of ineffective erythropoiesis with a maturation disturbance in the proliferative pool twice that in the non-proliferative pool. These findings indicate basic qualitative and quantitative abnormalities and a difference in the patterns of production of erythroid and myeloid cells in the myelodysplastic syndromes: Myeloid progenitors are increased in number but their maturation is grossly abnormal. On the other hand, the apparent reduction in erythroid progenitors and the reduced erythroid maturation index are attributable to both premature cell death of the more mature erythroblasts and an increased proerythroblast proliferation, i.e. extra divisions in the proerythroblast compartment at the expense of maturation.","['Dormer, P', 'Schalhorn, A', 'Wilmanns, W', 'Hershko, C']","['Dormer P', 'Schalhorn A', 'Wilmanns W', 'Hershko C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Erythrocytes/pathology', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb02297.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1987 Sep;67(1):61-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb02297.x.,,,,,,,"['Gesellschaft fur Strahlen- und Umweltforschung, Munchen, Federal Republic of Germany.']",,,,,

The mechanism of action is not clearly understood and it was suggested that low doses of the drug could induce leukaemic cells to differentiate. We investigated the effect of low dose ARA-C (20 mg/m2/d, divided into two doses s.c. at 12 h intervals, x 20 d) on the cell cycle distribution of leukaemic cells in four cases of ANLL. By comparison, four other cases of ANLL were studied during treatment with standard dose ARA-C (200 mg/m2/d as a continuous i.v. infusion x 7 d). Both treatments induced an accumulation of leukaemic cells in post G1 phases, at a variable extent and rate. During treatment by low dose ARA-C, the mitotic index (MI) fell slowly to zero in two patients who achieved a complete remission (CR), while it fell but recovered during treatment in the patients who did not achieve a CR. The MI fell rapidly to zero in the four cases treated by standard dose, who achieved a CR. These data are consistent with the known cytotoxic activity of ARA-C, via inhibition and slowing of DNA synthesis leading to defective cell proliferation and to cell death.","['Baccarani, M', 'Tazzari, P L', 'Motta, M R', 'Rizzi, S', 'Fanin, R', 'Fasola, G', 'Damiani, D', 'Dinota, A', 'Tura, S']","['Baccarani M', 'Tazzari PL', 'Motta MR', 'Rizzi S', 'Fanin R', 'Fasola G', 'Damiani D', 'Dinota A', 'Tura S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Time Factors']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb02292.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1987 Sep;67(1):33-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb02292.x.,,,,,,,"['Institute of Haematology L. and A.

A multi-step purification was developed, consisting essentially in: (i) Tween 40 extraction of crude cell membranes; (ii) solubilization of membrane fragments by Renex-30; (iii) isolation of glycoproteins by affinity chromatography on Lens culinaris haemagglutinin-Sepharose; (iv) papain treatment of the eluted glycoproteins followed by gel-filtration chromatography; (v) purification by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis of two molecular species from the protein-size fraction enriched for immune-complex-binding activity. The two electrophoretically isolated components displayed apparent molecular masses of 70 and 45 kDa by SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and restricted charge heterogeneity by two-dimensional analysis. Two-dimensional peptide mapping revealed the presence of many peptides in common between the two proteins and the absence of a number of peptides in the 45 kDa component. These two polypeptides were used as immunogens to produce polyclonal antibodies that cross-reacted with both proteins and specifically inhibited FcR-mediated reactions in vitro. Furthermore, FcR-related components from detergent-extracted lysates of the human K562 and U937 cell lines or human placental membranes were revealed by the putative anti-FcR antibodies adsorbed on Protein A-Sepharose.","['Gorini, G', 'Medgyesi, G A', 'Garavini, M', 'Dorrington, K J', 'Down, J']","['Gorini G', 'Medgyesi GA', 'Garavini M', 'Dorrington KJ', 'Down J']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)']",IM,"['Antigen-Antibody Complex/immunology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Glycoproteins/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Receptors, Fc/*immunology']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2450075 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1987 Jul 1;245(1):75-83. doi: 10.1042/bj2450075.,,,PMC1148084,,,,"['Laboratory of Pathology, ENEA, C.R.E., Rome, Italy.']",,,,,

A prospective study of adults in remission.,464-70,"To identify adults with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia at risk for the development of central nervous system involvement, we performed periodic cerebrospinal fluid examinations on patients in remission. Among 58 consecutive patients monitored during first remission, central nervous system leukemia developed in nine (16 percent). Four patients, including one who was symptomatic, had central nervous system leukemia detected simultaneously with marrow relapse. Five additional patients were asymptomatic and continue to have bone marrow remission. Following central nervous system and systemic treatment, two of these five patients have never had relapse, and three had relapse in the bone marrow five, 10, and 21 months later. Factors at diagnosis associated with the subsequent development of central nervous system leukemia were elevated leukocyte count, serum lysozyme and lactate dehydrogenase, extramedullary infiltration including splenomegaly, and monocytic (FAB M4 or M5a) morphology. In six of 17 patients (35 percent) with monocytic morphology, central nervous system leukemia developed compared with only three of 41 patients (7 percent) with other subtypes (p = 0.02). Discriminant analysis identified leukocyte count, splenomegaly, and M4 or M5a morphology as the most important risk factors and led to a mathematical formula that correctly identified 90 percent of the patients. Although the risk of central nervous system leukemia in adults with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia is too low to justify routine prophylaxis, those patients recognized to be at a greater risk should receive prophylaxis or be monitored closely with periodic lumbar punctures.","['Peterson, B A', 'Brunning, R D', 'Bloomfield, C D', 'Hurd, D D', 'Gau, J A', 'Peng, G T', 'Goldman, A I']","['Peterson BA', 'Brunning RD', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Hurd DD', 'Gau JA', 'Peng GT', 'Goldman AI']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia/*cerebrospinal fluid/diagnosis', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*cerebrospinal fluid/diagnosis', 'Muramidase/blood', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Splenomegaly/etiology']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(87)90756-X [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(87)90756-x [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1987 Sep;83(3):464-70. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(87)90756-x.,,,,,,,"['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Health Sciences Center, Minneapolis.']",,,,,

The initial yield of single-strand DNA breaks and the rates of their repair were found to be the same in both cell lines by the DNA alkaline elution technique. Using the technique of neutral DNA elution, L5178Y-S cells exhibited slightly increased double-strand breakage immediately after irradiation, most significantly at lower doses (i.e., less than 10 Gy). Nevertheless, even at doses that yielded equal initial double-strand breakage of both cell lines, the survival of L5178Y-S cells was significantly less than that of L5178Y-R cells. When the technique of neutral DNA elution was employed to measure the kinetics of DNA double-strand break repair, both cell lines exhibited biphasic fast and slow components of repair. However, the double-strand repair rate was much lower in the radiosensitive L5178Y-S cells than in the L5178Y-R cells (T1/2 of 60 vs 16 min). This difference was more pronounced in the fast-repair component. These results suggest that the repair of double-strand DNA breaks is an important factor determining the radiosensitivity of L5178Y cells.","['Wlodek, D', 'Hittelman, W N']","['Wlodek D', 'Hittelman WN']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA/radiation effects', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*radiation effects', 'Leukemia L5178/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Radiation Tolerance', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/radiation effects']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1987 Oct;112(1):146-55.,,,,,,,"['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.

Recently we reported that this drug causes, with high incidence, the development of monocytic-myeloid leukemias in male NMRI mice upon 5 X 5 mg/kg i.p. administration. Here we present evidence for the leukemogenic effect of haloperidol in two other strains of mice (XVII AKF1 hybrids, and the low leukemic BALB/c/BOM). The strain-dependent incidence of leukemias ranged both in males and females between 34% (AKR) and 69% (XVII AKF1) with average latencies between approximately 200 (AKR) and 600 (BALB/c) days. On the basis of cytological and cytochemical criteria the predominating type of leukemias was classified as monocytic-myeloid. These leukemic were serially transplantable. Cell-free extracts of leukemic tissues did not induce the disease indicating that no virus was activated by haloperidol. However, when the drug was administered to AKR mice after a suboptimal dose of nitrosomethylurea (NMU), a higher incidence of mixed-type leukemias was observed as with haloperidol alone. NMU alone induced lymphatic leukemias with proven viral involvement. The tumor promoter 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate did not influence haloperidol-induced leukemogenesis.","['Wunderlich, V', 'Fey, F', 'Sydow, G']","['Wunderlich V', 'Fey F', 'Sydow G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['684-93-5 (Methylnitrosourea)', 'J6292F8L3D (Haloperidol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Haloperidol/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Male', 'Methylnitrosourea/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Species Specificity', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/toxicity']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 1987;34(4):389-96.,,,,,,,"['Academy of Sciences of the German Democratic Republic, Central Institute of Cancer Research, Berlin.']",,,,,

The following events were examined: abnormal cell enlargement (giant cell formation), the rate of recovery of cell reproduction and DNA synthesis after releasing the cells from the HU blockage, parental DNA breakage and cell death. The presence of CAF at nontoxic concentration prevented giant cell formation, enhanced cell growth inhibition and cell killing. The effect of CAF was variable, dependent on the duration of exposure to HU and the time of exposure to CAF. To obtain maximal effect, the continuous presence of CAF during HU treatment and posttreatment time was necessary. Hydroxyapatite chromatography assay of single strand (ss) and double strand (ds) fractions in parental DNA and the measurement of the rate of post-treatment recovery of DNA synthesis indicated that CAF enhanced HU-induced DNA lesions. It is concluded that the results give further evidence that even short HU treatment can damage not only newly formed but also parental DNA.

The data on cancer mortality are less subject to selective bias than the registration data on which incidence rates are based, and they provide the firmest grounds on which evidence of any effect can be obtained. These data show conclusively that there has been no general increase in cancer mortality in the vicinity of nuclear installations in a 22-year period beginning several years after the opening of the installations that have released the largest amounts of radionuclides to the environment. On the contrary, the mortality from cancer has tended to be lower in the LAAs in the vicinity of nuclear installations than in control LAAs selected for their presumed comparability with the former. This is unlikely to be due to a protective effect of ionizing radiation and suggests that, despite the efforts that were made to choose comparable control areas, there were non-installation differences between the populations relevant to the risk of dying from one or other type of cancer. Detailed examination of the few types of cancer that were relatively more common in the installation areas suggest that several of the differences were most likely to be due to chance, diagnostic artefacts or social factors rather than to any hazard specifically related to the installations. One disease provides a possible exception: namely, leukaemia in the age group 0-24 years. Two other diseases need further investigation, multiple myeloma and Hodgkin's disease in the older age group 25-74 years. The excess mortality rates recorded from these cancers were not large, and it has yet to be established that they are not due to general confounding by other environmental or socio-economic factors.","['Forman, D', 'Cook-Mozaffari, P', 'Darby, S', 'Davey, G', 'Stratton, I', 'Doll, R', 'Pike, M']","['Forman D', 'Cook-Mozaffari P', 'Darby S', 'Davey G', 'Stratton I', 'Doll R', 'Pike M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nature,Nature,0410462,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Brain Neoplasms/etiology/mortality', 'England', 'Hodgkin Disease/etiology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/mortality', 'Multiple Myeloma/etiology/mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', '*Nuclear Reactors', 'Wales']",1987/10/08 00:00,1987/10/08 00:01,['1987/10/08 00:00'],"['1987/10/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/08 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/329499a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1987 Oct 8-14;329(6139):499-505. doi: 10.1038/329499a0.,,,,,,,"['Imperial Cancer Research Fund Cancer Epidemiology and Clincal Trials Unit, Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, UK.']",,,,,

Recent molecular studies have shown that this chromosomal translocation results in the juxtaposition of the candidate proto-oncogene bcl-2 (B-cell leukemia-lymphoma) on chromosome 18 with the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus on chromosome 14. However, because performing accurate cytogenetic studies in solid hematolymphoid neoplasms is difficult, knowledge of the prevalence of the t(14;18) translocation and, by association, the extent of bcl-2 involvement in human lymphomas is limited. We used a number of chromosome-18 DNA probes to analyze various subtypes of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and test for structural abnormalities near or within the bcl-2 gene. Molecular features of the t(14;18) translocation were found in virtually all follicular neoplasms and about 28 percent of diffuse large-cell lymphomas. No changes in bcl-2 were found in several other subtypes of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, including those previously suggested to originate from follicular-center cells and those about which cytogenetic data have been difficult to obtain. Our findings suggest a close pathogenetic relation between bcl-2 and a large group of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, both with and without a follicular morphology.

Tunicamycin treatment, pulse-chase experiments and Western blot analysis showed that both chains are synthesized as independent proteins. Hybridomas obtained after fusion of LICR-LON and human peripheral blood lymphocytes retained the ability of the parental cell line to synthesize gamma m and gamma s. Some of these hybrids synthesize and secrete IgM which presumably originates from the parental B-lymphocytes. Precipitation and PAGE-SDS analysis of membrane proteins after iodination of intact cells revealed only one heavy chain band, corresponding in size to that of the gamma m. No indication of the synthesis of the membrane form of IgM was found in the hybrids. These data show that the parental (lymphoid) phenotype (m and s-IgG) is codominant with the more differentiated phenotype (s-IgM) of the fusion partner cell (plasma cell). These observations are compatible with a class-specific m-s regulation operating on a different chromatin structure at the expressed Ig loci of each parental chromosome.","['Diaz-Espada, F', 'Milstein, C', 'Secher, D']","['Diaz-Espada F', 'Milstein C', 'Secher D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia/*immunology']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0161-5890(87)90040-x [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1987 Jun;24(6):595-603. doi: 10.1016/0161-5890(87)90040-x.,,,,,,,"['Department of Immunology, Clinica Puerta de Hierro, Madrid, Spain.']",,,,,

One hundred twenty-six evaluable patients were randomized to chemotherapy alone in the same time period. For the entire study, a total of 260 evaluable patients were randomized to chemotherapy. Chemoimmunotherapy patients were compared with the initial 126 chemotherapy patients. Chemotherapy regimens were compared among all 260 patients. Patient characteristics were similar between regimens and between chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy treatment groups.

The comparable chemotherapy alone group had 36%, 58%, and 63% response, respectively. The response rates, adjusted for chemotherapy regimen, were 52% and 38% (P = .02) for chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy, respectively. MER was associated with painful ulcers and fevers.

The molecules which enable them to recognize sensitive cells, or permit tumour cells to escape remain unknown. In the studies described here we have compared some of the plasma membrane characteristics of a NK-sensitive human leukaemia cell line (K562) with those of a partially resistant subclone derived from it (K562-Clone I). Gel electrophoresis of cell-surface proteins radiolabelled by lactoperoxidase-catalysed iodination, periodate-borohydride tritiation, or biosynthetically by incubation with [3H]fucose did not reveal any reproducible differences between the sensitive and resistant lines. However, analysis of glycolipids showed that Clone I incorporated significantly more fucose than did the parental line, and that it synthesized a minor population of complex structures not found in the original K562. A subclone of Clone I (Clone I-Con Ar1), made resistant to the toxic effects of concanavalin A, became sensitive once again to NK, and showed the parental glycolipid profile.

In all three cell lines examined a range of pHi values was associated with exponential growth. When cells from the extremes of the pHi distribution were sorted using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter and then restained for cellular DNA content, it was found that the higher pHi values were associated with enrichment of the S, G2, and M phases of the cell cycle, with a corresponding increase in the percentage of G1 cells at the lower pH1 range, suggesting cell-cycle dependence of pHi. It has been shown previously (I. W. Taylor and P. Hodson, 1984, J. Cell Physiol. 121, 517) that PMC-22 human melanoma cells are capable of entering a distinct pH-dependent quiescent state in response to the acidification of the growth medium which occurs naturally during growth to plateau phase. Simultaneous measurement of pHi and external pH showed that under these conditions pHi was maintained at control values down to an external pH of approximately 6.5, below which cytoplasmic acidification took place. This fall in pHi coincided with the onset of the transition to quiescence. Individual quiescent cells (defined by failure to incorporate bromodeoxyuridine during a 24-h exposure) could not be identified as such on the basis of a low pHi, suggesting that the probability of cell cycling is reduced by lowering pHi. Those cells which remained in cycle showed a markedly reduced rate of DNA synthesis, but a cell-cycle phase distribution similar to that in exponential growth, indicating that prolongation of all cell-cycle phases is an additional factor influencing overall population growth. The external pH at which both of these effects on cell proliferation kinetics took place in vitro is similar to that which occurs regionally within solid tumors, suggesting that pH effects could play a significant role in determining tumor cell growth in vivo.","['Musgrove, E', 'Seaman, M', 'Hedley, D']","['Musgrove E', 'Seaman M', 'Hedley D']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Humans', '*Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Melanoma/pathology', 'Mice']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-4827(87)90093-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(87)90093-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1987 Sep;172(1):65-75. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(87)90093-0.,,,,,,,"['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (Sydney Branch), University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",,,,,

Present studies show that, indeed, DNA in permeabilized metaphase cells, in contrast to cells in interphase, when exposed to buffers of low pH (1.5-2.8) becomes digestible with the single-strand-specific S1 or mung bean nucleases. A variety of extraction procedures and enzymatic treatments provided evidence that the presence of histones, HMG proteins, and S-S bonds in chromatin, as well as phosphorylation or poly(ADP)ribosylation of chromatin proteins, can be excluded as a factor responsible for the differential sensitivity of metaphase vs interphase DNA to denaturation. Cell treatment with NaCl at a concentration of 1.2 N and above abolished the difference between interphase and mitotic cells, rendering DNA in mitotic cells less sensitive to denaturation; such treatment also resulted in decondensation of chromatin visible by microscopy. The present data indicate that structural proteins extractable with greater than or equal to 1.2 N NaCl may be involved in anchoring DNA to the nuclear matrix or chromosome scaffold and may be responsible for maintaining a high degree of chromatin compaction in situ, such as that observed in metaphase chromosomes or in G0 cells. Following dissociation of histones, the high spatial density of the charged DNA polymer may induce topological strain on the double helix, thus decreasing its local stability; this can be detected by metachromatic staining of DNA with AO or digestion with single-strand-specific nucleases.","['Darzynkiewicz, Z', 'Traganos, F', 'Carter, S P', 'Higgins, P J']","['Darzynkiewicz Z', 'Traganos F', 'Carter SP', 'Higgins PJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EN464416SI (Ethidium)', 'F30N4O6XVV (Acridine Orange)']",IM,"['Acridine Orange', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes/*ultrastructure', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Ethidium', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology', 'Metaphase', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-4827(87)90103-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(87)90103-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1987 Sep;172(1):168-79. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(87)90103-0.,"['CA-23296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,"['Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, Walker Laboratory, Rye, New York 10580.']",,,,,

The cell lines were exposed continuously for 4-6 days to drug concentrations ranging between 0.1 and 500 micrograms/ml.

We also evaluated the cytotoxic activity of the two agents on normal human marrow myeloid progenitor cells in a colony-forming assay. Continuous exposure to the drugs gave a dose-dependent inhibition. The concentrations inhibiting the growth by 50% were 76 +/- 31 micrograms/ml for LM975 and 134 +/- 41 micrograms/ml for LM985. One hour incubation with either compound had no toxic effect on the myeloid progenitor cells. In conclusion, LM975 and LM985 do not appear to have a specific cytotoxicity for tumor cells. Our results indicate that, in vitro, toxicity on bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells is concentration dependent.

All derivatives were active against i.p. inoculated P388 leukaemia whereas only some were active against i.v. inoculated LL cells. The relative in vitro activities in the two cell lines, as measured by growth inhibition (IC50) assays, varied from equitoxic to 26-fold more active with P388 cells than with LL cells. The in vivo activity of these drugs against i.v. inoculated LL relative to i.p. inoculated P388 could be predicted with a high degree of significance from the ratio of in vitro activities in the 2 cell lines. However, this correlation did not appear to reflect cell line selectivity alone, since, when P388 cells were inoculated i.v. rather than i.p., drug sensitivity closely matched that of the LL tumour. This observation suggests a dominant role for pharmacological variables in determining the in vivo activity of amsacrine analogues, and underlines the importance of standardising tumour site in the determination of antitumour spectrum. Nevertheless, the correlation of selective in vitro toxicity for cultured LL cells with high activity against remotely implanted tumours demonstrates the utility of in vitro tests in identifying amsacrine analogues with improved clinical potential.","['Baguley, B C', 'Wilson, W R']","['Baguley BC', 'Wilson WR']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol,European journal of cancer & clinical oncology,8112045,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', 'S8P50T62B6 (asulacrine)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0277-5379(87)90254-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol. 1987 Jun;23(6):607-13. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(87)90254-9.,,,,,,,"['Cancer Research Laboratory, University of Auckland Medical School, New Zealand.']",,,,,

One hundred sixty catheters were placed in patients with malignant disease, many of whom were immunosuppressed at the time of catheter insertion. Seventy of 160 (44%) patients received prophylactic antibiotics and 90 (56%) did not. The mean age of each group was 23 years (range, 2 to 70 years), and the patients in each group were statistically similar in sex, underlying disease, and routine preoperative hematologic and biochemical evaluation. Exit-site wound infections occurred in 50 of 90 (55.5%) patients who did not receive prophylaxis and in 12 of 70 (17%) patients who received prophylaxis (P less than 0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of tunnel and incision site infections. The mean duration of antibiotic prophylaxis was 2.9 days (SD, 1.2 days).

Vancomycin was used as antibiotic prophylaxis in 64 patients, Kefzol (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) in one, oxacillin in three, nafcillin in one, and Septra (Burroughs Wellcome, Research Triangle Park, NC) in one. The data indicate that the use of intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduces exit site infection and may reduce both tunnel and incision site infection.

Cervical lymphadenopathy first appeared 6 years after the diagnosis of HCL, and histologic features of the node were characteristic of HD. As it was possible that the neoplastic cells of both lesions might have originated from a single clone, their phenotypic features were defined. The hairy cells were found to bear surface immunoglobulin, receptors for complement components, leukocyte common antigen, and antigen defined by LN-1 monoclonal antibody, whereas lymph node lesion was characterized as HD because the Reed-Sternberg-like cells were positive for Leu M1 antigen, lysozyme, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and nonspecific cross-reacting antigen.

All ddeNs except ddeUrd are potent and/or selective inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro, ddeCyd being the most potent (MIC50, 0.30 microM). The inhibitory effect of ddeCyd on ATH8 cell proliferation and HIV-induced cytopathogenicity is comparable to that of ddCyd. ddeThd is a more potent anti-HIV agent than ddThd (MIC50, 3.4 microM and 84 microM, respectively), but also more cytostatic (ID50, 172 microM and greater than 2000 microM, respectively). However, its in vitro chemotherapeutic index is higher than that of 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine, a drug which has recently proven effective in the treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. ddeAdo has a weaker anti-HIV and a stronger cytostatic effect than ddAdo. Neither ddeUrd nor ddUrd shows significant anti-retroviral activity at 500 microM. In contrast to their anti-retroviral activity, both ddNs and ddeNs lack any appreciable inhibitory activity against a series of nononcogenic RNA and DNA viruses, pointing to their selectivity as anti-retroviral agents. All ddeNs show a progressive loss of anti-retroviral effect upon prolonged incubation with virus-infected cells. This phenomenon is most likely due to the chemical instability of these compounds, and not to a preferential enzymatic phosphorolytic cleavage of the ddeNs. Evidence is presented that ddeCyd and ddCyd, and ddeThd and ddThd are phosphorylated by cellular dCyd kinase and dThd kinase, respectively. However, the Ki values as alternate substrate inhibitors for their respective kinases are high (greater than 500 microM), indicating poor substrate activity and, thus, poor anabolism in ATH8 cells.","['Balzarini, J', 'Kang, G J', 'Dalal, M', 'Herdewijn, P', 'De Clercq, E', 'Broder, S', 'Johns, D G']","['Balzarini J', 'Kang GJ', 'Dalal M', 'Herdewijn P', 'De Clercq E', 'Broder S', 'Johns DG']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleosides)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antiviral Agents', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Deoxyribonucleosides/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'HIV/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Mice', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1987 Jul;32(1):162-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

A wide range of potential risk factors was examined, including prenatal exposure to x rays, maternal drug ingestion and smoking, child's medical history, and parental medical conditions and occupation. Calculations were completed for leukaemia or lymphoma and diagnostic subgroups, as defined by laboratory confirmed cell type. In utero exposure to narcotic analgesics was weakly associated with leukaemia or lymphoma but no other antenatal factors gave significant risks. New associations were identified for skin diseases in both parents and congenital abnormalities in the mothers of children with leukaemia. For past medical conditions in the child, viral disease occurring under 6 months of age increased the risk for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Fewer children in the leukaemia or lymphoma group had been immunised compared with the control groups. Case children diagnosed over the age of 9 years were more likely than controls to have had four or more previous episodes of illness.

One patient had a polymicrobial infection (P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, non-haemolytic streptococcus). Twenty-nine infections were diagnosed only clinically. The mean duration of treatment was 11.1 days (range 4-20 days). Eighty-seven per cent of evaluable febrile episodes improved. Among 11 infections due to Gram-positive cocci, eight (72%) resolved, and in nine (90%) of ten cases due to Gram-negative bacilli success was obtained. The polymicrobial infection also resolved. In only four patients were mild side effects seen, e.g. exanthema, pruritus, phlebitis: renal toxicity was not observed.

Many patients had important aggravating factors such as renal transplantation, peritoneal or haemodialysis, leukaemia, extensive burns, renal stones, tracheostomy and diabetes. Pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21), Escherichia coli (7), and other Enterobacteriaceae (6). Twenty-four pathogens (13 P. aeruginosa) were ticarcillin-resistant. Thirty-six patients were clinically cured including all cases of malignant otitis externa, infected burns and non-obstructed urinary tract infection. Three patients improved and one patient with obstructed urinary tract infection failed. In 32 patients the pathogen was eradicated, in one patient it persisted and in seven it reappeared. In particular, 11 of 13 patients with infections due to ticarcillin-resistant P. aeruginosa were cured and two improved. There was, however, bacteriological relapse in five. There were no side-effects or evidence of toxicity in any of the patients. In an in-vitro study a synergistic effect between ticarcillin and clavulanate was noted against Enterobacteriaceae but only a slight synergistic effect against P. aeruginosa.

This approach easily detected increases in Kaposi's sarcoma (odds ratio (OR) comparing 1973-1978 to 1984: 2,479-fold, proportional increase = 99.9%) and in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (OR = 4.2-fold in 1984, p for trend less than 0.0001, proportional increase = 70%) in the City of San Francisco, with excesses especially in the Burkitt-like lymphomas and immunoblastic lymphomas. Extranodal lymphomas of the brain, but not other sites, were especially prominent (proportional increase = 96%). In addition, nonsignificant increases were seen for Hodgkin's disease (p for trend = 0.13) and for hepatoma (p for trend = 0.08). A posteriori, the authors noted increases in urinary tract tumors and acute lymphoblastic leukemia which warrant monitoring. Other tumors suggested to be AIDS-associated did not occur excessively in this population. Among single young men outside of San Francisco, Kaposi's sarcoma also increased significantly (OR = 182 in 1984), suggesting a lag of about three years behind the increases in the City of San Francisco. Some tumors may require a longer latent period before an association becomes manifest. In the meantime, however, these data indicate that the increases in AIDS-related cancers are limited to only a few malignancies.","['Biggar, R J', 'Horm, J', 'Goedert, J J', 'Melbye, M']","['Biggar RJ', 'Horm J', 'Goedert JJ', 'Melbye M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*complications/epidemiology', 'Adult', 'California', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Single Person']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a114697 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 1987 Oct;126(4):578-86. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a114697.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The monoclonal antibodies were generated against hepatocyte LIMPs and have been characterized previously (Barriocanal et al., 1986a, b). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that all four LIMPs are found in secretory vesicles of RBL cells. Ultrastructural immunolocalization, using a pre-embedding peroxidase technique, confirmed these results and also showed the distribution of LIMPs 1 and 4 at the cell surface. The relative, cell surface concentrations of the four LIMPs was determined using a fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS). In resting RBL cells the concentration of LIMP 1 at the cell surface was highest, followed by LIMP 4. LIMPs 2 and 3 could not be detected at the cell surface. Following stimulation of secretory vesicle exocytosis by A23187, the cell surface concentration of LIMP 4 was increased, whereas the concentration of LIMPs 1-3 remained unchanged.

Five different S9 preparations (from untreated and Aroclor 1254-treated Fischer 344 or Sprague-Dawley male rats) behaved similarly. S9 mix, which contained 1 mM NADP and 5 mM isocitrate as cofactors, was more mutagenic than S9 alone. Heat treatment of S9 did not destroy its mutagenic activity, but the addition of cofactors no longer stimulated an increase in mutagenicity, as observed with native S9. Treatment with cofactors was not mutagenic. These results implied the involvement of both energy-independent and NADPH-dependent enzymatic changes in S9 mix in producing mutagenic substances. The mutagenic treatments with S9 or S9 mix induced predominantly small TFT-resistant mutant colonies, which suggested that these treatments should be clastogenic to cultured mammalian cells. A warning was given that test chemicals evaluated as mutagenic only in the presence of S9 mix may instead be accelerating the decomposition of S9 mix into mutagens, and it may become necessary to experimentally distinguish between these two mechanisms before a chemical can be regarded as mutagenic.","['Myhr, B C', 'Mayo, J K']","['Myhr BC', 'Mayo JK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['56-49-5 (Methylcholanthrene)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biotransformation', 'Hot Temperature', '*Leukemia L5178/genetics', '*Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Methylcholanthrene/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microsomes, Liver/*metabolism', 'Mutagenicity Tests/*methods', 'Rats', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Time Factors']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-1218(87)90030-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1218(87)90030-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1987 Sep;189(1):27-37. doi: 10.1016/0165-1218(87)90030-9.,['N01-ES-28036/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The enzymes exhibited sigmoidal initial velocity versus dCMP concentration whereas in the presence of the activator, dCTP, Michaelis-Menten kinetics were obtained. At saturating substrate concentrations dTTP acted as an allosteric inhibitor of the enzyme isolated from non-stimulated as well as from stimulated lymphocytes. However, the enzymes isolated from the leukemic cells had lost the allosteric regulation by dTTP. At low substrate concentrations the competitive inhibitor, dAMP, activated all the enzymes. This activation was abolished in the presence of dCTP which indicates that dAMP might be involved in the regulation of dCMP deaminase activity and thus influence the dCTP and dTTP pools under physiological conditions.","['Tyrsted, G', 'Chao, P C', 'Munch-Petersen, B']","['Tyrsted G', 'Chao PC', 'Munch-Petersen B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleotide Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.12 (DCMP Deaminase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'DCMP Deaminase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/*enzymology/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleotide Deaminases/*metabolism', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00219395 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 1987 Jul;76(1):27-34. doi: 10.1007/BF00219395.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Report of 38 cases and review of the literature.,397-405,"LGL leukemia results from a chronic, clonal proliferation of LGL. Chronic neutropenia with recurrent bacterial infection and splenomegaly are common clinical manifestations. Rheumatoid arthritis coexists in some of these patients, who thus resemble patients with Felty syndrome. Other hematologic abnormalities that may occur include pure red-cell aplasia and adult-onset cyclic neutropenia. Lymphoid infiltration of bone marrow, splenic red pulp cords, and hepatic sinusoids is characteristic; lymph node and skin involvement are rare. Multiple serologic abnormalities are frequently present, including positive tests for rheumatoid factor and/or antinuclear antibody, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, and circulating immune complexes. Antineutrophil and antiplatelet antibodies are often present. Leukemic LGL exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity; the most common phenotype in our patients is CD2+, CD3+, CD8+, HNK-1+, CD16-. Despite markedly increased numbers of LGL, functional activity of the cells is usually decreased. The mechanism of cytopenias is uncertain: in pure red-cell aplasia, it appears to be due to suppressive effect on erythropoiesis by abnormal LGL, but in patients with chronic neutropenia it may be antibody-mediated. Although most patients appear to have a relatively benign clinical course, mortality from infections and progressive lymphoproliferation is substantial. Optimal therapy remains undefined. Some preliminary evidence suggests that LGL leukemia may be associated with infection with a retrovirus similar to HTLV-I. Although relatively rare, LGL leukemia is of interest because a better understanding of this disease process may contribute to our knowledge of autoimmune diseases, the immunoregulatory functions of LGL, and the mechanisms controlling normal hematopoiesis.","['Loughran, T P Jr', 'Starkebaum, G']","['Loughran TP Jr', 'Starkebaum G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood/complications/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis']",1987/09/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 1987 Sep;66(5):397-405.,['HL 36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

All hairy cells were categorized according to their nuclear morphology into ovoid subtype, convoluted subtype and indented subtype. The overall survival of 113 non-splenectomised patients was 11 months. However, the median survival time of each subtype differed considerably with 55 months for the ovoid subtype, 8 months for the convoluted and 6 months for the indented type. The prognosis of splenectomy patients were significantly better at a p-value of less than 0.0001 than the survival of the non-splenectomised patients. The median survival time was 59 months. Also in this group of patients the prognosis was different for the ovoid, convoluted and indented subtype. The median survival time of the ovoid subtype is not yet reached, despite a observation time of more than 180 months.

The packages included combinations of education, home psychologic support and restructuring, and training in pill taking. A 24-hour profile of the two drugs and their metabolites was first determined. Serum samples were then obtained monthly over 6 months and analyzed for presence of the drugs. Control patients were fully compliant with allopurinol only 16.8% of the time. This rate increased significantly (44% to 48% of the time) for those who received any one of the intervention programs. With respect to prednisone, control patients were compliant 26.8% of the time, with no real improvement after interventions. Finally, self reports overestimated compliance by a factor of two when compared to drug analysis. The results indicated that full compliance with oral medications was remarkably low among our patients who have treatable and in some cases curable hematologic malignancy.

Group A (WBC greater than 100,000/microL) had significantly more deaths during the first week of therapy than did group C (WBC less than 50,000/microL) (P = .0003). CNS hemorrhage was responsible for a significantly greater number of deaths in group A compared with group C (P less than .004). The group B (WBC 50,000 to 100,000/microL) death rate was intermediate. These findings are consistent with other reports of complications of leukostasis. Rapid intervention with antileukemic therapy and cranial irradiation may have decreased the risk of CNS hemorrhage in group A. If early deaths are removed from analysis, the complete remission rate among patient groups is not significantly different (group A, 59%; group B, 68%; group C, 65%). However, further analyses of patients achieving remission demonstrate significant differences among patient groups based on presenting WBC count. The median complete remission duration of patients in group A (4.2 months) is shorter than that of patients in group B (8.0 months) or C (8.0 months), P = .07. In addition, remission duration has improved with modern aggressive antileukemic therapy in groups B (median before 1977, 7.0 months; after 1977, 22.0 + months) and C (before 1977, 6.0 months; after 1977, 16.0 + months).

A complete remission (CR) was obtained in 29/44 (66%) patients. Serum zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) were studied as possible prognostic factors in the determination of the chance of a patient attaining remission. Pretreatment Zn was higher in patients attaining a remission (0.99 +/- 0.05 microgram/ml) than in patients failing to attain a CR (0.78 +/- 0.06 microgram/ml) (P = 0.0216). There was no further difference between the two groups during aplasia. However, when response to treatment was evaluated about day 28, the difference reappeared: 1.06 +/- 0.05 microgram/ml for CR patients vs 0.77 +/- 0.07 microgram/ml for failures (p = 0.0012). Pretreatment Cu was higher in responding (1.44 +/- 0.07 microgram/ml) than in nonresponding (1.06 +/- 0.05 microgram/ml) patients (p = 0.0002). The difference between the two groups remained highly significant at days 7, 14, 21, and 28. At the time of response evaluation, the values were 1.46 +/- 0.05 microgram/ml for CR patients vs 1.19 +/- 0.08 microgram/ml for non-CR patients (P = 0.0070).

To determine whether erythropoietin or other growth factors (functionally similar to burst-promoting activity, BPA) are important in mediating the erythropoietic effects observed in vitro, LP was preabsorbed with monospecific IgG raised against human erythropoietin or human BPA. Although elevated erythropoietin levels were found in each LP, preabsorption with antierythropoietin IgG did not alter its capacity to enhance human burst formation. In contrast, preabsorption with antimembrane IgG capable of recognizing human BPA abrogated the stimulatory effects of LP (p less than 0.05). In addition, LP was found to increase the percentage of murine CFU-S that are synthesizing DNA by the (3H) Tdr suicide technique, an effect which was not abrogated by preabsorption of LP with monospecific IgG raised against human BPA. We conclude that both erythropoietin and BPA are appropriately increased in ANLL. In addition, a factor is present in LP which induces DNA replication in murine pluripotential stem cells.","['Kobari, L', 'Dainiak, N', 'Najman, A', 'Kreczko, S', 'Gorin, N C', 'Duhamel, G', 'Frindel, E']","['Kobari L', 'Dainiak N', 'Najman A', 'Kreczko S', 'Gorin NC', 'Duhamel G', 'Frindel E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Absorption', 'Acute Disease', 'Cell Division', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1987 Sep;15(8):838-44.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventeen cDNA clones carrying the entire coding sequences of beta-tubulin were isolated and classified into two distinct isotypes, represented by two clones designated pMT27 and pMT49, according to the results of restriction mapping. On the basis of the nucleotide sequences of the two cDNAs, pMT27 and pMT49 were identified as mouse beta-tubulin isotypes 3 and 5, respectively. By using in vitro translation products of hybrid-selected mRNAs and of the SP6 in vitro transcripts of the cDNAs, polypeptides encoded by the two cDNA clones were analyzed by IEF. We found that pMT27 and pMT49 encode M beta Ib and M beta Ia, respectively. In addition, M beta II was detected in translation products of mRNA specifically hybridized to pMT49, but not in those of the in vitro transcript of pMT49 DNA.

After 72-h exposure, the 50% drug-inhibitory concentrations for exponentially growing P388 leukemic cells were 1.2 nM for NABV and 0.6 nM for vinblastine. The ultrastructural effects of NABV and vinblastine on P388 cells were similar: formation of tubulin paracrystals; mitotic arrest (C-mitosis); increased post-C-mitotic multinucleated cells; increased number of annulate lamellae; and the appearance of intracytoplasmic paired cisternae. [3H]NABV was used to identify Vinca alkaloid binding sites in P388 cells by photoaffinity labeling. After irradiation at 302 nm, radioactive Vinca alkaloid binding components were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and identified in 1-mm gel slices.

The Mr 54,000 component was identified as a tubulin subunit by immunoprecipitation with antitubulin monoclonal antibodies.

The in vivo decrease of protein synthesis observed 4 h post-NaOCN i.p. administration in the murine P388 leukemia cell cannot be explained by decreased amino acid pools in the mouse peritoneal cavity. In addition, the decrease in protein synthesis observed with NaOCN in isolated P388 cells was shown not to be secondary to (a) alterations in the kinetics of amino acid transport or (b) effects on total nucleotide pools. The incorporation of [14C]phenylalanine in P388 cell-free lysates from NaOCN-pretreated mice was significantly decreased to approximately 55% of control lysates in the presence of exogenous amino acids. The addition of exogenous calf liver tRNA to the lysates did not alter this result. However, no difference was observed in polyuridylic acid-directed [14C]phenylalanine incorporation into polypeptides in micrococcal nuclease-treated P388 lysates from NaOCN-pretreated or control mice. Quaternary initiation complex (48S) formation and mRNA synthesis were found to be significantly decreased by 35 and 38%, respectively, in P388 cells from NaOCN-pretreated mice. DNA synthesis was decreased by 66% of control at 1 h and 62% at 4 h post-NaOCN i.p. administration. No apparent effect with NaOCN was observed on total RNA synthesis in P388 cells. These results suggest that the decrease in P388 cell protein synthesis observed with NaOCN in vivo appears to be due to alterations manifested in the synthesis of cellular mRNA and protein synthesis initiation processes.

DNA alkali-labile sites may be due to the removal of 7-methylguanine by 7-methylguanine-DNA glycosylase which showed the same activity in L-1210 and L-1210/BCNU. Flow cytometry studies revealed that in L-1210 but not in L-1210/BCNU methazolastone induced an arrest of cells in SL-G2-M phases.

Similarly, AA-ANLL had the poorest prognosis in the majority of the classes of the French-American-British nomenclature. ANLL with inversion and/or deletion of chromosome #16 had the best prognosis, and ANLL with t(8;21) was not particularly favorable, nor was acute promyelocytic leukemia with t(15;17).

The neutral and sialylated glycopeptides ranged in size from 1,800 to 4,000 da. on gel filtration. Sequential lectin affinity analysis was then used to fractionate the Asn-oligosaccharides into major structural classes of high mannose, hybrid, and bi-, tri- and tetraantennary complex structures. Using lectins of well defined specificity, the sequential chromatography provided a satisfactory means of assessing the overall glycopeptide profiles of the different leukocyte types. Results from 10 patient samples show that alterations in leukocyte Asn-oligosaccharides occur during leukemogenesis. Most notable was an average twofold increase in the relative amount of high mannose glycopeptides compared to complex glycopeptides for the leukemic cells. High mannose glycopeptides comprised 8.6 percent of the total lectin-adherent glycopeptides from leukemics, and 4.2 percent in the normals. In addition, carbohydrate analysis has revealed that the total amount of neutral hexose was markedly decreased in all leukemic samples. Leukemics ranged from 10.5 to 18.8, while normals ranged from 24.2 to 49.2 nanomole of hexose per 100 micrograms protein. The sialic acid content of the leukemic glycopeptides was relatively unchanged from that of normals, resulting in an apparent increase in the sialic acid: hexose ratio for all leukemic glycopeptides. The results suggest that in the leukemic cells, high mannose structures constitute a larger proportion of the total Asn-linked oligosaccharides, while the overall level of protein glycosylation is decreased. Complex multiantennary glycopeptides, when synthesized, tended to be more fully sialylated than their normal counterparts.","['Forsberg, L S', 'Macher, B A']","['Forsberg LS', 'Macher BA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cancer Biochem Biophys,Cancer biochemistry biophysics,7506524,"['0 (Glycopeptides)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)']",IM,"['Asparagine', 'Chromatography, Affinity/methods', 'Glycopeptides/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Lectins', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukocytes/*analysis', 'Oligosaccharides/*isolation & purification']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Biochem Biophys. 1987 May;9(2):155-68.,['CA 32826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Gender, age, marital status, education, PSR, ED and two relevant interaction terms (PSR X ED; gender X ED) were analyzed using multiple linear and hierarchical regressions. Of the six main variables, gender and PSR had significant association with POMS total mood disturbance, a summary score for POMS emotional subscales, and most of the individual subscales. The PSR X ED interaction provided a rationale for testing a new regression model in which PSR and ED were combined into a single index of impairment. The final index resulted in five levels of physical impairment which bear an approximately linear relationship to increasing levels of distress (Overall regression, P less than 0.001).

Both PBL and LN morphologies correlate with the TTM distribution pattern and demonstrate a prognostic value that is independent of clinical characteristics. From the PBL morphology the LN morphology can be predicted. The prognostic power of the PBL morphology is lost after adjustment for the pattern of growth in LN and vice versa.

These phospholipid prodrugs (either free or incorporated into liposomes) were compared with the corresponding ditetradecanoylphosphatidylethanolamine (C14C14PE) conjugates, some of whose properties have been described previously, for their ability to inhibit the proliferation of human leukemic cells (CEM/O) or cells derived therefrom (CEM/MTX) that are resistant to methotrexate because of a defective drug transport system. Regardless of chain length, the gamma conjugates were more effective than either the alpha or the alpha, gamma conjugates, in inhibiting growth of the parent cells, confirming initial experiments with mouse cells. Chain length had, however, a pronounced influence on the capacity of the various gamma derivatives to circumvent the transport defect. For example, CEM/MTX cells were 120-fold less susceptible than CEM/O cells to inhibition by either methotrexate or methotrexate-gamma-C6C6PE, whereas both cell lines were equally sensitive to methotrexate-gamma-C14C14PE. Although less potent than either of the foregoing, methotrexate-gamma-C14C6PE could partially by-pass the defective transport system. These results suggest that methotrexate-gamma-PE derivatives with appropriate acyl residues might be useful probes to investigate the mechanism by which phospholipids in general are able to traverse cell membranes.","['Kinsky, S C', 'Loader, J E']","['Kinsky SC', 'Loader JE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamines)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Fatty Acids/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Liposomes/metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylethanolamines/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1987/09/04 00:00,1987/09/04 00:01,['1987/09/04 00:00'],"['1987/09/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/04 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2760(87)90175-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2760(87)90175-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1987 Sep 4;921(1):96-103. doi: 10.1016/0005-2760(87)90175-5.,['AI-15796/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Before specific therapies can be anticipated to have a predictable beneficial effect, these areas require active investigation to define the problem more clearly.","['Kaufman, D G', 'Nagler, H M']","['Kaufman DG', 'Nagler HM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Urol Clin North Am,The Urologic clinics of North America,0423221,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Autoantibodies/analysis', 'Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Bacterial Infections/complications/drug therapy', 'Ejaculation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypothermia, Induced', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infertility, Male/*drug therapy/etiology/immunology', 'Leukemia/complications/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Pregnancy', 'Semen/microbiology', 'Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological/complications', 'Spermatogenesis/drug effects', 'Spermatozoa/immunology', 'Testicular Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy', 'Varicocele/complications/therapy']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Urol Clin North Am. 1987 Aug;14(3):489-98.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Full anthropomorphic measurements were performed on 19/32 patients and complete measurements of 3-methylhistidine and the urinary creatinine/height ratio in 9/32 patients. Subsequent examinations revealed a decrease in brachial muscle area, total skeletal muscle mass and urinary creatinine/height ratio which, together with an increase in baseline 3-methylhistidine, confirmed the loss of muscle mass. Mean losses of muscle and fat were 6 p. 100 between T1 and T0 and 7 p. 100 between T2 and T0 for the muscle mass, and 9 p. 100 between T2 and T0 for the fat mass. These losses of body mass occurred very early, with significant differences between T1 and T0 and between T2 and T0.

One new approach to selective photochemotherapy, antibody-targeted photolysis (ATPL) uses photosensitizers (PS) coupled to monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) which bind to cell surface antigens on malignant cells. Selective destruction of human T leukemia cells (HBP-ALL) was accomplished by coupling the efficient PS chlorin e(6) to an anti-T cell MAb using dextran carriers. Conjugates with chlorin: MAb ratios of 30:1 retained > 85% MA b binding activity, and had a quantum yield for singlet oxygen production of 0.7 +/- 0.1, the same as that of free chlorin e(6). Cell killing was dependent on the doses of both MAb-PS and 630-670 nm light and occurred only in target cell populations which bound the MAb. On the order of 10(10) singlet oxygen molecules were necessary to kill a cell. A second approach to specific photochemotherapy, selective carcinoma cell photolysis (SCCP), relies on preferential accumulation of certain cationic PS by carcinoma cell mitochondria. We have evaluated several classes of cationic dyes, and in the case of N,N'-bis-(2-ethyl-1,3-dioxolane)-kryptocyanine (EDKC) and some of its analogs, have demonstrated highly selective killing of human squamous cell, bladder and colon carcinoma cells in vitro. In isolated mitochondria, EDKC uptake and fluorescence depended on membrane potential, and the dye specifically photosensitized damage to Complex I in the electron transport chain. N,N'-bis-(2-ethyl-1,3-dioxolane)-kryptocyanine and some of its analogs accumulated within subcutaneous xenografts of human tumors in nude mice with tumor:skin ratios > 8.

Immunosuppression through the use of corticosteroids or chemotherapy for such conditions as Hodgkin's disease, lymphoma, leukemia, malnutrition, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) should also be noted and alert the clinician to the possible presence of an unusual pathogen. Meningitis associated with leukemia or most of the non-T-cell lymphomas is likely to be from a common bacterial agent (often Listeria), unless the patient is being treated with a steroid or is receiving other chemotherapy. Patients with Hodgkin's disease or AIDS or who have been treated with a steroid are more likely to have cryptococcal or tuberculous meningitis. Neonates and the very elderly may present with only irritability or lethargy and fever, without any of the other common symptoms. In neonates up to one week of age, group B streptococcal infection should be suspected. Gram-negative organisms should be suspected in elderly patients and those who have had neurosurgery.

In each case, leukemic blast cells manifested only one type of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, indicating that the malignant process had developed from a single cell. In six elderly patients, circulating erythrocytes, platelets, or both expressed only the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase found in blast cells, indicating that these leukemias had arisen from stem cells with multipotent differentiative expression. In 16 younger adults and children, erythroid cells and platelets were predominantly derived from normal stem cells. In three other cases, the stem cell that gave rise to leukemic blasts apparently also gave rise to erythroid progenitors but not to mature erythrocytes. Heterogeneity was also found during remissions. In 8 of 13 patients, restoration of nonclonal hemopoiesis and repopulation of the marrow by normal stem cells was observed during remission. In the other five patients, marrow stem cells remained partially or completely clonal, even during remission. These data indicate that acute nonlymphocytic leukemia is a heterogeneous disease with respect to differentiation of the stem cells involved by leukemia and the nature of remissions.","['Fialkow, P J', 'Singer, J W', 'Raskind, W H', 'Adamson, J W', 'Jacobson, R J', 'Bernstein, I D', 'Dow, L W', 'Najfeld, V', 'Veith, R']","['Fialkow PJ', 'Singer JW', 'Raskind WH', 'Adamson JW', 'Jacobson RJ', 'Bernstein ID', 'Dow LW', 'Najfeld V', 'Veith R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,['EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/analysis/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction']",1987/08/20 00:00,1987/08/20 00:01,['1987/08/20 00:00'],"['1987/08/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/20 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM198708203170802 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1987 Aug 20;317(8):468-73. doi: 10.1056/NEJM198708203170802.,"['CA 16448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 31782/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

The binding and redistribution pattern of soybean surface receptors was determined with fluorescein-isothiocyanate conjugated SBA (F-SBA) by ultraviolet microscopy, and with a fluorescent activated cell sorter (FACS). The results indicate that there is a correlation between SBA labelling--distribution and the stage of lymphoid cell differentiation. The SBA labelling on the membrane of null lines was undetectable by U.V. microscopy and flow cytometry. A gradual increase in SBA labelling correlating with the stage of differentiation was observed on cell lines of both B and T origin. However the maximal fluorescence intensity of the T lines was lower than the B lines. The redistribution pattern of SBA on the membrane of T lines was rings and mild patches, whereas that on the B lines was moderate to large patches. The reactivity of the lymphoid lines with SBA was not affected by growth conditions. The binding of SBA to normal lymphoblastoid lines was generally low and the fluorescence intensity weak. The reactivity of these lines with SBA was not associated with their origin or ""age"". It is suggested that the differences in the reactivity of SBA with human hematopoietic lines at various stages of maturation may be of value in future understanding the differences in structure and function of the surface membrane between normal and malignant cells, and the relation to normal and abnormal cell differentiation.","['Ben-Bassat, H', 'Weksler-Zangen, S', 'Shlomai, Z', 'Prokocimer, M']","['Ben-Bassat H', 'Weksler-Zangen S', 'Shlomai Z', 'Prokocimer M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Lectins)', '0 (Plant Lectins)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', '0 (Soybean Proteins)', '0 (soybean lectin)', '0 (soybean lectin receptor)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Lectins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/classification/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', '*Plant Lectins', 'Receptors, Mitogen/metabolism', '*Soybean Proteins']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(87)90030-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1987;11(7):589-95. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(87)90030-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five patients had refractory anemia (RA), four RA with ring sideroblasts (RARS), nine RA with excess blasts (RAEB), eight RAEB 'in transformation' (RAEB-T), three chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and three secondary MDS (SMDS). Two patients in the SMDS group had been treated with alkylating agents for lung cancer and polycythemia vera, respectively. The other had been exposed to thorotrast. Chromosome analyses were performed with Q and G bandings on bone marrow cells incubated for 24 hr. A clonal chromosomal abnormality was observed in the marrow cells from 19 of the 32 patients (59%). Chromosomal abnormalities of nos. 5 and/or 7 were found in five patients, and were probably specific for RAEB-T and SMDS. Among the twelve patients with solely abnormal metaphases (AA), eight (67%) progressed to acute leukemia, a higher proportion than the three from the 13 patients (23%) with solely normal metaphases (NN) (P less than 0.05). One of the seven patients (14%) with both normal and abnormal metaphases (AN) developed acute leukemia (AA v. AN, P less than 0.03). In only two of the 12 patients who progressed to acute leukemia (17%), was complete remission achieved. The median survival time was only 4.0 months for patients with karyotype AA compared with 18.0 months for AN and 24.0 months for NN (AA v. AN, P less than 0.05, AA v. NN, P less than 0.05). The absence of cytogenetically normal cells indicated a poor prognosis with frequent progression to acute leukemia which is resistant to chemotherapy. Progression to acute leukemia depended not only on chromosomal abnormalities but also on morphological subtype classified according to French-American-British co-operative group criteria. Morphological findings and karyotype combined gave a good indication of the outcome for patients with MDS.","['Taniwaki, M', 'Horiike, S', 'Inazawa, J', 'Nishida, K', 'Misawa, S', 'Takino, T', 'Abe, T']","['Taniwaki M', 'Horiike S', 'Inazawa J', 'Nishida K', 'Misawa S', 'Takino T', 'Abe T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Cell Count', '*Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics/mortality', 'Chromosome Banding/methods', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 1987 Jun;17(2):141-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,

M-MuLV-derived mutants or M-MuLV-related variants which transduce the neomycin phosphotransferase gene can, however, induce drug resistance in embryonal carcinoma cells with high efficiency. In this study we investigated the sequences critical for retroviral gene expression in two different embryonal carcinoma cell lines, F9 and PCC4. We show that two synergistically acting sequence elements mediate expression in embryonal carcinoma cells. One of these is located within the U3 region of the viral long terminal repeat, and the second one is in the 5' untranslated region of the retrovirus. The latter element, characterized by a single point mutation, affects the level of stable RNA in infected cells, suggesting a regulatory mechanism similar to that of human immunodeficiency virus in human T cells.","['Weiher, H', 'Barklis, E', 'Ostertag, W', 'Jaenisch, R']","['Weiher H', 'Barklis E', 'Ostertag W', 'Jaenisch R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Viral', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*microbiology', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.61.9.2742-2746.1987 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1987 Sep;61(9):2742-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.61.9.2742-2746.1987.,"['HD-19105/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA 38497/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC255781,,,['GENBANK/M17289'],,,,,,

Cbz-protected species cis-9 and trans-11, respectively, served as a source of stable Cbz-protected precursors to these cyclohexanediol diamines (CDD), which were liberated upon catalytic (H2, Pd/C) hydrogenation. Catalytic osmylation of 9 afforded a mixture of diastereomeric diols 13 and 14, which served as precursors to cis-anti-cis CDD 3b and cis-syn-cis CDD 3a, respectively, whereas osmylation of 11 yielded the expected single product 12, the precursor to cis-anti-trans CDD 3d.

Initial extensive debridement of the lesions, combined with systemic chemotherapy with amphotericin B failed to halt the progression of the disease. Histology showed vascular invasion with hyphal forms. Each patient then responded well to radical debridement (three hemipelvectomies and one chest well resection). The child in an immunocompromised state who develops a red papule, then a black eschar with surrounding erythema, should have immediate biopsy that can easily demonstrate the characteristic hyphal forms.

Analysis of the ribonucleotides in the lymphoid cells provides useful information for the differential diagnosis of patients suspected of having CLL or NHL, and may be valuable for the design of new chemotherapeutic regimens.","['de Korte, D', 'Haverkort, W A', 'Roos, D', 'van Gennip, A H']","['de Korte D', 'Haverkort WA', 'Roos D', 'van Gennip AH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Ribonucleotides)', '0 (Uridine Diphosphate Sugars)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate/analysis', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/*analysis/classification', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Ribonucleotides/*analysis', 'Uridine Diphosphate Sugars/analysis']",1987/08/15 00:00,1987/08/15 00:01,['1987/08/15 00:00'],"['1987/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910400211 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1987 Aug 15;40(2):192-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910400211.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study the uptake and toxic effect of three different Methotrexate-monoclonal antibody (MTX-MoAb) conjugates (MTX-anti-transferrin receptor (TFR), MTX-anti-Ly-2.1 and MTX-anti-L3T4) were examined and compared with free MTX. It was concluded that MTX and these MTX-MoAb conjugates gain entry into tumour cells and are processed by different mechanisms, considering the following results: alterations in temperature had a greater effect on the toxicity of MTX-MoAb than on MTX; in addition, MTX and MTX-MoAb had different rates of action on cells; the specific MTX transport inhibitor, p-chloromercuribenzene sulphonate (pCMS), reduced MTX toxicity but had no effect on specific MTX-MoAb conjugates; the concentration of various ions (Ca2+, Mg2+ and Mn2+) effected the entry of MTX-MoAb but had no effect on free MTX. MTX enters by its own carrier mechanism, while MTX-MoAb conjugates enter by endocytosis with release of MTX at the lysosomal membrane, demonstrated by the ability of chloroquine and NH4Cl (which inhibit lysosomal function) to inhibit the action of MTX-MoAb but not MTX. Therefore, these MTX-MoAb conjugates are not degraded at the surface but bind to their receptor and then enter the cell by endocytosis as one entity; the MTX-MoAb conjugates are then degraded within the lysosomes, resulting in the release of free MTX into the cytoplasm where it acts on dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) to inhibit cell metabolism.","['Smyth, M J', 'Pietersz, G A', 'McKenzie, I F']","['Smyth MJ', 'Pietersz GA', 'McKenzie IF']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Immunol Cell Biol,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cations, Divalent)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cations, Divalent/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Temperature', 'Thymoma/*drug therapy', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*drug therapy']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/icb.1987.21 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Cell Biol. 1987 Apr;65 ( Pt 2):189-200. doi: 10.1038/icb.1987.21.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Portal and sinusoidal tumoral infiltration was observed in all cases. It was associated with angiomatous lesions of the sinusoids in eight cases; these lesions consisted of randomly distributed cavities lined by hairy cells and containing hairy cells and erythrocytes. In addition to the attachment of hairy cells to the sinusoidal wall, other striking electron microscopic abnormalities of the sinusoids included 1) wide areas of communication between the sinusoidal lumen and Disse's space, allowing extravasation of blood cells; 2) focal disruption of the sinusoidal wall; and 3) replacement of the sinusoidal cell lining by tumor cells in close contact with hepatocytes. Most of these changes closely resembled those observed in peliosis hepatis. As in peliosis, sinusoidal alterations in hairy cell leukemia might be due to the destruction of the sinusoidal wall, and tumor cells could play a role in the pathogenesis of the lesions. The pattern of liver involvement in hairy cell leukemia, which is peculiar among hepatic localizations of blood malignancies, might reflect the unique phenotype of the tumor cells.","['Zafrani, E S', 'Degos, F', 'Guigui, B', 'Durand-Schneider, A M', 'Martin, N', 'Flandrin, G', 'Benhamou, J P', 'Feldmann, G']","['Zafrani ES', 'Degos F', 'Guigui B', 'Durand-Schneider AM', 'Martin N', 'Flandrin G', 'Benhamou JP', 'Feldmann G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*pathology', 'Liver/*ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0046-8177(87)80054-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0046-8177(87)80054-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1987 Aug;18(8):801-7. doi: 10.1016/s0046-8177(87)80054-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the same time the activities of erythrocyte SOD are also determined in patients with lung cancer, lymphoma, leukemia and thyroidal dysfunctions. The mean SOD activity of healthy subjects assayed by the method of inhibition of xanthine autoxidation was 11.0 X 10(3) units/g of hemoglobin (Hb). The mean SOD content of healthy subjects assayed by an immunodiffusion method was 456 micrograms/g of Hb. Both the activity and the content of SOD showed normal distributions, while no significant variations in regard to sex and age were detected. A high positive correlation between the activity and the content of SOD was observed in normal healthy subjects (r = 0.77, p less than 0.001). True specific activity was calculated from the levels of activity and content of SOD. The mean true specific activity of SOD in human erythrocytes was 23.7 units/micrograms of SOD. There was no significant difference in true specific activity among age groups. The activity of erythrocyte SOD was determined in 38 patients with lung cancer (n = 15), malignant lymphoma (n = 11) and acute myeloid leukemia (n = 12). Patients with malignant lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia showed a significant decrease in enzyme activity (p less than 0.01) while the patients with lung cancer (9 squamous cell carcinomas and 6 small cell carcinomas) showed a normal value of SOD activity. Furthermore, patients with malignant lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia who were in remission and were not being treated with anticancer drugs also showed a significant decrease in SOD activity. These observations therefore indicate that a low level of erythrocyte SOD activity is related to cancer and that degree of the activities varies with the type of cancer. A total of 18 determinations of erythrocyte SOD activity were made on 16 patients with thyroidal dysfunction. Patients with hyperthyroidism showed a significant increase in SOD activity (p less than 0.01), while patients with hypothyroidism showed the same SOD activity as those of healthy subjects. A significantly high positive correlation was found between erythrocyte SOD activity and the level of thyroxine in serum (r = 0.60, p less than 0.01).

Of the 13 patients who did not undergo consolidation chemotherapy 2 subsequently underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and 3 died as a result of major infectious complications while in complete remission. Eight patients received no further treatment because they refused or had previously experienced severe toxicity. The median disease-free interval for this group was only 3 months. Our preliminary data on brief intensive consolidation therapy for patients with relapsed or primary refractory leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma suggest that this kind of treatment prolongs disease-free interval.","['Peters, W G', 'Willemze, R', 'Colly, L P']","['Peters WG', 'Willemze R', 'Colly LP']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol,European journal of cancer & clinical oncology,8112045,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy', 'Risk']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0277-5379(87)90377-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol. 1987 Apr;23(4):401-5. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(87)90377-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was found that the prevalent 3.8-kb c-myb mRNA present in thymocytes, T cell leukaemias, myelomonocytic leukaemias, erythroleukaemias and myeloid stem cells was initiated at several cap sites mapping within a region 97-244 bp upstream from the protein coding sequence. Utilization of additional cap sites mapping further upstream was also observed in certain cells, most notably thymocytes, and this gave rise to RNA species (4.3-5.6 kb) larger than the presumptive mRNA. In contrast, myeloma cell c-myb transcripts, which are much less abundant than those in more immature haemopoietic cells, were found to be initiated at a restricted set of cap sites mapping 244-277 bp upstream of the coding sequence. Hence, these data suggest that the abundance of the c-myb mRNA may be regulated by a process involving selective utilization of mRNA cap sites.

Differential growth of lymphoma cells was observed when young mice were injected as compared with older mice and when mice were treated with agents known to interfere with natural resistance (e.g., poly(I:C), FLV-P, carrageenan, cyclophosphamide, high doses of irradiated cells). Similar results were obtained by measuring rapid clearance of 125IUdR-labeled EL-4 cells from lungs of intact B6 mice. In vivo cold competition studies, employing EL-4 and several other tumor lines of the same or different haplotype, showed that only EL-4 and RBL-5 cells were capable of inhibiting syngeneic resistance against EL-4 tumor.

Of all the agents examined on a schedule of every 3 days X 3, 10EDAM and cyclophosphamide (CPA) were the most active overall against the tumor models employed. Against the E0771 tumor, antitumor potency was in the descending order of CPA, 10EDAM, cisplatin (Cis Pt), melphalan (L-PAM), MTX, and 5-FU. Similar ranking in relative potency was also derived with the T241 tumor. Against both of these models, MTX and 5-FU were only minimally active. Against the L1210 leukemia, 10EDAM was the most active agent followed in descending order by MTX, CPA, 5-FU, L-PAM, and Cis Pt. All two-drug combinations required attenuation to one-half the LD10 dosage for each. The results show that 10EDAM with CPA was the most effective combination employed in all three tumor models. Therapeutic activity was far greater than that obtained with each agent alone, with a substantial number of long-term survivors. 10EDAM was also highly active in combination with L-PAM and Cis Pt against the E0771 tumor and with Cis Pt against the L1210 leukemia. Some increase in therapeutic activity beyond that obtained with each agent alone, but to a substantially lesser extent, was documented for MTX and each of the three alkylating agents against the L1210 tumor. MTX with 5-FU was not an effective combination, but against the E0771 tumor gave therapeutic effects beyond that obtained with each agent alone when 5-FU was given 7 hours after MTX. Similar effects were seen with 10EDAM and 5-FU on these schedules, but 10EDAM alone was more effective than MTX and 5-FU given together against this tumor. A combination of either antifolate with 5-FU and CPA was ineffective against all three tumor models, in part because of the further attenuation of dosage required in this mouse strain and the minimal overall activity of 5-FU in these models.

PHA isolectin with four L subunits (PHA-L4) induced a significant antiproliferative response of CCRF-CEM and MOLT-4 tumor cells at a concentration of only 0.05 micrograms/ml. A 50% inhibition of DNA synthesis of these two cell lines was obtained at 0.4 and 0.5 micrograms PHA-L4/ml, respectively. The effect was cytostatic rather than cytotoxic. Considerably higher (greater than 10) concentrations of PHA isolectin with four E subunits were needed to induce similar growth inhibition of the tumor cells, as compared to PHA-L4. The effect of PHA isolectins on cellular metabolism of the leukemic cell lines was measured using microcalorimetry. The rate of heat production (thermal power), which is the net effect of all metabolic pathways, was decreased already after a 30-min culture of tumor cells in the presence of isolectin. PHA-L4 showed a significant inhibitory effect at a concentration of 0.1 micrograms/ml, whereas approximately 200 times more of PHA isolectin with four E subunits was needed to obtain the same metabolic inhibition. Measurements of glycolytic lactate and oxygen consumption during isolectin treatments supported the fact that the PHA-L4 induced antiproliferative response of human leukemic cell lines was specific and energy dependent.

Cultures were analyzed for frequency of clusters and colonies as well as for size of clusters.

We find that the equilibrium concentration of drug taken inside the cells varies smoothly with temperature between 37 degrees C and 0 degree C. Even at 0 degree C, however, there is still measurable uptake of the drug into cells. The cytotoxicity index (cloning in soft agar), on the other hand, does not parallel the uptake temperature dependence. Cytotoxicity rapidly diminishes as the temperature of drug exposure is lowered; at all temperatures below about 20 degrees C, Adriamycin is not active. In contrast, other cytotoxic anticancer drugs like mitomycin C, bleomycin, and ARK 73-21 (a platinum analogue) retain cytotoxic potency at low temperatures. The inability of Adriamycin to kill cells at low temperature persists even at very high drug concentrations where substantial quantities of drug enter the cells. The low temperature impotence is not a result of inoperative enzymes which could metabolize Adriamycin to an alkylating species or electron donor to oxygen, since NADH and NADPH dependent reductase activities show linear Arrhenius behavior with no indication of low temperature inactivity. Using purified L1210 plasma membranes with bound Adriamycin as a fluorescence polarization probe, we find evidence of a phase change in the cell surface occurring at the same temperature as the loss of biological activity (approximately equal to 20 degrees C). We conclude that Adriamycin induced cytotoxicity is not dictated solely by uptake, in apparent contradiction with mechanisms requiring an intracellular target. Moreover, the loss of cytotoxicity below 20 degrees C appears to be linked to a structural change in the cell surface membrane, supporting a role other than transport for this membrane in transducing Adriamycin action.","['Lane, P', 'Vichi, P', 'Bain, D L', 'Tritton, T R']","['Lane P', 'Vichi P', 'Bain DL', 'Tritton TR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Mice', 'Microsomes, Liver/enzymology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', '*Temperature', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Aug 1;47(15):4038-42.,['CA28852/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Experience in a large cooperative group.,1143-50,"To evaluate the potential teratogenicity and mutagenicity of modern cancer treatment, the authors enumerated from a cooperative clinical trial group 133 pregnancies in 66 women with malignant neoplasms (53% with Hodgkin's disease, 26% with other lymphomas and leukemia, and 21% with solid tumors). The gestations were divided into the following groups: Group 1, 43 pregnancies ending before therapy; Group 2, therapy given at conception or during 32 pregnancies; and Group 3, 58 pregnancies after therapy. Although the total frequencies of abnormalities were similar in Groups 1 and 2 (23% of 35 pregnancies not electively aborted and 28% of 25, respectively), there were slightly more elective abortions and birth defects related to radiation exposure at a susceptible time of gestation in Group 2. Still, there were eight normal infants among the ten fetuses who were liveborn and had first trimester exposure to chemotherapy alone; so, drug therapy early in pregnancy is not inevitably teratogenic. The apparent and surprising excess of abnormal outcomes in Group 3, 40% of 50 pregnancies, was due to low birth weight and premature terminations of pregnancy, rather than an excess of congenital anomalies. The type of unfavorable outcomes in Group 3 and their concentration in the first year posttherapy suggested they could represent defects in factors (e.g., uterine or hormonal) that normally maintain gestations, and not genetic damage to oocytes. Limitations of the data, collected by mail from physicians and their patients, included biases of self-reporting and low statistical power. Prospective study, probably through interinstitutional collaboration, seems necessary, if accurate estimates are to be made of the frequency of certain outcomes, such as spontaneous abortion and minor anomalies.","['Mulvihill, J J', 'McKeen, E A', 'Rosner, F', 'Zarrabi, M H']","['Mulvihill JJ', 'McKeen EA', 'Rosner F', 'Zarrabi MH']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Medical History Taking', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Risk', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19870901)60:5<1143::aid-cncr2820600537>3.0.co;2-e [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1987 Sep 1;60(5):1143-50. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19870901)60:5<1143::aid-cncr2820600537>3.0.co;2-e.,,,,,,,,,,,,

When higher concentrations of Ara-C (eg, 5 X 10(-5) mol/L) were administered, dCyd-mediated protection toward CFU-GM decreased, but remained significantly greater than that observed for L-CFU. Incubation with 10(-3) mol/L of dCyd reduced the 4-hour intracellular accumulation of the triphosphate derivative of Ara-C (Ara-CTP) in both normal and leukemic cells by greater than 98%; under identical conditions, a significant expansion of the intracellular of the triphosphate derivative of dCyd (dCTP) pools was observed in normal bone marrow mononuclear cells but not in leukemic blasts. This finding was associated with a greater reduction in Ara-C DNA incorporation in normal elements. These in vitro studies suggest that dCyd may preferentially protect normal v leukemic myeloid progenitor cells from the lethal actions of high-dose Ara-C.","['Bhalla, K', 'MacLaughlin, W', 'Cole, J', 'Arlin, Z', 'Baker, M', 'Graham, G', 'Grant, S']","['Bhalla K', 'MacLaughlin W', 'Cole J', 'Arlin Z', 'Baker M', 'Graham G', 'Grant S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphates)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cytarabine/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Deoxycytidine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Phosphates/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78456-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Aug;70(2):568-71.,['CA-35601-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, during the course of therapy in patients with ANLL, the hypermethylation pattern reflects the presence of the leukemic clone even in normal-appearing granulocytes derived from this clone.

Already the initial phase of this cascade still requires a better understanding. Namely, we are still missing a clear physical description of the effective stimulus-producing antigen-IgE complex in terms of size and spatial requirements. We are investigating this problem on a well-defined cell line (rat basophilic leukemia-RBL-2H3) using synthetic divalent haptens and a monoclonal IgE. A subsequent phase following IgE aggregation is a transient increase in the free calcium concentration in these cells' cytosol. The source of the Ca2+ and the way by which it enters the cytosol are studied predominantly by examining antigen-induced channel activity in the cells' membrane allowing Ca2+ influx from the exterior medium. Finally, we have observed that under certain experimental conditions, antigen-induced degranulation can be achieved even without a rise in cytosolic free calcium. In our search for alternative second messengers, we examine the potential candidacy of the cytosolic Na+/H+ balance. So far, we have found that antigen-stimulated secretion does require extracellular sodium and involves changes in its cytosolic pH.

When PSK-treated tumor cells were injected into the abdominal wall of C57BL/6 mice, PSK-treated tumor cells were less invasive than non-treated ones in mice. These phenomena are concern neither with the change of cellular viability nor that of cell proliferation.","['Katano, M', 'Yamamoto, H', 'Torisu, M']","['Katano M', 'Yamamoto H', 'Torisu M']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Among these 10 Alu sequences, the human N-ras oncogene was present in 3 cases. Analysis of nucleotide sequences of the exons of human N-ras oncogenes cloned from the tumors revealed a single point mutation of the codon encoding the 13th amino acid of exon 1 from guanine to cytosine in all 3 cases of MDS. A one-year follow-up study of these MDS cases showed that in the patients positive for the transforming gene, the disease state progressed from PARA, PASA to RAEB or from RAEB to acute leukemia in 6 out of 7 cases, while in the 6 negative patients, no change was observed in their disease states. It was considered that the mutation of the N-ras gene at the 13th amino acid codon of exon 1 was fairly specific to MDS and that presence of the transforming gene may be used for predicting the progress of the disease.","['Takaku, F', 'Hirai, H', 'Nishida, J']","['Takaku F', 'Hirai H', 'Nishida J']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

The reasons for use included multiresistant pathogens susceptible only to norfloxacin in 42 percent, failure of prior use of a marketed antibiotic in 34 percent, and preferred use of norfloxacin due to anticipated toxicity from an aminoglycoside in 32 percent or from other agents in 9 percent. Infections treated included 29 complicated urinary tract infections, 23 involving multiresistant Pseudomonas species, and 10 gastrointestinal infections, seven involving Salmonella species. Prophylaxis of infection was initiated in three neutropenic patients with leukemia. The duration of norfloxacin therapy ranged from eight to 28 days at a daily dose of 800 mg (400 mg twice daily). Norfloxacin treatment resulted in clinical cure or improvement in 84 percent of patients and eradicated the etiologic pathogen(s) 52 percent of the time. In Pseudomonas species infections, cure was achieved in 29 percent of patients and 57 percent showed improvement; the pathogen was eradicated in 43 percent of these infections. Resistance developed in four of the eight Pseudomonas species infections that persisted. Based on a review of compassionate therapy cases, it appears that norfloxacin is effective oral therapy for many complicated urinary and gastrointestinal infections for which other agents cannot be used because of bacterial resistance or anticipated toxicity.","['Heseltine, P N', 'Corrado, M L']","['Heseltine PN', 'Corrado ML']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,['N0F8P22L1P (Norfloxacin)'],IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bacterial Infections/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Digestive System Diseases/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Norfloxacin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Urinary Tract Infections/drug therapy']",1987/06/26 00:00,1987/06/26 00:01,['1987/06/26 00:00'],"['1987/06/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/26 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(87)90626-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(87)90626-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1987 Jun 26;82(6B):88-92. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(87)90626-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the Japanese, or in those with Japanese ancestry born and living in the USA, CLL is rather rare. It is also rare in China, but convincing data to support this statement are found primarily in the Chinese literature. We have reviewed previously unpublished data from Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) concerning the frequency of CLL among adult patients with the four common types of leukemia. Of 4,174 such patients (1952-1986), 4.6% had CLL; 22.9% chronic myeloid leukemia (CML); 50.3% acute myeloid leukemia (AML); and 22.3% acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This low frequency of CLL is none the less higher than that found in a multiinstitutional collection of Chinese patients with leukemia. Various clinical and laboratory aspects of a carefully studied, previously published group of patients with CLL from PUMC were compared to similar published findings in patients from the University of Utah. No differences in the overall nature of the disease were detected between these groups. However, not unexpectedly, the duration of symptoms before the diagnosis was made longer in Chinese than in USA patients and the proportion diagnosed at a time when no CLL related symptoms had been noted was less in Chinese. Neither differences in life span in the two populations nor an excess of CML, AML, and ALL at the expense of CLL were viable hypotheses to explain the rarity of CLL in China. We suggest that the dearth of CLL in Chinese is on a genetic basis, as it is thought to be in the Japanese.","['Boggs, D R', 'Chen, S C', 'Zhang, Z N', 'Zhang, A']","['Boggs DR', 'Chen SC', 'Zhang ZN', 'Zhang A']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Adult', 'China', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*epidemiology', 'United States']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830250317 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1987 Jul;25(3):349-54. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830250317.,['5 R01 AM14352-17/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Among 3,494 hand laminators (the job with the highest exposure to styrene) there was one death from lymphoma and none from leukemia. The findings do not exclude the possibility that styrene is a human carcinogen, but give no support to the hypothesis that it causes leukemia and lymphoma.","['Coggon, D', 'Osmond, C', 'Pannett, B', 'Simmonds, S', 'Winter, P D', 'Acheson, E D']","['Coggon D', 'Osmond C', 'Pannett B', 'Simmonds S', 'Winter PD', 'Acheson ED']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Finland,Scand J Work Environ Health,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",7511540,"['0 (Plastics)', '0 (Styrenes)']",IM,"['Female', 'Glass', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Plastics', 'Styrenes/*adverse effects', 'United Kingdom']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['2067 [pii]', '10.5271/sjweh.2067 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Work Environ Health. 1987 Apr;13(2):94-9. doi: 10.5271/sjweh.2067.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an altered sinus the staining pattern of the ring fibres had gained attenuations and the sinus was sometimes lined by a continuous BM of uneven thickness. The number of altered sinuses was related to the size of the spleen. The pseudosinuses were larger than normal sinuses and usually also larger than altered sinuses. One of the two types seemed to be derived from ruptured Billroth's cords and entailed spaces of irregular size and shape bounded by strips of fibres containing BM proteins. No ring fibres were seen in the wall. The other type of pseudosinus occurred in those spleens where no white pulp remained. These spaces were large, located around arteries and bounded by irregular strips of BM material.

It has also been demonstrated that the period of treatment required to achieve this is shorter when DC administration is started in later stages of tumor progression. Therefore, the leukemic cells may have properties with regard to DC sensitivity which change with time during tumor progression. In the present study this hypothesis was tested by studying the permeability for DC, the presence of cell-surface molecules, and the mitochondrial content of the leukemic cells in various stages of tumor development in control and in DC-treated rats. Changes in DC permeability or antigenic phenotype were not observed, but the content of mitochondria decreases during tumor progression. DC treatment leads to an additional reduction of the content of functional mitochondria which results in proliferation arrest. The higher mitochondrial content of the leukemic cells during the earlier stages of tumor development explains thus why a longer period of DC treatment is needed to achieve growth arrest when treatment is started in these stages.","['Van den Bogert, C', 'Dontje, B H', 'Kuzela, S', 'Melis, T E', 'Opstelten, D', 'Kroon, A M']","['Van den Bogert C', 'Dontje BH', 'Kuzela S', 'Melis TE', 'Opstelten D', 'Kroon AM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Doxycycline/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Permeability', 'Phenotype', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Rats']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(87)90088-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1987;11(6):529-36. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(87)90088-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objectives of the trial reported here were to evaluate clinical responses and assess pharmacokinetic parameters as a determinant of outcome when VM-26 was administered as a 72-hour continuous infusion (CI) with doses escalated from 300 to 750 mg/m2 per course. Twenty-eight patients with recurrent leukemia, lymphoma, or neuroblastoma received 53 courses of CI VM-26 and 16 had measurable responses. There were two partial remissions and one stable disease among seven neuroblastoma patients and 13 of 21 leukemia/lymphoma patients had oncolytic responses (greater than or equal to 75% decrease in circulating blasts). Toxicity included moderate to severe mucositis and myelosuppression. Pharmacokinetic parameters determined during 35 courses administered to 23 patients were highly variable. Clearance (CI) ranged between 3.7 and 43.8 ml/min/m2, resulting in VM-26 plasma concentrations from 2.8 to 30.6 mg/L across all dose levels. The interpatient pharmacokinetic variability reflected in CI and VM-26 steady state concentrations (Css), obscured any dose-response relationship. However, when pharmacokinetic parameters for responding and nonresponding patients were compared, statistically significant relationships were observed. For responders, the mean Css was 15.2 mg/L and mean CI was 12.1 mL/min/m2; for nonresponders, mean Css was 6.2 mg/L (P less than .01) and mean CI was 21.3 mL/min/m2 (P less than .05). Thus, patients with higher CI and lower Css were less likely to respond. Clinical responses occurred in ten of ten patients with Css greater than 12 mg/L, and only five of 13 patients with Css less than 12 mg/L (P less than .01). In this study, interpatient pharmacokinetic variability yielded a four- to sixfold difference in intensity of systemic exposure (Css) within the same dose level, which was an important determinant of clinical response. These data indicate that achieving a VM-26 target concentration for individual patients could ensure an increased intensity of systemic exposure in patients with a high CI and improve the likelihood of effective therapy.","['Rodman, J H', 'Abromowitch, M', 'Sinkule, J A', 'Hayes, F A', 'Rivera, G K', 'Evans, W E']","['Rodman JH', 'Abromowitch M', 'Sinkule JA', 'Hayes FA', 'Rivera GK', 'Evans WE']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",IM,"['Child', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Parenteral', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Neuroblastoma/*drug therapy', 'Podophyllotoxin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Teniposide/administration & dosage/metabolism/*therapeutic use']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1987.5.7.1007 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1987 Jul;5(7):1007-14. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1987.5.7.1007.,"['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that the Ca2+ response to antigen and to ionomycin has two components, a Ca2+ spike and a Ca2+ plateau. In nominally Ca2+-free medium, both components of the Ca2+ response are inhibited and secretion does not occur. In Na+-free medium, the initial Ca2+ spike induced by antigen or ionomycin occurs, but the plateau is again absent and secretion is inhibited by 30 to 50%. Secretion is also reduced by 10(-4) M amiloride, an inhibitor of Na+ transport pathways, and by 10(-5) M concentrations of two amiloride analogs with greater activity than amiloride, respectively, against Na+ channels and Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Phorbol esters, which stimulate protein kinase C, enhance the Ca2+ plateau and secretion caused by suboptimal amounts of both antigen and ionomycin; this enhancement depends on extracellular Na+. The Na+ ionophore, monensin, mimics the Ca2+ plateau. From these data, we infer that the Ca2+ spike and plateau reflect separate responses of RBL-2H3 cells to antigen or ionomycin. We propose that the Ca2+ plateau results at least in part from the activation of a Na+-dependent Ca2+ influx pathway. One possible mechanism is that antigen binding stimulates a protein kinase C-regulated Na+ transport system. The resulting influx of Na+ may activate a Na+/Ca2+ antiporter that supports the Ca2+ plateau and mediator release.","['Stump, R F', 'Oliver, J M', 'Cragoe, E J Jr', 'Deanin, G G']","['Stump RF', 'Oliver JM', 'Cragoe EJ Jr', 'Deanin GG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Sodium-Calcium Exchanger)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '7DZO8EB0Z3 (Amiloride)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amiloride/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Antigens/immunology', 'Basophils/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Calcium/*physiology', 'Carrier Proteins/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Exocytosis/*drug effects', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/physiology', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', 'Serotonin/*metabolism', 'Sodium/*physiology', 'Sodium-Calcium Exchanger']",1987/08/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Aug 1;139(3):881-6.,"['GM 37202/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HD06665/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We have attempted a more integrated and quantitative evaluation of carcinogenic risk for humans, trying to utilize, in addition to the epidemiological data, all data available, specifically data on metabolism, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity in small rodents. An integrated evaluation of the globality of the available data seems to suggest a progressive saturation of metabolic capacity both for man and rodents between 10 and 100 ppm. The most susceptible target cells seem to be different in humans (predominant induction of myelogenous leukemia) and small rodents (induction of a wide variety of tumors). Nevertheless, both epidemiological and experimental carcinogenicity data tend to indicate a flattening of the response for the highest dosages, again suggesting a general saturation of mechanisms of metabolic activation, extended to different target tissues. From a quantitative point of view, the data suggest a carcinogenic potency at 10 ppm two to three times higher than that computable by a linear extrapolation from data in the 100 ppm range.

The competitive inhibition of NK cells by GM2 was restricted to the source of tissue from which GM2 was isolated.

Male birth year cohorts 1926-41 were analyzed by comparing observed/expected ratios. There were 422 cases of leukaemia (A59) in these cohorts during 1949-78 which was the follow-up period. The expected values were counted on the basis of experience of the whole population of included cohorts. There were approximately 533,000 persons in the cohorts studied. About 315,000 participated in the mass BCG vaccination campaign. 115,000 were tuberculin positive, 200,000 were negative and BCG vaccinated. The cohort analysis techniques were applied and the findings presented as Lexis diagrams. A sample of the population register was used in order to check the matching errors in FVI. Obviously, the presented number of participants is not quite reliable. This is understandable because the register had not been in use from 1953-77 and contact with the organizers is no longer possible. With correction factors the errors can be adjusted, at least to some extent. The register is functioning as expected in relation to general mortality and tuberculosis. The results indicate that there is no marked difference between naturally T. B. infected and BCG vaccinated persons. The participants seem to have considerably less cases of leukaemia than the non-participants of which a great deal are not infected or vaccinated. Structural weaknesses in the FVI do not allow firm conclusions to drawn. There is in any case so much evidence by age, by calendar year and by cohort that a hypothesis of the diminishing long term effects on leukaemia is justified. The interrelationships are long standing and were noticeable during the whole follow-up period about 30 years. It seems that there is no difference in the possible effect between different types of leukaemia. The structural weaknesses, like the real number of participants in the register can be corrected. The analysis can be broadened to cover females as well, which will also facilitate analysis by different types of leukaemia. The possible long standing effect of mycobacterial infections are discussed. Some strategies of further research are outlined.","['Haro, A S']",['Haro AS'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Dev Biol Stand,Developments in biological standardization,0427140,['0 (BCG Vaccine)'],IM,"['*BCG Vaccine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Finland', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Tuberculin Test', 'Tuberculosis/complications/*prevention & control']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Dev Biol Stand. 1986;58 ( Pt A):433-49.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The facts are that: Fetal rests or stigmata thereof remain in many of the organs of the body--the liver, the kidney, the spleen, the brain and so forth. These rests are usually absorbed by the end of the first year of life, but recent evidence indicates that stigmata of this fetal tissue may remain throughout one's entire life and be precursors of cancer. In animals and in humans, the antigens from malignant neoplasms crossreact with anti-fetal antibodies. Many tumors express fetal antigens and secrete fetal products. Alpha-feto-protein was found in adult cancer of the liver; carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) has been reported in cancer of the colon-rectum; fetal alkaline phosphatase has been found in many adult cancers. Fetal tissue injected into animals will immunize these animals against certain transplanted tumors. Recently, in a lecture at Salk Institute, Sir Peter Medawar, Nobel Prize winner in medicine and until recently the head of the British Medical Research Council, described the use of quasi-fetal tissue as helpful in treating cancer of the adult. The infant's immune system is not fully developed. In fact, one can transfuse an infant without typing because he has built no antibodies to the blood types in early infancy. It has been shown in individuals of any age who are immune-deficient, either by heredity or acquired that the rate of malignancy may be as high as 10,000 times that of the general population. The immune system controls cancer development to a great extent. Published data suggests that the immune system detects and destroys embryonic cells or components thereof that may be a locus for cancer development. Our studies demonstrated that in some 85,353 BCG vaccinated newborns followed over a period of 20 years, there was an overall 74 percent reduction in the death rate from all forms of cancer when compared to a similar group not vaccinated. The differences were highly significant statistically.

Since our original communication describing the CT findings of IPA, we have added ten new cases, each subsequently substantiated by lung biopsy (two), autopsy (two), and/or positive cultures of sputum or extrapulmonary sites (seven). The CT halo sign, or zone of lower attenuation surrounding a pulmonary mass, was present in eight of nine patients with early CT scans obtained during bone marrow aplasia. Characteristic CT progression from multiple fluffy masses to cavitation or air crescent formation suggested IPA in five of seven patients with serial CT scans. CT directly affected patient management in seven of ten cases. Scan findings were one criterion for increasing to high-dose amphotericin B or for adding 5-fluorocytosine.

The protective action of CRN against the toxic effects of MTZ is not accompanied by a reduction of the antitumour activity of MTZ; on the contrary the reduced toxicity permits higher doses of MTZ to be given with the result that better antitumour activity can be achieved. This is illustrated by the highly effective action of MTZ and CRN in preventing the appearance of Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL) metastases, a tumour against which MTZ when used alone is inactive even at maximum tolerated doses (MTD). However, the effect of the combination on the primary 3LL is less pronounced. HD-MTZ and CRN are also more effective than MTD-MTZ alone in preventing dissemination and proliferation of L1210 leukaemia. Although the mechanism of the CRN protective effect is as yet unclear it appears that CRN prevents the lethal effects of necrotizing enteritis produced by HD-MTZ. It is concluded that CRN by reducing MTZ toxicity without interfering with its activity increases the therapeutic index of MTZ and permits an expanded exploration of its dose response curve against a variety of malignancies.","['Hellmann, K', 'Hutchinson, G E', 'Henry, K']","['Hellmann K', 'Hutchinson GE', 'Henry K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Clin Exp Metastasis,Clinical & experimental metastasis,8409970,"['0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (cronassial)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Gangliosides/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/prevention & control', 'Neoplasm Transplantation']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00058061 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Metastasis. 1987 Apr-Jun;5(2):157-63. doi: 10.1007/BF00058061.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to the decrease in myc expression seen when leukemia cells are induced to differentiate, we have found no changes in expression of the myc gene family in differentiated colon carcinoma cells. However, a greater than 5-fold increase in expression of sequences which hybridize to Ha-ras was observed in cells which secrete mucin, with a smaller increase seen in expression of Ki-ras in the same cells. This increase was not seen in cells which exhibit vectorial transport of water and ions, and which are not mucus-secreting. All differentiated lines were less tumorigenic in nude mice than the parental HT29 cells, irrespective of the level of ras expression. These results are consistent with the reports that ras expression is highest in the most differentiated cells of the colon and is substantially decreased in metastatic human colon tumors as compared to primary colon tumors. The data also suggest that a high level of ras gene expression is a marker for a particular differentiated state in colon cells rather than being directly equated with transformation or tumorigenicity.

Side effects of high dose Ara-C though relatively substantial are manageable enough to warrant wider scale efficacy trials of this agent in childhood leukemias and solid tumors.","['Barrios, N J', 'Tebbi, C K', 'Freeman, A I', 'Brecher, M L']","['Barrios NJ', 'Tebbi CK', 'Freeman AI', 'Brecher ML']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Remission Induction']",1987/07/15 00:00,1987/07/15 00:01,['1987/07/15 00:00'],"['1987/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19870715)60:2<165::aid-cncr2820600207>3.0.co;2-g [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1987 Jul 15;60(2):165-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19870715)60:2<165::aid-cncr2820600207>3.0.co;2-g.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mode of interaction of adriamycin with its nuclear target, responsible for its therapeutic effect, is known [Berman, H. M., & Young, P.R. (1981) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 10, 87-114]. The planar anthracycline moiety of adriamycin intercalates between the base pairs whereas the sugar moiety fits into the DNA large groove. However, the cardiotoxicity of adriamycin places a limit on the total dose that may be given [Minow, R. A., Banjamin, R.S., & Gottlieb, J. A. (1975) Cancer Chemother. Rep. 6, 195-202]. Much evidence suggests that the mitochondrial membrane could be the target responsible for adriamycin cardiotoxicity. The formation of a very stable complex between adriamycin and cardiolipin, a phospholipid specific to the inner mitochondrial membrane, has been shown to inhibit several mitochondrial membrane enzymes whose activities depend on the presence of cardiolipin. Using attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy, we demonstrate here that, in the adriamycin-cardiolipin complex, both cardiolipin and adriamycin structures are modified as compared with the pure substances. Dichroism values indicate a slight reorientation of the cardiolipin molecule toward a normal to the plane of the bilayer whereas adriamycin, which shows no ordering in a pure phase, is highly ordered in the complex, the anthracycline moiety titled at about 40 degrees with respect to the normal to the plane of the bilayer. The partial disappearance of NH3+ characteristic bands indicates the involvement of the positively charged amino group of adriamycin in the complex formation.","['Goormaghtigh, E', 'Brasseur, R', 'Huart, P', 'Ruysschaert, J M']","['Goormaghtigh E', 'Brasseur R', 'Huart P', 'Ruysschaert JM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Cardiolipins)', '0 (adriamycin-cardiolipin complex)', '7664-41-7 (Ammonia)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Ammonia', '*Cardiolipins', 'Circular Dichroism', '*Doxorubicin', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared/methods']",1987/03/24 00:00,1987/03/24 00:01,['1987/03/24 00:00'],"['1987/03/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/24 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00380a043 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1987 Mar 24;26(6):1789-94. doi: 10.1021/bi00380a043.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The P values for liposomes prepared from lipid extracts of natural (purified) membranes of various origins could be more or less predicted (calculated) from the relative contributions of the individual lipid components. In all cases, the polarization varied with the cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio (C/PL) according to the equation P = Pplat -(Pplat -Pzero) exp(-alpha C/PL), in which Pzero refers to the polarization without cholesterol and Pplat is a maximal plateau value, reached at a high C/PL (greater than 1). The ""cholesterol-ordering coefficient"" alpha of the phospholipids was found to increase with the fraction of sphingomyelin or dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine molecules, indicating that the susceptibility of phospholipids to be ordered by cholesterol is increased by these compounds. Pzero increases curvilinearly with the fraction of either of these molecules. Pplat increases linearly with the fraction of saturated acyl chains for most phospholipids. Highly unsaturated fatty acyl chains (e.g., 20:4 and 22:6) strongly depress Pplat but not Pzero. The results suggest that such phospholipids are unlikely to associate with cholesterol and may thus create extremely fluid membrane domains. The disproportionation of cholesterol in the cell can be understood by the differing composition of the phospholipids in plasma membranes and endomembranes and their ordering susceptibility (affinity) toward cholesterol.","['van Blitterswijk, W J', 'van der Meer, B W', 'Hilkmann, H']","['van Blitterswijk WJ', 'van der Meer BW', 'Hilkmann H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', '*Cholesterol/metabolism', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism', '*Fatty Acids', '*Fatty Acids, Unsaturated', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Liposomes', 'Liver/metabolism', '*Membrane Fluidity', 'Membrane Lipids/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphatidylcholines', '*Phospholipids/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1987/03/24 00:00,1987/03/24 00:01,['1987/03/24 00:00'],"['1987/03/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/24 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00380a038 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1987 Mar 24;26(6):1746-56. doi: 10.1021/bi00380a038.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute leukaemias.,27-36,"Peripheral blood samples from 118 patients with acute leukaemia (68 untreated; 50 treated) were measured with the Technicon H-6000 automated haematology analyser. This instrument provides, in addition to measurements of the classical haematology parameters (i.e. cell counts, haemoglobin concentration, etc.), a differential count on 10(4) WBC effected by means of flow cytochemistry (peroxidase content) and volume (light scatter) discrimination. Disregarding RBC and platelet counts and their volume distribution profiles, the most important diagnostic parameters for leukaemic disease were the WBC count, the WBC differential count, and the proportions of large unstained cells (LUC) and high peroxidase (HPX) cells obtained by the automated differential count as well as the mean value of the WBC peroxidase content distribution (MPA). Granulocytic leukaemias had lower MPA than normal and lymphocytic leukaemias had MPA values above normal. M1 leukaemias were also characterized by large proportions of LUC and low fractions of HPX, while M2 leukaemias showed low LUC with high HPX. M3 leukaemias had low LUC and very high HPX. M4 leukaemias had large LUC and 'monocytic' components and a modest fraction of HPX. M5 leukaemias had very large numbers of LUC, 'monocytes' and 'lymphocytes' and a normal HPX. For M1 leukaemia, the presence of less than 7% LUC following induction treatment was related to morphological changes of normal cells induced by chemotherapy while LUC above 10% usually indicated unsuccessful induction associated with the presence of residual blasts. If treatment was successful, M2 and M3 leukaemias characteristically decreased their HPX population. All M4 leukaemias studied by us failed to enter remission and continued to display high proportions of HPX and LUC. Similarly, most M5 leukaemias had a poor response to treatment and always showed a very high proportion of LUC. Untreated lymphocytic leukaemias demonstrated high LUC, normal HPX and a high proportion of 'lymphocytes'. Hairy cell leukaemias showed almost equal proportions of 'lymphocytes' and LUC. Successful chemotherapy of all lymphoid leukaemia entities was associated with rapid decreases in LUC, slower decrements of 'lymphocytes' and moderate and transient increments in HPX. Thus, flow cytochemistry can assist not only in the segregation of acute leukaemias along with FAB classification with nonmorphologic criteria, but also in the follow up of patients with these diseases.","['Drewinko, B', 'Bollinger, P', 'Brailas, C', 'Moyle, S', 'Wyatt, J', 'Simson, E', 'Johnston, D', 'Trujillo, J M']","['Drewinko B', 'Bollinger P', 'Brailas C', 'Moyle S', 'Wyatt J', 'Simson E', 'Johnston D', 'Trujillo JM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Flow Cytometry/*instrumentation', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes/*pathology']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb06886.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1987 May;66(1):27-36. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb06886.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Throughout the study period a total of 90 pyrexial episodes were monitored in which organisms designated to be pathogens were isolated from blood cultures on 38 occasions. The response rate to the combination of a ureidopenicillin with gentamicin fell sharply from 50% during patients' first pyrexial episodes to zero during the third and subsequent episodes. The preponderance of Gram-positive bacteria and the high overall resistance of bacterial isolates to these antibiotics have led us to reconsider our approach to empirical therapy and to include antibiotics with greater activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis.

Initial rate kinetics and extent of duality of entry routes for folic acid and diastereomers of 5-methyltetrahydrohomofolate in the presence of physiological anions.,1659-67,"Comparison of the kinetic parameters for influx of highly purified [3H]folic acid versus [3H]methotrexate in L1210 cells under anionic buffer conditions showed a marked discordancy. In addition, the kinetics for influx of [3H]folic acid were unchanged in variant L1210 cells defective in [3H]methotrexate transport. In these variant cells, the Vmax for methotrexate was reduced 17-fold and the Km was increased 3-fold. The results show that [3H]folic acid influx is mediated by a system which has a low affinity, but a 20-fold higher capacity, for folate compounds than the classical high-affinity system mediating [3H]methotrexate influx. Since the latter system also exhibits very low affinity for [3H]folic acid, it would not be expected to contribute significantly to the total influx of [3H]folic acid. The high-capacity system for [3H]folic acid influx is different from that believed to mediate pterin influx in L1210 cells since it was not inhibited by adenine, a potent inhibitor of pterin influx. However, exposure of cells to [3H]folic acid in a nonanionic buffer resulted in marked stimulation of initial influx, and a fraction of influx under these conditions was inhibited by methotrexate. These results suggest that anions modulate the extent of multiplicity of [3H]folic acid influx by their known effects on the high-affinity, reduced folate/methotrexate system. The diastereomers, at carbon 6, of [14C]5-methyltetrahydrohomofolate shared both transport systems. The influx Km for the natural diastereomer was one-half that of the unnatural form for both transport systems. Both diastereomers showed a much greater differential in affinity between the two transport systems than did [3H]folic acid. Our results suggest that an analog which could be effectively transported by the low-affinity/high-capacity route may be useful in the treatment of tumors resistant to methotrexate due to a defective high-affinity/low capacity influx system. We also found that incubation of L1210 cells with [3H]folic acid or the natural diastereomer [14C]5-methyltetrahydrohomofolate for 10 min resulted in the formation of a nonexchangeable fraction of radioactivity amounting to 20-40% of the total accumulation. This non-exchangeable fraction may be explained by the accumulation of metabolites other than polyglutamates. Preloading of cells with methotrexate prior to incubation with [3H]folic acid prevented the accumulation of radioactivity as a nonexchangeable fraction.","['Sirotnak, F M', 'Goutas, L J', 'Jacobsen, D M', 'Mines, L S', 'Barrueco, J R', 'Gaumont, Y', 'Kisliuk, R L']","['Sirotnak FM', 'Goutas LJ', 'Jacobsen DM', 'Mines LS', 'Barrueco JR', 'Gaumont Y', 'Kisliuk RL']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Anions)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '52196-22-2 (5-methyltetrahydrohomofolic acid)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Anions', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Folic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/metabolism', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Stereoisomerism']",1987/05/15 00:00,1987/05/15 00:01,['1987/05/15 00:00'],"['1987/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(87)90051-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(87)90051-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1987 May 15;36(10):1659-67. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(87)90051-7.,"['CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA10914/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Proliferative activity was calculated as the percentage of cells with DNA content intermediate between the diploid (2n) and the tetraploid (4n) values (2n-4n%). Ploidy was expressed as the ratio between the modal channel of the G0-G1 peak of the probe and that of an internal reference standard (DNA index, DI).

Drug-resistant tumor cells, however, usually bear biochemical changes which are related to the resistance mechanisms. New modalities against resistant cells could be possible if we were able to characterize these biochemical changes. Vincristine (VCR)- and adriamycin (ADM)-resistant tumor sublines show cross-resistance (pleiotropic drug resistance) to other unrelated drugs. VCR- and ADM-resistant sublines possess an enhanced outward transport of antitumor agents, which results in a low accumulation of antitumor agents in the cells. The cells express unique glycoproteins in the plasma membrane, and possess a higher calcium content in the cells. They also have double-minute chromosomes and homogeneously staining regions in chromosomes. By targeting for these biochemical changes, we have established new modalities against drug-resistant tumor cells. Calcium channel blockers inhibited the enhanced outward transport of VCR and ADM from resistant tumor cells, and thus overcame resistance to these agents. This approach showed potential usefulness in clinical trials. Another possible approach against drug-resistant tumor cells could be the utilization of monoclonal antibodies against unique glycoproteins in the plasma membrane of resistant tumor cells. We have developed monoclonal antibodies against adriamycin-resistant human myelogenous leukemia K562.

A number of chemicals have already been isolated and tested for potential carcinogenesis in animals, and we report on the following aspects of chemical carcinogenesis. A series of new mutagenic heterocyclic amines have been isolated from pyrolysates of amino acids and proteins, and from cooked foods such as the charred parts of broiled fish and meat. Among these heterocyclic amines, nine compounds have been studied in long-term animal experiments, all of which were shown to cause carcinomas in mice. Some chemicals were also proved to be carcinogenic in rats. Because of their eating habits, people may simultaneously ingest mutagens and carcinogens, both of which have been found in certain cooked foods. Nitrosatable precursors of mutagens and tumor promoters have also been discovered in food--a finding of great importance in this particular context. Thus, it would appear that people are ingesting carcinogens, precursors of mutagens, tumor promoters, and tumor inhibitors, simultaneously. Commonly encountered human pathological conditions, such as viral and bacterial infections, non-infections inflammatory diseases, nutritional disorders, hormonal or homeostatic disturbances, gall and/or kidney stones, and benign proliferative disorders may be shown to be precursors for the development of future cancers. In most cases, however, the scientific evidence to support this theory has not been completely evaluated, but the existence of such pathological conditions should be taken into consideration whenever the development of a cancer is being studied. The division which at one time existed between basic cancer research and the clinical investigation of the disease has begun to disappear. The importance of clinical investigation and its use in the prevention of disease has been demonstrated, for example, in studies of adult human T-cell leukemia.","['Takayama, S']",['Takayama S'],['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

It is, however, highly oncogenic in rats and mice, in whom it induces thymic lymphomas. These lymphomas are clonal tumors and appear four to six months following virus inoculation. Although provirus integration is random in virus infected non-tumor cells, it shows regional specificity in these tumors, thus suggesting that insertional mutagenesis may play an important role in tumor induction and progression. Our studies have revealed four common DNA regions for provirus insertion in these tumors (Mlvi-1, Mlvi-2, Mlvi-3 and c-Myc), while studies from other laboratories have revealed two additional ones (pvt-1/mis-1 and pim-1). Mlvi-1, Mlvi-2 and Mlvi-3 represent three independent logi since there is no homology between them molecular clones that identify them and they map on different rat chromosomes. It is interesting however that two of them (Mlvi-1 and Mlvi-2), as well as pvt-1/mis-1, map to mouse chromosome 15 which is known to become trisomic in murine thymic lymphomas. In addition to the specificity of provirus integration, tumor induction is also associated with amplification of the proviral DNA. This amplification may be favored during oncogenesis because cells that carry insertion mutations in multiple oncogenes may exhibit growth advantage over cells in which only single insertion mutations have occurred. This could happen because the effect of these mutations may be additive or because there is a synergistic relationship between multiple loci during oncogenesis. This was indeed suggested by the appearance of concerted provirus insertions in Mlvi-1 and Mlvi-2. Alternatively, the amplification of the provirus during tumor induction may be selected because it provides for elevated levels of viral gene products that participate in the process of oncogenesis. Such products may be coded by sequences in the gag/pol region. We indeed present evidence here for a 2 kb tumor specific gag/pol transcript which is expressed in these thymomas. Our analysis of Mlvi-1 and Mlvi-2 has revealed the following. Mlvi-1 contains at least one open reading frame which is conserved among species and which preliminary evidence indicates may be expressed in the thymomas. Additionally Mlvi-1 appears to be present in more than one copy per haploid genome in both rats and humans. In Mlvi-2 we have shown the presence of a transcribed region downstream from the cluster of the integrated proviruses in the MoMuLV induced thymic lymphomas. However this transcript is expressed mostly in rat embryo fibroblasts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Tsichlis, P N']",['Tsichlis PN'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Lymphoma/*etiology/genetics/pathology', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Rats', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*etiology/genetics/pathology']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1987 Mar-Apr;7(2):171-80.,"['CA-06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-38047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-05539/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing numbers of AIDS patients will be seeking medical attention from physicians in all areas of the country and it will be important for health care professions to develop programs which counter unreasonable stigma and prejudicial attitudes that may be associated with this illness.","['Kelly, J A', 'St Lawrence, J S', 'Smith, S Jr', 'Hood, H V', 'Cook, D J']","['Kelly JA', 'St Lawrence JS', 'Smith S Jr', 'Hood HV', 'Cook DJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Public Health,American journal of public health,1254074,,IM,"['*Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Female', 'Homosexuality', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Leukemia', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Physician-Patient Relations', '*Prejudice', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",1987/07/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2105/ajph.77.7.789 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Public Health. 1987 Jul;77(7):789-91. doi: 10.2105/ajph.77.7.789.,,,PMC1647216,,['KIE: 23646'],,,,,['KIE'],"['Columbus', 'Empirical Approach', 'Health Care and Public Health', 'Memphis', 'Phoenix']","['KIE: KIE BoB Subject Heading: AIDS/health personnel', 'KIE: Full author name: Kelly, Jeffrey A', 'KIE: Full author name: St Lawrence, Janet S', 'KIE: Full author name: Smith, Steve', 'KIE: Full author name: Hood, Harold V', 'KIE: Full author name: Cook, Donna J']"

Recent reports have suggested a neuroregulatory role for calcitonin. We examined the hypotheses that in children (1) CSF levels of calcium and phosphorus might be low, (2) CSF levels of magnesium might be higher than serum levels of magnesium, and (3) immunoreactive calcitonin might be present in the CSF. We examined serum and CSF samples of 45 children, aged 8 days to 16 years, undergoing spinal taps for suspected meningitis or as part of leukemia therapy. Both serum and CSF levels of calcium correlated with those of magnesium. There was no correlation for CSF levels vs serum levels of calcium, magnesium, or phosphorus. The CSF levels of calcium and phosphorus were lower than the serum levels of these elements, but the CSF levels of magnesium were higher than the serum levels of magnesium. Calcitonin was detected in the CSF of 8% of samples assayed (range, 14 to 175 ng/L [14 to 175 pg/mL]). Two of these five samples had bacteriologically proven meningitis, and two samples were from patients less than 2 months of age. The CSF levels of calcitonin did not correlate with the serum levels of calcitonin. Thus, in children CSF levels of calcium and phosphorus are low, CSF levels of magnesium are higher than the serum levels, and the level of immunoreactive calcitonin is usually not present in the CSF but possibly is elevated in meningitis and early infancy.","['Venkataraman, P S', 'Kirk, M R', 'Tsang, R C', 'Chen, I W']","['Venkataraman PS', 'Kirk MR', 'Tsang RC', 'Chen IW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Dis Child,American journal of diseases of children (1960),0370471,"['27YLU75U4W (Phosphorus)', '9007-12-9 (Calcitonin)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Calcitonin/blood/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Calcium/blood/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/blood/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Magnesium/blood/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Phosphorus/blood/*cerebrospinal fluid']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1001/archpedi.1987.04460070053022 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Dis Child. 1987 Jul;141(7):751-3. doi: 10.1001/archpedi.1987.04460070053022.,"['HD 11725/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'RR 0123/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,['Am J Dis Child 1987 Dec;141(12):1299'],,,,,,,,

Sixty-four patients were treated with radiation, 36 with radiation and chemotherapy, and 25 with chemotherapy alone as an initial treatment. Twenty of 52 (38%) with stage I or II who received initially radiation alone relapsed, and 70% (14 of 20) of them were salvaged with chemotherapy.

Forty percent (8 of 20) of these patients failed within or at the margin of the radiation portal, and 60% failed predominantly outside of the radiation field. Even though we did not treat the whole lung prophylactically, there was only one true peripheral lung recurrence. Nine of 20 (45%) recurred in more than one site. Of 36 patients treated with combined radiation and chemotherapy, 21 patients had stage I, II, or IIIA disease. Of these, two patients relapsed.

Their relapse-free survival at 96 months is 79% for large masses and 95% for small masses (p = 0.18). The site of relapse is discussed in detail in the text.

The results of the 2-year carcinogenesis bioassay used by the National Toxicology Program (NTP), in which test compounds were administered to rodents by corn oil gavage, provide an opportunity to compare the effects of fat on chemically induced and naturally occurring tumors. Oil gavage increases the fat intake about threefold, equivalent to a 15% fat diet. Only 2 oil gavage effects were observed in the NTP carcinogenesis bioassay. First, pancreatic hyperplasia was increased from 2.6% in untreated controls to 12.6% in male Fischer 344/N vehicle control rats; however, this sporadic and weak effect did not influence the outcome of carcinogenesis bioassays. Second, leukemia/lymphoma incidence was about 50% lower in male vehicle controls than in the untreated control rats; in contrast, this strong effect increased survival by 8-10%. Therefore, oil gavage had an apparent protective effect in male Fischer 344/N rats. The absence of growth enhancement for the relatively high background level of tumors in oil gavage-treated rats was remarkable and is inconsistent with observations in rat mammary tumor model studies. Because it is impossible to extrapolate the enhancing effect of a high fat diet on tumor growth from rodent tumor models to the NTP carcinogenesis bioassay, great caution should be used in extrapolating from rodent tumor model studies to the human situation.","['Appleton, B S', 'Landers, R E']","['Appleton BS', 'Landers RE']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Dietary Fats)', '0 (Oils)']",IM,"['Adenoma/etiology/pathology', 'Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Body Weight', '*Carcinogens', 'Dietary Fats/*toxicity', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*pathology', 'Oils/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Rats']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4613-1835-4_10 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1986;206:99-104. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4613-1835-4_10.,,,,,,,,,,,,
