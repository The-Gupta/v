To elucidate the molecular basis of TL expression, we have identified the molecular species that react with TL antiserum. At least three species can be resolved by metabolic radiolabeling of thymocytes and ASL1 leukemia cells, lysis, immune precipitation, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide. After a brief incubation with [35S]methionine, the only radioactive molecule recognized by TL antiserum is a homogeneous species with an apparent Mr of 45,000 daltons. This molecule, 45K TL, includes high-mannose-type carbohydrate attached to a 45,000 dalton glycosidase-resistant backbone. In this form, 45K, it is never exposed on the cell surface. If pulse-labeled cells are further incubated with nonradioactive methionine before lysis, however, radioactivity disappears from the 45K TL species and appears in the slower migrating species 46K and 48K TL. Thus, 46K and 48K appear to represent products generated from the 45K TL precursor by posttranslational modification. These TL forms are displayed on the cell surface; they lack high-mannose carbohydrate but evidently include acidic complex-type carbohydrate. Normal thymocytes from Qa:Tla-negative mice lack not only the surface forms of TL but also the intracellular 45K TL form. Peripheral lymphoid cells of Qa:Tla-positive mice synthesize none of these TL species. But the TL antiserum, which contains Qa antibody, recognizes a distinct gene product in spleen and thymus of Qa-Tla-positive mice. In its pulse-labeled form, this molecule, which may represent Qa-1, has an apparent Mr of 44,000 daltons, and consists of a glycosidase-resistant polypeptide core of only 35,000 daltons linked to more high mannose carbohydrate than 45K TL.","['Rothenberg, E', 'Boyse, E A']","['Rothenberg E', 'Boyse EA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology']",1979/10/01 00:00,1979/10/01 00:01,['1979/10/01 00:00'],"['1979/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.150.4.777 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1979 Oct 1;150(4):777-91. doi: 10.1084/jem.150.4.777.,PMC2185687,,,,,,,

These results confirm previous reports showing the inability of HC to produce CSF and suggest that inhibition of CFU-C proliferation, as measured by this technique, is not an important mechanism in the neutropenia observed in HCL.","['Richman, C M', 'Golomb, H M']","['Richman CM', 'Golomb HM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Culture Media)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Culture Media', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/*physiology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/etiology']",1979/09/01 00:00,1979/09/01 00:01,['1979/09/01 00:00'],"['1979/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1979 Sep;7(8):411-5.,,,,,,,,

Fifteen lymph node biopsies from a group of 82 specimens studied for the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) fulfilled morphological criteria for this diagnosis. These criteria required a diffuse infiltrate of relatively uniform, immature lymphoid cells with basophilic cytoplasm; round, oval or lobulated nuclei with evenly dispersed chromatin; rare or inconspicuous nucleoli; and numerous mitotic figures. Examination of 1-micron thick, plastic-embedded, Giemsa-stained tissue sections revealed convoluted nuclei in more than 50% of neoplastic cells in four cases: in six specimens there was an admixture of cells with grooved, hyperlobulated, and round nuclei, and in five the round or oval nuclei were non-convoluted. Specimens from all 15 patients were positive for TdT by fluorescent antibody and biochemical assays. The percentage of cells from involved nodes reacting by indirect immunofluorescence with an antiserum against bovine TdT ranged from 4 to 90% (mean of 52%), and the mean level of biochemically measured enzyme activity was 8.7 units/g of tissue (range of 1.9 to 27.5). Cytochemical stains for acid phosphatase were positive in 13 of the 15 cases. In eight samples more than 50% of cells formed rosettes with sheep erythrocytes, while the E rosettes varied from 14 to 38% in the other seven. The percentage of cells with complement receptors varied widely (range of 6 to 80), but cells bearing surface immunoglobulin or IgGfc receptors were not increased. All patients presented with supradiaphragmatic lymphaedenopathy, eight with an anterior mediastinal mass. Two-thirds of the patients were male, and the mean age was 20 years (range 4 to 46 years). None were leukemic at the time of diagnosis, but eight patients subsequently developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Involvement of the central nervous system was observed in four of the 15, and of the testes in two. Ten patients have died of their disease with a median survival of 8 months (range 4 to 20), and five are alive 3--8 months after diagnosis. We observed no differences in clinical findings at presentation, incidence of mediastinal involvement or leukemic dissemination, content of TdT, acid phosphatase staining, or immunologic cell surface characteristics between the convoluted and non-convoluted types of lymphoblastic lymphoma. Distinctive morphologic, cell surface, biochemical, and clinical features of lymphoblastic lymphoma can be identified irrespective of the presence or absence of convoluted nuclei.","['Long, J C', 'McCaffrey, R P', 'Aisenberg, A C', 'Marks, S M', 'Kung, P C']","['Long JC', 'McCaffrey RP', 'Aisenberg AC', 'Marks SM', 'Kung PC']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Nucleus/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*metabolism', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Immunologic', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1979/12/01 00:00,1979/12/01 00:01,['1979/12/01 00:00'],"['1979/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(197912)44:6<2127::aid-cncr2820440625>3.0.co;2-g [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1979 Dec;44(6):2127-39. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(197912)44:6<2127::aid-cncr2820440625>3.0.co;2-g.,,,,,,,,

Nonneoplastic tissues (peripheral blood, lymph nodes, spleens, tonsils, thymus, and pleural fluid) and specimens from various lymphoproliferative disorders, including acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphosarcoma cell leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of B-and T-cell types, and Hodgkin's disease, were evaluated. T (E-rosetting) cells demonstrated several patterns of NAE reactivity: 1) a strong globular reaction product, the most specific pattern for T-cell identification, 2) granular cytoplasmic staining, or 3) no reactivity. B lymphocytes revealed a granular pattern of NAE staining, were devoid of enzyme, or, in rare instances, exhibited strong NAE activity. Percentages of lymphoid cells with strong (globular) NAE activity closely paralleled T-cell (E-rosette) values in the majority of cases, with the best correlations observed for peripheral blood studies. However, discordant results were noted for some neoplastic and nonneoplastic tissues, including cases of T-cell lymphoma or leukemia. Markedly discrepant results were noted for thymic lymphocytes, most of which revealed E-rosette formation and weak or absent NAE activity. Lymph nodes involved by Hodgkin's disease demonstrated a heterogeneous pattern of staining in E-rosetting cells and in Reed-Sternberg variants. Cryostat section studies of reactive lymph nodes and nodular lymphomas demonstrated strong NAE staining in lymphoid cells of T-cell (interfollicular, internodular) areas, with little or no positivity in follicles or nodules (B-cell areas). NAE staining patterns further suggested that T cells comprise part of the follicular cuff and possibly represent a minor population of some neoplastic nodules. Although NAE determinations do not represent a consistently reliable alternative to immunologic methods for T-cell identification, this easily applicable cytochemical marker is complementary to other techniques in assessing neoplastic or nonneoplastic tissues, particularly cryostat sections.

A factor analysis of these data on the basis of responses of CLL cells from twenty-one patients and from the use of five different ligands in three different concentrations has shown that as few as two factors can account for as much as 63% of the total variance of these responses. On the assumption that these two factors were T-cell dependency of CLL responses and stage of maturity of the responding CLL cell, we have formulated a theory that explains the basis for this functional marker system for CLL cells.

The extent of binding varied widely according to the system and the cell type employed. Two systems bound preferentially to a high proportion of B lymphocytes from peripheral blood or tonsils, one of which bound with only a very few T cells. In contrast, four other test systems which bound well with the Fc receptors on T lymphocytes gave weaker reactions with Fc receptors on B cells. The reactivity of Fc receptors on null or third population lymphocytes was similar to that of the Fc-positive T cells. Pronase digestion experiments showed a graded selective loss of reactivity with the different Fc reagents. No one system was optimal for all of the lymphocyte populations, although aggregated IgG exhibited the broadest spectrum of reactivity. A pronounced effect of temperature was evident on the binding reactions, and native IgG showed strong binding at 4 degrees C, particularly to the Fc receptors on T cells.","['Winchester, R J', 'Hoffman, T', 'Ferrarini, M', 'Ross, G D', 'Kunkel, H G']","['Winchester RJ', 'Hoffman T', 'Ferrarini M', 'Ross GD', 'Kunkel HG']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Pronase)']",IM,"['Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology', 'Methods', 'Palatine Tonsil/immunology', 'Pronase', 'Receptors, Fc/*analysis', 'Rosette Formation', 'Temperature']",1979/07/01 00:00,1979/07/01 00:01,['1979/07/01 00:00'],"['1979/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1979 Jul;37(1):126-33.,PMC1537655,,,,,,,

Further studies of this bond show that the lymphocyte receptor is not immunoglobulin, although the binding of antisera or staphylococci to surface immunoglobulin inhibits the formation of mouse rosettes. Rosette formation could not be induced in thymocytes by enzymatic modification of the surface, or in T cells by lectin-induced transformation. The capacity to bind mouse erythrocytes was lost after incubation in a serum-free medium of lymphcytes from most patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and normal subjects. This loss could be prevented by the addition of a variety of sera and glycoprotein-containing substances to the medium, including fetuin. Conditions conductive to the subsequent restoration of rosetting capacity could not be found, indicating that the loss of this capacity was not due to the shedding of a cell-surface receptor which could be re-synthesized. It is suggested that the functional receptors in B1 lymphocytes are held in aggregates by cross-linking peripheral glycoprotein molecules; disaggregation and consequent loss of the capacity to form rosettes with mouse erythrocytes occurs during incubation in serum-free media, and during maturation of lymphocytes to the B2 stage.","['Zalewski, P D', 'Forbes, I J']","['Zalewski PD', 'Forbes IJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Culture Media', 'Erythrocytes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Mice/immunology', 'Models, Biological', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/drug effects/*immunology', 'Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1979/06/01 00:00,1979/06/01 00:01,['1979/06/01 00:00'],"['1979/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1979 Jun;36(3):536-46.,PMC1537748,,,,,,,

The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 13 years. Nineteen leukaemias were found, essentially granulocytic, with a latent period of 5.7 +/- 2, 8 years after the beginning of treatment. This incidence of almost 1% of leukaemias is probably less than the actual percentage since a number of patients were lost on follow up and since the period of observation is as yet too short. The majority of patients has been treated for more than one year. No cases were seen amongst patients treated for less than six months, or with less than 1g of chlorambucil or 50 g of cyclophosphamide. The risk would seem to be the same for both alkylating agents. No patients treated with azathioprine developed leukaemia, but few patients received this drug. Amongst 35 patients treated for severe psoriatic arthropathy with chlorambucil, 4 developed leukaemia. This particularly high percentage is such that all trials of alkylating agent in this condition should be stopped. The prevalence of leukaemia seen in the series as a whole is comparable to that found in mass studies carried out in various malignant diseases treated by cytotoxics. Awareness of this risk should, lead to even stricter limitations before the use of cytotoxic drugs in rheumatological conditions.","['Kahn, M F', 'Arlet, J', 'Bloch-Michel, H', 'Caroit, M', 'Chaouat, Y', 'Renier, J C']","['Kahn MF', 'Arlet J', 'Bloch-Michel H', 'Caroit M', 'Chaouat Y', 'Renier JC']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Nouv Presse Med,La Nouvelle presse medicale,0312552,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rheumatic Diseases/*drug therapy']",1979/04/14 00:00,1979/04/14 00:01,['1979/04/14 00:00'],"['1979/04/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/04/14 00:01 [medline]', '1979/04/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nouv Presse Med. 1979 Apr 14;8(17):1393-7.,,Leucemies aigues apres traitement par agents cytotoxiques en rhumatologie. 19 observations chez 2006 patients.,,,,,,

The effects of the suppressor cells were exerted on a proliferation-independent function of the lymphocytes, since MIF production, as well as its suppression, occurred even after proliferation of the lymphocytes was blocked by mitomycin-C.

These methods detect increasingly severe metabolic damage; inhibition of deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA, the reversibility of inhibition of deoxyuridine incorporation by supplementation with formyltetrahydrofolate as Ca2+ leucovorin, and the ability of cells to form clones in soft agarose. The critical dose and exposure time for establishing and maintaining the metabolic toxicity of methotrexate is examined in detail. It is shown that, if an initial loading dose of methotrexate is of high enough concentration or is maintained for a sufficient period to achieve greater than 98% inhibition of deoxyuridine incorporation, this inhibition can be sustained by low concentrations of 2,4-diamino-5-(3',4'-dichlorophenyl)-6-methylpyrimidine or methotrexate. Concentrations of methotrexate or 2,4-diamino-5-(3',4'-dichlorophenyl)-6-methylpyrimidine that equal or exceed 0.1 microM are sufficient for maintenance of inhibition by an initial loading dose of methotrexate but escape from inhibition that occurs if lower levels of drug are used.

The deficiency in ADCC was partly explained by reduction in the number of circulating effector cells (Fc receptor-bearing cells) demonstrable at a time when white blood cell and platelet counts were normal. These cytotoxic functions, as well as the circulating numbers of T-cells and Fc receptor-bearing cells were further decreased by the administration of monthly cycles of combination chemotherapy with 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine and 6-thioguanine. Following each cycle of chemotherapy, progressive recovery of these functions occurs during the third and fourth weeks with occasional increases above base line in patients in whom chemotherapy is withheld for longer than five weeks. In selected patients recovery of one cytotoxic function preceded the other, indicating that these functions are mediated by different effector cells. Administration of a single dose of daunomycin i.v. had no effect in either of these cytotoxic functions or in the circulating numbers of lymphocytes. The decrease in ADCC effector cell function induced by phase cycle-specific agents correlated with the level of reactivity exhibited by patients after achieving bone marrow and clinical remission. Patients showing low levels of reactivity postremission experienced highest degree of depression. In two patients, complete abrogation of ADCC effector function was demonstrated with minimal recovery even six weeks after stopping chemotherapy. These findings indicate that effector cells in ADCC and mitogen-induced cellular cytotoxicity are highly susceptible to phase cycle-specific agents, and their recovery takes longer that of other lymphoid and nonlymphoid populations.","['Zighelboim, J']",['Zighelboim J'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Phytohemagglutinins', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1979/09/01 00:00,1979/09/01 00:01,['1979/09/01 00:00'],"['1979/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1979 Sep;39(9):3357-62.,,,,,,,,

The markers used included E, Fc gamma, Fc micron (IgM) and C3d rosetting, estimation of SIg and CyIg, and tests for the expression of HTLA, Ia and ALL. Repeat biopsy specimens were studied in 23 of these patients. The phenotypic features of lymphoblastic malignancy indicated B-cell, T-cell and ALL-positive null-cell tumours in this group. Immunoblastic lymphomas were predominantly of non-capping B-cell type, but T-cell immunoblastic lymphoma occurred in 2 patients. Immunoblastic lymphomas of receptor-silent cells occur, and are ALL- and HTLA-negative. In the category of diffuse, poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphomas, most cases are of centroblastic and centrocytic tumour of diffuse type, but pure centrocytic tumours and centroblastic tumours occur. The dominant phenotype in this group is of B cells expressing C3d receptors. Nodular poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphomas (Rappaport) are classified as centroblastic and centrocytic follicular (Kiel) and most express SIg+ C3d+ phenotype. The frequency of this phenotype appeared the same in both diffuse and nodular poorly differentiated lymphocytic neoplasms. The Rappaport group of diffuse well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma includes 2 Kiel categories, malignant lymphoma lymphocytic, and malignant lymphoma lymphoplasmacytoid. Cells of the former tumour were considered to be immature B cells resembling those seen in CLL, and characteristically expressing SIg weakly, with a high frequency of single kappa light chain. Cells of the latter tumour are by contrast mature, and are related to the centroblastic and centrocytic follicular tumour by their histogenesis and phenotypic features. Repeat biopsy examinations indicate that T-cell predominance occurs in the prodromal phase of B-cell-predominant tumours of SIg+ C3d+ phenotype. It is concluded that non-Hodgkin lymphoma can be divided into 2 categories: (1) tumours of immature immunologically incompetent cells of lymphoblastic histology and with phenotypic features akin to T, B and Null-cell ALL, and (2) tumours of differentiated lymphocytes expressing the phenotypic features of B lymphocytes, with maturation arrested at one of several stages of an antigen-dependent immune response.","['Habeshaw, J A', 'Catley, P F', 'Stansfeld, A G', 'Brearley, R L']","['Habeshaw JA', 'Catley PF', 'Stansfeld AG', 'Brearley RL']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*analysis', 'Receptors, Immunologic', 'Rosette Formation', 'Spleen/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1979/07/01 00:00,1979/07/01 00:01,['1979/07/01 00:00'],"['1979/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1979.137 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1979 Jul;40(1):11-34. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1979.137.,PMC2009956,,,,,,,

It was observed that the reduced count concerned all 4 subclasses of lymphocytes B, that is those with surface receptors for IgA, IgM, IgG and IgE immunoglobulins.

WBC obtained after Isopaque-dextran separation were cultured in vitro by a double-layer agar technique. Before treatment 19 patients out of 32 had CSA and all had CFC; both CSA and CFC were found in 19 patients. In follow-up studies during treatment, CSA was mainly unaffected during the leukopenic phase, while CFC were suppressed. No CFC were found at WBC counts below 1,000/mm3. This seems to imply that CFC are more sensitive to chemotherapy than colony-stimulating cells. 14 patients entered remission; all of them had CSA. 16 out of the 18 nonresponders lacked on or both types of cells. The presence of CSA and CFC in peripheral blood therefore appears to be a sign of favorable prognosis, while the absence of CSA and/or CFC implies lack of response to treatment. The conclusion from this study is that the presence of both CFC and CSA in peripheral WBC is a sign of a good prognosis. Absence of CFC and/or CSA in the initial sample indicates that the patient is unlikely to respond to conventional therapy with cytotoxic drugs. The presence or absence of CSA alone has a higher prognostic significance than the presence or absence of CFC.","['Alsabti, E A', 'Saleh, K']","['Alsabti EA', 'Saleh K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Colony-Stimulating Factors', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Prognosis']",1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000225336 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncology. 1979;36(4):180-3. doi: 10.1159/000225336.,,,,,,,,

No relationship existed between quantities of HThy-L and an expression of different surface immunoglobulin isotypes in B-cell lines. Low quantities of HThy-L were detected in leukemia myeloid and myeloma cell lines as well as in B-cell leukemia lines originating from patients with B-cells acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Apparently, the increased quantities of HThy-L in T-cell leukemia lines may be related to certain stages of T-cell differentiation at which leukemia cell transformation occurs.","['Chechik, B E', 'Minowada, J']","['Chechik BE', 'Minowada J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1979/09/01 00:00,1979/09/01 00:01,['1979/09/01 00:00'],"['1979/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/63.3.609 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1979 Sep;63(3):609-14. doi: 10.1093/jnci/63.3.609.,,,,,,,,

The tumor cells bore surface Ig that included both mu- and delta-chains associated with the lambda light chain. Alloantigens coded for within the murine MHC, including H-2D, H-2K, and I-region products, were identified on the tumor cells. Although normal B lymphocytes are thought to express products coded for within both the I-A and I-E subregions, the BCL1 expressed only normal amounts of I-E subregion products. In addition, the H-2 and Ia antigens revealed by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis exhibited an abnormal pattern of post-translational modifications. The Fc, but not the complement-receptor, was present on the surface of tumor cells. The presence of IgD, Ia antigens, and the responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide (see subsequent paper) have led us to postulate that the BCL1 tumor represents a later differentiative stage than murine B lymphocyte tumors previously described.","['Knapp, M R', 'Jones, P P', 'Black, S J', 'Vitetta, E S', 'Slavin, S', 'Strober, S']","['Knapp MR', 'Jones PP', 'Black SJ', 'Vitetta ES', 'Slavin S', 'Strober S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin D)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin D/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology', 'Time Factors']",1979/09/01 00:00,1979/09/01 00:01,['1979/09/01 00:00'],"['1979/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1979 Sep;123(3):992-9.,,,,,,,,

Most poor stimulator blasts had, however, normal MLC-activating properties if, instead of whole blood, isolated lymphocytes were used as the responding cells. The poor activation of lymphocytes by some leukemic blasts in whole blood appeared to be associated with impaired release of blastogenic factor(s) during the MLBC.

HC of all patients bore Fc-receptors with a high binding affinity for aggregated IgG. Using 125 I-labelled F(ab')2-fragments of monospecific antibodies in autoradiography, only one light chain type was detected on HC of individual patients. In four patients mu- and delta-chains were simultaneously expressed on HC, whereas in two patients only gamma-chains and in one case only mu-chains were observed on HC. One patient showed a combination of gamma- and delta-chains on his HC. A great variation in density of surface immunoglobulings of HC was observed within individual patients. After removal by capping, surface immunoglobulin reappeared on HC during cell culture, but more slowly than on normal B-lymphocytes. As shown in two patients by internal labelling, HC secreted immunoglobulin light chains, but no heavy chains.

However, extracts of slowly sedimenting cells, separated by velocity sedimentation from the marrows of eight patients in remission whose whole marrow had produced no LIA, produced inhibitory material in all cases. Extracts of the more rapidly sedimenting cells from these marrows contained an inactivator of LIA.

Approximately 20% of T cells are TH+2, whereas 80% are TH-2 utilizing specific heteroantisera. To determine shether human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells belong to one or another T-cell subset, cell surface phenotyping was performed on tumor populations from 25 patients with T-ALL. Tmuor cells from these 25 individuals were either TH+1 or TH-2, but not both. 5 of 25 patients had TH+2 T-ALL cells. These TH+2 tumor populations were found exclusively in children and often without an accompanying thymic mass. TH-2 T-ALL, in contrast, occurred in both children and adults and was almost always associated with thymic enlargement. Although children with TH+2 T-ALL had as high or higher peripheral blast counts on presentation than their TH-2 T-ALL counterparts, overall survival was greater for the TH+2 group (greater than 36 mo) than the TH-2 group (less than 12 mo).

This antiserum was shown by complement-mediated cytotoxicity assay, membrane immunofluorescent staining, and by quantitative absorption analysis to react preferentially with certain B-lymphoblastoid cell lines, with a minor population of peripheral blood B lymphocytes, and a major population of tonsillar B lymphocytes. Certain B-cell leukemias also expressed the antigen, whereas others did not. Considerable variability was observed among positive B cells in the intensity of fluorescent staining even among the leukemic cells from a single individual. Although T cells, including T cells, were negative by direct immunofluorescent and cytotoxicity assay, evidence for low levels of the antigen on the cells of T cell lines was obtained. The whole specific antiserum and its F(ab')2 fragments stimulated B lymphocytes to proliferate. This proliferation did not produce differentiation to plasma cells and was T-cell independent.

Spleen cells cultured from normal mice do not acquire such cytolytic activity. Cytolytic activity resides in the T lymphocyte population. Alloantiserum, but not antisera against FLV-virion polypeptides, inhibited the lysis of FLC-745 cells by cytolytic T lymphocytes. To understand further the role of cellular and humoral immune anti-FLV responses in mice with dormant FLV-infections, in vitro experiments were conducted that mimicked the in vivo FLV-specific immune environment of these mice. We found that FLV-immune serum from mice with dormant FLV-infections modulated FLV-antigen expression on the surfaces of FLC-745 cells without affecting their susceptibility to lysis by cytolytic T lymphocytes. These results suggest that cytolytic T lymphocyte restrain the outgrowth of FLV-antigen-modulated erythroleukemic cells in mice with dormant FLV infections and that the targets for cell-mediated lysis may be H-2d-associated antigens.","['Genovesi, E V', 'Marx, P A', 'Wheelock, E F']","['Genovesi EV', 'Marx PA', 'Wheelock EF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', '*Antigens, Viral', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1979/03/01 00:00,1979/03/01 00:01,['1979/03/01 00:00'],"['1979/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1979 Mar;122(3):795-800.,,,,,,,,

The first population consists of the precursors of blast cells and has specificity for AML; the second population consists of T-lymphocyte precursors, also found in normal blood. The two progenitor populations can be separated by exploiting the capacity of T-lymphocyte (but not blasts) progenitors to form rosettes with sheep erythrocytes (E rosettes). After E-rosette formation, T-lymphocyte precursors can be removed by centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque. Such separation has a number of consequences: (1) Blast progenitors can be detected where unseparated mononuclear preparations have yielded either no colonies or only T-lymphocyte colonies (20 of 21 patients). (2) The stimulator requirements of the blast progenitors change, indicating that cell-cell interactions may take place between blast and T-lymphocyte progenitors. (3) It is feasible to characterize blast and T-lymphocyte precursors independently, even though they may coexist in peripheral blood.

The muFcR was rapidly shed and resynthesized when washed Bm cells were maintained in medium not containing FCS and the general importance of this phenomenon in any study of muFcR is considered. It is suggested that Bm cells are memory cells and that the muFcR plays a part in the immune response.","['Burns, G F', 'Cawley, J C', 'Barker, C R']","['Burns GF', 'Cawley JC', 'Barker CR']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/immunology/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'Rosette Formation']",1979/03/01 00:00,1979/03/01 00:01,['1979/03/01 00:00'],"['1979/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1979 Mar;36(3):569-77.,PMC1457558,,,,,,,

Further characterization of the lymphocyte subpopulation involved.,367-72,"We have previously shown that lymphocyte emperipolesis, the phenomenon whereby lymphocytes wander freely within the cytoplasm of larger host cells, is almost totally dependent on host cell pre-sensitization with IgG type antibody. In addition, the particular lymphocyte subpopulation involved was partially characterized as an Fc receptor bearing, non-T cell. In this study we have attempted to further define the emperipoletic lymphocyte subpopulation using cell fractionation procedures and correlation analysis. Significant correlation was found between emperipolesis and both Fc receptor bearing, surface immunoglobulin negative (Fc + SIg-) cells and antibody dependent lymphocyte mediated cytotoxicity; observations which suggest that the so-called K cells are the emperipoletic effector cells. The significance of these findings in relation to antibody dependent cytolysis is discussed.","['Reid, F M', 'Sandilands, G P', 'Gray, K G', 'Anderson, J R']","['Reid FM', 'Sandilands GP', 'Gray KG', 'Anderson JR']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Separation', 'Cytoplasm/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/physiopathology', 'Monocytes/immunology/physiology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis']",1979/02/01 00:00,1979/02/01 00:01,['1979/02/01 00:00'],"['1979/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1979 Feb;36(2):367-72.,PMC1457454,,,,,,,

Isoenzymatic study of leukocytic acid phosphatase showed a noticeable increase of band 3 and the absence of supernumerary band 3b. Immunological analysis revealed a significant decrease of the surface immunoglobulins and a rise in absolute terms in the number of lymphocytes forming spontaneous rosettes. In the case of the prolymphocytic variety what was particularly noticeable was the great number of lymphocytes bearing complement receptors.

Indirect sensitization of RADA1 leukemia cells with H-2 antisera followed by antiserum against mouse IgG also failed to induce H-2 antigen modulation. Normal peritoneal cells from certain mouse strains were partially modulated with H-2D-specific or H-2K-specific and monospecific antisera within several hours, but normal thymus and lymph node cells did not modulate. Modulation of peritoneal cells occurred without a complete loss of sensitizing H-2 antibody from the cell surface and required a cobra venom factor-sensitive activity that could be restored by human complement component C3.

The major subpopulation of thymocytes that is PNA-positive was separated from the PNA-negative cells by differential agglutination with the lectin. The two thymocyte subpopulations were tested in the mixed lymphocyte reaction and with the phytohemagglutinin of Phaseolus vulgaris. The poor response of the PNA-positive thymocytes to these stimuli indicates that these thymocytes are functionally immature. The fluorescein isothiocyanate-PNA-binding test with peripheral blood lymphocytes of leukemic patients revealed that in most acute leukemias the PNA receptor is exposed on the blastic cells, whereas in most cases of chronic leukemia the peripheral blood lymphocytes are PNA-negative.

We have investigated the effect of theophylline on E-rosette formation using cells from normal individuals, and patients with immunodeficiency or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and have attempted to correlate the influence of the drug on distinct T-lymphocyte subpopulations. Three subpopulations of E-rosetting T-lymphocytes can be delineated: theophylline-sensitive T-cells which lose the capacity to form E-rosettes following treatment; theophylline-resistant T-cells which are unaffected by the drug; and theophylline-dependent cells which acquire the ability to form E-rosettes following incubation with theophylline. The action of theophylline was shown to be dose-dependent, temperature-dependent and reversible. Reversibility or re-expression of the receptor for sheep red cells could be blocked by the addition of puromycin. In peripheral blood, E-rosetting T-lymphocytes were roughly divided into two equal populations, one sensitive, the other resistant. Thymocytes were shown to be entirely theophylline-resistant, whereas a small population of cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow were induced to become E-rosetting in the presence of theophylline. Induction by theophylline may be effective at a distinct stage of precursor T-cell differentiation.","['Limatibul, S', 'Shore, A', 'Dosch, H M', 'Gelfand, E W']","['Limatibul S', 'Shore A', 'Dosch HM', 'Gelfand EW']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['4A6ZS6Q2CL (Puromycin)', 'C137DTR5RG (Theophylline)']",IM,"['Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Growth', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Puromycin/pharmacology', '*Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Temperature', 'Theophylline/*pharmacology']",1978/09/01 00:00,1978/09/01 00:01,['1978/09/01 00:00'],"['1978/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1978 Sep;33(3):503-13.,PMC1537427,,,,,,,

These two cases are the only examples of B cell ALL studied with chromosome banding reported to date.

Ia antigens were also found on T blasts grown in long-term cultures with conditioned medium generated by phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes. In addition, leukemia blasts which stained for Ia antigens and formed E rosettes were identified in the peripheral blood of two leukemic patients. This evidence further supports the existence of Ia-bearing T cells in man. The Ia+ T-lymphocyte population was shown to contain cells responsible for the generation of allogeneic helper activity.

Relationship to cytoplasmic myosin.,409-18,"A detailed kinetic analysis of the distribution of cytoplasmic myosin during the capping of various lymphocytic surface molecules revealed two distinct capping mechanisms. (a) Some cell surface molecules, including immunoglobulin, Fc receptor, and thymus leukemia antigen, all cap spontaneously in a small fraction of lymphocytes during locomotion. Cytoplasmic myosin becomes concentrated in the cytoplasm underlying these spontaneous caps. Exposure to specific antibodies causes all three of these surface molecules to cap rapidly with a concomitant redistribution of cytoplasmic myosin to the area of the cap. These antibodies also stimulate cell locomotion. (b) Other lymphocyte surface molecules, including H2 and Thy.1, do not cap spontaneously. Moreover, exposure to antibodies to these molecules causes them to cap slowly without a redistribution of cytoplasmic myosin or stimulation of cell locomotion. Exposure to concanavalin A gives a response intermediate between these two extremes. We believe that the first type of capping is active and may involve a direct link between the surface molecules and the cytoplasmic contractile apparatus. The second type of capping appears to result simply from aggregation of cross-linked molecules in the plane of the membrane.","['Braun, J', 'Fujiwara, K', 'Pollard, T D', 'Unanue, E R']","['Braun J', 'Fujiwara K', 'Pollard TD', 'Unanue ER']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Concanavalin A)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Movement', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments', 'Immunoglobulins', '*Immunologic Capping', 'Lymphocytes/analysis', 'Mice', 'Myosins/analysis/*physiology', 'Receptors, Concanavalin A', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1978/11/01 00:00,1978/11/01 00:01,['1978/11/01 00:00'],"['1978/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.79.2.409 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1978 Nov;79(2 Pt 1):409-18. doi: 10.1083/jcb.79.2.409.,PMC2110255,,,,,,,

The patient was first followed without treatment; after 18 months multiple myeloma developed. At that time, immunofluorescence study of lymphocytes of the peripheral blood showed mainly membrane-bound immunoglobulins (S-Ig) of the IgGkappa class. The bone marrow disclosed a definite predominance of plasma cells with cytoplasmic IgGlambda, suggesting that the two B cell-derived diseases had arisen from two different cell clones. During the development of multiple myeloma, the serum concentration of the M component IgGlambda increased. Concurrently, the M component of IgGkappa gradually disappeared from the serum, and the concentrations of the normal immunoglobulins IgA and IgM declined. Following cytostatic treatment, the concentration of the myeloma-derived M component IgGlambda was halved and simultaneously the M component IgGkappa reappeared in the serum. To our knowledge, this case is the second reported of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and multiple myeloma indicating development of the two diseases from different cell clones, and the first reported cases with myeloma-induced suppression of M-component secretion from malignant cells.","['Pedersen-Bjergaard, J', 'Petersen, H D', 'Thomsen, M', 'Wiik, A', 'Wolff-Jensen, J']","['Pedersen-Bjergaard J', 'Petersen HD', 'Thomsen M', 'Wiik A', 'Wolff-Jensen J']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,"['0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Myeloma Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Clone Cells', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Electrophoresis, Paper', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/analysis', '*Immunoglobulin Fragments/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*complications/immunology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications/immunology', '*Myeloma Proteins/analysis', '*Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis']",1978/09/01 00:00,1978/09/01 00:01,['1978/09/01 00:00'],"['1978/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1978 Sep;21(3):256-64.,,,,,,,,

E, EA rosettes and surface Ig assayed significantly lower in leukemic children than in matched controls, except for three cases of T-cell leukemia in which E rosettes were very high. After cessation of therapy almost normal results were obtained. As for serum Ig, the only abnormal finding was that of low IgM during therapy. The skin tests with Varidase, Candidine, Mumps antigen and DNCB were not significantly different at onset and in remission. As for DNCB test, the negative responses at onset often became positive in remission, but only when the test was performed before any treatment (anamnestic-like response?). One of the three patients with T-cell leukemia relapsed after 8 months: strangely enough, no surface marker could be detected on that occasion. We could not find any relationship between various immunological tests, or between these tests and prognosis; chemotherapy proved active in suppressing cellular immunity, especially the primary cellular response.","['Bardare, M', 'Pietrogrande, M C', 'Corona, F', 'Varin, E', 'Carnelli, V', 'Masera, G']","['Bardare M', 'Pietrogrande MC', 'Corona F', 'Varin E', 'Carnelli V', 'Masera G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Helv Paediatr Acta,Helvetica paediatrica acta,0373005,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity, Delayed/immunology', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Mercaptopurine/therapeutic use', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",1978/08/01 00:00,1978/08/01 00:01,['1978/08/01 00:00'],"['1978/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Helv Paediatr Acta. 1978 Aug;33(3):241-50.,,,,,,,,

A critical analysis of the results showed that as regards the purely diagnostic aspect the significance of histochemistry was severely limited to practically no more than tumours of the granulocytic series (myeloperoxidase and chloracetylesterase activities). Proof of alpha--mannosidase activity appeared to be greatly promising in the group of histiocytosis X. In the rest of the series, particularly in the lymphatic and thrombocytic series, the diagnostic significance of histochemistry proved to be either limited or non-existent. Considering the present state of methods used, the main advantage of histochemistry is in that it helps add details to the metabolic profile of the tumour under study.

For normal lymphocytes differences in the distribution patterns were observed between: (1) B and T cells, (2) central and peripheral cells, and (3) resting and activated cells. The findings suggested that cell density is determined by cell lineage the degree of differentiation and the stage of functional activation. Marked differences in the density distribution profiles were also observed among certain types of morphologically distinguishable lymphoproliferations. To some extent density analyses enabled the discrimination between CLL, follicular lymphomas and lymphoblastic lymphomas as well as between O-ALL and T-ALL. Density profiles of malignant lymphocytes failed to disclose any features specific for malignancies. But they revealed some similarities with distinct subsets of normal lymphocytes, i.e. between: (1) CLL and bone marrow lymphoid cells, (2) follicular lymphomas and follicular centre cells, and (3) lymphoblastic lymphomas and activated lymphocytes. These findings are further evidence supporting the hypothesis that the malignant transformation of phenotypically different lymphoproliferations takes place at different levels of lymphocyte differentiation.","['Huber, C', 'Zier, K', 'Michlmayr, G', 'Rodt, H', 'Nilsson, K', 'Theml, H', 'Lutz, D', 'Braunsteiner, H']","['Huber C', 'Zier K', 'Michlmayr G', 'Rodt H', 'Nilsson K', 'Theml H', 'Lutz D', 'Braunsteiner H']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Cell Separation', '*Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', '*Lymphocytes', '*Lymphoma', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1978/09/01 00:00,1978/09/01 00:01,['1978/09/01 00:00'],"['1978/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1978.tb03642.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1978 Sep;40(1):93-103. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1978.tb03642.x.,,,,,,,,

Normal tissues such as skin had both B and A glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase isoenzymes, but the leukemic myelogenous cells displayed only one isoenzyme type, consistent with their clonal origin. A population of cells with undoubted thymus-derived (T)-lymphocyte characteristics had both isoenzymes. Presumably, then, these T cells did not arise from the leukemic stem cell, either because they antedated the development of leukemia in that stem cell or, more likely, because they arose from progenitors not involved by the disease. In contrast, another population of lymphocytes showed only one isoenzyme type, suggesting that it arose from the chronic myelocytic leukemia stem cell. However, although this population contained many cells with the characteristics of bone marrow-derived (B) lymphocytes, it is not certain that the single enzyme produced by the cells over all can be attributed to B lymphocytes rather than to contaminating non-B-lymphoid cells.","['Fialkow, P J', 'Denman, A M', 'Jacobson, R J', 'Lowenthal, M N']","['Fialkow PJ', 'Denman AM', 'Jacobson RJ', 'Lowenthal MN']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,['EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antibody Formation', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/enzymology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1978/10/01 00:00,1978/10/01 00:01,['1978/10/01 00:00'],"['1978/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI109193 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1978 Oct;62(4):815-23. doi: 10.1172/JCI109193.,PMC371833,,,,,,,

As the presence of the various esterases did not demonstrate any specific distribution pattern among he haematopoietic cell lines of different origin, we concluded that the ANAE marker is no longer T-specific when malignant lymphoid cells are considered, and that the usefulness of this marker in routine diagnostic work therefore is limited.","['Sundstrom, C', 'Nilsson, K', 'Ranki, A', 'Hayry, P']","['Sundstrom C', 'Nilsson K', 'Ranki A', 'Hayry P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,"['EC 3.1.- (Naphthol AS D Esterase)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*enzymology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*enzymology', 'Naphthol AS D Esterase/blood/*metabolism', 'Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology']",1978/07/01 00:00,1978/07/01 00:01,['1978/07/01 00:00'],"['1978/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1978.tb02494.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1978 Jul;21(1):47-59. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1978.tb02494.x.,,,,,,,,

As after induction by MGI in vitro, MGI(+)D(+) clones were induced for Fc and C3 rosettes, lysozyme, and mature macrophages and granulocytes in normal syngeneic or allogeneic mice. MGI(+)D(-) clones were also induced in these mice for all these properties, although in vitro they were not induced by MGI for mature cells. The MGI(-)D(-) clones were induced in vivo for C3 and Fc rosettes, lysozyme, and intermediate stages but not for mature cells, whereas none of these properties were induced in these clones by MGI in vitro. Thus, certain types of myeloid leukemic cells differentiate better in vivo, possibly due to the presence of higher effective concentrations of MGI and/or other inducing factors, and MGI(+)D(+) and MGI(+)D(-) cells can completely differentiate in vivo to mature cells. In vivo differentiation was inhibited in mice treated with cyclophosphamide. It was also inhibited in various strains of nude mice, except for one MGI(+)D(+) clone, where it was inhibited in C57BL/6 but not in ICR nude mice. This MGI(+)D(+) clone was also the only clone that was induced to differentiate normally in vitro by a 23,000 molecular weight form of purified MGI. The results suggest that different clones respond to different molecular forms of MGI, which may be present in different proportions in some animals, that in vivo differentiation by MGI possibly with other factors may be regulated by cells involved in the immune response, and that this differentiation can be genetically controlled. Differentiation in vivo was enhanced by injection of conditioned medium containing MGI and by inoculation of MGI-producing cells, including normal granulocytes. This indicates that the induction of normal differentiation of myeloid leukemic cells in vivo can be enhanced by these treatments.","['Lotem, J', 'Sachs, L']","['Lotem J', 'Sachs L']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/metabolism', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced/pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Mice, Nude', 'Muramidase/metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Species Specificity']",1978/08/01 00:00,1978/08/01 00:01,['1978/08/01 00:00'],"['1978/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.75.8.3781 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1978 Aug;75(8):3781-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.75.8.3781.,PMC392870,,,,,,,

The following numbers of patients had leukemia cells that reacted with the ALL antisera: 13 of 18 with ALL, 3 of 27 with acute myelocytic leukemia, 1 of 8 with chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), and 0 of 12 with CLL. The positive CML was a patient in CML blast crisis. Normal peripheral blood B- and T-lymphocytes and normal bone marrow were negative. Reactions of the anti-ALL serum (136K) were compared with the reactions of a rabbit anti-B-cell antiserum (63K) that reacted with approximately 70% of leukemia cells. Cultured lymphoblastoid cell lines from normal donors were negative by both cytotoxicity and immunofluorescence tests. However, by immunofluorescence testing, 8 of 17 known malignant lines from a variety of lymphoproliferative disorders were positive; 4 of these lines were of T-cell origin. By immunoprecipitation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the ALL antigen appeared to consist of a single polypeptide chain of approximately 98,000 daltons.

The isolated material showed a single 125I-band (m.w. approximately 58,000) on gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate and was used to immunize a rabbit. The resulting anti-serum was reacted with lysates of surface iodinated mouse or rat tumor mast cells. Analysis of the precipitates on (10%) gel electrophoresis revealed one major peak comprising greater than 80% of the detectable counts and having an estimated m.w. of approximately 58,000. The antiserum reacted with detergent-solubilized and cell-bound receptors in the presence or absence of excess IgE; it also inhibited the binding of 125I-IgE. Cultured mouse mastocytoma cells never exposed to IgE released 3H-serotonin when incubated with F(ab')2, but not Fab' fragments of the antiserum, which had been rigorously freed of IgE and anti-IgE. The release was inhibited in the presence of excess IgE, was Ca++ dependent, and equaled 80% of the maximum obtained with IgE and anti-IgE.

Measurement of the synthesis of nuclear ribosomal RNA, nonpolyadenylic acid heterogeneous RNA, and polyadenylic acid heterogeneous RNA revealed potentiation by 2'-deoxycoformycin of the inhibitory effect of cordycepin on all species of RNA, as well as on polyadenylic acid synthesis. No differences were noted in the size of nuclear polyadenylic acid obtained from cells treated with cordycepin in either the presence or the absence of the adenosine deaminase inhibitor. These results suggest that the potentiation by 2'-deoxycoformycin of the cytotoxic and antitumor effects of cordycepin on L1210 cells in vivo is related to inhibition of nuclear RNA synthesis.","['Glazer, R I', 'Lott, T J', 'Peale, A L']","['Glazer RI', 'Lott TJ', 'Peale AL']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleosides)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)']",IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Azepines/*pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Deoxyadenosines/*pharmacology', 'Deoxyribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Poly A/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Ribosomal/biosynthesis']",1978/08/01 00:00,1978/08/01 00:01,['1978/08/01 00:00'],"['1978/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1978 Aug;38(8):2233-8.,,,,,,,,

The plasma clot culture system was used as a measure in vitro of erythropoiesis. The patient's peripheral blood and marrow T lymphocytes obtained both before and after transfusion therapy suppressed erythroid colony formation by normal human bone marrow cells. Pretreatment of the patient's bone marrow T cells by antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and complement reversed this suppression. In addition, pretreatment of the patient's marrow cells with ATG and complement markedly augmented erythropoiesis in vitro. The expression of erythroid activity caused by the selective destruction of the suppressor T lymphocytes in the patient's bone marrow with ATG and the suppression of normal erythropoiesis by the patient's bone marrow and peripheral blood lymphocytes suggest that interaction between the malignant T cell and the erythropoietin-responsive stem cell is important in production of anemia in this patient.","['Hoffman, R', 'Kopel, S', 'Hsu, S D', 'Dainiak, N', 'Zanjani, E D']","['Hoffman R', 'Kopel S', 'Hsu SD', 'Dainiak N', 'Zanjani ED']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Humans', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Male', 'Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1978/07/01 00:00,1978/07/01 00:01,['1978/07/01 00:00'],"['1978/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68318-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1978 Jul;52(1):255-60.,,,,,,,,

We found a monoclonal B cell proliferation in most cases in the latter group, in spite of the paucity of clinical and laboratory findings. Furthermore, early CLL can readily be distinguished from benign lymphocytosis by surface marker criteria. In untreated CLL, surface marker characteristics are stable with time and predominantly reflect expansion of clones expressing only B cell markers; however, small increase of blood T cells are often seen.

Pyrogen was released spontaneously into the culture medium during growth by all cell lines with macrophage or myeloid characteristics including lysozyme production; R-8 cells, of presumed B-lymphocyte origin, did not produce pyrogen. When injected into mice, the pyrogens gave fever curves typical of endogenous pyrogen, were inactived by heating to 56 degrees C and by pronase digestion, and appeared to be secreted continuously by viable cells. Two pyrogenic molecular species produced by H-774 cells were identified by Sephadex filtration, one of mol wt approximately equal to 30,000, and the other greater than or equal to 60,000. By contrast, three carcinoma cell lines of human origin and SV-40 3T3 mouse fibroblasts did not produce pyrogen in vitro. These results suggest that some malignant cells derived from phagocytic cells of bone marrow origin retain their capacity for pyrogen production, and may spontaneously secrete pyrogen during growth.","['Bodel, P']",['Bodel P'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,['0 (Pyrogens)'],IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/metabolism', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Histiocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Pyrogens/*biosynthesis']",1978/05/01 00:00,1978/05/01 00:01,['1978/05/01 00:00'],"['1978/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Exp Med. 1978 May 1;147(5):1503-l6.,PMC2184265,,,,,,,

Most (11 of 13) of the Thy 1+ and/or TL+ tumors, i.e., T-cell tumors, expressed high levels of either Ly 1 or Ly 2 antigen, but not both. Thus most thymic lymphocytic tumors expressed restricted Ly phenotypes comparable to phenotypes previously described for functional peripheral T cells. Because tumor phenotypes were stable over a number of transplant generations, they therefore appeared to be an intrinsic property of the specific tumors. The majority of the BALB/c lymphomas were Ly 1- 2+ and also positive with anti-TL antiserum. This predominant phenotype on the BALB/c tumors may be related to either the mode of tumor induction or to the mouse strain, but since the restricted Ly pattern was observed both in BALB/c and AKR tumors, the phenotypic restriction itself is not a consequence of either of these factors. Tumor induction by ENU per se is not responsible for Ly or TL ,ntigen expression since several non-T-cell BALB/ c tumors, also induced by ENU, did not express either Ly or TL antigens. Data presented here suggest that the target cell for leukemogenesis may be a partially differentiated thymus cell. The restricted expression of Ly antigens on differentiating thymus cells to either the (formula: see text), phenotype may occur before the loss of TL antigen.","['Mathieson, B J', 'Campbell, P S', 'Potter, M', 'Asofsky, R']","['Mathieson BJ', 'Campbell PS', 'Potter M', 'Asofsky R']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'P8M1T4190R (Ethylnitrosourea)']",IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'Ethylnitrosourea', 'Isoantigens/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymoma/immunology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/immunology']",1978/04/01 00:00,1978/04/01 00:01,['1978/04/01 00:00'],"['1978/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.147.4.1267 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1978 Apr 1;147(4):1267-79. doi: 10.1084/jem.147.4.1267.,PMC2184247,,,,,,,

The experience at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center is reported. Presenting signs and symptoms are consistent with prior reports. The chemotherapy results in the past have been poor; because of the poor results, chemotherapy is started only if one of the following criteria are present: (1) frequent transfusion requirements; (2) rapidly increasing peripheral white blood cell count or percentage of leukemic blast forms; (3) frequent recurrent infectious and/or hemorrhagic complications. A hitherto unrecognized association of erythroleukemia and symptomatic rheumatic disease and numerous immunologic abberations are reported.

We describe here other hematopoietic tumor cell lines in which CSA is either produced constitutively or inducible by immunostimulators. CSA production in macrophage and monocyte tumor lines is induced by lipopolysaccharide, zymosan, Mycobacterium strain Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, tuberculin purified protein-derivative preparation from mycobacteria, and dextran sulfate. Myeloma, mastocytoma, and T-lymphoma lines do not produce CSA with or without these agents. In contrast, the T-lymphocyte mitogen concanavalin A (but not phytohemagglutinin) induces CSA synthesis in one of seven T-lymphomas tested. In most cases induction of CSA is correlated with conditions of cell growth inhibition by the immunomodulators. However, other drugs that cause cytostasis or cytotoxicity do not lead to CSA production.

Since lymphoblasts in most childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias lack slg and other conventional B-lymphocyte and T-lymphocyte markers, we examined the possibility that some leukemias represent ""pre-B""-cell neoplasms. In four of 22 consecutive patients, leukemic cells had the clgM+.slg- phenotype of pre-B cells.

Age, sex, initial peripheral leukocyte count (WBC), lymph node enlargement or the presence of hepato- or splenomegaly bore no statistically significant relationship to the patient's lymphoblast type, and only a WBC in excess of 10(5)/microliter correlated with a poor prognosis.

This depression occurs early in the disease, before the onset of splenomegaly, and is associated with a decline in the susceptibility of splenocytes from FLV-infected mice to lysis by anti-Thy-1. 2 serum and complement. Treatment of splenocytes from FLV-infected mice with neuraminidase restores, in large part, their susceptibility to anti-Thy-1.2 serum as well as their cytolytic capacity. These studies suggest that one early immunosuppressive consequence of infection with FLV involves alteration of the effector T-lymphocyte cell surface.","['Mascio, A A', 'Ceglowski, W S']","['Mascio AA', 'Ceglowski WS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antilymphocyte Serum', 'Complement System Proteins', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neuraminidase/*therapeutic use', 'Spleen/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1978/02/01 00:00,1978/02/01 00:01,['1978/02/01 00:00'],"['1978/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/iai.19.2.486-492.1978 [doi]'],ppublish,Infect Immun. 1978 Feb;19(2):486-92. doi: 10.1128/iai.19.2.486-492.1978.,PMC414110,,,,,,,

These included antisera against ALL antigen, p23,30 (Ia-like structure) and other T cell, B cell and myeloid markers 'Lymphoid' blast crisis shares the phenotype of common ALL (of non-T, non-B variety). Both leukemias react with anti-ALL serum and have pre-myeloid, pre-B lymphoid and pre-thymocyte characteristics. Their phenotype may reflect the characteristics of the pluripotential stem cell from which they derive. Nevertheless both leukaemias retain their undifferentiated characteristics and lack overt myeloid, B cell and thymocyte differentiation markers. Myeloid blast crisis and AML are negative with anti-ALL serum but some of the poorly differentiated myeloblasts react with anti-p23,30 serum (and negative for SmIg). The anti-p23,30 serum (used in a double marker assay combined with anti-immunoglobulin) detects some (4-11%) intermediate sized agranular p23,30+/SmIg-cells in peripheral blood during the chronic phase of CML as well as in normal foetal bone marrow. These could be myeloid stem cells (from which in CML the myeloid blast crisis arises).

The appearance of leukaemia in a certain number of persons is due to reduced immunity in the patient or weak antigen immunogenicity of leukaemic cells. Authors also present evidence for the existance of tumor antigens same as in leukaemic leukocytes in human pathology. These antigens belong either to still undiscovered viruses of human leukaemia, as is the case of reverse transcriptase of RNK virus, found in leukocytes of 95 percent of patients with acute leukaemia, or they are new antigens formed by combination of cell genoma and virus genoma, or by depression of the gene which were active only during the foetal life under the influence of oncogenic chemical substances or viruses. The evidence is given too, concerning the existence of immune response in human medicine, in the form of cytotoxic antibodies or sensitized T lymphocytes to tumor antigens which can be demonstrated in vitro by the test of colonial growth inhibition of tumor cells. As the immunity does not operate against tumor or leukaemic cells, the reason for it must be sought in the disorder of the afferent part (weak immunogenicity of tumor antigens, tolerance of tumor antigens, etc.), or of the efferent part of the immune response (the presence of blocking factors in the patient's plasma). At the end, the authors also discuss about the attempts of immunological treatment of acute leukaemia, and the results to this date are encouraging.","['Stefanovic, S', 'Banicevic, B', 'Jancic, M S', 'Vucic, L', 'Vidakovic, A']","['Stefanovic S', 'Banicevic B', 'Jancic MS', 'Vucic L', 'Vidakovic A']",['hrv'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Serbia,Bilt Hematol Transfuz,Bilten za hematologiju i transfuziju,7601504,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/etiology/*immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bilt Hematol Transfuz. 1977;5(2):3-14.,,"Imunitet u leukemijama: povod za nastanak leukemija, cinilac u uspesnom lecenju leukemija.",,,,,,

The leukemic cells did not have the membrane receptors or immunoglobulin markers of B lymphocytes or monocytes nor did they synthesize immunoglobulin. A lymphoid cell line established in vitro from the cells had the same T-lymphocyte characteristics. The lymphoid cell line is positive for tartrateresistant acid phosphatase, forms rosettes with untreated sheep erythrocytes, and reacts with an anti-T-lymphocyte antiserum. Thus the syndrome of hairy-cell leukemia may occasionally result from the neoplastic proliferation of T-lymphocytes as well as from the more usual B-lymphocyte form.

The aggregated and B-IgG and H-IgG bound to the bovine PBL, but aggregated H-IgG was found to be more sensitive for the detection of Fc receptors. The specificity of aggregated H-IgG binding to the Fc receptors was established by demonstrating that antigen-antibody complexes inhibited this binding, and unaggregated H-IgG did not bind significantly to PBL. Double-labeling experiments suggested that all Fc+ cells have surface immunoglobulins (SIg), a marker for B lymphocytes. The percentage of Fc+ and SIg+ cells in normal animals was 9.5% (range 4-15%) and 16.2% (range 4.5-30.2%), respectively.

Furthermore, illness developed in nine of the ten patients between 30 and 100 days after initiation of therapy, suggesting a period of heightened susceptibility to infection. An indirect immunofluorescent test was used to detect antipneumocystis antibodies in serum samples collected from patients with pneumocystis pneumonia and their contacts.

The cytolytic activities of the two lymphocyte populations described two distinct biphasic kinetic profiles that were similar in amplitude and duration but separated from each other by 4-6 days. In progressing neoplasm, there was a rapidly occuring accumulation of T lymphocytes highly cytolytic for MSC cells. This response, however, was not sustained and disappeared in association with the onset of unchecked tumor growth. In contrast, T lymphocyte cytolytic activity developed more slowly in regressing sarcomas and attained peak levels coincident with the beginning of tumor regression. Similar changes in cytolytic activity characterized T lymphocytes in lymph nodes draining tumors. When cultured in vitro for 4 days, non-cytotoxic T lymphocytes from regional lymph nodes draining progressing sarcomas regained very high levels of cytolytic activity. Such restitution was diminished, however, if MSC cell lysates, macrophages or macrophages fed MSC cell lysates were present during the culture period. These experiments provided presumptive evidence that T lymphocyte-mediated cytolytic activity was lost in progressively growing Moloney sarcomas as a consequence of suppression in vivo of the genesis and/or functional expression of cytolytic T lymphocytes, perhaps by macrophages and/or soluble tumor antigen.","['Gillespie, G Y', 'Russell, S W']","['Gillespie GY', 'Russell SW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1978/01/15 00:00,1978/01/15 00:01,['1978/01/15 00:00'],"['1978/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1978/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910210116 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1978 Jan 15;21(1):94-99. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910210116.,,,,,,,,

Lymphocytes from spleen, thymus and lymph node pools were tested for responsiveness to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin A (Con A). Results showed a significant decrease in PHA-induced blastogenesis of all lymphocytes tested at the time of maximal tumor volume, with a return to normal responsiveness as the tumor regressed. In contrast, a differential dose dependent Con A response occurred in spleen and thymus lymphocytes. A decreased 3H-thymidine uptake occurred at optimal Con A dose, correlating with the PHA decrease. However, at a lower Con A dose an increased response was observed, beginning shortly before the PHA depression and continuing until regression of tumor began. This phenomena was not observed in lymph node lymphocytes. Based upon these observations, we suggest that the cell or cells responsible for the transient suppression of PHA responsiveness may be Con A responsive T lymphocytes.","['Marshall, G D Jr', 'Thurman, G B', 'Foster, B G', 'Goldstein, A']","['Marshall GD Jr', 'Thurman GB', 'Foster BG', 'Goldstein A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Immunol Commun,Immunological communications,0353016,['11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1977/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08820137709093470 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Commun. 1977;6(6):603-15. doi: 10.3109/08820137709093470.,,,,,,,,

Employing the double layer in vitro bone marrow culture technique, leukemic marrows from these children failed to produce colonies in culture in the presence or absence of normal feeder layers. Varying the concentration of leukemic cells in the feeder layers failed to augment colony growth from normal bone marrows.

Clinical features were correlated with phenotypic features of blast cells, including surface markers and cytomorphology. Four groups with distinct clinical and pathologic features emerged from the study: a) The acute leukemias of the ""null"" or ""undifferentiated"" group were those in which the malignant cells carried distinctive null leukemia surface antigen and lacked features of either T cells (E-rosette positivity) or B cells (surface immunoglobulin positivity). These cases occurred most frequently in the series (56% of total cases), peaked in incidence at 6 years, were associated with extensive bone marrow involvement, lacked distinguishing cytomorphologic features, and had the best response to therapy of all groups. b) The acute myelogenous leukemias, including those with myeloid, monocytoid, or erythroid features or a combination of the above, had extensive bone marrow involvement and the characteristic morphology. This group was seen with intermediate frequency and showed an intermediate response to therapy. c) Leukemia-lymphomas of the T-cell group were frequently associated with mediastinal masses and other masses, a cytomorphology which was different from the B-cell group but similar to the null group, and high white cell counts. These cases occurred with intermediate frequency (14%) and had a worse prognosis than the null group. d) Leukemia-lymphomas of the B-cell group had monoclonal surface immunoglobulin with mu-heavy and either kappa or lambda light chain. These patients were least frequent in the series, frequently presented with abdominal masses, and had a characteristic Burkitt cell morphology. Prognosis was the worst of all patients in our series. These data suggest that the major phenotypic groups of childhood leukemia and lymphoma have differing prognoses and should receive differing forms of therapy.

The CTL and their precursor cells were systemically distributed in peripheral lymph nodes and spleen, although they had the tendency of homing to the lymphoid tissue of the same origin. Direct cytotoxicity was obtained with the lymphocytes from these lymphoid tissues, and cells obtained from these lymphoid tissues could produce secondary cytotoxic responses by the mixed lymphocyte tumor cell culture reactions 40--60 days after adoptive transfer. In addition, lymph node and spleen cells had a synergistic effect on the induction of cytotoxicity. These findings indicated that tumor immunity was widely distributed and that various populations of lymphocytes were involved in the generation of efficient cell-mediated cytotoxic responses.","['Ting, C C']",['Ting CC'],['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/pharmacology', 'Ascitic Fluid/cytology', 'Cell Movement', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/physiology', 'Time Factors']",1978/02/01 00:00,1978/02/01 00:01,['1978/02/01 00:00'],"['1978/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/60.2.437 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1978 Feb;60(2):437-44. doi: 10.1093/jnci/60.2.437.,,,,,,,,

These clones were studied for their ability to bind epidermal growth factor (EGF), susceptibility to transformation by mouse sarcoma virus (MSV), and alteration in EGF binding upon sarcoma virus transformation. The epithelioid clones bound much more EGF than the fibroblastic clones; Scatchard plots on two of these clones, one epithelioid and one fibroblastic, showed that the higher EGF binding (1.3 x 10(5) molecules per cell for the epithelioid clone and 1.3 x 10(4) molecules per cell for the fibroblastic clone) was due to a greater number or receptors on the epithelioid cells rather than to a difference in the apparent affinity constant. When the clones were transformed by Moloney murine sarcoma virus the EGF binding decreased, the effect being greater with the fibroblastic clones. In 20 out of 20 independently isolated sarcoma virus transformed fibroblastic clones, the level of EGF binding was either greatly reduced or completely eliminated. In contrast to EGF, another growth factor, multiplication stimulating activity (MSA), bound to a greater extent to the fibroblastic clones than the epithelioid clones, and its binding was not decreased by sarcoma virus transformation. The results show that loss of EGF binding ability correlates with expression of the murine sarcoma virus transformation.","['de Larco, J E', 'Todaro, G J']","['de Larco JE', 'Todaro GJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Peptides)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', '*Clone Cells/metabolism', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mice', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Submandibular Gland/analysis']",1978/03/01 00:00,1978/03/01 00:01,['1978/03/01 00:00'],"['1978/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1040940311 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1978 Mar;94(3):335-42. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1040940311.,,,,,,,,

Schedules with very delayed ""low-dose"" leucovorin rescue following lethal doses of methotrexate were highly effective in preventing toxicity and achieved a pronounced antitumor effect in both ascites tumor models. Best results were obtained on a schedule of methotrexate (400 mg/kg s.c.) followed 16 to 20 hr later by calcium leucovorin (12 mg/kg s.c.) given once every 2 hr for a total of 5 doses. Progressive increases in the calcium leucovorin dosage on any schedule reduced both toxicity and the antitumor effect of methotrexate in each model. Following a single course of therapy, essentially no toxicity was observed, and the antitumor effects were 2-fold (L1210 leukemia) and 4-fold (Sarcoma 180) greater than a single, maximally tolerated dose (24/kg s.c.) methotrexate alone. An increase in the methotrexate dosage to 800 mg/kg s.c. with or without an increase in calcium leucovorin dosages on the same schedule did not appreciably increase the antitumor effect observed. Two courses of high-dose methotrexate (400 mg/kg s.c.) with leucovorin rescue (24 mg/kg s.c. 16, 20, and 24 hr after drug) given with an 8-day interval between courses doubled the total antitumor effect in each model with no substantial increase in toxicity and gave long-term survivors with Sarcoma 180.

K+ transport in five subjects with CLL (10 mmol.1 cell water-1.h-1) was half that in normal blood T-lymphocytes (20 mmol.1 cell water-1 h-1). Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) treatment of CLL lymphocytes did not increase significantly their active K+ transport, whereas K+ transport by normal T-lymphocytes increased by 100%. Since there were 73% T-lymphocytes in normal blood and 14% in CLL blood, the difference in membrane K+ turnover could be related either to neoplasia or to the proposed B-lymphocyte origin of CLL. We studied human tonsillar lymphocytes which contained a mean of 34% T-cells. In five studies of tonsils, K+ transport was 14 mmol.1 cell water-1.h-1 and treatment with PHA increased K+ transport only 30%. The intermediate values of basal K+ transport and K+ transport in response to PHA in tonsillar lymphocytes were consistent with the proportion of T-lymphocytes present. These data suggest that B-lymphocytes have reduced membrane permeability and active transport of K+. Thus the marked decrease in CLL lymphocyte membrane K+ permeability and transport may be a reflection of its presumed B-cell origin, rather than a membrane alteration related to malignant transformation.","['Segel, G B', 'Lichtman, M A']","['Segel GB', 'Lichtman MA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,['RWP5GA015D (Potassium)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Palatine Tonsil/*cytology/metabolism', 'Potassium/*metabolism', 'Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",1977/11/01 00:00,1977/11/01 00:01,['1977/11/01 00:00'],"['1977/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1040930213 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1977 Nov;93(2):277-84. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1040930213.,,,,,,,,

Interferon exerted only a transitory and less pronounced effect on [3H]-deoxyadenosine incorporation and had no effect on the content of total DNA per cell. Study of [3H]-thymidine uptake at 1 degree into acid-soluble cellular material showed that interferon reduced the uptake of this labeled nucleoside whereas the uptake of [3H]-deoxyadenosine and [3H]-deoxy-D-glucose was not inhibited. The effect of interferon on [3H]-thymidine uptake occurred prior to the inhibitory action on cell multiplication. It is suggested that the inhibitory of [3H]-thymdine uptake reflected specific changes in the cell membrane of interferon-treated cells which may be relevant to the understanding of the antiviral and other biological effects of interferon.,"['Brouty-Boye, D', 'Tovey, M G']","['Brouty-Boye D', 'Tovey MG']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Intervirology,Intervirology,0364265,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Deoxyadenosines/metabolism', 'Deoxyglucose/metabolism', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Thymidine/*metabolism']",1978/01/01 00:00,1978/01/01 00:01,['1978/01/01 00:00'],"['1978/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000148942 [doi]'],ppublish,Intervirology. 1978;9(4):243-52. doi: 10.1159/000148942.,,,,,,,,

The influence of these cells on either activated or non-activated mouse bone marrow cells was measured, and the results were compared with the action of the two major leucocyte fractions, mononuclear cells and granulocytes. It was demonstrated that acute leukemic blasts were almost completely unable to activate myeloid committed stem cells (Colony Forming Units, CFUC). In contrast, blasts from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in blastic crisis disclosed a variable pattern of activation, in that two out of three cases exerted normal stimulatory capacity. A possible inhibitory action of leukemic cells was the subject of further experiments. Acute leukemic blasts in some cases disclosed inhibitory activity, a few cases appeared to be without influence on normal proliferating CFUC. Granulocytes from patients with CML in the chronic phase showed inhibitory capacity when compared with granulocytes from normal individuals.

After combination chemotherapy over one year, lymphocytes populations with no immunological cell-markers are relatively increased. Regular monitoring of the immunological subgroups of lymphocytes seems to be unhelpful in early diagnosis of periods with increased risk of severe infections.","['Schwenk, H U']",['Schwenk HU'],['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Fortschr Med,Fortschritte der Medizin,2984763R,"['0 (Endotoxins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin D)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Binding Sites', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/etiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane', 'Endotoxins/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin D', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1977/09/08 00:00,1977/09/08 00:01,['1977/09/08 00:00'],"['1977/09/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/09/08 00:01 [medline]', '1977/09/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Fortschr Med. 1977 Sep 8;95(33):2019-20.,,Immunologische Membranmerkmale auf Blasten und Lymphozyten von Patienten mit akuter Leukamie.,,,,,,

CLL cells, unlike normal B cells, showed a marked increase in mouse-complement receptors. No increase in receptors for guinea pig complement was observed in the leukemic cells. The population of SIg-bearing lymphocytes was significantly greater than that of complement-receptor bearing lymphocytes. The total number of E-rosetting cells was increased in all CLL patients.

Before treatment 16 patients out of 30 had CSA and 22 out of 29 had CFC; both CSA and CFC were found in 15 patients. In follow-up studies during treatment, CSA was mainly unaffected during the leukopenic phase, while CFC were suppressed. No CFC were found at WBC counts below 900/mm3. This seems to imply that CFC are more sensitive to cytotoxic agents than colony-stimulating cells. Twelve patients entered remission; all of them had CSA and all the 11 who were investigated for CFC had CFC before treatment. Fourteen out of 18 non-responders lacked one or both types of cells.

Lymphocytes forming rosettes with EAM did not bind sheep red cells, had membrane Ia-like antigens and, in some instances, surface immunoglobulin. The specificity of EAM rosettes was confirmed by inhibition experiments with purified human Ig. IgM but not IgG molecules inhibited the rosette reaction. In addition, inhibition of EAM rosettes with IgM fragments showed that the receptor has affinity for a part of the molecule located in the Fc portion. By analogy with the receptors previously found on certain human T cells, receptors for IgM were not detected on freshly isolated B cells, but were expressed after overnight culture in IgM-free media. Studies on different human lymphoid tissues showed that IgM receptors are expressed on a limited percentage of both circulating and noncirculating B cells. In addition to normal B cells, the malignant B cells of a majority of cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia expressed the receptors for IgM.","['Ferrarini, M', 'Hoffman, T', 'Fu, S M', 'Winchester, R', 'Kunkel, H G']","['Ferrarini M', 'Hoffman T', 'Fu SM', 'Winchester R', 'Kunkel HG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', '*Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Cattle/immunology', 'Cell Separation', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments', 'Immunoglobulin G', '*Immunoglobulin M', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell', 'Sheep/immunology']",1977/10/01 00:00,1977/10/01 00:01,['1977/10/01 00:00'],"['1977/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1977 Oct;119(4):1525-9.,,,,,,,,

Cytolytic activity, expressed in terms of lytic units/10(6) T cells, was similar for intratumoral T cell suspensions obtained 11 days after induction of either regressing (3.1 +/- 1.3 LU/10(6) T cells) or progressing (4.3 +/- 1.8) neoplasms. By 13 days post-induction, regressing tumors contained T lymphocytes with an increased cytolytic activity (11.1 +/- 4.5) whereas those from progressing tumors were strikingly less able to kill MSC cells (less than or equal to 0.2). This dramatic loss in cytotoxicity could not be attributed to errors associated with the enzymatic disaggregation method, inhibition by copurified endogenous tumor cells, or immunosuppression induced by viral infection. The changes in functional activity of intratumoral T lymphocytes from the two types of sarcoma appeared to be correlated with the stage of neoplasia. In this model system, cytolytic activity of T lymphocytes increased during spontaneous tumor regression whereas losses in cytotoxicity occurred coincident with the onset of inexorable progression.","['Gillespie, G Y', 'Hansen, C B', 'Hoskins, R G', 'Russell, S W']","['Gillespie GY', 'Hansen CB', 'Hoskins RG', 'Russell SW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology']",1977/08/01 00:00,1977/08/01 00:01,['1977/08/01 00:00'],"['1977/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1977 Aug;119(2):564-70.,,,,,,,,

Characterization and pathogenic role.,405-10,"In a young woman with ulcerative colitis, hypoimmunoglobulinemia, and humoral immunodeficiency, lymphocyte counts vary between 600 and 1,000 per mm(3) with 0.5-1.5% bone marrow-derived (B) cells and 98-99% thymus-derived (T) cells. Anti-lymphocyte antibodies were detected by immunofluorescence and by microlymphocytotoxicity with increased reactivity at +4 degrees C. They belonged to the IgM class and were polyclonal. Studies performed with various normal lymphocyte subpopulations, several lymphoblastoid cell lines and lymphocytes from immunodeficiency patients showed that these antibodies reacted with B cells. The corresponding antigen(s) is distinct from membrane-bound immunoglobulins, is not an alloantigen, and is probably unrelated to the la-like molecules. Pokeweed mitogen stimulated B cells appear to lose this antigen. Cells from various lymphoproliferative disorders were tested. T-derived and ""non T-non-B"" leukemic cells did not react with the antibody. Malignant cells from B-derived lymphomas and prolymphocytic leukemias were reactive. The incidence of positivity of the leukemic cells among patients with common B chronic lymphocytic leukemia was surprisingly low (one-third of the patients). The autoantibody nature of the anti-B-cell antibodies and their pathogenic role in the genesis of the patient's hypoimmunoglobulinemia was demonstrated by the effect of removal of antibodies by massive plasmaphereses which were followed by a dramatic and transitory increase of B-cell figures. Whereas most primary immunodeficiency syndromes appear to result from an arrest in the differentiation capabilities of immunologically competent cells, autoantibodies to circulating B lymphocytes may be incriminated in the pathogenesis of some cases of hypogammaglobulinemia.","['Tursz, T', ""Preud'homme, J L"", 'Labaume, S', 'Matuchansky, C', 'Seligmann, M']","['Tursz T', ""Preud'homme JL"", 'Labaume S', 'Matuchansky C', 'Seligmann M']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,['0 (Autoantibodies)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Autoantibodies', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Colitis, Ulcerative/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immune Adherence Reaction', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*immunology/physiopathology', 'Palatine Tonsil/physiopathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/physiology']",1977/08/01 00:00,1977/08/01 00:01,['1977/08/01 00:00'],"['1977/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI108789 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1977 Aug;60(2):405-10. doi: 10.1172/JCI108789.,PMC372381,,,,,,,

In syngeneic BN hosts the levels of CIC attained and the time-course of detection were related to the tumor dose, tumor mass, and regressive or progressive course of the tumor. In general, syngeneic rats that received larger tumor doses developed larger tumors and greater maximum levels of CIC. However, the amount of CIC was not always directly proportional to the tumor size, although this was nearly the case with regressor BN and Lewis rats. In rats with regressing tumors, CIC decreased to insignificant levels as the tumors disappeared. Progressor BN rats that received 20 and 10 X 10(6) tumor cells had higher and more sustained levels of CIC, but, shortly before the hosts died, despite an increase of tumor size, there was a decline of CIC. Progressor BN rats that received an initial inoculum of 0.5 X 10(6) tumor cells that grew to 44 mm maximum mean diameter had levels of CIC which were only slightly above levels of control rats.

It was confirmed that the lymphocyte response of patients was depressed. Furthermore, the lymphocytes of 15 out of 27 cancer patients, selected because of their low responses, inhibited the reactivity of normal lymphocytes in co-cultures. The lymphocytes from one patient with Hodgkin's disease were also inhibitory. In contrast, lymphocytes from healthy subjects, patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, lymphosarcoma or multiple myeloma caused no suppression. Experiments with purified cell populations from patients with carcinoma indicated that purified T cells responded to mitogens while unseparated lymphocytes failed to respond and that the inhibitory activity was due to adherent cells, presumably monocytes. There was no evidence for B-cell-mediated suppression. However, in two cases inhibition was caused by isolated T cells of the patients and not by adherent cells. These experiments suggested that one mechanism for the depression of cell-mediated immunity seen in patients with advanced cancer may be the nonspecific suppresssion of certain T-cell functions by circulating monocytes.","['Zembala, M', 'Mytar, B', 'Popiela, T', 'Asherson, G L']","['Zembala M', 'Mytar B', 'Popiela T', 'Asherson GL']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Lectins)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Bronchogenic/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Hodgkin Disease/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immune Adherence Reaction', 'Lectins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1977/05/15 00:00,1977/05/15 00:01,['1977/05/15 00:00'],"['1977/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1977/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910190503 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1977 May 15;19(5):605-13. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910190503.,,,,,,,,

After absorption with leucocytes, erythrocytes and serum proteins from normal individuals, the antisera demonstrated significant complement-dependent cytotoxicity against leukaemic cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (9/11), LSL (7/9) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (9/12), with an antibody titre of 1:64 or greater. The antisera did not react with: (a) blood lymphocytes from clinically healthy individuals (0/23), patients with ono-lymphoproliferative disorders (0/8) and normal umbilical cords (0/3), (b) normal lymphocytes stimulated by pokeweed mitogen (0/7), allogeneic lymphocytes (0/3), fetuin (0/1), purified protein derivative (PPD) (0/2), and candida antigen (0/1); (C) normal marrow cells (0/3), (D) normal thymocytes (0/2) and (E) leukaemic cells from patients with acute myeloblastic (AML) (0/10) and chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL) (0/3). However, the antisera did react with lymphoblastoid cells from continuous B-cell lines derived from an AML patient and from a non-leukaemic individual and, to a lesser extent, with lymphocytes from patients with infectious mononucleosis. The antisera also reacted with lymphocytes from chronically infected tonsils. Cytotoxicity of the antisera against lymphoblastoid and tonsillar cells was inhibited by ALL and CLL cell-lysates; and, conversely, cytotoxicity against ALL cells was inhibited by the lymphoblastoid cell extract. In contrast, a cell lysate or extract from normal inhibited by the lymphoblastoid cell extract. In contrast, a cell lysate or extract from normal lymphocytes did not inhibit cytotoxicity toward lymphoblastoid, tonsillar or ALL cells. Cytotoxicity of the antisera was neutralized by a goat anti-rabbit IgG (GAR IgG).

Hapten-specific T cell activation occurred with TNP-conjugated peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) and purified macrophages but not with TNP-conjugated erythrocytes, thymocytes, or nonadherent lymph node cells or PEC. In addition, T cell activation also occurred with TNP-conjugated guinea pig leukemia cells, but only in the presence of macrophages.

All patients received the same chemotherapy. At diagnosis, the proportion and absolute numbers of T lymphocytes fell into 2 groups, a ""low"" group (medians 8%, 318/mm3) and a ""normal"" group (medians 60%, 1405/mm3). Patients with a low proportion of T cells tended to have a high proportion and absolute number of null cells (correl. coeff. r = 0.94). This group has had high white blood cell counts (median = 29,600/mm3) and a high proportion of blasts (84%). During remission, the proportion of T cells returned toward normal (40-75%) in both groups. Four patients in the low T group relapsed; T cells again fell to low levels and returned to normal in response to new therapy. Three interpretations of these observations are suggested: 1) Active leukemia may cause normal lymphocytes (T cells and to a lesser degree B cells) to lose their surface markers; 2) Acute leukemia may inhibit maturation of normal lymphoid cells, and thus T or B markers are not sufficiently developed to be detectable; and 3) Cells without surface markers (null cells) may be a part of the malignant population, even though they are not morphologic blasts.

As for normal CFU-C, addition of 10% hemolysate or 40% horse serum promoted the growth of comparable numbers of colonies. Rat hemolysate can therefore replace horse serum as a growth promoter of leukemic and normal CFU-C present in culture.

It can be concluded that C-type viruses play an active role in antinuclear antibody induction.","['Varet, B', 'Cannat, A', 'Gisselbrecht, S']","['Varet B', 'Cannat A', 'Gisselbrecht S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Antinuclear)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Antinuclear', 'Antibodies, Viral', 'Female', '*Genes', 'Genotype', 'Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology/microbiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology/genetics/*immunology/microbiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Rauscher Virus/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Spleen/microbiology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics']",1977/04/01 00:00,1977/04/01 00:01,['1977/04/01 00:00'],"['1977/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1977 Apr;37(4):1115-8.,,,,,,,,

Lymphocyte level is an index of cell-mediated immunity which is important in host defense against cancer. But it is surprising that a simple test such as peripheral lymphocyte count could be correlated with clinical stages and survival results in patients with Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-lymphomatous solid tumors. Regarding the latter, lymphocyte count had prognostic values in patients with cancer of the bone, Ewing's sarcoma; breast; colon; kidney, neuroblastoma; uterine cervix, and other sites. In general, higher lymphocyte counts before therapy correlated with longer survival. Using newer immunologic techniques, T and B lymphocytes can be identified and the different subtypes of leukemia, immunodeficiency and lymphoproliferative diseases have been studied intensively. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia represents a proliferation of B cells, while the Sezary syndrome represents that of T lymphocytes. There is a qualitative and quantitative disturbance of Blymphocytes in patients with multiple myeloma. In Hodgkin's disease, there is hyperactivity of the B cells and functional defect of the T cells. Finally, the nodular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma resulted from neoplastic transformation of the B lymphocytes. In several nonmalignant autoimmune conditions, abnormality of T-cell or B-cell counts has been reported. For example, T cells were reported to be decreased in patients with ulcerative or granulomatous colitis and in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, However, it needs to be pointed out that, in 1973, Farid and associates (44) reported a significant increase in T and a proportionate reduction of B rosette in 17 patients with untreated Grave's disease and 16 with Hashimoto's thyroiditis as compared with 24 normal and eight goiter controls. In 1975, six publications later, they (143) had to announce a retraction because further studies by them and by other investigators could not repeat the earlier results. Despite variations and lack of standardization of the test systems, some consistent deviations of T-lymphocyte and B-lymphocyte counts have been reported. T lymphocytes were quantitatively decreased in patients with carcinoma of the brain, breast, head and neck, liver, lung and urologic organs and with malignant melanoma. In general, there is a marked decrease of T cells with increasing stage of disease and a return of T cells to normal level after successful therapy.

Their cytotoxic activity is relatively resistant to gamma-radiation, 50% surviving 1,000 rads and 30% remaining after 5,000 rads, and to heat, since 20 min incubation at 48-51 degrees C is required for its abolition. In these properties the natural killer (NK) cells are very similar to the cytotoxic T cells from tumour-immune rats, and they share in addition a requirement for Ca++ ions for cytolysis. They differ in that they are non-T cells as defined by their resistance to anti-T-cell antiserum and complement, and by their presence in T-cell-deprived rats. They lack detectable surface Ig, Fc receptors and phagocytic or adherence properties and belong therefore to that small proportion of lymphoid cells lacking the surface markers of T or B lymphocytes, as do the comparable NK cells of mice. Cytotoxicity appears to involve an autonomous, papain-sensitive recognition structure on the surface of NK cells, rather than acquired cytophilic antibody operating through an antibody-dependent mechanism.","['Shellam, G R']",['Shellam GR'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 3.4.22.2 (Papain)']",IM,"['*AKR murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cations, Divalent', 'Cell Separation', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Gamma Rays', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/radiation effects', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology', 'Papain/pharmacology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology']",1977/02/15 00:00,1977/02/15 00:01,['1977/02/15 00:00'],"['1977/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1977/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910190212 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1977 Feb 15;19(2):225-35. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910190212.,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the kinetics of appearance of cytolytic cells within the MSV-induced tumor was determined. In agreement with previous studied, it was found that cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific for MSV-associated antigens were present among the cells extracted from the tumor and from the lymphoid organs. However, differences in the kinetics of CTL activity could be documented: lymphoid cells from spleen, RLN and peripheral blood showed peak activity at the time of maximum tumor diameter, while intratumoral cells showed peak activity at the onset of tumor regression. MLN cells showed cytolytic activity only when tumor regression had begun.

Following each dose of HU, DNA synthesis was inhibited completely. Recovery of LI was rapid and approached control values by 6 hr. Following each dose of Ara-C, DNA synthesis was inhibited completely for at least 6 hr. Recovery of LI was first noted 6 hr following 20 mg/kg Ara-C and 9 hr following 200 mg/kg. Following both doses the LI reached 100% of the control value by 26 hr. GC analysis indicated that following Ara-C treatment, DNA synthesis was reinitiated first with cells with low GC from 6 to 12 hr followed by cells with increasing GC from 12 to 20 hr. The labeling intensity reached control values by 20 hr and an 'overshoot' occurred by 26 hr. These data suggest that the recovery of DNA synthesis rate is a gradual process. Survival data for mice receiving two doses of Ara-C indicated that the optimal interval for retreatment following the lower dose of Ara-C occurred by 6 hr as compared to 12--16 hr for the higher dose. These times coincided in both instances with recovery of LI to 33--50% of control values.

Specimens obtained from untreated patients showed marked increases in all compartments the most dramatic of which were for CFU-E and circulating CFU-C. This increased cell flow down the early stages of the red cell pathway in CML suggests that heightened proliferation and differentiation of primitive hemopoietic cells may be a more general phenomenon than previously suspected in this disease. In 5 of 6 patients, abnormal erythroid progenitors capable of proliferation and differentiation into hemoglobinized erythroblasts in cultures containing less than 0.002 units of erythropoietin/ml were regularly detected. In the 6th patient abnormal growth was not seen in cultures of the initial marrow obtained but was detected in cultures set up with peripheral blood taken 7 months later. The unexplained amplification of the erythropoietic compartment and the ability of some of these cells to mature in vitro in the virtual absence of erythropoietin is at variance with the anemia characteristic of untreated patients. This suggests the possibility of a major differentiation block at the level of CFU-E. Further studies of the properties of erythroid progenitors in these patients should help to provide new insights into the pathogenesis of CML and may provide useful markers for monitoring engrafted cell function after autotransplantation of patients in blast crisis.","['Eaves, A C', 'Eaves, C J']","['Eaves AC', 'Eaves CJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1979;7 Suppl 5:65-75.,,,,,,,,

Aggressive cytoreductive treatment followed by autografting appears to be a promising approach to the palliative management of patients with CGL in transformation.","['Goldman, J M']",['Goldman JM'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*therapy', '*Leukocyte Transfusion']",1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1979;7 Suppl 5:389-97.,,,,,,,,

In 210 patients evaluated retrospectively, the incidence of meningeal disease was 33% for patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 20% for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 22% for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas with an unfavorable histology (NHL), 3% for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and 1% for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In most patients, meningeal involvement appeared several months after diagnosis of acute leukemia, often preceding systemic relapse if bone marrow remission had been achieved before. Prophylactic treatment of the CNS was begun in eight patients with ALL or AML after bone marrow remission was achieved. Of these patients, three with ALL and one with AML were free of disease up to 2 years after diagnosis.

The purpose of this study was to determine if leukemic lymphoblasts from untreated ALL patients could inhibit normal granulopoiesis. Several concentrations of leukemic bone marrow cells from nine patients were mixed with either normal bone marrow cells or with autologous (HLA-identical) remission bone marrow cells, incubated for 1 hour, and co-cultured by the double layer agar technique. The cells were also cultured separately as controls. No statistically significant differences occurred between observed and expected colony counts in the majority of experiments. With three patients, slight inhibition occurred at some but not all leukemic cell concentrations tested; this inhibition was not correlated with the leukemic cell concentration. These results indicate that leukemic cells from untreated ALL patients do not significantly inhibit normal in vitro granulopoiesis at the committed stem cell level or at later levels of differentiation; therefore, such inhibition does not appear to be responsible for ALL-associated neutropenia.","['Findley, H W Jr', 'Kennedy, M S', 'Lui, V K', 'Ragab, A H']","['Findley HW Jr', 'Kennedy MS', 'Lui VK', 'Ragab AH']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Granulocytes/*physiology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood']",1979/11/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1979/11/01 00:00'],"['1979/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1979/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1979 Nov;7(10):495-9.,,,,,,,,

In eight of these patients, chromosomal abnormalities were found in the leukemic cells; in four, the karyotypic abnormalities were established with banding techniques. The data of the present study and a review of the literature regarding chromosomal changes in Ph1-negative CML indicate that: 1) no characteristic or consistent karyotypic change is present in Ph1-negative CML and that diploidy is more common in this than any other leukemia; 2) the most common changes involve group C chromosomes (particularly +8); and 3) a missing Y is less common in Ph1-negative CML than in its Ph1-positive counterpart. The karyotypic changes in Ph1-negative CML resemble more those encountered in Ph1-positive CML than in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). The much shorter survival of the Ph1-negative CML patients vs that of the Ph1-positive group was again substantiated, and some of the previously reported clinical and laboratory findings unique to Ph1-negative CML were confirmed.

In appropriate clones, MGI induced the normal differentiation-associated property of chemotaxis to a variety of compounds including the steroid hormone dexamethasone. The induced cells could also distinguish among different steroids by chemotaxis, suggesting that there are specific membrane interaction sites for steroids. The sequence of differentiation in these cells was the formation of C3 and Fc rosettes leads to phagocytosis of these rosettes and chemotaxis leads to synthesis and secretion of lysozyme leads to mature macrophages or granulocytes. The use of appropriate mutants and the comparison of induction by MGI and dexamethasone has shown that chemotaxis to casein can be dissociated from: chemotaxis to dexamethasone, ATP, and bacterial factor; formation of C3 or Fc rosettes; phagocytosis of these rosettes; synthesis of lysozyme; and the formation of mature cells. It is suggested from this dissection of normal differentiation that there are different membrane changes for specific chemotaxis, formation of these rosettes, and their phagocytosis, and that induction of each of these properties requires activation of different genes.","['Symonds, G', 'Sachs, L']","['Symonds G', 'Sachs L']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Somatic Cell Genet,Somatic cell genetics,7506054,"['0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Complement C3)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Chemotactic Factors/pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis', 'Clone Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Complement C3/biosynthesis', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', '*Genes', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Macrophages', 'Mice', 'Rosette Formation']",1979/11/01 00:00,1979/11/01 00:01,['1979/11/01 00:00'],"['1979/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01542652 [doi]'],ppublish,Somatic Cell Genet. 1979 Nov;5(6):931-44. doi: 10.1007/BF01542652.,,,,,,,,

We separated the children into standard risk and increased risk. We defined increased risk as a WBC over 30 000/mm3 at presentation and an age of less than two years or greater than 10 years at presentation. There have been 15 relapses on these 50 patients; 11 occurred in increased risk patients (of 22 increased risk patients) and four occurred in standard risk patients (of 28 standard risk patients).

The NHL-hM may arise de novo or they develop more frequenctly in the course of a low-grade malignant lymphoma or in immune-deficiency states. They grow very fast and metastasise very early. However an early diagnosis allows to detect them in patients with the clinical stages I-II. By a radical operative removal of these tumours and by a thorough subsequent treatment a persistent remission or cure may be achieved. The most frequent types of NHL-hM are the lymphoblastic leukemias of childhood, the centroblastoma, and the immunoblastoma. In typical cases the histological diagnosis is easy. The immature, anaplastic types are difficult to diagnose and different methods (demonstration of surface and cytoplasmic immunoglobulins, cytochemistry, electron microscopy) most be applied. The most important differential diagnoses are the acute myeloblastic and myelomonocytic leukemias (naphthol-AS-D-chloroacetatesterase) immature epithelial tumours (lymphoepithelioma), and reactive processes (e.g. infectious monocleosis).","['Kelenyi, G']",['Kelenyi G'],['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Arch Geschwulstforsch,Archiv fur Geschwulstforschung,0372411,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Brown-Pearce/diagnosis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Infectious Mononucleosis/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis/ultrastructure', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness']",1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Geschwulstforsch. 1979;49(8):648-61.,,Nicht-Hodgkin-Lymphome hoher Malignitat Pathologische Diagnose und Differentialdiagnose.,,,,,,

Though treatment with intrathecal drugs reversed major neurological signs, there was evidence of generalized cerebral cortical atrophy.

At its end 37% of recordings were normal and 57% slightly abnormal. After maintenance-therapy of 1/2 to 1 year duration, there were 65% normal findings. Moderate and severe disorders were no longer demonstrated. Paroxysmal activity developed twice, each during the first phase of therapy and accompnaying convulsions. In both cases we saw slowing of background-activity and signs of increased excitability still months after. In one of these patients, the probable cause was a vincristin-encephalopathy, the cause of the second case remained unknown. EEGs of two furtehr patients with rubella-encephalitis and subarachnoideal hemorrhage exhibited severe unspecific changes.","['Korinthenberg, R', 'Palm, D', 'Rubig, A', 'Schellong, G']","['Korinthenberg R', 'Palm D', 'Rubig A', 'Schellong G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Neuropadiatrie,Neuropadiatrie,0260671,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cerebral Cortex/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', '*Electroencephalography', 'Evoked Potentials/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Radiotherapy Dosage']",1979/11/01 00:00,1979/11/01 00:01,['1979/11/01 00:00'],"['1979/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-0028-1085336 [doi]'],ppublish,Neuropadiatrie. 1979 Nov;10(4):332-47. doi: 10.1055/s-0028-1085336.,,,,,,,,

In general, the incidence of each of the leukemias and lymphomas is lower in Japan than in other Pacific rim populations whose rates are known. Particularly striking is the low incidence of CLL in Japan. Among Japanese in Hawaii, rates of some of these cancers (lymphosarcoma, CML) approach those of whites, whereas rates of other cancers (Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, ALL, CLL, and AML) more closely resemble those of native Japanese. The number of Chinese living in countries served by population-based cancer reporting systems is too small for any firm conclusions to be made about leukemia and lymphoma incidence in this group. The incidence of these diseases in certain other nonwhite Pacific rim residents (i.e., Mexican Americans, blacks, and Maoris) is, by and large, similar to that of whites.","['Weiss, N S']",['Weiss NS'],['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Natl Cancer Inst Monogr,National Cancer Institute monograph,0216026,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'British Columbia', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Japan', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology', 'New Zealand', 'United States']",1979/11/01 00:00,1979/11/01 00:01,['1979/11/01 00:00'],"['1979/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 1979 Nov;(53):139-42.,,,,,,,,

All these cases were oligoblastic and, according to their clinical course, they could be termed as smouldering leukemias. The chronic types affected mainly males. The diagnostic cytomorphological and cytochemical criteria are discussed. Erythro- and thrombocytopoiesis were distinctly less impaired than in acute leukemias (AL). The leucocyte count in the peripheral blood of the SMML cases was within the normal range. Hepato- and splenomegaly were markedly increased as compared to AL. According to our materials leukemic skin infiltrations were less frequent in CMoL, CMML and SMML than in acute monocytic leukemias. In each of the three types of leukemia discussed monocytic leukemic cells could be readily identified by cytochemical tests and usually showed fairly normal maturation. In accordance with these observations lysozyme levels in urine and serum usually were strongly increased. The patients in the CMML and CMoL groups showed a mean survival of more than 13 months (2 out of 7 are still alive), whereas the SMML patients survived an average of 8 months. Deaths were frequently due to advanced age rather than to leukemia. In other cases a terminal accumulation of blasts marked a transition to acute leukemia. During the smouldering phase of the disease no beneficial effect of combined chemotherapy could be noted. Supportive and symptomatic therapy might improve length and quality of survival.","['Abbrederis, K', 'Schmalzl, F', 'Braunsteiner, H']","['Abbrederis K', 'Schmalzl F', 'Braunsteiner H']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Med Klin,Medizinische Klinik,0376637,,IM,"['Aged', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Clinical Enzyme Tests', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1979/11/30 00:00,2000/03/22 09:00,['1979/11/30 00:00'],"['1979/11/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '1979/11/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Klin. 1979 Nov 30;74(48):1803-10.,,Subakute und chronische monozytare Leukamie: Diagnostische und klinische Problematik.,,,,,,

Criteria for accepting the diagnosis were hyperferremia, ringed marrow sideroblasts, ineffective erythropoiesis, and exclusion of associated hematologic disorders. The findings of a mean age at onset of 70 years, increased mean corpuscular volume, relative neutropenia; and occasional splenomegaly at diagnosis corresponded with previous reports. During the followup for a median period of 32 months, 6 patients (25%) transformed to acute myelogenous or myelomonocytic leukemia after widely variable intervals. The initial data base of these patients was compared to that of the remaining 19 patients in order to isolate predictive features. Only a lesser degree of hyperferremia (P less than 0.001) made the group going on to leukemia distinctive. The median survival of these patients was 20 months. The median survival of 19 patients not developing leukemia was 72 months for males and 42 months for females. Hemochromatosis was diagnosed in four patients and was a primary or associated cause of death in three. Analysis of the transfusion history suggested that intrinsic iron leading was a major factor in these patients. We conclude that leukemic transformation in AISA is a common, poorly predictable event which required lengthy followup for detection. Hemochromatosis in AISA occurs frequently and shortens the median survival.","['Lewy, R I', 'Kansu, E', 'Gabuzda, T']","['Lewy RI', 'Kansu E', 'Gabuzda T']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,['E1UOL152H7 (Iron)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Sideroblastic/blood/*complications', 'Female', 'Hemochromatosis/etiology', 'Humans', 'Iron/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830060404 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1979;6(4):323-31. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830060404.,,,,,,,,

Similar examination was performed on human leukemia cells and on sera and leukocytes from Donryu rats inoculated with rat leukemia cells (DBLA-6), induced by NBU. In addition to the enzyme activity, isoenzyme pattern was analyzed electrophoretically. The results obtained were as follows: 1) FDP/F1P ratios of the peripheral and marrow blood were high in untreated leukemia. After the induction therapy, the ratio in the marrow blood was high, but decreased in peripheral blood. 2) In complete remission, both ratios were decreased to normal level. 3) In the early relapse of leukemia, the marrow blood showed a high ratio in spite of normal value in the peripheral blood. During full relapse or reinduction therapy, FDP/F1P ratio remained high in both the peripheral and marrow blood. 4) Atypical hypoplastic leukemia showed a significantly high ratio in the marrow, but a low ratio in the periphery. No difference in either ratio was detected between hypoplastic anemia and normal subjects. 5) Zymogram of leukemia cells from leukemia patients showed that ALD-A was predominant more clearly than in normal leukocytes. ALD in normal leukocytes was composed mainly of ALD-A and its hybrids with ALD-B and ALD-C. 6) The ratio in sera and leukocytes from rats inoculated with DBLA-6 cells was increased with exacerbation of leukemia. ALD-A was predominant in rat leukemia cells on the zymogram. It is concluded that aldolase isoenzymes, especially the FDP/F1P ratio, are useful in estimating clinical course of leukemia, particularly in deciding early relapse of leukemia in bone marrow. These laboratory findings are also useful in differentiating atypical leukemia from hypoplastic anemia.","['Sakurada, K']",['Sakurada K'],['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi,[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science,17410290R,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 4.1.2.13 (Fructose-Bisphosphate Aldolase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/enzymology', 'Anemia, Hemolytic/enzymology', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Fructose-Bisphosphate Aldolase/*blood', 'Hematologic Diseases/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*blood', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Leukocytes/enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/enzymology', 'Rats']",1979/09/01 00:00,1979/09/01 00:01,['1979/09/01 00:00'],"['1979/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi. 1979 Sep;54(5):501-31.,,,,,,,,

In all cases, the leukaemic blasts were negative for myeloperoxidase on the basis of standard cytochemistry. In nine cases a variable proportion of blasts contained peroxidase activity detectable only by electron microscopy, permitting definition of their myeloid nature. By their distinct characteristics and localization, different peroxidase activities were recognized. Thus, several types of blasts were identified: megakaryoblasts (MKB), basophil promyelocytes (BPM), myeloid blasts with small granules containing peroxidase (MyB), and proerythroblasts (ProE). MKB were predominant in two cases and present in four cases, mixed with other myeloid blasts. BPM were abundant in one case and present in seven cases. MyB were identified as a majority in four cases. Three cases remained without any peroxidase. It is concluded that ultrastructural detection of peroxidases is of value for the identification of early myeloid blasts. Their high incidence and the simultaneous presence of several myeloid precursors suggest that during the blast crisis the target cell is frequently a pluripotent myeloid stem cell.","['Marie, J P', 'Vernant, J P', 'Dreyfus, B', 'Breton-Gorius, J']","['Marie JP', 'Vernant JP', 'Dreyfus B', 'Breton-Gorius J']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow/*enzymology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/enzymology', 'Female', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Peroxidases/*metabolism']",1979/12/01 00:00,1979/12/01 00:01,['1979/12/01 00:00'],"['1979/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1979.tb03787.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1979 Dec;43(4):549-58. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1979.tb03787.x.,,,,,,,,

Treatment of these differentiated cells with cytochalasin B can lead to a high proportion (i.e., 80-85%) of enucleated cells in vitro. Nuclear extrusion in cells induced to differentiate by dimethyl sulfoxide and subsequently treated with cytochalasin B began within 24-36 hr of exposure to the antibiotic, with the appearance of a pre-enucleated stage in which the cell nucleus became pycnotic and eccentrically located. Maximum enucleation occurred after 72-96 hr of exposure to cytochalasin B and was significantly enhanced when dimethyl sulfoxide was included in the culture medium during the period of treatment with cytochalasin B. Enucleation appeared to take place only in differentiated progeny, because nondifferentiated cells treated with cytochalasin B alone yielded a population of multinucleated cells.

W. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76, 4455-4459]. In this communication, we report that the Fv-2 locus, the major genetic determinant controlling host susceptibility to erythroleukemia induction by Friend leukemia virus, also controls the expression of endogenous sequences related to the replication-defective component of Friend leukemia virus, Friend spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV), in normal uninfected mice. Two independent congeneic pairs of mice [C57BL/6 (B6) and B6.S; B6 and B6.C(H-7(b))], differing only in a small region of the mouse genome including the Fv-2 locus, were used for this purpose. In both cases, molecular hybridization analysis indicated that the presence of SFFV-related RNA sequences in normal mice was associated with the Fv-2(s) allele: bone marrow or spleen cellular RNA from Fv-2(rr) B6 mice contained no detectable SFFV-related sequences, whereas their congeneic Fv-2(ss) pairs contained relatively high levels of these RNA sequences. The absence of these RNA sequences in Fv-2(rr) mice was not due to deletion of these sequences from the DNA of Fv-2(rr) mice. Repopulation of lethally irradiated Fv-2(rr) mice with syngeneic Fv-2(rr) bone marrow cells did not lead to any increase in the levels of these SFFV-related RNA sequences, suggesting that the expression of these sequences is still reduced or inhibited in actively cycling Fv-2(rr) hemopoietic cells. Infection with Friend leukemia virus resulted in the appearance of high levels of RNA homologous to SFFV-specific sequences in the leukemic spleens of B6.S (Fv-2(ss)) mice, whereas these cellular RNA sequences could not be detected in the spleens of Friend virus-infected B6 (Fv-2(rr)) mice. The demonstration that the same gene locus controls both the expression of exogenous SFFV-specific sequences and erythroleukemia induction by Friend leukemia virus suggests that these sequences may be necessary for erythroleukemic transformation. In addition, the finding that the Fv-2 gene locus controls the expression of endogenous SFFV-related sequences suggests that these sequences may also be involved in normal hemopoiesis.","['Mak, T W', 'Axelrad, A A', 'Bernstein, A']","['Mak TW', 'Axelrad AA', 'Bernstein A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*microbiology', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Defective Viruses/*genetics', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Genes, Viral', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Mice', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Spleen/*microbiology']",1979/11/01 00:00,1979/11/01 00:01,['1979/11/01 00:00'],"['1979/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.76.11.5809 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1979 Nov;76(11):5809-12. doi: 10.1073/pnas.76.11.5809.,PMC411740,,,,,,,

In (B10.A X A)F1 X A backcross mice the spleen virus titer segregated with the level of viremia. The Rfv-3 gene appeared to act by controlling anti-Friend virus antibody production. The interaction of antiviral antibody with infected cells led to a decrease in release of infectious virus by late leukemic spleen cells in Rfv-3r/s mice to 1/300th that in Rfv-3s/s mice.

Changes in the proliferative activity of the leukaemic myeloblasts were monitored by determination of the labelling index (LI) and the mitotic index (MI). There was a significant fall in both LI and MI within a few hours of the administration of cytarabine (P = 0.005). In 14 of the 16 cases the LI subsequently rose to observed maxima 0.3% to 14.1% (mean 5.0%) above the preinfusion LI, 11 to 77 hours (mean 40.8 h) after the infusion (P less than 0.05). The MI returned to the mean pretreatment level within the period of observation in 11 of the 16 cases. In general, the changes in MI followed those in LI; the results are consistent with cytarabine-induced arrest or death of leukaemic blast cells in S phase. Because of the variability in timing of kinetic changes in leukaemic myeloblasts following cytarabine, it is not possible to institute remission induction therapy consistently at the time of maximum synchronization with any fixed chemotherapeutic schedule. Furthermore, the degree of synchronization attained is, in general, small, limiting the prospect of exploiting synchronization with cytarabine as a means of improving the remission rate for AML.","['Buchanan, J G', 'Matthews, J R', 'Postlewaight, B F', 'Upsdell, M']","['Buchanan JG', 'Matthews JR', 'Postlewaight BF', 'Upsdell M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitosis/drug effects']",1979/07/01 00:00,1979/07/01 00:01,['1979/07/01 00:00'],"['1979/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/00313027909059011 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathology. 1979 Jul;11(3):349-59. doi: 10.3109/00313027909059011.,,,,,,,,

In the absence of the inducing agent, the 707B line of Friend erythroleukaemic cells is highly agglutinable by the lectins concanavalin A or wheat germ agglutinin. However, 48 h after the induction of differentiation, there is a marked decrease in the agglutination of the cells in the presence of either lectin. This suggests that early in differentiation a change occurs in the cell membrane preceding the onset of globin synthesis which starts approximately 72 h after induction. The change in agglutination by concanavalin A also occurs in the presence of reagents which do not induce haemoglobin synthesis in the 707B line of Friend erythroleukaemic cells but which are able to stimulate the synthesis of this protein in other erythroleukaemic cell lines. The reduction in the agglutinability of the differentiating cells does not seem to result from a reduction in the number of concanavalin A receptors on the cells, nor does it reflect a change in the clustered distribution of concanavalin A receptors in the differentiating cells. Both the control and dimethyl sulphoxide-induced cells show a similar patchy distribution of ferritin-labelled concanavalin A when examined by electron microscopy. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows little change in the total pattern of protein synthesis by control and differentiating cells when pulse-labelled with [35S] methionine. However, use of 125I-labelled concanavalin A to stain polyacrylamide gels, on which the total proteins of control and differentiating cells had been separated, revealed a profound change in the composition of the concanavalin A-binding proteins. The control, undifferentiated cells contained eleven or more classes of concanavalin A-binding glycoproteins, many of which stained to a lesser degree as the cell density increased. After the onset of differentiation, 2 new concanavalin A-binding glycoproteins appeared within 48 h. One of these proteins has a molecular weight in excess of 180 000 while the other migrated with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 100 000. After erythroid differentiation had progressed for 120 h, these newly synthesized glycoproteins became the major concanavalin A-binding proteins of the erythroleukaemic cells.","['Hunt, R C', 'Marshall, L M']","['Hunt RC', 'Marshall LM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Lectins)', '0 (Receptors, Concanavalin A)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Aggregation/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Erythrocytes/ultrastructure', 'Lectins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Receptors, Concanavalin A/drug effects']",1979/08/01 00:00,1979/08/01 00:01,['1979/08/01 00:00'],"['1979/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1979 Aug;38:315-29.,,,,,,,,

These matrices preserved the characteristic topographical distribution of condensed and diffuse ""chromatin"" regions, as do nuclei in situ or isolated nuclei. Histone H1 was released from the nuclear matrix of undifferentiated cells by 0.3 M KCl; inner core histones were released by 1 M KCl. Nuclear matrix from differentiated cells did not maintain H1, and histone cores were fully released in 0.7 M KCl. KCl removed the core histones as an octameric structure with no evidence of preferential release of any single histone. Electron microscopy of KCl-treated matrix revealed no condensed regions but rather a network of fibrils in the whole DNA-depleted nuclei. When nuclear matrices from both types of cell were exposed to conditions of very low ionic strength, inner core histones and condensed regions remained. These observations support the contention that inner core histones are bound to matrix through natural ionic bonds or saline-labile elements, and that these interactions are implicated in chromatin condensation. hnRNA remained undegraded and tenaciously associated to the matrix fibrils, and was released only by chemical means which, by breaking hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds, produced matrix lysis. Very few nonhistone proteins were released upon complete digestion of DNA from either type of nuclei. The remaining nonhistone proteins represent a large number of species of which the majority may be matrix components. The molecular architecture in both condensed and diffuse regions of interphase nuclei appears to be constructed of two distinct kinds of fibers; the thicker chromatin fibers are interwoven with the thinner matrix fibers. The latter are formed by a heteropolymer of many different proteins.","['Long, B H', 'Huang, C Y', 'Pogo, A O']","['Long BH', 'Huang CY', 'Pogo AO']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Heterogeneous Nuclear)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/analysis/*ultrastructure', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Chromatin/*analysis', 'Deoxyribonucleases/pharmacology', 'Histones/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Proteins/analysis', 'RNA, Heterogeneous Nuclear/*analysis']",1979/12/01 00:00,1979/12/01 00:01,['1979/12/01 00:00'],"['1979/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(79)90221-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(79)90221-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1979 Dec;18(4):1079-90. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(79)90221-6.,,,,,,,,

Dependent on the blast cell count, the leukemic IMP dehydrogenase had a higher mean specific activity than the enzymes of fractionated, immature bone marrow cells, or normal granulocytes. The partially purified enzymes from the various blood cells were apparently identical; they exhibited hyperbolic substrate saturation kinetics and were inhibited by a number of purine nucleotides.

Our sequential treatment of L1210 leukaemic mice, in which vincristine was administered before methotrexate therapy, was as effective as treatment with the two drugs given simultaneously. In solid tumour experiments we were unable to show any increase in the antitumour effect of methotrexate when vincristine was injected before methotrexate administration. Consequently, we advocate the re-evaluation of the practice of vincristine leads to methotrexate therapy as used in many clinical protocols for the treatment of patients with osteosarcoma. Pretreatment with vincristine resulted in methotrexate-induced weight loss and sometimes in toxic death of the mice. Since the growth of tumours can be modified by regulation of the caloric intake of the host, this aspect was investigated in more detail. The effect of starvation, which was comparable to the effect of drug-induced weight loss, had a retarding effect on tumour growth. The growth rates of smaller tumour volumes were less severely affected than were those of large tumour masses.","['Mulder, J H', 'van Putten, L M']","['Mulder JH', 'van Putten LM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Body Weight', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Osteosarcoma/drug therapy', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Starvation', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage']",1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00254981 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1979;3(2):111-6. doi: 10.1007/BF00254981.,,,,,,,,

Necrotising enterocolitis in this and previously reported cases of cyclic neutropaenia resembles the agranulocytic form of intestinal necrosis which occasionally complicates leukaemia.","['Bignold, L P', 'Harvey, H P']","['Bignold LP', 'Harvey HP']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Australia,Aust N Z J Med,Australian and New Zealand journal of medicine,1264322,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Agranulocytosis/*complications', '*Clostridium Infections/pathology', 'Enterocolitis, Pseudomembranous/*etiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Ileocecal Valve/pathology', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/*complications']",1979/08/01 00:00,1979/08/01 00:01,['1979/08/01 00:00'],"['1979/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1445-5994.1979.tb04173.x [doi]'],ppublish,Aust N Z J Med. 1979 Aug;9(4):426-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.1979.tb04173.x.,,,,,,,,

The median time from the first presentation with Hodgkin's disease to the development of acute leukaemia was 7.7 years. Chromosomal abnormalities were found in four patients. A preleukaemic phase was present in three patients. Survival following diagnosis of acute leukaemia was short (median four weeks) and only one patient achieved a complete remission.

The relationship between onset of accumulation of globin mRNA and cell cycle phase has been examined in MELC fractionated with respect to cell cycle (G1, early S, mid S, and late S/G2) by the technique of centrifugal elutriation. This technique provides synchronized populations of cells without use of chemicals that block cell function (e.g., DNA synthesis). It is shown that the initial onset of accumulation of globin mRNA occurs during the first G1 phase after a complete S traversed in culture with inducer. Once globin mRNA synthesis is initiated, it continues throughout the cell cycle. Studies of synchronized MELC populations exposed to hexamethylenebisacetamide starting in G1, mid S, or late S/G2, provide evidence that an effect of the inducer during G1 or early S is critical to initiation of accumulation of newly synthesized globin mRNA and to the prolongation of G1, both of which are associated with terminal erythroid differentiation.","['Gambari, R', 'Marks, P A', 'Rifkind, R A']","['Gambari R', 'Marks PA', 'Rifkind RA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Diamines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', '*Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Diamines/pharmacology', 'Globins/*genetics', '*Interphase/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",1979/09/01 00:00,1979/09/01 00:01,['1979/09/01 00:00'],"['1979/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.76.9.4511 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1979 Sep;76(9):4511-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.76.9.4511.,PMC411607,,,,,,,

Only background homology was detected between cDNA(sff) and viral RNA from a number of murine [Friend murine leukemia virus (MuLV), Moloney-MuLV, and Kirsten sarcoma virus] and nonmurine (Rous sarcoma virus, feline leukemia virus, baboon endogenous virus, and Mason-Pfizer mammary tumor virus) retroviruses. Limited homology was also detected to a number of murine xenotropic and mink cell focus-inducing viruses (20-35%) as well as Rauscher leukemia virus (50%). Nucleotide sequences homologous to cDNA(sff) were also detected in the DNA of normal cells of several mouse strains as single or a few copies per cell. Thermal denaturation analysis indicated that duplexes formed between cDNA(sff) and normal DBA/2J cellular DNA have a reduction in melting temperature of 2 degrees C when compared with the dissociation of hybrids between cDNA(sff) and homologous sequences in SFFV-infected mouse spleen cell DNA. Examination of cellular RNA from uninfected mouse cells indicated that SFFV-related RNA sequences were also expressed in varying degrees in different tissues of adult DBA/2J mice. The highest amounts were observed in cells from bone marrow and spleen, whereas considerably lower amounts were found in cells from the thymus and kidney. No SFFV-related sequences could be detected in RNA extracted from liver, muscle, or fibroblasts. The presence of these SFFV-related sequences in normal, uninfected mouse cell DNA and their differential expression in hematopoietic tissues suggest that these sequences may be an integral part of the program of both normal and leukemic hematopoietic cell differentiation.","['Bernstein, A', 'Gamble, C', 'Penrose, D', 'Mak, T W']","['Bernstein A', 'Gamble C', 'Penrose D', 'Mak TW']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics']",1979/09/01 00:00,1979/09/01 00:01,['1979/09/01 00:00'],"['1979/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.76.9.4455 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1979 Sep;76(9):4455-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.76.9.4455.,PMC411595,,,,,,,

However, they do not become committed to terminal differentiation nor do they become benzidine positive. This is in contrast to MEL cells induced with dimethyl sulfoxide (Me(2)SO) which undergo a more complete program of erythroid differentiation. In order to determine the relationship between commitment and various events in the erythroid program, we compared the induction of MEL cells with hemin and with Me(2)SO. The amount of globin mRNA accumulated in inducing MEL cells and the rate of its synthesis and turnover were quantitated. Although MEL cells induced with hemin accumulated significantly less globin mRNA than did cells induced with Me(2)SO, the rate of synthesis of globin mRNA was the same in fully induced cells, irrespective of inducer. Therefore, there is no evidence that induction with hemin produces an early program that is different or altered from that which is part of Me(2)SO induction. MEL cells induced with Me(2)SO specifically destabilize their globin mRNA after 4 days of induction. This raises the question of whether this destabilization of globin mRNA is an independently programmed late event, as suggested by the time of its occurrence, or, alternatively, whether it might be the inevitable consequence of an early event(s). For instance, destabilization might be linked to the synthesis or translation of globin mRNA. Because MEL cells induced with hemin do not destabilize their globin mRNA, we have concluded that this turnover of globin mRNA is a late event, occurring only in a committed cell population.","['Lowenhaupt, K', 'Lingrel, J B']","['Lowenhaupt K', 'Lingrel JB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Globins/*biosynthesis', 'Heme/*analogs & derivatives', 'Hemin/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects']",1979/10/01 00:00,1979/10/01 00:01,['1979/10/01 00:00'],"['1979/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.76.10.5173 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1979 Oct;76(10):5173-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.76.10.5173.,PMC413102,,,,,,,

TPA induced normal cell differentiation in one of the mouse leukemic clones and this was mediated by induction of the protein inducer of differentiation to macrophages or granulocytes (MGI) in the cells that then differentiated. Other mouse clones were not induced to differentiate by TPA. In one of these clones, TPA induced cell susceptibility to externally added MGI. This effect was not due to a general induction of susceptibility to all compounds because TPA did not induce susceptibility to lypopolysaccharide or dexamethasone in this clone. In the human leukemic cell line, TPA also induced differentiation with the induction of MGI activity and enhanced susceptibility to added MGI. It is suggested that the clonal differences in induction of MGI activity and increased susceptibility to MGI may be associated with differences in receptors for TPA and the ability of TPA to modify receptors for MGI. Studies with normal bone marrow cells have indicated that TPA stimulated MGI activity and also increased susceptibility of normal myeloblasts to induction of multiplication by MGI. The ability of different phorbol esters to produce these effects on normal myeloblasts and myeloid leukemic cells paralleled their ability to act as tumor promoters. The results indicate that a tumor promoter such as TPA can induce the production of and increase cell susceptibility to a normal regulator of cell multiplication and differentiation. TPA has pleiotropic effects. It is suggested that, by these mechanisms, TPA may thus act as a tumor promoter by increasing cell multiplication in initiated cells, induce differentiation in some cells, or inhibit differentiation in other cells, depending on which molecules are being regulated in the TPA-treated cells.","['Lotem, J', 'Sachs, L']","['Lotem J', 'Sachs L']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Phorbols)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Rosette Formation', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1979/10/01 00:00,1979/10/01 00:01,['1979/10/01 00:00'],"['1979/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.76.10.5158 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1979 Oct;76(10):5158-62. doi: 10.1073/pnas.76.10.5158.,PMC413099,,,,,,,

In an effort to characterize the anemia, we analyzed the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) at the time of diagnosis. The MCV was selected because of the observation that older erythrocytes have a reduced MCV and an anemia presumably related to decreased red blood cell production should be reflected by a reduced MCV. A total of 54 patients fulfilled the criteria for analysis. Of this group, 33 per cent had an increased MCV, 61 per cent had a normal MCV, and 6 per cent had a decreased MCV for age. Patients with an increased MCV were found to have a significantly lower hemoglobin and platelet count. The number of females in the group with the increased MCV was 83 per cent as contrasted with 43 per cent in the group with a normal MCV. At relapse, 71 per cent of patients with an initially increased MCV had an elevated MCV as contrasted with only 23 per cent in the group with an initially normal MCV. These observations suggest that in patients with ALL and an increased MCV, a maturation defect may be present that affects all cell lines and may be the result of a diffusible substance released from the leukemic cells. The MCV cannot be used as a reflection of mean cell age in patients with ALL and does not support the belief that the anemia in ALL is merely the result of a ""crowding-out"" process.","['Small, T', 'Oski, F A']","['Small T', 'Oski FA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Pediatr (Phila),Clinical pediatrics,0372606,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Erythrocyte Indices', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Hemoglobins', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood/complications', 'Platelet Count']",1979/11/01 00:00,1979/11/01 00:01,['1979/11/01 00:00'],"['1979/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/000992287901801104 [doi]'],ppublish,"Clin Pediatr (Phila). 1979 Nov;18(11):687-8, 690-1. doi: 10.1177/000992287901801104.",,,,,,,,

Excess DNA prevents uptake of the drug. Administration of the drug as the complex results in much higher serum concentration and a reduced urinary excretion. The complex is well tolerated, but side effects are probably of the same order as those seen with the free drug. An exception may be the heart. The acute toxicity is not seen when infusing the complex. Our experience with 20 children who have received more than 500 mg/m2 indicates that the chronic cardiac toxicity may be reduced, too.

These data support the observed therapeutic synergisms with combinations of alkylating agents seen against a broad spectrum of murine tumors, and they suggest other drug combinations that might be considered for experimental and clinical trial based on a growing number of logical differences in biochemical mechanism of action of alkylating agent anticancer drugs that have been reported.","['Schabel, F M Jr', 'Trader, M W', 'Laster, W R Jr', 'Corbett, T H', 'Griswold, D P Jr']","['Schabel FM Jr', 'Trader MW', 'Laster WR Jr', 'Corbett TH', 'Griswold DP Jr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Cisplatin/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Osteosarcoma/drug therapy']",1979/09/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1979/09/01 00:00'],"['1979/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1979/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1979 Sep-Oct;63(9-10):1459-73.,,,,,,,,

Incremental increases of vincristine concentrations in excess of 2 x 10(-9) M produced a progressive reduction of survival of L1210 cells and suppression of CEM growth under the condition of constant drug exposure. A maximum cytotoxic effect was reached with drug concentrations between 10(-8) and 10(-7) M. When L1210 cells were exposed to vincristine for a variable length of time ranging from 0.5 to 24 hr, 10(-7) M produced a noticeable cytotoxic effect following an incubation of only 30 min. A 50% cell kill of L1210 cells and a 50% reduction of CEM cell growth were produced by 10(-7) M following a 1- to 3-hr period of exposure; 6 to 12 hr were required to produce a similar effect at a vincristine concentration of 10(-8) M. Therefore, the antitumor effect of vincristine is critically dependent on both concentration and duration of exposure.

The concept of leukemia cell subpopulations in each patient received major clinical support from ALL. The pharmacological sanctuary, typified by the meninges, was first discovered and specifically attacked in ALL. Combination therapy, aggressive therapy during remission, phase-specific therapy, and the interrelationships of phases of therapy were developed first in ALL. Since leukemia cell features, such as T-cell characteristics, correlate with responsiveness to therapy, powerful new tools may be developed to improve the biological specifically of therapy.

Pretreatment characteristics.,1001-14,"The phenomenon of premature chromosome condensation (PCC) was used to compare the bone marrow proliferation characteristics of 163 patients with various forms of leukemia prior to the initiation of new therapy. The proliferative potential index (PPI, or fraction of G1 cells in late G1 phase) and the fraction of cells in S phase was determined and compared to the type of disease and the bone marrow blast infiltrate for each patient. Previously untreated patients with acute leukemia exhibited an average PPI value three times that of normal bone marrow (37.5% for acute myeloblastic leukemia [AML], acute monomyeloblastic leukemia [AMML], or acute promyelocytic leukemia [APML] and 42% for acute lymphocytic leukemia [ALL] or acute undifferentiated leukemia [AUL]). Untreated chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients showed intermediate PPI values (25.2%), whereas CML patients with controlled disease exhibited nearly normal PPI values (14.6%). On the other hand, blastic-phase CML patients exhibited PPI values closer to that observed in patients with acute leukemia (35.4%). Seven patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) exhibited even higher PPI values. No correlations were observed between PPI values, fraction of cells in S phase, and marrow blast infiltrate. For untreated acute disease patients, PPI values were prognostic for response only at low and high PPI values. These results suggest that the PCC-determined proliferative potential is a biologic reflection of the degree of malignancy within the bone marrow.","['Hittelman, W N', 'Broussard, L C', 'McCredie, K']","['Hittelman WN', 'Broussard LC', 'McCredie K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromosomes/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Time Factors']",1979/11/01 00:00,1979/11/01 00:01,['1979/11/01 00:00'],"['1979/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)80831-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1979 Nov;54(5):1001-14.,,,,,,,,

Resolution of all clinical and morphologic abnormalities occurred. The remission was apparently associated with an acute pulmonary infection. At relapse, remission induction was accomplished with cystosine arabinoside and daunorubicin therapy. In vitro granulocyte-macrophage agar culture studies (CFU-c) showed an abnormal growth pattern at presentation, which persisted during the period of spontaneous remission. Reports of spontaneous remissions of acute myelogenous leukemia in adults have become increasingly rare, and the remissions themselves are short-lived. Despite the association between spontaneous remissions and acute infections or febrile episodes, attempts at remission induction with infectious agents have been unsuccessful.

Direct assessement of dexamethasone binding revealed high-affinity dexamethasone receptors on the untreated cells. The specific binding of [3H]dexamethasone was dose dependent. At a concentration of 10(-8) M, almost all binding sites were occupied. The mean number of binding sites per cell in two separate experiments was 8045 and 7191, respectively, and the Kd varied between 3.38 and 3.49 x 10(-9) M. Dimethyl sulfoxide treatment led to a decrease in the number of dexamethasone binding sites on the cells induced to differentiate. After 5 days of treatment, the mean number of sites per cell was reduced to 1216 and 896 in two experiments, with a Kd of 5 x 10(-9) M. Dexamethasone treatment resulted in a moderate decrease in the efficiency of colony formation within 72 hr after the cells were plated in methylcellulose. The mechanism of this inhibitory effect is unknown. However, it was also dose dependent and could be abrogated by appropriate concentrations of progesterone or 11-deoxycortisone. These results suggest that the steroid effects on growth and differentiation of the erythroleukemia cells may be mediated via glucocorticoid receptors.","['Golde, D W', 'Bersch, N', 'Lippman, M E', 'Friend, C']","['Golde DW', 'Bersch N', 'Lippman ME', 'Friend C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Steroid/*metabolism', 'Tumor Virus Infections/metabolism']",1979/07/01 00:00,1979/07/01 00:01,['1979/07/01 00:00'],"['1979/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.76.7.3515 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1979 Jul;76(7):3515-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.76.7.3515.,PMC383858,,,,,,,
