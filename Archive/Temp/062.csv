To identify genetic factors associated with childhood ALL risk in the Chinese population, we performed a three-stage GWAS of 1184 childhood ALL cases and 3219 non-ALL controls. The combined analysis identified a new locus (rs1121404 in WWOX) at 16q23.1 associated with childhood ALL susceptibility (odds ratio (OR) = 1.38, P = 5.29 x 10(-10)), especially in the subtype of B-ALL (OR = 1.39, P = 2.47 x 10(-9)). The functional studies subsequently revealed that the expression of WWOX in ALL bone marrow was significantly lower than that in normal bone marrow. The G allele of rs1121404 displayed significantly decreased levels of mRNA expression of WWOX These results suggest that WWOX plays an important role in the development of childhood ALL and provide new insights into the etiology of childhood ALL.","['(c) The Author 2016.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, a total of 4 ultra high risk CLL patients with the deletion of p53 in our center between July 2012 and Jan 2014 were enrolled. The RIC regimen was administered and the hematopoietic reconstitution, transplantation related mortality (TRM), overall survival (OS), progress free survival (PFS) were evaluated. RESULTS: We registered 4 patients with the median age of 56 years (49-61 years), including 3 males and 1 female. The median mononuclear cells (MNC) and CD34(+) cells were 6.54 (2.85-14.7) x 10(8)/kg (recipient body weight) and 5.81 (2.85-7.79) x 10(6)/kg (recipient body weight), respectively. The median time of the neutrophil recovery was 11 days (range of 9-12 days), and the median time of the platelet recovery 5.5 days (range of 0-11 days). Three patients (75%) attained a full donor chimerism at day 28 after transplantation and one (25%) got a mixed chimerism of donor and recipient. During the follow-up at a median time of 26.5 months (range of 21-39 months), 2 (50%) patients developed acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) grade I and 2 (50%) patients got CMV infection. One patient got herpes zoster virus and EB virus infections. No transplantation related mortality was found in the 4 patients. One patient who was in partial response status progressed 5 months after transplantation, and the other 3 patients remained in durable remission after allo-HSCT.

METHODS: Cytogenetic examination of bone marrow cells obtained from patients was performed by 24 h culture method. R banding technical was used for karyotype analysis. PDGFRbeta gene rearrangement was detected by FISH using dual color break apart PDGFRbeta probe. ETV6-PDGFRbeta fusion genes were detected by multiple-reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Direct sequencing analysis was performed on the PCR products in case 1. Immunophenotype analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. Four cases were treated with imatinib (IM) and followed up. RESULTS: The diagnoses included 3 MPN and 1 AML-M2. The t (5;12) (q33;p13) was a primary abnormality in 3 cases of MPN and a secondary abnormality in 1 case of AML-M2. PDGFRbeta gene rearrangement and ETV6-PDGFRbeta fusion genes were detected by FISH and multiple-RT-PCR in 4 cases, respectively. The immunophenotypical analysis of leukemia cells showed positive for CD13, CD33 and CD34. Two cases obtained MMR after the treatment of IM, one case complete hematologic and complete cytogenetic response.

METHODS: A total of 16 patients with refractory relapsed FLT3-positive AML, including 10 refractory relapsed pre-transplantation and 6 relapsed after allo-HSCT, were enrolled in this retrospective study. Sorafenib treatment protocols included sorafenib in combination with chemotherapy inducing remission, and sorafenib monotherapy as mauntenance treatment after complete remission (CR). RESULTS: Thirteen of the 16 patients achieved CR after one or two courses of induction therapy, including 7 refractory relapsed pre-transplantation and 6 relapsed after allo-HSCT. With a median follow up of 472 (range, 59-1569) days post-transplantation, 12 patients survived and 4 died. Causes of death included leukemia relapse (n=3) and acute graft-versus-host disease (n=1). The 2-year overall and disease-free survival post-transplantation of the 16 patients were (75.0+/-10.8) % and (50.5+/-13.7) % respectively. The main side effect of sorafenib was the skin rash. The incidence of rash was lower in the patients used sorafenib pre-transplantation than those post-transplantation (30.0% vs 75.0%, P=0.043).

In order to construct the AIK expression vector by Gateway technology, and establish an optimal expression and purification method for recombinant AIK, a set of primers containing AttB sites were designed and used to create the AttB-TEV-FLAG-AIR fusion gene by overlapping PCR. The resulting fusion gene was cloned into the donor vector pDONR223 by attB and attP mediated recombination (BP reaction), then, transferred into the destination vector pDESTl 5 by attL and attR mediated recombination (LR reaction). All the cloning was verified by both colony PCR and DNA sequencing. The BL21 F. coli transformed by the GST-AIR expression plasmid was used to express the GST-AIK fusion protein with IPTG induction and the induction conditions were optimized. GST-AIR fusion protein was purified by glutathione magnetic beads, followed by rTEV cleavage to remove GST tag and MTS assay to test the growth inhibition activity of the recombinant AIR on human leukemia HL-60 cells. We found that a high level of soluble expression of GST-AIK protein (more than 30% out of the total bacterial proteins) was achieved upon 0.1 mmol/L ITPG induction for 4 h at 37 degrees C in the transformed BL21 F. coli with starting OD(6)(0)(0) at 1.0. Through GST affinity purification and rTEV cleavage, the purity of the resulting recombinant AIK was greater than 95%. And the MTS assays on HL-60 cells confirmed that the recombinant AIK retains an antitumor activity at a level similar to the chemically synthesized AIK.

Although the overall survival rate has been improved by the current therapeutic regime, the presence of resistance has resulted in limited efficacy. In this study, an RNA interference (RNAi)-based therapeutic regime is proposed with the aim to knockdown the BCR-ABL hybrid oncogene using small interfering RNA (siRNA). The siRNA transfection rates have usually been limited due to the declining contact probability among polyplexes and the non-adherent nature of leukemic cells. Our work aims at addressing this limitation by using a biodegradable charged polyester-based vector (BCPV) as a nanocarrier for the delivery of BCR-ABL-specific siRNA to the suspension culture of a K562 CML cell line. BCR-ABL siRNAs were encapsulated in the BCPVs by electrostatic force. Cell internalization was facilitated by the BCPV and assessed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. The regulation of the BCR-ABL level in K562 cells as a result of RNAi was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We observed that BCPV was able to form stable nanoplexes with siRNA molecules, even in the presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS), and successfully assisted in vitro siRNA transfection in the non-adherent K562 cells. As a consequence of downregulation of BCR-ABL, BCPV-siRNA nanoplexes inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis. All results were compared with a commercial transfection reagent, Lipofectamine2000, which served as a positive control. More importantly, this class of non-viral vector exhibits biodegradable features and negligible cytotoxicity, thus providing a versatile platform to deliver siRNA to non-adherent leukemia cells with high transfection efficiency by effectively overcoming extra- and intra-cellular barriers. Due to the excellent in vitro transfection results from BCPV-siRNA, a newly developed biodegradable transfection agent, BCPV, is being probed for transfection performance in an animal model.",,"['Yang, Chengbin', 'Panwar, Nishtha', 'Wang, Yucheng', 'Zhang, Butian', 'Liu, Maixian', 'Toh, Huiting', 'Yoon, Ho Sup', 'Tjin, Swee Chuan', 'Chong, Peter Han Joo', 'Law, Wing-Cheung', 'Chen, Chih-Kuang', 'Yong, Ken-Tye']","['Yang C', 'Panwar N', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang B', 'Liu M', 'Toh H', 'Yoon HS', 'Tjin SC', 'Chong PH', 'Law WC', 'Chen CK', 'Yong KT']","['School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Avenue, 639798, Singapore. ktyong@ntu.edu.sg.', 'School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Avenue, 639798, Singapore. ktyong@ntu.edu.sg.', 'School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Avenue, 639798, Singapore. ktyong@ntu.edu.sg.', 'School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Avenue, 639798, Singapore. ktyong@ntu.edu.sg.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Buffalo, The State University of New York, Buffalo, New York 14260, USA.', 'Division of Structural Biology & Biochemistry, School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, 639798, Singapore.', 'Division of Structural Biology & Biochemistry, School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, 639798, Singapore and Department of Genetic Engineering, College of Life Sciences, Kyung Hee University, Yongin-si Gyeonggi-do, 446701, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Avenue, 639798, Singapore. ktyong@ntu.edu.sg.', 'School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Avenue, 639798, Singapore. ktyong@ntu.edu.sg.', 'Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, P.

Dynamic BH3 profiling is a novel methodology that we have applied to the measurement of complementarity between sensitiser BH3 peptide mimetics and therapeutic agents. Using dynamic BH3 profiling, we show that the agent TG02, which downregulates MCL-1, sensitises to the BCL-2-inhibitory BAD-BH3 peptide, whereas the BCL-2 antagonist ABT-199 sensitises to MCL-1 inhibitory NOXA-BH3 peptide in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells. At the concentrations used, the peptides did not trigger mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation in their own right, but primed cells to release Cytochrome C in the presence of an appropriate trigger of a complementary pathway. In KG-1a cells TG02 and ABT-199 synergised to induce apoptosis. In heterogeneous AML patient samples we noted a range of sensitivities to the two agents. Although some individual samples markedly favoured one agent or the other, in the group as a whole the combination of TG02 + ABT-199 was significantly more cytotoxic than either agent individually.

However, its potential role in solid cancers has rarely been reported. We investigated the coordinate function of Musashi2-Numb in the development of pancreatic cancer (PC) in vitro and vivo. Both Musashi2 protein and mRNA levels were higher in PC tissues than that in paired normal pancreas (P<0.05). Musashi2 overexpression and Numb positive expression were positively and negatively associated with tumor size and UICC stage, respectively (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis identified Musashi2 and Numb as adverse and favorable independent indicators for the survival of PC patients. Moreover, patients with high Musashi2 expression combining with negative Numb expression had a significantly worse overall survival (P=0.001). The negative relationship between Musashi2 and Numb was found at both PC tissue and cell levels. These two endogenous proteins can be co-immunoprecipitated from PC cell lines, and Musashi2 silence up-regulated Numb protein in vitro and vivo. Meanwhile, its silence decreased cell invasion and migration in vitro and inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumors and the frequency of liver metastasis in vivo.

To determine a possible biomarker for STOP-IM CML, we examined plasma miRNA expression in CML patients who were able to discontinue IM. We first screened candidate miRNAs in unselected STOP-IM patients, who had sustained UMRD after discontinuing IM for more than six months, in comparison with healthy volunteers, by using a TaqMan low-density array for plasma or exosomes. Exosomal miR-215 and plasma miR-215 were downregulated in the STOP-IM group compared to the control, indicating that the biological relevance of the plasma miR-215 level is equivalent to that of the exosomal level. Next, we performed real-time quantitative RT-PCR in 20 STOP-IM patients, 32 patients with UMRD on continued IM therapy (IM group) and 28 healthy volunteers. The plasma miRNA-215 level was significantly downregulated in the STOP-IM group (p < 0.0001); we determined the cut-off level and divided the IM group patients into two groups according to whether the plasma miR-215 was downregulated or not.

Flavobacterium columnare (FC) infection can cause great economic loss of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) which is one of the most important cultured fish in the world. However, miRNAs in response to FC infection in common carp has not been characterized. To identify specific miRNAs involved in common carp infected with FC, we performed microRNA sequencing using livers of common carp infected with and without FC. A total of 698 miRNAs were identified, including 142 which were identified and deposited in the miRbase database (Available online: http://www.mirbase.org/) and 556 had only predicted miRNAs. Among the deposited miRNAs, eight miRNAs were first identified in common carp. Thirty of the 698 miRNAs were differentially expressed miRNAs (DIE-miRNAs) between the FC infected and control samples. From the DIE-miRNAs, seven were selected randomly and their expression profiles were confirmed to be consistent with the microRNA sequencing results using RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. In addition, a total of 27,363 target genes of the 30 DIE-miRNAs were predicted. The target genes were enriched in five Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, including focal adhesion, extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction, erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ErbB) signaling pathway, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and adherent junction. The miRNA expression profile of the liver of common carp infected with FC will pave the way for the development of effective strategies to fight against FC infection.",,"['Zhao, Lijuan', 'Lu, Hong', 'Meng, Qinglei', 'Wang, Jinfu', 'Wang, Weimin', 'Yang, Ling', 'Lin, Li']","['Zhao L', 'Lu H', 'Meng Q', 'Wang J', 'Wang W', 'Yang L', 'Lin L']","['Shandong Freshwater Fisheries Research Institute, Jinan 250013, China. zhaolijuan4234@163.com.', 'Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Freshwater Genetics and Breeding, Jinan 250013, China. zhaolijuan4234@163.com.', 'Shandong Provincial Freshwater Aquatic Products Quality Inspection Center, Jinan 250013, China. zhaolijuan4234@163.com.', 'Key Lab of Freshwater Animal Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China. zhaolijuan4234@163.com.', 'Shandong Freshwater Fisheries Research Institute, Jinan 250013, China. luhong.518@163.com.', 'Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Freshwater Genetics and Breeding, Jinan 250013, China. luhong.518@163.com.', 'Shandong Provincial Freshwater Aquatic Products Quality Inspection Center, Jinan 250013, China. luhong.518@163.com.', 'Shandong Freshwater Fisheries Research Institute, Jinan 250013, China. qingleimeng@126.com.', 'Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Freshwater Genetics and Breeding, Jinan 250013, China. qingleimeng@126.com.', 'Shandong Provincial Freshwater Aquatic Products Quality Inspection Center, Jinan 250013, China. qingleimeng@126.com.', 'Shandong Freshwater Fisheries Research Institute, Jinan 250013, China. wangjinfu1978@163.com.', 'Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Freshwater Genetics and Breeding, Jinan 250013, China. wangjinfu1978@163.com.', 'Shandong Provincial Freshwater Aquatic Products Quality Inspection Center, Jinan 250013, China. wangjinfu1978@163.com.', 'Key Lab of Freshwater Animal Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China. wangwm@mail.hzau.edu.cn.', 'Shandong Freshwater Fisheries Research Institute, Jinan 250013, China. jnsyang@163.com.', 'Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Freshwater Genetics and Breeding, Jinan 250013, China. jnsyang@163.com.', 'Shandong Provincial Freshwater Aquatic Products Quality Inspection Center, Jinan 250013, China. jnsyang@163.com.', 'Key Lab of Freshwater Animal Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China. linli@mail.hzau.edu.cn.', 'Department of Aquatic Animal Medicine, College of Fisheries, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China. linli@mail.hzau.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160415,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Carps/*genetics/*microbiology', 'Fish Diseases/*genetics/microbiology', 'Flavobacteriaceae Infections/genetics/*veterinary', 'Flavobacterium/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Liver/metabolism/microbiology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics']",2016/04/20 06:00,2017/01/07 06:00,['2016/04/20 06:00'],"['2016/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/20 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms17040566 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms17040566 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2016 Apr 15;17(4):566. doi: 10.3390/ijms17040566.,10.3390/ijms17040566 [doi] E566 [pii],,,PMC4849022,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Flavobacterium columnare', 'common carp', 'deep sequencing', 'liver', 'miRNA']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite progressive advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of this disease, the outcome for most patients is poor. It is, therefore, necessary to develop more effective treatment strategies. Genetic aberrations affecting kinases have been widely studied in AML; however, the role of phosphatases remains underexplored. Inactivation of the tumor-suppressor protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is frequent in AML patients, making it a promising target for therapy. There are several PP2A inactivating mechanisms reported in this disease. Deregulation or specific post-translational modifications of PP2A subunits have been identified as a cause of PP2A malfunction, which lead to deregulation of proliferation or apoptosis pathways, depending on the subunit affected. Likewise, overexpression of either SET or cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, endogenous inhibitors of PP2A, is a recurrent event in AML that impairs PP2A activity, contributing to leukemogenesis progression. Interestingly, the anticancer activity of several PP2A-activating drugs (PADs) depends on interaction/sequestration of SET. Preclinical studies show that pharmacological restoration of PP2A activity by PADs effectively antagonizes leukemogenesis, and that these drugs have synergistic cytotoxic effects with conventional chemotherapy and kinase inhibitors, opening new possibilities for personalized treatment in AML patients, especially in cases with SET-dependent inactivation of PP2A. Here, we review the role of PP2A as a druggable tumor suppressor in AML.",,"['Arriazu, Elena', 'Pippa, Raffaella', 'Odero, Maria D']","['Arriazu E', 'Pippa R', 'Odero MD']","['Hematology/Oncology Program, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra , Pamplona , Spain.', 'Centre for Gene Regulation and Expression, University of Dundee , Dundee , UK.', 'Hematology/Oncology Program, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain; Department of Biochemistry and Genetics, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain; Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Navarra (IdiSNA), Pamplona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160406,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,2016/04/20 06:00,2016/04/20 06:01,['2016/04/20 06:00'],"['2016/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2016.00078 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2016 Apr 6;6:78. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2016.00078. eCollection 2016.,10.3389/fonc.2016.00078 [doi],,,PMC4822158,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'FTY720', 'OP449', 'PP2A', 'SET']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Human primary NK cells were distributed across a silicon-glass microchip containing 32,400 individual microwells loaded with target cells. Through fluorescence screening and automated image analysis, the numbers of NK and live or dead target cells in each well could be assessed at different time points after initial mixing. Cytotoxicity was also studied by time-lapse live-cell imaging in microwells quantifying the killing potential of individual NK cells. Although most resting NK cells ( approximately 75%) were non-cytotoxic against the leukemia cell line K562, some NK cells were able to kill several (>/=3) target cells within the 12-h long experiment. In addition, the screening approach was adapted to increase the chance to find and evaluate serial killing NK cells. Even if the cytotoxic potential varied between donors, it was evident that a small fraction of highly cytotoxic NK cells were responsible for a substantial portion of the killing. We demonstrate multiple assays where our platform can be used to enumerate and characterize cytotoxic cells, such as NK or T cells.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 11,364 patients who underwent allogeneic peripheral-blood or bone marrow transplantation for acute leukemia between 1997 and 2012. We analyzed the impact of donor and recipient EBV serologic status on overall survival, relapse-free survival, relapse incidence, nonrelapse mortality, and incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allo-HSCT. RESULTS: Patients receiving grafts from EBV-seropositive donors had the same overall survival as patients who received grafts from EBV-seronegative donors (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.12; P = .23). Seropositive donors also had no influence on relapse-free survival (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.11; P = 0.31), relapse incidence (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.12; P = .58), and nonrelapse mortality (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.17; P = .37). However, in univariate analysis, recipients receiving grafts from seropositive donors had a higher risk of chronic GVHD than those with seronegative donors (40.8% v 31.0%, respectively; P < .001; HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.30 to 1.56). When adjusting for confounders, higher risk was identified for both acute and chronic GVHD. In seronegative patients with seropositive donors, the HR for chronic GVHD was 1.30 (95% CI, 1.06 to 1.59; P = .039). In seropositive patients with seropositive donors, the HR was 1.24 (95% CI, 1.07 to 1.45; P = .016) for acute GVHD and 1.43 (95% CI, 1.23 to 1.67; P < .001) for chronic GVHD. Seropositive patients with seronegative donors did not have an increased risk of GVHD. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that donor EBV status significantly influences development of acute and chronic GVHD after allo-HSCT.",['(c) 2016 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Styczynski, Jan', 'Tridello, Gloria', 'Gil, Lidia', 'Ljungman, Per', 'Hoek, Jennifer', 'Iacobelli, Simona', 'Ward, Katherine N', 'Cordonnier, Catherine', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Milpied, Noel', 'Veelken, Hendrik', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim', 'Maertens, Johan', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Cornelissen, Jan', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Daguindau, Etienne', 'Petersen, Eefke', 'Passweg, Jakob', 'Greinix, Hildegard', 'Duarte, Rafael F', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Dreger, Peter', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Cesaro, Simone']","['Styczynski J', 'Tridello G', 'Gil L', 'Ljungman P', 'Hoek J', 'Iacobelli S', 'Ward KN', 'Cordonnier C', 'Einsele H', 'Socie G', 'Milpied N', 'Veelken H', 'Chevallier P', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Maertens J', 'Blaise D', 'Cornelissen J', 'Michallet M', 'Daguindau E', 'Petersen E', 'Passweg J', 'Greinix H', 'Duarte RF', 'Kroger N', 'Dreger P', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A', 'Cesaro S']","['Jan Styczynski, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Bydgoszcz; Lidia Gil, Medical University, Poznan, Poland; Gloria Tridello and Simone Cesaro, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata, Verona; Simona Iacobelli, Universita di Roma ""Tor Vergata"", Roma, Italy; Per Ljungman, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden; Jennifer Hoek, European Bone Marrow Transplantation Group Data Office; Hendrik Veelken, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden; Jan Cornelissen, Erasmus MC-Daniel den Hoed Cancer Centre, Rotterdam; Eefke Petersen, University Medical Centre, Utrecht, the Netherlands; Katherine N.

Using CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of the canonical autophagy-essential gene Atg7, we found that erythroleukemia K562 cells are armed with two sets of autophagic machinery. Alternative mitophagy is functional regardless of whether the canonical autophagic mechanism is intact or disrupted. Although canonical autophagy defects attenuated cell cycling, proliferation and differentiation potential, the leukemia cells retained their abilities for mitochondrial clearance and for maintaining low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis. Treatment with a specific inducer of mitophagy revealed that the canonical autophagy-defective erythroleukemia cells preserved a mitophagic response. Selective induction of mitophagy was associated with the upregulation and localization of RAB9A on the mitochondrial membrane in both wild-type and Atg7(-/-) leukemia cells. When the leukemia cells were treated with the alternative autophagy inhibitor brefeldin A or when the RAB9A was knocked down, this mitophagy was prohibited. This was accompanied by elevated ROS levels and apoptosis as well as reduced DNA damage repair. Therefore, the results suggest that erythroleukemia K562 cells possess an ATG7-independent alternative mitophagic mechanism that functions even when the canonical autophagic process is impaired, thereby maintaining the ability to respond to stresses such as excessive ROS and DNA damage.",,"['Wang, Jian', 'Fang, Yixuan', 'Yan, Lili', 'Yuan, Na', 'Zhang, Suping', 'Xu, Li', 'Nie, Meilan', 'Zhang, Xiaoying', 'Wang, Jianrong']","['Wang J', 'Fang Y', 'Yan L', 'Yuan N', 'Zhang S', 'Xu L', 'Nie M', 'Zhang X', 'Wang J']","['Hematology Center of Cyrus Tang Medical Institute, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Soochow University School of Medicine, Suzhou 215123, China.', 'Hematology Center of Cyrus Tang Medical Institute, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Soochow University School of Medicine, Suzhou 215123, China.', 'Hematology Center of Cyrus Tang Medical Institute, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Soochow University School of Medicine, Suzhou 215123, China.', 'Hematology Center of Cyrus Tang Medical Institute, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Soochow University School of Medicine, Suzhou 215123, China.', 'Hematology Center of Cyrus Tang Medical Institute, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Soochow University School of Medicine, Suzhou 215123, China.', 'Hematology Center of Cyrus Tang Medical Institute, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Soochow University School of Medicine, Suzhou 215123, China.', 'Hematology Center of Cyrus Tang Medical Institute, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Soochow University School of Medicine, Suzhou 215123, China.', 'Hematology Center of Cyrus Tang Medical Institute, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Soochow University School of Medicine, Suzhou 215123, China.', 'Hematology Center of Cyrus Tang Medical Institute, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Soochow University School of Medicine, Suzhou 215123, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160419,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (RAB9A protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rab GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Atg7 protein, human)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Autophagy-Related Protein 7)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 7/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', '*Mitophagy', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'rab GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2016/04/20 06:00,2017/03/14 06:00,['2016/04/20 06:00'],"['2015/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [medline]']","['srep24641 [pii]', '10.1038/srep24641 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Apr 19;6:24641. doi: 10.1038/srep24641.,10.1038/srep24641 [doi],,,PMC4835698,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immune factors are required for muscle regeneration, but chronic inflammation creates a profibrotic milieu that exacerbates disease progression. Osteopontin (OPN) is an immunomodulator highly expressed in dystrophic muscles. Ablation of OPN correlates with reduced fibrosis and improved muscle strength as well as reduced natural killer T (NKT) cell counts. Here, we demonstrate that the improved dystrophic phenotype observed with OPN ablation does not result from reductions in NKT cells. OPN ablation skews macrophage polarization toward a pro-regenerative phenotype by reducing M1 and M2a and increasing M2c subsets. These changes are associated with increased expression of pro-regenerative factors insulin-like growth factor 1, leukemia inhibitory factor, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator. Furthermore, altered macrophage polarization correlated with increases in muscle weight and muscle fiber diameter, resulting in long-term improvements in muscle strength and function in mdx mice. These findings suggest that OPN ablation promotes muscle repair via macrophage secretion of pro-myogenic growth factors.",['(c) 2016 Capote et al.'],"['Capote, Joana', 'Kramerova, Irina', 'Martinez, Leonel', 'Vetrone, Sylvia', 'Barton, Elisabeth R', 'Sweeney, H Lee', 'Miceli, M Carrie', 'Spencer, Melissa J']","['Capote J', 'Kramerova I', 'Martinez L', 'Vetrone S', 'Barton ER', 'Sweeney HL', 'Miceli MC', 'Spencer MJ']","['Department of Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 Molecular, Cellular, and Integrative Physiology Interdepartmental PhD Program, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095.', 'Department of Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 mspencer@mednet.ucla.edu ikramero@ucla.edu.', 'Department of Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095.', 'Department of Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095.', 'Department of Applied Physiology and Kinesiology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610 Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 Center for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095 Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610.', 'Department of Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 Center for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095 Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610 mspencer@mednet.ucla.edu ikramero@ucla.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160418,United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,['106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Polarity', 'Macrophages/cytology/*metabolism/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Muscles/metabolism/pathology/physiology', 'Muscular Dystrophy, Animal/*pathology', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/metabolism/physiology', 'Osteopontin/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Regeneration']",2016/04/20 06:00,2017/05/16 06:00,['2016/04/20 06:00'],"['2015/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['jcb.201510086 [pii]', '10.1083/jcb.201510086 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2016 Apr 25;213(2):275-88. doi: 10.1083/jcb.201510086.

Although complexes (2) and (3) did not exhibit potent cytotoxic activity, HPyCT4BrPh and its gold(III) complex (1) proved to be highly cytotoxic against HL-60 (human promyelocytic leukemia) and THP-1 (human monocytic leukemia) cells, and against MDA-MB 231 and MCF-7 (human breast adenocarcinoma) solid tumor cells. Except for HL-60 cells, upon coordination to gold(III) a 2- to 3-fold increase in the cytotoxic effect was observed. An investigation on the possible biological targets of the gold(III) complex was carried out. Complex (1) but not the free thiosemicarbazone inhibits the enzymatic activity of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). The affinity of 1 for TrxR suggests metal binding to a selenol residue in the active site of the enzyme. While HPyCT4BrPh was inactive, 1 was able to inhibit topoisomerase IB (Topo IB) activity.

Decitabine is a pyrimidine analog incorporated into DNA, where it irreversibly inhibits DNA methyltransferases through covalent adduct formation with the enzyme. The use of decitabine was studied in an open-label, randomized, multicenter phase III study (DACO-016) in patients with newly diagnosed de novo or secondary AML. Decitabine (n = 242) was compared with patient's choice with physician's advice (n = 243) of low-dose cytarabine or supportive care alone. The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival. The median overall survival in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population was 7.7 months among patients treated with decitabine compared with 5.0 months for those in the control arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-1.04; p = .1079). Mature survival data after an additional year of follow-up were consistent with these results, with a median overall survival of 7.7 months in patients treated with decitabine and 5.0 months in the control arm (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68-0.99; p = .0373). Secondary endpoints, including response rates, progression-free survival, and event-free survival, were increased in favor of decitabine when compared with control treatment. The most common adverse drug reactions reported during treatment with decitabine are pyrexia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, nausea, and diarrhea. This paper summarizes the scientific review of the application leading to approval of decitabine in the EU. The detailed scientific assessment report and product information (including the summary of product characteristics) for this product are available on the EMA website (http://www.ema.europa.eu). IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains an area of significant unmet need, especially in older patients. Older patients and those with comorbidities are often considered ineligible for standard induction therapy, and outcome for these patients is poor. Decitabine has favorable effects in terms of overall survival, which were considered clinically meaningful in the context of a manageable toxicity profile and after consideration of the lack of therapeutic alternatives for these patients. Decitabine is widely used in the treatment of AML in patients aged >60 years, as per current guidelines, including the European LeukemiaNet and the U.S. National Cancer Comprehensive Network.",['(c)AlphaMed Press.'],"['Nieto, Maria', 'Demolis, Pierre', 'Behanzin, Eliane', 'Moreau, Alexandre', 'Hudson, Ian', 'Flores, Beatriz', 'Stemplewski, Henry', 'Salmonson, Tomas', 'Gisselbrecht, Christian', 'Bowen, David', 'Pignatti, Francesco']","['Nieto M', 'Demolis P', 'Behanzin E', 'Moreau A', 'Hudson I', 'Flores B', 'Stemplewski H', 'Salmonson T', 'Gisselbrecht C', 'Bowen D', 'Pignatti F']","['European Medicines Agency, London, United Kingdom Maria.NietoGutierrez@ema.europa.eu.', 'French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety, Saint-Denis Cedex, France.', 'French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety, Saint-Denis Cedex, France.', 'French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety, Saint-Denis Cedex, France.', 'Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, London, United Kingdom.', 'Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, London, United Kingdom.', 'Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, London, United Kingdom.', 'Lakemedelsverket, Medical Products Agency, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Hospital Saint Louis, Paris, France.', 'European Medicines Agency, London, United Kingdom.', 'European Medicines Agency, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160418,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Decitabine', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male']",2016/04/20 06:00,2017/11/02 06:00,['2016/04/20 06:00'],"['2015/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['theoncologist.2015-0298 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2015-0298 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2016 Jun;21(6):692-700. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2015-0298.

However, Mog failure has sometimes been observed in patients who have accompanying chemotherapy-associated lymphocytopenia. In this study, we examined whether adoptive transfer of artificial ADCC effector cells combined with Mog would overcome this drawback. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We lentivirally gene-modified peripheral blood T cells from healthy volunteers and ATL patients expressing the affinity-increased chimeric CD16-CD3zeta receptor (cCD16zeta-T cells). Subsequently, we examined the ADCC effect mediated by those cCD16zeta-T cells in the presence of Mog against ATL tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo RESULTS: cCD16zeta-T cells derived from healthy donors killed in vitro Mog-opsonized ATL cell line cells (n = 7) and primary ATL cells (n = 4) depending on both the number of effector cells and the dose of the antibody. cCD16zeta-T cells generated from ATL patients (n = 3) also exerted cytocidal activity in vitro against Mog-opsonized autologous ATL cells. Using both intravenously disseminated model (n = 5) and subcutaneously inoculated model (n = 4), coadministration of Mog and human cCD16zeta-T cells successfully suppressed tumor growth in xenografted immunodeficient mice, and significantly prolonged their survival (P < 0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These data strongly suggest clinical feasibility of the novel combined adoptive immunotherapy using cCD16zeta-T cells and Mog for treatment of aggressive ATL, particularly in patients who are ineligible for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

The function of Aurora B in leukemic cells has made it an important treatment target. In this study, we explored the expressions of Aurora (A, B, and C) kinases in newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients. In addition, we investigated the effects of AZD1152 as a specific inhibitor of Aurora B on cell survival, DNA synthesis, nuclear morphology, apoptosis induction, cell cycle distribution, and gene expression in an APL-derived NB4 cell line. Our results showed that Aurora B was overexpressed in 88 % of APL patients. AZD1152 treatment of NB4 cells led to viability reduction and G2/M arrest followed by an increase in cell size and polyploidy induction. These giant cells showed morphological evidence of mitotic catastrophe. AZD1152 treatment induced activation of G2/M checkpoint which in turn led to transient G2/M arrest in a p21-independent manner. Lack of functional p53 in NB4 cells might provide an opportunity to escape from G2/M block and to endure repeated rounds of replication and polyploidy. Treated cells were probably eliminated via p73-mediated overexpression of BAX, PUMA, and APAF1 and downregulation of survivin and MCL-1. In summary, AZD1152 treatment led to endomitosis and polyploidy in TP53-mutated NB4 cells. These giant polyploid cells might undergo mitotic catastrophe and p73-mediated apoptosis. It seems that induction of polyploidy via AZD1152 could be a novel form of anti-cancer therapy for APL that may be clinically accessible in the near future.",,"['Ghanizadeh-Vesali, Samad', 'Zekri, Ali', 'Zaker, Farhad', 'Zaghal, Azam', 'Yousefi, Meysam', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir', 'Ghaffari, Seyed H']","['Ghanizadeh-Vesali S', 'Zekri A', 'Zaker F', 'Zaghal A', 'Yousefi M', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Ghavamzadeh A', 'Ghaffari SH']","['Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cellular Molecular Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences (IUMS), Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetics and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences (IUMS), Tehran, Iran.', 'Cellular Molecular Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences (IUMS), Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. shghaffari200@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160419,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0', '(2-((3-((4-((5-(2-((3-fluorophenyl)amino)-2-oxoethyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)amino)quina', 'zolin-7-yl)oxy)propyl)(ethyl)amino)ethyl dihydrogen phosphate)', '0 (Organophosphates)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase B)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aurora Kinase B/*antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organophosphates/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2016/04/20 06:00,2017/01/28 06:00,['2016/04/20 06:00'],"['2015/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00277-016-2670-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-016-2670-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2016 Jun;95(7):1031-42. doi: 10.1007/s00277-016-2670-6.

Reaching effective communication is of great importance as it has been linked to a range of improved patient outcomes such as satisfaction, compliance to treatment, perceived quality of life and physical and mental health. To get a better understanding how communication in haematological consultations can be improved, the current study focussed on patients' preferences and perceived performances regarding the communicative behaviour of their health care professional. Secondly, the mediation of an online communication tool for patients was analysed. Within a controlled pre- post-test design, 78 datasets of clinical consultations could be analysed. Patients considered both affective and instrumental communication aspects important. The affective communication behaviour of the health care professional met the patients' pre-visit preferences well. In the information exchange, more variability and discrepancies were found.

To further improve the communication during clinical consultations, health care professionals should inquire about patients' expectations, especially during the exchange of information and advices.

We compared hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) outcomes among pediatric patients who did or did not receive palifermin as a preventive treatment for oral mucositis. Pediatric patients and controls, matched for HCT and donor type, disease, disease status, and age, were selected from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research database and a 1:3 matched cohort analysis was performed. Stratified Cox proportional hazards models were built and propensity score adjustments were used to compare overall and disease-free survival outcomes between palifermin-treated and untreated patients. Three controls were identified for 90% of palifermin recipients. The remaining cases were matched with 2 (8%) controls or 1 (2%) control, for a total of 210 palifermin-treated patients matched with 606 controls. Median follow-up was 31 months in cases and 36 months in controls. Fifty-seven percent of patients underwent allogeneic HCT, mostly for acute leukemia, and 43% underwent autologous HCT, mostly for solid tumors. In univariate analyses, 2-year survival and disease-free survival rates after allogeneic HCT (58% versus 66%, P = .109; 49% versus 60%, P = .06) and after autologous HCT (73% versus 77%, P = .474; 60% versus 64%, P = .637) were similar between palifermin-treated patients and matched controls. In multivariate analysis, palifermin treatment did not significantly increase the risk of mortality (relative risk [RR], 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], .87 to 1.66) or of relapse (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, .78 to 1.62) compared with matched controls. No significant differences in rates of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were observed between palifermin-treated patients and matched controls. Among pediatric patients undergoing HCT, overall survival, disease-free survival, neutrophil recovery, and GVHD rates were similar between palifermin-treated patients and matched controls.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Alloreactive natural killer (NK) cells mediate a potent antileukemic effect and may also enhance engraftment and reduce graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Haploidentical transplantations provide a setting in which NK cell alloreactivity can be manipulated, but they are associated with high rates of GVHD. We performed a phase I study infusing escalating doses of NK cells from an HLA haploidentical-related donor-selected for alloreactivity when possible-as a component of the preparative regimen for allotransplantation from a separate HLA-identical donor. The goal of infusing third-party alloreactive NK cells was to augment the antileukemic effect of the transplantation without worsening GVHD and, thus, improve the overall outcome of hematopoietic transplantation. Twenty-one patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or chronic myelogenous leukemia refractory or beyond first remission received a preparative regimen with busulfan and fludarabine followed by infusion of apheresis-derived, antibody-selected, and IL-2-activated NK cells. Doses were initially based on total nucleated cell (TNC) content and later based on CD56(+) cells to reduce variability. CD56(+) content ranged from .02 to 8.32 x 10(6)/kg. IL-2, .5 x 10(6) units/m(2) subcutaneously was administered daily for 5 days in the final cohort (n = 10). CD3(+) cells in the NK cell product were required to be < 10(5)/kg. Median relapse-free, overall, and GVHD-free/relapse-free survival for all patients enrolled was 102, 233, and 89 days, respectively. Five patients are alive, 5 patients died of transplantation-related causes, and 11 patients died of relapse. Despite the small sample size, survival was highly associated with CD56(+) cells delivered (P = .022) and development of >/= grade 3 GVHD (P = .006). There were nonsignificant trends toward higher survival rates in those receiving NK cells from KIR ligand-mismatched donors and KIR-B haplotype donors. There was no association with disease type, remission at time of transplantation, or KIR content. GVHD was not associated with TNC, CD56(+), or CD3(+) cells infused in the NK cell product or the stem cell product. This trial demonstrates a lack of major toxicity attributable to third-party NK cell infusions delivered in combination with an HLA-compatible allogeneic transplantation. The infusion of haploidentical alloreactive NK cells was well tolerated and did not interfere with engraftment or increase the rate of GVHD after allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation. Durable complete remissions occurred in 5 patients at high risk for disease recurrence. This approach is being further developed in a phase I/II trial with ex vivo-expanded NK cells to increase the NK cell dose with the objective of reducing relapse and improving the outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation for AML/MDS.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Donor-recipient HLA matching considered allele-level matching at HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1. Separate analyses were conducted for 6-7/8 HLA-matched and 3-5/8 HLA-matched transplants because HLA matching confounded KIR-ligand matching (ie, KIR-ligand mismatching was less likely with better HLA matching). All patients received single CB unit and myeloablative conditioning. There were no significant differences in nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse, and overall mortality by KIR-ligand match status. However, among recipients of 3-5/8 HLA-matched transplants, NRM (HR, 2.26; P = .008) and overall mortality (HR, 1.78; P = .008) but not relapse were higher with KIR-ligand mismatched (host-versus-graft direction) compared with KIR-ligand matched transplants. These data do not support selecting CB units based on KIR-ligand match status for transplants mismatched at 1 or 2 HLA loci. Although transplants mismatched at 3 or more HLA loci are not recommended, avoiding KIR-ligand mismatching in this setting lowers mortality risks.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

METHODS: Set within a socio-demographically representative UK population of approximately 4 million, myeloid malignancy data (N=5231 diagnoses) are from an established patient cohort. Information on incidence, survival (relative & overall), transformation/progression, and prevalence is presented for >20 subtypes. RESULTS: The median diagnostic age was 72.4years (InterQuartile Range 61.6-80.2), but there was considerable subtype heterogeneity, particularly among the acute myeloid leukaemias (AML) where medians ranged from 20.3 (IQR 13.9-43.8) for AML 11q23 through to 73.7 (IQR 57.3-79.1) for AML with no recurrent genetic changes. Five-year Relative Survival (RS) estimates varied hugely; from <5% for aggressive entities like therapy-related AML (2.6%, 95% Confidence Interval 0.4-9.0) to >85% for indolent/treatable conditions like chronic myeloid leukaemia (89.8%, 95% CI 84.0-93.6). With a couple of notable exceptions, males experienced higher rates and worse survival than females: the age-standardized incidence rates of several conditions was 2-4 higher in males than females, and the 5-year RS for all subtypes combined was 48.8% (95% CI 46.5-51.2) and 60.4% (95% CI 57.7-62.9) for males and females respectively. During follow-up (potential minimum 2 years and maximum 11years) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) progression to AML ranged from 25% for refractory anaemia with excess blasts through to 5% for refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts: the median interval between MDS and AML diagnosis was 9.0 months (IQR 4.8-17.4months). CONCLUSIONS: The marked incidence and outcome variations seen by subtype, sex and age, confirm the requirement for ""real-world"" longitudinal data to inform aetiological hypotheses, healthcare planning, and future monitoring of therapeutic change. Several challenges for routine cancer registration were identified, including the need to link more effectively to diagnostic and clinical data sources, and to review policies on the recording of progressions and transformations.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

CDKN2A/B is believed to contribute to this chemotherapy resistance. METHODS: To further investigate the association between CDKN2 status and TKI resistance, the prevalence of CDKN2 deletions and its correlation with a variety of clinical features was assessed in 135 Ph-positive ALL patients using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH). RESULTS: Results showed that no difference occurred between patients with CDKN2 deletion (44/135) and wild-type patients in sex, age, and complete remission (CR) rate following induction chemotherapy combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, CDKN2 deletion carriers demonstrated higher white blood cell (WBC) count, enhanced rates of hepatosplenomegaly (P = 0.006), and upregulation of CD20 expression (P = 0.001). Moreover, deletions of CDKN2 resulted in lower rates of complete molecular response (undetectable BCR/ABL), increased cumulative incidence of relapse, short overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) time (P < 0.05) even though these patients received chemotherapy plus TKIs followed by allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT). In the case of 44 patients who presented with CDKN2 deletion, 18 patients were treated with dasatinib treatment, and another 26 patients were treated with imatinib therapy, and our study found that there were no differences associated with OS (P = 0.508) and DFS (P = 0.555) between the two groups.

This disease is known to have a negative impact on dairy cattle production and, because no treatment or vaccine is available, finding a possible genetic solution is important. Our objective was to perform a comprehensive genetic analysis of leukosis incidence in dairy cattle. Data on leukosis occurrence, pedigree and molecular information were combined into multitrait GBLUP models with milk yield (MY) and somatic cell score (SCS) to estimate genetic parameters and to perform whole-genome scans and pathway analysis. Leukosis data were available for 11 554 Holsteins daughters of 3002 sires from 112 herds in 16 US states. Genotypes from a 60K SNP panel were available for 961 of those bulls as well as for 2039 additional bulls. Heritability for leukosis incidence was estimated at about 8%, and the genetic correlations of leukosis disease incidence with MY and SCS were moderate at 0.18 and 0.20 respectively. The genome-wide scan indicated that leukosis is a complex trait, possibly modulated by many genes. The gene set analysis identified many functional terms that showed significant enrichment of genes associated with leukosis. Many of these terms, such as G-Protein Coupled Receptor Signaling Pathway, Regulation of Nucleotide Metabolic Process and different calcium-related processes, are known to be related to retrovirus infection. Overall, our findings contribute to a better understanding of the genetic architecture of this complex disease. The functional categories associated with leukosis may be useful in future studies on fine mapping of genes and development of dairy cattle breeding strategies.",['(c) 2016 Stichting International Foundation for Animal Genetics.'],"['Abdalla, E A', 'Penagaricano, F', 'Byrem, T M', 'Weigel, K A', 'Rosa, G J M']","['Abdalla EA', 'Penagaricano F', 'Byrem TM', 'Weigel KA', 'Rosa GJ']","['Department of Animal Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53705, USA.', 'Department of Animal Science, University of Benghazi, Benghazi, 21861, Libya.', 'Department of Animal Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611, USA.', 'University of Florida Genetics Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611, USA.', 'Antel BioSystems, Inc., Lansing, MI, 48910, USA.', 'Department of Dairy Science, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53706, USA.', 'Department of Animal Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53705, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53706, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160419,England,Anim Genet,Animal genetics,8605704,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle/*genetics', 'Dairying', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Incidence', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Milk', 'Pedigree', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'United States']",2016/04/20 06:00,2017/01/12 06:00,['2016/04/20 06:00'],"['2016/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/age.12438 [doi]'],ppublish,Anim Genet. 2016 Aug;47(4):395-407. doi: 10.1111/age.12438.

In this study, we detected CD25-positive cells in various types of lymphoid tumours in dogs. Immunohistochemical analyses of the tissues from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (n = 6), T-zone lymphoma (TZL) (n = 5), and follicular lymphoma (FL) (n = 2) revealed that cells strongly positive for CD25 were observed generally in accordance with lymphoma cell localization. CD25-positive cells were consistently detected in TZL and FL cases; however, the number of CD25-positive cells was variable among DLBCL cases. Furthermore, we evaluated the rate of CD25-positive cells by flow cytometric analysis in 29 dogs with lymphoid malignancies, including high-grade B-cell lymphoma (n = 17), TZL (n = 5), FL (n = 2), cutaneous lymphoma (n=2), and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (n = 3).

In prognostic analysis of 15 cases with high-grade B-cell lymphoma, the progression-free survival was significantly shorter in CD25-high group than that in CD25-low group.

One-stop hybrid FDG-PET/CT combines the functional and morphologic information, outperforming both, CT and FDG-PET as separate imaging modalities. This has resulted in several recommendations using FDG-PET/CT for staging, restaging, monitoring during therapy, and assessment of treatment response as well as identification of malignant transformation. FDG-PET/CT may obviate the need for a bone marrow biopsy in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. FDG-PET/CT response assessment is recommended for FDG-avid lymphomas, whereas CT-based response evaluation remains important in lymphomas with low or variable FDG avidity. The treatment induced change in metabolic activity allows for assessment of response after completion of therapy as well as prediction of outcome early during therapy. The five-point scale Deauville Criteria allows the assessment of treatment response based on visual FDG-PET analysis. Although the use of FDG-PET/CT for prediction of therapeutic response is promising it should only be conducted in the context of clinical trials. Surveillance FDG-PET/CT after complete remission is discouraged due to the relative high number of false-positive findings, which in turn may result in further unnecessary investigations. Future directions include the use of new PET tracers such as F-18 fluorothymidine (FLT), a surrogate biomarker of cellular proliferation and Ga-68 CXCR4, a chemokine receptor imaging biomarker as well as innovative digital PET/CT and PET/MRI techniques.",['Copyright (c) 2016.

BLV has negative effects on animal health and causes economic losses worldwide. However, epidemiological studies on BLV are relatively unknown in many parts of Asian countries. Thus, this study sought to explore BLV infections in cattle in Thailand to determine the extent of the geographic distribution of BLV and to measure its prevalence rates. For this study, 744 cattle from 11 farms in 9 provinces of Thailand were screened in 2013 and 2014 by ELISA and nested PCR. Of those cattle, 41 BLVs were genetically characterized using 188 BLV gp51 env gene sequences available in GenBank. The BLV prevalence in Thailand was high, ranging from 5.3% to 87.8%, as determined by PCR and 11.0% to 100% as determined by ELISA, according to geographical region. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Thailand BLVs belonged to genotypes 1 and 6 and a new genotype 10, which are sporadically observed across Thailand with a prevalence of 31.7%, 19.5%, and 48.8%, respectively. A significant number of amino acid substitutions were also found in the gp51 sequences, of which unique changes in genotype 10 have not been reported previously. Briefly, the majority of substitutions were confined to CD4+/CD8+ T-cell epitopes, neutralizing domains, and E-D-A epitopes. Those observations indicate that BLV infections in Thailand cattle are prevalent and that the geographic distribution of BLV is dynamic, with a high level of genetic diversity. This distribution implies a long-term BLV infection in cattle populations and the movement of infected cattle. In sum, this study suggests that intensive surveillance and effective prevention strategies are required to determine the prevalence of BLV in Thailand and control continuous infections with BLVs.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Infective complications represent a significant proportion of treatment-related toxicity. The objective of this study was to describe the microbiological aetiology and clinical outcome of episodes of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropaenia in a cohort of children treated for ALL at our institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with ALL were treated with either the HKSGALL93 or the Malaysia-Singapore (Ma-Spore) 2003 chemotherapy protocols. The records of 197 patients who completed the intensive phase of treatment, defined as the period of treatment from induction, central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy to reinduction from June 2000 to January 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: There were a total of 587 episodes of febrile neutropaenia in 197 patients, translating to an overall rate of 2.98 episodes per patient. A causative pathogen was isolated in 22.7% of episodes. An equal proportion of Gram-positive bacteria (36.4%) and Gram-negative bacteria (36.4%) were most frequently isolated followed by viral pathogens (17.4%), fungal pathogens (8.4%) and other bacteria (1.2%). Fungal organisms accounted for a higher proportion of clinically severe episodes of febrile neutropaenia requiring admission to the high-dependency or intensive care unit (23.1%). The overall mortality rate from all episodes was 1.5%. CONCLUSION: Febrile neutropaenia continues to be of concern in ALL patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy. The majority of episodes will not have an identifiable causative organism. Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria were the most common causative pathogens identified. With appropriate antimicrobial therapy and supportive management, the overall risk of mortality from febrile neutropaenia is extremely low.",,"['Lam, Joyce Cm', 'Chai, Jie Yang', 'Wong, Yi Ling', 'Tan, Natalie Wh', 'Ha, Christina Tt', 'Chan, Mei Yoke', 'Tan, Ah Moy']","['Lam JC', 'Chai JY', 'Wong YL', 'Tan NW', 'Ha CT', 'Chan MY', 'Tan AM']","[""Paediatric Haematology/Oncology Service, Department of Paediatric Subspecialties, KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Singapore,Ann Acad Med Singap,"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",7503289,,IM,"['Candidiasis/epidemiology', 'Chemotherapy-Induced Febrile Neutropenia/epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Escherichia coli Infections/epidemiology', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*epidemiology', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Influenza, Human/epidemiology', 'Klebsiella Infections/epidemiology', 'Mycoses/*epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Pseudomonas Infections/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Singapore/epidemiology', 'Staphylococcal Infections/epidemiology', 'Virus Diseases/*epidemiology']",2016/04/20 06:00,2017/02/15 06:00,['2016/04/20 06:00'],"['2016/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/15 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ann Acad Med Singap. 2015 Nov;44(11):530-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In combination with immunofluorescence and Western blotting, we show that these Raman markers reflect the relative changes in the potential biological markers from cell surface antigens, cytoplasmic proteins, and DNA content and correlate with the lymphoblastic B-cell maturation/differentiation stages. Our study demonstrates the potential of this technique for classification of B-leukemia cells into the different differentiation/maturation stages, as well as for the identification of key biochemical changes under chemotherapeutic treatments.

In classic APL harboring PML-RARalpha transcripts, more than 90% of patients can achieve complete remission when treated with ATRA combined with arsenic trioxide chemotherapy. In the last 20 years, more than 10 variant fusion genes have been found and identified in APL patients. These variant APL cases present different clinical phenotypes and treatment outcomes. All variant APL cases show a similar breakpoint within the RARalpha gene, whereas its partner genes are variable. These fusion proteins have the ability to repress rather than activate retinoic targets. These chimeric proteins also possess different molecular characteristics, thereby resulting in variable sensitivities to ATRA and clinical outcomes.

This notion is based on multiple thymus transplantation experiments, where it was shown that thymus-resident cells were rapidly replaced by progenitors migrating from the bone marrow (BM). This substitution occurs even when bone marrow precursors are unable to generate T cells, as in Rag1/2(-) or severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-deficient mice. In contrast, two groups reported that neonatal thymi transplanted into mice that cannot respond to IL-7 harbor populations with extensive capacity to self-renew, which maintain continuous thymocyte generation for several months after surgery. The consequences of this self-renewal capacity differed in these two laboratories. We found that these thymus transplants rapidly reconstitute the full diversity of peripheral T-cell repertoires 1 month after surgery, the earliest time point studied. Moreover, transplantation experiments performed across major histocompatibility barriers show that allogeneic-transplanted thymi are not rejected, and allogeneic cells do not induce graft-versus-host disease, both syngeneic and allogeneic transplants inducing rapid protection from infection. These results indicate a potential use of neonatal thymus transplants to correct T-cell intrinsic deficiencies. The other group observed that continuous thymocyte renewal from BM precursors was fundamental to prevent tumor development. In the absence of this input, thymocytes from the transplanted thymus generated tumors with all the characteristics of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Moreover, they suggested that the absence of BM competition was responsible for the T-ALLs developing in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-X1 patients, deficient in the expression of IL2-Rgammac . These patients were treated with autologous CD34(+) cells transfected with virus vectors expressing gammac in the absence of myeloablation. We here review the potential therapeutic impact of thymus transplantation and compare the results of these two laboratories aiming to find an answer to the 'Dr Jekill versus Mr. Hyde' status of thymus transplantation experiments.",['(c) 2016 The Authors.

Despite this progress, about 15% and 50% of pediatric and adult cases, respectively, show resistance to treatment or relapse with dismal prognosis, calling for further therapeutic investigations. T-ALL is an heterogeneous disease, which presents intrinsic alterations leading to aberrant expression of transcription factors normally involved in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell development and mutations in genes implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and T-cell development. Gene expression profiling allowed the classification of T-ALL into defined molecular subgroups that mostly reflects the stage of their differentiation arrest. So far this knowledge has not translated into novel, targeted therapy. Recent evidence points to the importance of extrinsic signaling cues in controlling the ability of T-ALL to home, survive, and proliferate, thus offering the perspective of new therapeutic options. This review summarizes the present understanding of the interactions between hematopoietic cells and bone marrow/thymic niches during normal hematopoiesis, describes the main signaling pathways implicated in this dialog, and finally highlights how malignant T cells rely on specific niches to maintain their ability to sustain and propagate leukemia.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

A common approach as a complementary treatment is the use of aqueous extracts of Viscum album L. (Santalaceace). The therapeutic activity of these extracts is attributed to Mistletoe lectins which are Ribosome-inactivating proteins type II. Besides these main constituents the extract of Viscum album L. comprises also a mixture of lipophilic ingredients like triterpene acids of the oleanane, lupane and ursane type. However, these constituents are not contained in commercially available aqueous extracts due to their high lipophilicity and insolubility in aqueous extraction media. To understand the impact of the extract ingredients in cancer therapy, the intracellular uptake of the mistletoe lectin I (ML) by cultured tumor cells was investigated in relation to the mistletoe triterpene acids, mainly oleanolic acid. Firstly, these hydrophobic triterpene acids were solubilized using cyclodextrins (""TT"" extract). Afterwards, the uptake of either single compounds (isolated ML and the aqueous ""viscum"" extract) or in combination with the TT extract (ML+TT, viscumTT), was analyzed. The uptake of ML was studied inTHP-1-, HL-60-, 143B- and Ewing TC-71-cells and determined after 30, 60 and 120 minutes by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay which quantifies the A-chain of the hololectin. It could be shown that the intracellular uptake after 120 minutes amounted to 20% in all cell lines after incubation with viscumTT. The studies further revealed that the uptake in THP-1-, HL-60- and Ewing TC-71-cells was independent of the addition of TT extract. Interestingly, the uptake of ML by 143B-cells could only be measured after addition of triterpenes pointing to resistance to mistletoe lectin.",,"['Mulsow, Katharina', 'Enzlein, Thomas', 'Delebinski, Catharina', 'Jaeger, Sebastian', 'Seifert, Georg', 'Melzig, Matthias F']","['Mulsow K', 'Enzlein T', 'Delebinski C', 'Jaeger S', 'Seifert G', 'Melzig MF']","['Institute of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Freie Universitaet Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Mannheim University of Applied Sciences, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Division of Oncology / Haematology, Otto Heubner Centre for Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine (OHC), Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Birken AG, Niefern-Oeschelbronn, Germany.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Division of Oncology / Haematology, Otto Heubner Centre for Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine (OHC), Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Freie Universitaet Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160418,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Plant Lectins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2)', '0 (Toxins, Biological)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (mistletoe lectin I)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Plant Lectins/metabolism', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2/*metabolism', 'Sarcoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Toxins, Biological/*metabolism', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viscum album/*chemistry']",2016/04/19 06:00,2016/09/14 06:00,['2016/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0153825 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-08142 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Apr 18;11(4):e0153825. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0153825. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0153825 [doi],,,PMC4835140,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results indicate that differential expression of alpha-2,3 ST is involved in MDR of CML, and that miR-4701-5p regulates the susceptibility of CML cells to multiple drugs, at least in part, through targeting ST3GAL1.",,"['Li, Yan', 'Luo, Shihua', 'Dong, Weijie', 'Song, Xiaobo', 'Zhou, Huimin', 'Zhao, Lifen', 'Jia, Li']","['Li Y', 'Luo S', 'Dong W', 'Song X', 'Zhou H', 'Zhao L', 'Jia L']","['College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.', 'Department of Traumatology, Shanghai Ruijin Hospital, Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Tromso, Tromso, Norway.', 'Department of Microbiology, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160418,United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (MIRN4701 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.4 (beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics/physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Sialyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/19 06:00,2017/06/22 06:00,['2016/04/19 06:00'],"['2015/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['labinvest201650 [pii]', '10.1038/labinvest.2016.50 [doi]']",ppublish,Lab Invest. 2016 Jul;96(7):731-40. doi: 10.1038/labinvest.2016.50.

To investigate the leukemogenic process, we generated conditional knock-in (cKI) mice for E2A-PBX1, in which E2A-PBX1 is inducibly expressed under the control of the endogenous E2A promoter. Despite the induced expression of E2A-PBX1, no hematopoietic disease was observed, strongly suggesting that additional genetic alterations are required to develop leukemia. To address this possibility, retroviral insertional mutagenesis was used. Virus infection efficiently induced T-cell, B-cell, and biphenotypic ALL in E2A-PBX1 cKI mice. Inverse PCR identified eight retroviral common integration sites, in which enhanced expression was observed in the Gfi1, Mycn, and Pim1 genes. In addition, it is of note that viral integration and overexpression of the Zfp521 gene was detected in one tumor with B-cell lineage; we previously identified Zfp521 as a cooperative gene with E2A-HLF, another E2A-involving fusion gene with B-lineage ALL. The cooperative oncogenicity of E2A-PBX1 with overexpressed Zfp521 in B-cell tumorigenesis was indicated by the finding that E2A-PBX1 cKI, Zfp521 transgenic compound mice developed B-lineage ALL. Moreover, upregulation of ZNF521, the human counterpart of Zfp521, was found in several human leukemic cell lines bearing t(1;19). These results indicate that E2A-PBX1 cooperates with additional gene alterations to develop ALL. Among them, enhanced expression of ZNF521 may play a clinically relevant role in E2A fusion genes to develop B-lineage ALL.","['(c) 2016 The Authors.

Haploidentical transplantation using CD3/CD19 depletion is associated with encouraging results especially in patients in early phase of disease.

More importantly, several analyses were performed to understand the interactions between various polymers and MRP1 at the cellular level. The results showed that the polymers did not show remarkable correlation of MRP1 gene and protein expression, but could decrease intracellular ATP, mitochondrial membrane potential and glutathione levels, which was greatly dependent on the molecular structure of polymers.

However, clinical use is often confounded by toxicity, perhaps due to indiscriminate hyperacetylation of cellular proteins. Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms by which HDACi trigger differentiation, cell cycle arrest, or apoptosis of cancer cells could inform development of more targeted therapies. We used the myelogenous leukemia line K562 as a model of HDACi-induced differentiation to investigate chromatin accessibility (DNase-seq) and expression (RNA-seq) changes associated with this process. RESULTS: We identified several thousand specific regulatory elements [~10 % of total DNase I-hypersensitive (DHS) sites] that become significantly more or less accessible with sodium butyrate or suberanilohydroxamic acid treatment. Most of the differential DHS sites display hallmarks of enhancers, including being enriched for non-promoter regions, associating with nearby gene expression changes, and increasing luciferase reporter expression in K562 cells. Differential DHS sites were enriched for key hematopoietic lineage transcription factor motifs, including SPI1 (PU.1), a known pioneer factor. We found PU.1 increases binding at opened DHS sites with HDACi treatment by ChIP-seq, but PU.1 knockdown by shRNA fails to block the chromatin accessibility and expression changes. A machine-learning approach indicates H3K27me3 initially marks PU.1-bound sites that open with HDACi treatment, suggesting these sites are epigenetically poised. CONCLUSIONS: We find HDACi treatment of K562 cells results in site-specific chromatin remodeling at epigenetically poised regulatory elements. PU.1 shows evidence of a pioneer role in this process by marking poised enhancers but is not required for transcriptional activation.",,"['Frank, Christopher L', 'Manandhar, Dinesh', 'Gordan, Raluca', 'Crawford, Gregory E']","['Frank CL', 'Manandhar D', 'Gordan R', 'Crawford GE']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708 USA ; Center for Genomic and Computational Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708 USA.', 'Center for Genomic and Computational Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708 USA ; Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708 USA.', 'Center for Genomic and Computational Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708 USA ; Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708 USA.', 'Center for Genomic and Computational Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708 USA ; Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708 USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160416,England,Epigenetics Chromatin,Epigenetics & chromatin,101471619,,,,2016/04/19 06:00,2016/04/19 06:01,['2016/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13072-016-0065-5 [doi]', '65 [pii]']",epublish,Epigenetics Chromatin. 2016 Apr 16;9:15. doi: 10.1186/s13072-016-0065-5. eCollection 2016.,10.1186/s13072-016-0065-5 [doi],,,PMC4833939,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acetylation', 'Chromatin accessibility', 'Enhancer', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitor', 'Pioneer factor']","['R01 GM117106/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HG004563/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Wright's staining and alpha-NBE staining were used to observe the differentiation of HL-60 cells after 5 days of 10 mumol/L NSC67657 treatment. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to detect the differentiation and cell cycles. The expressions of mRNA and proteins of ICAT and Wnt signaling pathway-related factors, including beta-catenin, TCF-4, c-myc, cyclin D1 and TCF-1 before and after differentiation, were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: Morphological observation showed that NSC67657 induced monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. At 5 days after 10 mumol/L NSC67657 treatment, the number of CD14(+) HL-60 cells was (94.37+/-2.84)%, significantly higher than the (1.31+/-0.09)% in control group (P<0.01). The flow cytometry assay revealed that NSC67657 induced (76.46+/-2.83)% of G1/G0 phase arrest, significantly higher than that of (59.40+/-5.42)% in the control group (P<0.05), while the S phase cells were of (18.76+/-0.98)%, significantly lower than that of (34.38+/-2.61) % in the control group (P<0.05). The NSC67657 treatment also up-regulated the expression of ICAT mRNA and protein, and down-regulated the expression of beta-catenin mRNA and protin (P<0.01 for all). However, the nuclear expression of beta-catenin was down-regulated (P<0.01). The NSC67657 treatment induced nonsignificant alterations of TCF-4 mRNA, total protein and nuclear protein in the HL-60 cells (P>0.05 for all). The target genes of Wnt signaling pathway, including c-myc, cyclinD1 and TCF-1 mRNA and proteins in the HL-60 cells were significantly down-regulated after NSC67657 treatment (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The new steroidal drug NSC67657 induces monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells, and down-regulates the expression of beta-catenin and target genes of Wnt signaling pathway.

At the whole-genome scale, we identify that miR-23a, -27a and -24 synergistically target multiple members of the oncogenic gp130-JAK1-Stat3 pathway, and thus reinforce their inhibition on the cascade to regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis. Importantly, Ruxolitinib, a JAK1 inhibitor, could rescue the phenotypic changes induced by miR-23a, -27a and -24 inhibitors. Furthermore, miR-23a cluster-mediated-inactivation of the JAK1-Stat3 pathway promotes the expression and activity of GATA1 via inhibiting PU.1, thereby improving erythroid differentiation. Collectively, we reveal an important regulatory circuit comprising GATA1, the miR-23a cluster and gp130-JAK1-Stat3 pathway, that synergistically facilitates apoptosis and erythropoiesis and restrains adverse proliferation, indicating the therapeutic significance of miR-23a, -27a and -24 for AEL treatment.",,"['Su, R', 'Dong, L', 'Zou, D', 'Zhao, H', 'Ren, Y', 'Li, F', 'Yi, P', 'Li, L', 'Zhu, Y', 'Ma, Y', 'Wang, J', 'Wang, F', 'Yu, J']","['Su R', 'Dong L', 'Zou D', 'Zhao H', 'Ren Y', 'Li F', 'Yi P', 'Li L', 'Zhu Y', 'Ma Y', 'Wang J', 'Wang F', 'Yu J']","[""Department of Biochemistry, State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) & Peking Union Medical College (PUMC), Beijing, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Cancer Biology, College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', ""Department of Biochemistry, State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) & Peking Union Medical College (PUMC), Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry, State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) & Peking Union Medical College (PUMC), Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Chongqing Cancer Institute, Chongqing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry, State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) & Peking Union Medical College (PUMC), Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry, State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) & Peking Union Medical College (PUMC), Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry, State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) & Peking Union Medical College (PUMC), Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Daping Hospital, Research Institute of Surgery, Third Millitary Medical Universtiy, Chongqing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Daping Hospital, Research Institute of Surgery, Third Millitary Medical Universtiy, Chongqing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry, State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) & Peking Union Medical College (PUMC), Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry, State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) & Peking Union Medical College (PUMC), Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pathophysiology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) & Peking Union Medical College (PUMC), Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry, State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) & Peking Union Medical College (PUMC), Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry, State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) & Peking Union Medical College (PUMC), Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160418,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (MIRN23a microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN24 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN27 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'Acute erythroleukemia']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down-Regulation', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Multigene Family', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2016/04/19 06:00,2017/09/07 06:00,['2016/04/19 06:00'],"['2015/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc2016127 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2016.127 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2016 Nov 17;35(46):6001-6014. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.127.

Deubiquitinases (DUBs) remove ubiquitin conjugates from diverse substrates; therefore, they are essential regulators of the UPS. DUB inhibitors, especially the inhibitors of proteasomal DUBs are becoming a research hotspot in targeted cancer therapy. Previous studies have shown that metal complexes, such as copper and zinc complexes, can induce cancer cell apoptosis through inhibiting UPS function. Moreover, we have found that copper pyrithione inhibits both 19S proteasome-associated DUBs and 20S proteasome activity with a mechanism distinct from that of the classical 20S proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. In the present study, we reveal that (i) nickel pyrithione complex (NiPT) potently inhibits the UPS via targeting the 19S proteasome-associated DUBs (UCHL5 and USP14), without effecting on the 20S proteasome; (ii) NiPT selectively induces proteasome inhibition and apoptosis in cultured tumor cells and cancer cells from acute myeloid leukemia human patients; and (iii) NiPT inhibits proteasome function and tumor growth in nude mice. This study, for the first time, uncovers a nickel complex as an effective inhibitor of the 19S proteasomal DUBs and suggests a potentially new strategy for cancer treatment.",,"['Zhao, C', 'Chen, X',

Cancer initiating cells also contribute to resistance and relapse from treatments. Here we examined the effects of the MCL-1 inhibitor SC-2001 in killing non melanoma-initiating-cells (bulk of melanoma), and melanoma-initiating-cells (MICs). By itself, SC-2001 significantly kills melanoma cells under monolayer conditions in vitro and in a conventional mouse xenograft model. However, even at high doses (10muM), SC-2001 does not effectively eliminate MICs. In contrast, the combination of SC-2001 with ABT-737 (a BCL-2/BCL-XL/BCL-W inhibitor) significantly decreases ALDH+ cells, disrupts primary spheres, and inhibits the self-renewability of MICs. These results were observed in multiple melanomas, including short term cultures of relapsed tumors from current treatments, independent of the mutation status of BRAF or NRAS. Using a low-cell-number mouse xenograft model, we examined the effects of these treatments on the tumor initiating ability of MIC-enriched cultures. The combination therapy reduces tumor formation significantly compared to either drug alone. Mechanistic studies using shRNA and the CRISPR-Cas9 technology demonstrated that the upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins NOXA and BIM contribute to the combination-induced cell death. These results indicate that the MCL-1 inhibitor SC-2001 combined with ABT-737 is a promising treatment strategy for targeting melanoma.",,"['Mukherjee, Nabanita', 'Lu, Yan', 'Almeida, Adam', 'Lambert, Karoline', 'Shiau, Chung-Wai', 'Su, Jung-Chen', 'Luo, Yuchun', 'Fujita, Mayumi', 'Robinson, William A', 'Robinson, Steven E', 'Norris, David A', 'Shellman, Yiqun G']","['Mukherjee N', 'Lu Y', 'Almeida A', 'Lambert K', 'Shiau CW', 'Su JC', 'Luo Y', 'Fujita M', 'Robinson WA', 'Robinson SE', 'Norris DA', 'Shellman YG']","['University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Department of Dermatology, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Department of Dermatology, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Department of Dermatology, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Department of Dermatology, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Institute of Biopharmaceutical Sciences, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biopharmaceutical Sciences, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Department of Dermatology, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Department of Dermatology, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Department of Dermatology, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Dermatology Section, Denver, CO, USA.', 'University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Department of Dermatology, Aurora, CO, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (SC-2001)', '0 (Sulfonamides)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/genetics/metabolism', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Self Renewal/genetics', 'Cell Survival', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Humans', 'Melanocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Melanoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2016/04/19 06:00,2018/04/24 06:00,['2016/04/19 06:00'],"['2015/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['8695 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.8695 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jul 18;8(29):46801-46817. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.8695.,10.18632/oncotarget.8695 [doi],,,PMC5564524,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['SC-2001', 'cancer stem cells', 'drug-induced cell death', 'melanoma', 'melanoma stem cells']","['I01 BX000141/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'P30 AR057212/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Inspired by the chemical structure of S (-)-oleocanthal, a natural secoiridoid from extra-virgin olive oil with documented anticancer activity against c-Met-dependent malignancies, the research presented herein reports on the discovery of the novel olive-derived homovanillyl sinapate (HVS) as a promising c-Met inhibitor. HVS was distinguished for its remarkable potency against wild-type c-Met and its oncogenic variant in cell-free assays and confirmed by in silico docking studies. Furthermore, HVS substantially impaired the c-Met-mediated growth across a broad spectrum of breast cancer cells, while similar treatment doses had no effect on the non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell growth. In addition, HVS caused a dose-dependent inhibition of HGF-induced, but not epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced, cell scattering in addition to HGF-mediated migration, invasion, and 3-dimensional (3D) proliferation of tumor cell spheroids. HVS treatment effects were mediated via inhibition of ligand-mediated c-Met activation and its downstream mitogenic signaling and blocking molecular mediators involved in cellular motility across different cellular contexts. An interesting feature of HVS is its good selectivity for c-Met and Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ABL1) when profiled against a panel of kinases. Docking studies revealed interactions likely to impart high dual affinity for both ABL1 and c-Met kinases. HVS markedly reduced tumor growth, showed excellent pharmacodynamics, and suppressed cell proliferation and microvessel density in an orthotopic model of triple negative breast cancer. Collectively, the present findings suggested that the oleocanthal-based HVS is a promising c-Met inhibitor lead entity with excellent therapeutic potential to control malignancies with aberrant c-Met activity.",,"['Mohyeldin, Mohamed M', 'Akl, Mohamed R', 'Ebrahim, Hassan Y', 'Dragoi, Ana Maria', 'Dykes, Samantha', 'Cardelli, James A', 'El Sayed, Khalid A']","['Mohyeldin MM', 'Akl MR', 'Ebrahim HY', 'Dragoi AM', 'Dykes S', 'Cardelli JA', 'El Sayed KA']","['Department of Basic Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Louisiana at Monroe, Monroe, Louisiana, USA.', 'Department of Basic Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Louisiana at Monroe, Monroe, Louisiana, USA.', 'Department of Basic Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Louisiana at Monroe, Monroe, Louisiana, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, Louisiana, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, Louisiana, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, Louisiana, USA.', 'Department of Basic Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Louisiana at Monroe, Monroe, Louisiana, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Coumaric Acids)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '68A28V6010 (sinapinic acid)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (MET protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Coumaric Acids/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Male', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Phosphorylation', 'Point Mutation', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Spheroids, Cellular', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Time Factors', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2016/04/19 06:00,2017/12/27 06:00,['2016/04/19 06:00'],"['2015/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/27 06:00 [medline]']","['8681 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.8681 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 May 31;7(22):32247-73. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.8681.,10.18632/oncotarget.8681 [doi],,,PMC5078011,['The authors have no relevant conflicts to disclose.'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['ABL1', 'breast cancer', 'c-Met', 'homovanillyl sinapate', 'olive oil']",['R15 CA167475/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

These vesicles are rapidly released to the supernatant in the form of exosomes upon re-activation of T cells. In this study we have compared for the first time proteomics of exosomes produced by normal human T cell blasts with those produced by tumoral Jurkat cells, with the objective of identify proteins associated with tumoral exosomes that could have a previously unrecognized role in malignancy. We have identified 359 and 418 proteins in exosomes from T cell blasts and Jurkat cells, respectively. Interestingly, only 145 (around a 40%) are common. The major proteins in both cases are actin and tubulin isoforms and the common interaction nodes correspond to these cytoskeleton and related proteins, as well as to ribosomal and mRNA granule proteins. We detected 14 membrane proteins that were especially enriched in exosomes from Jurkat cells as compared with T cell blasts. The most abundant of these proteins was valosin-containing protein (VCP), a membrane ATPase involved in ER homeostasis and ubiquitination. In this work, we also show that leukemic cells are more sensitive to cell death induced by the VCP inhibitor DBeQ than normal T cells.

While miR-320a is reported to be deregulated in many malignancy types, its biological role in multiple myeloma (MM) remains unclear. Here, we observed reduced expression of miR-320a in MM samples and cell lines. Ectopic expression of miR-320a dramatically suppressed cell viability and clonogenicity and induced apoptosis in vitro. Mechanistic investigation led to the identification of Pre-B-cellleukemia transcription factor 3 (PBX3) as a novel and direct downstream target of miR-320a. Interestingly, reintroduction of PBX3 abrogated miR-320a-induced MM cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. In a mouse xenograft model, miR-320a overexpression inhibited tumorigenicity and promoted apoptosis. Our findings collectively indicate that miR-320a inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in MM cells by directly targeting PBX3, supporting its utility as a novel and potential therapeutic agent for miRNA-based MM therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Important biological functions have been attributed to 2 subsets of EV, the exosomes (bud from endosomal membranes) and the microvesicles (MV; bud from plasma membranes). Since both types of particles contain surface proteins derived from their cell of origin, their detection in blood may enable diagnosis and prognosis of disease. We have used an antibody microarray (DotScan) to compare the surface protein profiles of live cancer cells with those of their EV, based on their binding patterns to immobilized antibodies. Initially, EV derived from the cancer cell lines, LIM1215 (colorectal cancer) and MEC1 (B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia; CLL), were used for assay optimization. Biotinylated antibodies specific for EpCAM (CD326) and CD19, respectively, were used to detect captured particles by enhanced chemiluminescence. Subsequently, this approach was used to profile CD19(+) EV from the plasma of CLL patients. These EV expressed a subset (~40%) of the proteins detected on CLL cells from the same patients: moderate or high levels of CD5, CD19, CD31, CD44, CD55, CD62L, CD82, HLA-A,B,C, HLA-DR; low levels of CD21, CD49c, CD63.

Information on DVLs in chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL) is limited. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of DVLs in CLL cells and association with Wnt pathways downstream of ROR1. DVL1, 2 and 3 were exclusively expressed in CLL cells as compared to normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The expression of DVL1 and DVL3 proteins was significantly more pronounced in progressive than in non-progressive disease (p < 0.01), whereas the level of DVL2 was significantly higher in non-progressive as compared to progressive disease (p < 0.001). Treatment of CLL cells with anti-ROR1 specific monoclonal antibodies induced dephosphorylation of ROR1 as well as of tyrosine and serine residues of both DVL2 and DVL3. However, gene silencing of DVLs in the CLL cell line (EHEB) did not induce detectable apoptosis. Non-progressive CLL patients had a different protein activity pattern with regard to Wnt signalling pathway proteins as GSK-3beta, beta-catenin and AKT as compared to progressive disease. The DVL2 protein may play a role in the activation of signalling pathways in CLL during early stages of the disease, while DVL1 and 3 may have a role in later phases of the leukaemia.",,"['Khan, Abdul Salam', 'Hojjat-Farsangi, Mohammad', 'Daneshmanesh, Amir Hossein', 'Hansson, Lotta', 'Kokhaei, Parviz', 'Osterborg, Anders', 'Mellstedt, Hakan', 'Moshfegh, Ali']","['Khan AS', 'Hojjat-Farsangi M', 'Daneshmanesh AH', 'Hansson L', 'Kokhaei P', 'Osterborg A', 'Mellstedt H', 'Moshfegh A']","['Department of Oncology-Pathology, Immune and Gene Therapy Lab, Cancer Center Karolinska (CCK), Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Immune and Gene Therapy Lab, Cancer Center Karolinska (CCK), Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Immune and Gene Therapy Lab, Cancer Center Karolinska (CCK), Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Immune and Gene Therapy Lab, Cancer Center Karolinska (CCK), Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Immune and Gene Therapy Lab, Cancer Center Karolinska (CCK), Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Cancer Research Center and Department of Immunology, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Immune and Gene Therapy Lab, Cancer Center Karolinska (CCK), Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Immune and Gene Therapy Lab, Cancer Center Karolinska (CCK), Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. hakan.mellstedt@karolinska.se.', 'Cancer Centre Karolinska, Department of Oncology, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, SE-171 76, Stockholm, Sweden. hakan.mellstedt@karolinska.se.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Immune and Gene Therapy Lab, Cancer Center Karolinska (CCK), Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160416,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (DVL1 protein, human)', '0 (DVL2 protein, human)', '0 (DVL3 protein, human)', '0 (Dishevelled Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dishevelled Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Up-Regulation', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/genetics', 'beta Catenin/genetics/metabolism']",2016/10/27 06:00,2017/02/17 06:00,['2016/04/18 06:00'],"['2015/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/17 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13277-016-5039-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-016-5039-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2016 Sep;37(9):11947-11957. doi: 10.1007/s13277-016-5039-5.

Its solution behaviour in standard phosphate buffer, at pH 7.4, was investigated spectrophotometrically and found to reproduce quite closely that of cisplatin; indeed, progressive sequential release of the two halide ligands typically occurs as in the case of cisplatin, with a roughly similar kinetics. Afterward, patterns of reactivity toward model proteins and standard ctDNA were explored and the nature of the resulting interactions elucidated. The antiproliferative properties were then evaluated in four representative cancer cell lines, namely A549 (human lung cancer), HCT116 (human colon cancer), IGROV-1 (human ovarian cancer) and FLG 29.1 (human acute myeloid leukaemia).

Diagnosis of pediatric cancer still relies on clinical signs, which sometimes may be non-specific or appear at later stages. Thus, there is a need for a better understanding of molecules that allow a less invasive, early and effective method of cancer diagnosis. Despite the efforts of many researches to set specific miRNAs to be routinely used as diagnostic molecules, no miR has been currently utilized so far. In this study, we review the recent discoveries on circulating miRNAs in blood of patients suffering from the following pediatric cancers: osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilms tumor, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, retinoblastoma and neuroblastoma. We also focus on the roles of circulating miRs in tumorigenesis pathways, the methodological approaches used to detect and quantify circulating miRs, and discuss the challenges in using them routinely as biomarkers for pediatric cancers.",,"['de Carvalho, Ivna Neria Silva Ribamar', 'de Freitas, Renata Mendes', 'Vargas, Fernando Regla']","['de Carvalho IN', 'de Freitas RM', 'Vargas FR']","['Genetics Department, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Birth Defects Epidemiology Laboratory, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Av Brasil 4365, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 21040-360, Brazil.', 'Birth Defects Epidemiology Laboratory, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Av Brasil 4365, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 21040-360, Brazil.', 'Genetics Department, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. fernando.vargas@ioc.fiocruz.br.', 'Birth Defects Epidemiology Laboratory, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Av Brasil 4365, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 21040-360, Brazil. fernando.vargas@ioc.fiocruz.br.', 'Genetics and Molecular Department, Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. fernando.vargas@ioc.fiocruz.br.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20160416,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/*genetics', 'Exosomes/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*blood/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics']",2016/04/18 06:00,2016/12/27 06:00,['2016/04/18 06:00'],"['2016/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12032-016-0766-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s12032-016-0766-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Med Oncol. 2016 May;33(5):49. doi: 10.1007/s12032-016-0766-4.

A total of 609 (74 %) respondents received a TKI <1 year after diagnosis and 665 (81 %) were on a branded TKI. Median TKI therapy duration was 3 years (range <1-13 years). A total of 255 (31 %) respondents had a molecular test every 3 months, and 280 (34 %), every 6 months. Multivariate analyses showed that older age, starting TKI therapy >1 year after diagnosis and generic TKI use were associated with deviation from recommended monitoring frequency (both every 3 months and every 3 or 6 months). In addition, TKI therapy duration >3 years and imatinib use were associated with under-testing every 3 months. Rural household registration was associated with less testing at every 3 or 6 months. The most commonly stated reasons for under-testing were no requirement by physician (60 %), followed by cost (19 %), no necessity (10 %) and no eligible lab nearby (10 %).

Oroxylin A (OA) has showed anticancer effects on other cancer cells. Here, studies were conducted to determine the antileukemia effect of OA on t(8;21)-positive AML cells in vitro and in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of OA on cell viability of t(8;21)-positive Kasumi-1 and primary AML cells were analyzed by MTT assay. Cell differentiation was examined by NBT reduction assay, flow cytometry analysis for CD11b/CD14, and Giemsa stain. Protein expressions were determined by Western blots. Immunofluorescence assay was used to verify the effect of OA on HDAC-1 expression in vivo. Immunohistochemical staining was applied to evaluate leukemic infiltration of AML-bearing NOD/SCID mice. RESULTS: OA enhanced NBT reduction activity and CD11b/CD14 expression of AML1/ETO-positive AML cells markedly. Results of Giemsa staining also demonstrated that OA could induce the morphologic changes with reduction of nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios, suggesting the cell differentiation induced by OA. Further study showed that OA decreased the expression of fusion protein AML1/ETO and down-regulated HDAC-1 protein levels in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, OA increased the expression of differentiation-related proteins C/EBPalpha and P21. Acetylation levels of histones were also advanced obviously after treatment of OA. In vivo study indicated that OA could prolong the survival of AML-bearing NOD/SCID mice and reduce leukocytic infiltration of the spleen.

The aims of this work were to estimate the current prevalence of CML by using routine data and to project future patient numbers in Germany. METHODS: Data were available for about 10.5 million people in the statutory health insurance system in Bavaria for the years 2008-2013. Survival rates were adapted from two recent publications. RESULTS: The mean estimated age-standardized (Old European Standard Population) incidence rates per 100,000 inhabitants were 1.300 and 1.768 for women and men. Based on the population data, we estimated a total number of about 9000 CML patients in Germany for 2012. We expect the number of CML patients to increase further until at least 2040-2050 with a maximum of more than 20,000 CML patients as the most probable scenario. CONCLUSIONS: Using a restrictive definition for case patients, we do not think that there is much overestimation. As a consequence of this considerable increase of the prevalence of CML the burden for the health care system will increase with respect to costs and medical care needed. The procedure presented here allows to estimate the expected number of CML patients in other countries, too.",,"['Lauseker, Michael', 'Gerlach, Roman', 'Tauscher, Martin', 'Hasford, Joerg']","['Lauseker M', 'Gerlach R', 'Tauscher M', 'Hasford J']","['Institute for Medical Information Sciences, Biometry, and Epidemiology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Marchioninistr. 15, 81377, Munich, Germany. lauseker@ibe.med.uni-muenchen.de.', 'Kassenarztliche Vereinigung Bayerns, Munich, Germany.', 'Kassenarztliche Vereinigung Bayerns, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Information Sciences, Biometry, and Epidemiology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Marchioninistr. 15, 81377, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160416,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'Survival Rate']",2016/04/18 06:00,2017/02/18 06:00,['2016/04/18 06:00'],"['2016/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00432-016-2155-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-016-2155-y [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2016 Jul;142(7):1441-7. doi: 10.1007/s00432-016-2155-y.

Although most BLV-infected animals do not develop the disease, they maintain the transmission chain of BLV at the herd level. As a feasible approach to control the virus, selection of cattle carrying the BoLA-DRB3*0902 allele has been proposed, as this allele is strongly associated with a BLV infection profile or the low proviral load (LPL) phenotype. To test whether these cattle affect the BLV transmission chain under natural conditions, selected BLV-infected LPL-BoLA-DRB3*0902 heterozygous cows were incorporated into a BLV-negative dairy herd. An average ratio of 5.4 (range 4.17-6.37) BLV-negative cows per BLV-infected cow was maintained during the 20mo of the experiment, and no BLV-negative cattle became infected. The BLV incidence rate in this herd was thus zero, whereas BLV incidence rates in different local herds varied from 0.06 to 0.17 cases per 100 cattle-days. This finding strongly suggests that LPL-BoLA-DRB3*0902 cattle disrupted the BLV-transmission chain in the study period.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

Unfortunately, currently used ""one-size-fits-all"" chemotherapy regimens result in cure for only a minority of patients. Although progress has been made in identifying subsets of patients who require chemotherapy alone-as compared with those who require initial chemotherapy followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation to maximize the chance for cure-clinical and cytogenetic prognosticators are not sufficiently accurate for such a risk-adapted stratification approach. New molecular technologies have allowed for in-depth molecular analyses of AML patients. These studies have revealed novel mutations, epigenetic changes, and/or aberrant expression levels of protein-coding and noncoding genes involved in leukemogenesis. These molecular aberrations are now being increasingly used not only to select risk-adapted treatment strategies, but also to incorporate newer molecularly targeted agents into conventional chemotherapy and/or transplant treatments. The hope is that this approach will lead to a better selection of ""personalized"" treatments for individual patients at diagnosis, the ability to assess these treatments in real time, and the ability, if necessary, to modify these therapies utilizing molecular endpoints for guidance regarding their antileukemia activity.

Median age was 47 years. The first induction course included fludarabine (Flu) and high-dose cytarabine (Ara-C) plus idarubicin (Ida), with or without gemtuzumab-ozogamicin (GO) 3 mg/m(2) (FLAI-5). Patients achieving complete remission (CR) received a second course without fludarabine but with higher dose of idarubicin. Patients not achieving CR received an intensified second course. Patients not scheduled for early allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (HSCT) where planned to receive at least two courses of consolidation therapy with Ara-C. Our double induction strategy significantly differs from described fludarabine-containing regimens, as patients achieving CR receive a second course without fludarabine, to avoid excess toxicity, and Ara-C consolidation is administrated at the reduced cumulative dose of 8 g/m(2) per cycle. Toxicity is a major concern in fludarabine containing induction, including the recent Medical Research Council AML15 fludarabine, cytarabine, idaraubicin and G-CSF (FLAG-Ida) arm, and, despite higher anti-leukemic efficacy, only a minority of patients is able to complete the full planned program. In this article, we show that our therapeutic program is generally well tolerated, as most patients were able to receive subsequent therapy at full dose and in a timely manner, with a 30-day mortality of 4.8%. The omission of fludarabine in the second course did not reduce efficacy, as a CR rate of 83% was achieved and 3-year disease-free survival and overall survival (OS) were 49.6% and 50.9%, respectively. Our experience shows that FLAI-5/Ara-C + Ida double induction followed by risk-oriented consolidation therapy can result in good overall outcome with acceptable toxicity. Am. J.

The advent of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and its inclusion in combinatorial regimens with anthracycline chemotherapy has provided cure rates exceeding 80%; however, this widely adopted approach also conveys significant toxicity including severe myelosuppression and rare occurrence of secondary leukemias. More recently, the advent of arsenic trioxide (ATO) and its use in association with ATRA with or without chemotherapy has further improved patient outcome by allowing to minimize the intensity of chemotherapy, thus reducing serious toxicity while maintaining high anti-leukemic efficacy. The advantage of ATRA-ATO over ATRA chemotherapy has been recently demonstrated in two large randomized trials and this option has now become the new standard of care in low-risk (i.e. non-hyperleukocytic) patients. In light of its rarity, abrupt onset and high risk of early death and due to specific treatment requirements, APL remains a challenging condition that needs to be managed in highly experienced centers. We review here the results of large clinical studies conducted in newly diagnosed APL as well as the recommendations for appropriate diagnosis, prevention and management of the main complications associated with modern treatment of the disease.","['(c) The Author 2016.

CAR T-cell therapy uses gene transfer technology to reprogram a patient's own T cells to stably express CARs, thereby combining the specificity of an antibody with the potent cytotoxic and memory functions of a T cell. In early-phase clinical trials, CAR T cells targeting CD19 have resulted in sustained complete responses within a population of otherwise refractory patients with B-cell malignancies and, more specifically, have shown complete response rates of approximately 90% in patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Given this clinical efficacy, preclinical development of CAR T-cell therapy for a number of cancer indications has been actively investigated, and the future of the CAR T-cell field is extensive and dynamic. Several approaches to increase the feasibility and safety of CAR T cells are currently being explored, including investigation into the mechanisms regulating the persistence of CAR T cells. In addition, numerous early-phase clinical trials are now investigating CAR T-cell therapy beyond targeting CD19, especially in solid tumors.

In addition, an artificial distinction between AML20-30 and AML30+ was made by regulatory agencies by initially restricting approval of azacitidine to AML20-30. Thus, uncertainty prevails regarding the diagnosis, prognosis and optimal treatment timing and strategy for patients with AML20-30. Here, we aim to provide clarification for patients treated with azacitidine front-line. METHODS: The Austrian Azacitidine Registry is a multicentre database (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01595295). For this analysis, we selected 339 patients treated with azacitidine front-line. According to the WHO classification 53, 96 and 190 patients had MDS-RAEB-I, MDS-RAEB-II and AML (AML20-30: n = 79; AML30+: n = 111), respectively. According to the FAB classification, 131, 101 and 111 patients had MDS-RAEB, MDS-RAEB-t and AML, respectively. RESULTS: The median ages of patients with MDS and AML were 72 (range 37-87) and 77 (range 23-93) years, respectively. Overall, 80 % of classifiable patients (</=30 % bone marrow blasts) had intermediate-2 or high-risk IPSS scores. Most other baseline, treatment and response characteristics were similar between patients diagnosed with MDS or AML. WHO-classified patients with AML20-30 had significantly worse OS than patients with MDS-RAEB-II (13.1 vs 18.9 months; p = 0.010), but similar OS to patients with AML30+ (10.9 vs 13.1 months; p = 0.238). AML patients that showed MDS-related features did not have worse outcomes compared with patients who did not (13.2 vs 8.9 months; p = 0.104). FAB-classified patients with MDS-RAEB-t had similar survival to patients with AML30+ (12.8 vs 10.9 months; p = 0.376), but significantly worse OS than patients with MDS-RAEB (10.9 vs 24.4 months; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate the validity of the WHO classification of MDS and AML, and its superiority over the former FAB classification, for patients treated with azacitidine front-line. Neither bone marrow blast count nor presence of MDS-related features had an adverse prognostic impact on survival. Patients with AML20-30 should therefore be regarded as having 'true AML' and in our opinion treatment should be initiated without delay.",,"['Pleyer, Lisa', 'Burgstaller, Sonja', 'Stauder, Reinhard',

The biological activity of ESAs is mainly regulated by the number of sialic acid-containing carbohydrates on the erythropoietin (EPO) peptide. Sialidase, a sialic acid-metabolizing enzyme that accumulates in CKD patients, is suspected of contributing to shortening the circulation half-life of ESAs. Epoetin beta pegol (continuous erythropoietin receptor activator; C.E.R.A.), is an EPO integrated with methoxypolyethylene glycol (PEG). It has been suggested that C.E.R.A. may exert a favorable therapeutic effect, even under conditions of elevated sialidase; however, no detailed investigation of the pharmacological profile of C.E.R.A. in the presence of sialidase has been reported. In the present study, we injected C.E.R.A. or EPO pre-incubated with sialidase into rats, and assessed the hematopoietic effect by reticulocyte count. The hematopoietic effect of C.E.R.A., but not EPO, was preserved after sialidase treatment, despite the removal of sialic acid.

However, the use of ovarian shielding or non-myeloablative regimens may preserve ovarian function. To evaluate the ovarian reserve, serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels were retrospectively measured in 11 female HSCT recipients aged less than 40 years, including seven with acute leukemia (AL) and four with aplastic anemia (AA), who received a myeloablative conditioning regimen with ovarian shielding or a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen. In most patients, menstruation had stopped and AMH level had decreased to an undetectable level (<0.1 ng/ml) after HSCT. Most patients showed a recovery of regular menstruation, but AMH levels did not increase immediately after the resumption of menstruation. However, in three AL patients and two AA patients who were evaluable for long-term recovery, AMH level increased gradually beyond 1 year after HSCT.

Genetic studies in mice have demonstrated that cell cycle is tightly controlled by the complex interplay between extrinsic cues and intrinsic regulatory pathways involved in HSC self-renewal and differentiation. Deregulation of these cellular programs may transform HSCs or hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) into disease-initiating stem cells, and can result in hematopoietic malignancies such as leukemia. While previous studies have shown roles for some cell cycle regulators and related signaling pathways in HSCs and HPCs, a more complete picture regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying cell cycle regulation in HSCs or HPCs is lacking. Based on accumulated studies in this field, the present review introduces the basic components of the cell cycle machinery and discusses their major cellular networks that regulate the dormancy and cell cycle progression of HSCs.

The objective of the present study was to report the associated diseases during a ten-year clinical-laboratory follow-up in patients with an initial diagnosis of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) of unknown cause. METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal cohort study with a ten-year clinical-laboratory follow-up was conducted. Patients with a history of urticarial plaques of over six weeks presenting as the only clinical symptom were selected. Individuals with other clinical conditions, urticaria of known causes or chronic physical urticaria were excluded. The following tests were initially performed: haemogram, urine type I, stool parasite exam and sedimentation rate. The following exams were ordered during follow-up: PPD; urine culture; serology tests; antithyroid and antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, lupus anticoagulant; thyroid hormones; serum immunoglobulin; paranasal sinus and thorax radiographs; testing for BK and Helicobacter pylori; and prick tests. RESULTS: Infections were diagnosed in 29% of patients (syphilis, parasitosis, H. pylori, urinary infection, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C); autoimmune diseases in 21% (thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome); primary immunodeficiencies in 4% (IgA and IgG2 deficiencies); and chronic myeloid leukaemia in 1%. At ten-years of follow-up, the urticaria diagnosis was CSU of unknown cause in 45% of the cases. CONCLUSION: This ten-year clinical-laboratory follow-up of 100 individuals with chronic urticaria as the initial diagnosis revealed the presence of associated diseases in over half of the cases. The most prevalent diseases were infections and autoimmune diseases besides primary immunodeficiencies and blood diseases.","['Copyright (c) 2016 SEICAP. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

Patients from 106 centres in 21 countries were randomly assigned (1:1, with stratification by Sokal score at diagnosis) using an interactive voice and web response system to receive oral ponatinib (45 mg) or imatinib (400 mg) once daily until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other criteria for withdrawal were met. Eligible patients were at least 18 years of age, within 6 months of diagnosis, and Philadelphia chromosome-positive by cytogenetic assessment, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and had not previously been treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The primary endpoint was major molecular response at 12 months. Patients who remained on study and had molecular assessments at specified timepoints were studied at those timepoints. Safety analyses included all treated patients, as per study protocol. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01650805. FINDINGS: Between Aug 14, 2012, and Oct 9, 2013, 307 patients were randomly assigned to receive ponatinib (n=155) or imatinib (n=152). The trial was terminated early, on Oct 17, 2013, following concerns about vascular adverse events observed in patients given ponatinib in other trials. Trial termination limited assessment of the primary endpoint of major molecular response at 12 months, as only 13 patients in the imatinib group and ten patients in the ponatinib group could be assessed at this timepoint; the proportion of patients achieving a major molecular response at 12 months did not differ significantly between the two groups (eight [80%] of ten patients given ponatinib and five [38%] of 13 patients given imatinib; p=0.074). 11 (7%) of 154 patients given ponatinib and three (2%) of 152 patients given imatinib had arterial occlusive events (p=0.052); arterial occlusive events were designated serious in ten (6%) of 154 patients given ponatinib and in one (1%) of 152 patients given imatinib (p=0.010). The data monitoring committee criterion for risk assessment (significant difference in serious grade 3 or 4 ischaemic events between groups) was not met (five [3%] of 154 vs one [1%] of 152; p=0.21). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events observed in more than 5% of patients in the ponatinib group were increased lipase (22 [14%] of 154 vs three [2%] of 152 with imatinib), thrombocytopenia (19 [12%] of 154 vs ten [7%] of 152 with imatinib), rash (ten [6%] of 154 vs two [1%] of 152 with imatinib). In the imatinib group, grade 3 or 4 adverse events observed in more than 5% of patients were neutropenia (12 [8%] of 152 vs five [3%] of 154 with ponatinib) and thrombocytopenia (ten [7%] of 152 vs 19 [12%] of 154 with ponatinib). Serious adverse events that occurred in three or more patients given ponatinib were pancreatitis (n=5), atrial fibrillation (n=3), and thrombocytopenia (n=3). No serious adverse event occurred in three or more patients given imatinib. INTERPRETATION: The efficacy of ponatinib treatment of newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia compared with imatinib could not be assessed due to trial termination, but preliminary data suggest there might be benefit, although with more arterial occlusive events than with imatinib at the doses studied. Because the EPIC trial was terminated early, efficacy of ponatinib in this setting remains to be established. FUNDING: ARIAD Pharmaceuticals.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was performed to assess residual disease status by flow cytometry immunophenotyping (FCI) methods in patients with MDS or MDS/MPN treated with HMAs, and correlate the findings with clinical response. METHODS: CD34+ myeloid precursors were assessed in 85 patients with MDS and MDS/MPN treated with HMAs using FCI methods. Morphological, cytogenetic and molecular assessments were performed to evaluate the responses. RESULTS: After a median six cycles (3-19) of HMAs, 40 (47%) patients showed haematological improvement, 26 (63%) showed bone marrow (BM) and 20 (39%) cytogenetic response. However, CD34+ myeloid progenitors showed persistent immunophenotypic aberrancies in 72 (85%) patients, indeterminate in four (5%) and negative in nine (10%). Compared with pretreatment BM in a given patient, FCI abnormalities were reduced in 15 (20%) patients, similar in 37 (48%), increased in 15 (20%) and showed antigenic shift in nine (12%). Patients who achieved immunophenotypic improvement had a superior progression-free survival (p=0.031). In the subgroup of patients who underwent haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), 16/19 (84%) patients who had a pre-HSCT positive FCI study became normal. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show the difficulty in eradicating neoplastic myeloid precursors by HMA therapy, thereby resulting in ultimate treatment failure in most patients. Achieving immunophenotypic improvement helps to identify patients who may benefit from continuous HMA treatment. HSCT provides a potential cure for these patients by replenishing BM with normal haematopoietic stem cells.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Current diagnosis is based on detection of Toxoplasma-specific IgM and IgG. In this study, we established and optimized a diagnostic PCR assay for molecular diagnosis of T. gondii in Libya. METHODS: From January to December, 2010, 177 blood and serum samples were collected from suspected patients. This includes: 140 women who have had spontaneous abortions, 26 HIV-positive patients, nine patients with leukemia and lymphoma, and two infants with ocular infection. Samples were screened for anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM antibodies before DNA extraction. The surface antigen gene 2 (SAG2) was targeted in a semi-nested PCR to amplify a 999 bp and a 614 bp fragment in the first and the second run respectively. RESULTS: A total of 54/140 (38.5 %) women who have had spontaneous abortions, 23/26 (88 %) HIV patients, 6/9 (66.6 %) of the leukaemia and lymphoma patients, and one child with ocular infection were seropositive for anti-Toxoplasma IgG and/or IgM. Genomic DNA was extracted from 38 selected seropositive samples. The PCR was sensitive enough to detect DNA concentration of 12 ng/muL. PCR analysis was performed for 38 selected seropositive patients (16 women who have had spontaneous abortions, 15 positive HIV patients, six leukaemia patients and one child with ocular infection). Our designed primers were successfully amplified in 22/38 (57.9 %) samples; 5/12 (35.7 %) from serum and 17/26 (65.8 %) from whole blood samples. All PCR positive samples were IgG-positive except two samples which were IgM and IgG & IgM-positive serum samples respectively. The semi-nested PCR confirmed five more samples. These included two leukaemia and two HIV-positive whole blood samples and one serum sample from an aborted woman. CONCLUSION: The ability of PCR to diagnose active toxoplasmosis is needed in immunocompromised patients and congenital toxoplasmosis cases, especially when serological techniques fail. For the first time in Libya, we established and optimized semi-nested PCR of SAG2 gene. The developed PCR method was able to detect as little as 12 ng/muL of T. gondii DNA and was useful to diagnose the diseases in women who have had spontaneous abortions, HIV-positive patients, patients with leukemia and lymphoma, and infants with ocular infection.",,"['Gashout, Aisha', 'Amro, Ahmad', 'Erhuma, Mabruk', 'Al-Dwibe, Hamida', 'Elmaihub, Eanas', 'Babba, Hamouda', 'Nattah, Nabil', 'Abudher, Abdalhafid']","['Gashout A', 'Amro A', 'Erhuma M', 'Al-Dwibe H', 'Elmaihub E', 'Babba H', 'Nattah N', 'Abudher A']","['Faculty of Medical Technology Pathology Department, University of Tripoli, Tripoli, Libya.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Al-Quds University, Main Campus, Abu Dis, P.O.

The prokaryotic system expressed immunotoxins not only maintained their binding specificity for CD7-positive cells with a Kd of 16.74 nM and 3.6 nM for PG001 and PG002 respectively, but also efficiently promoted antigen-restricted apoptosis of the CD7-positive leukemia cell lines Jurkat and CEM, and primary T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells with an in vitro cytotoxic activity (EC50) in the range of 23-30 pM for PG002.

Owing to the efficient antigen-restricted anti-leukemic activity of PG002, this CD7 nanobody-based immunotoxin exhibited a superior anti-CD7 positive malignancies activity than previously reported immunotoxins, and may represent a promising therapeutic strategy in treating CD7-positive leukemia and lymphoma, which still remain a significant clinical challenge.",,"['Tang, Jinle', 'Li, Jialu', 'Zhu, Xuejun', 'Yu, Yuan', 'Chen, Dan', 'Yuan, Lei', 'Gu, Zhenyang', 'Zhang, Xingding', 'Qi, Lin', 'Gong, Zhishu', 'Jiang, Pengjun', 'Yu, Juhua', 'Meng, Huimin', 'An, Gangli', 'Zheng, Huyong', 'Yang, Lin']","['Tang J', 'Li J', 'Zhu X', 'Yu Y', 'Chen D', 'Yuan L', 'Gu Z', 'Zhang X', 'Qi L', 'Gong Z', 'Jiang P', 'Yu J', 'Meng H', 'An G', 'Zheng H', 'Yang L']","['The Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Soochow University, Suzhou, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'The Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Soochow University, Suzhou, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jiangsu Provincial Traditional Chinese Medical Hospital, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'The Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Soochow University, Suzhou, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Suzhou Cancer Immunotherapy and Diagnosis Engineering Center, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'The Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Soochow University, Suzhou, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Suzhou Cancer Immunotherapy and Diagnosis Engineering Center, Suzhou, China.', 'The Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Suzhou Cancer Immunotherapy and Diagnosis Engineering Center, Suzhou, China.', ""The Medical Group of Zhengzhou First People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."", 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jiangsu Provincial Traditional Chinese Medical Hospital, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jiangsu Provincial Traditional Chinese Medical Hospital, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'The Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Soochow University, Suzhou, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'The Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Soochow University, Suzhou, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", 'The Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Soochow University, Suzhou, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Suzhou Cancer Immunotherapy and Diagnosis Engineering Center, Suzhou, China.', 'The Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Single-Domain Antibodies)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD7', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Single-Domain Antibodies/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2016/04/16 06:00,2018/01/24 06:00,['2016/04/16 06:00'],"['2015/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['8710 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.8710 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jun 7;7(23):34070-83. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.8710.,10.18632/oncotarget.8710 [doi],,,PMC5085138,"['L.

The resistance of leukemia cells to contemporary chemotherapy is one of the most formidable obstacles to treating AML. Combining valproic acid (VPA) with other anti-leukemic agents has previously been noted as a useful and necessary strategy which can be used to specifically induce anticancer gene expression. In the present study, we demonstrated the synergistic antileukemic activities between VPA and cytarabine (AraC) in a retrovirus-mediated murine model with MLL-AF9 leukemia, three leukemia cell lines (THP-1, K562 and HL-60) and seven primary human AML samples. Using RT-qPCR, we noted that the combination of VPA and AraC significantly upregulated Bax expression and led to the arrest of leukemia cell proliferation, sub-G1 DNA accumulation and cell apoptosis, as demonstrated by flow cytometric analysis. Significantly, further experiments revealed that knockdown of Bax expression prevented VPA and AraCinduced cell apoptosis in THP-1 cells. The results of our present study demonstrated the synergistic antileukemic effect of combined VPA and AraC treatment in AML, and thus we suggest that VPA be used an alternative treatment for AML.",,"['Liu, Nan', 'Wang, Chen', 'Wang, Libing', 'Gao, Lei', 'Cheng, Hui', 'Tang, Gusheng', 'Hu, Xiaoxia', 'Wang, Jianmin']","['Liu N', 'Wang C', 'Wang L', 'Gao L', 'Cheng H', 'Tang G', 'Hu X', 'Wang J']","['Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, P.R.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and transcription factors (TFs) are two major regulators of gene expression, which may play important roles in the etiology of AML. However, the global regulation of gene expression in AML, involving miRNAs and TFs, still remains elusive. To characterize the global role of miRNAs and TFs in AML pathogenesis, large scale expression profiling of miRNA and TF was performed using miRNA sequencing and TF array technology, respectively, and validated by qPCR. In the present study, 308 miRNAs and 84 TFs were identified to be differentially expressed (fold-change >/=2.0) in AML samples relative to their controls. After integrating the expression profiling data into bioinformatic analysis, we identified 1,462 miRNA-gene pairs, 982 TF-gene pairs and 296 TF-miRNA pairs. By merging these regulatory relations together, we constructed a comprehensive AML-specific miRNA-TF regulatory network. In this network, we identified 22 hub miRNAs and 11 hub TFs. KEGG pathway analysis showed that the network nodes were significantly enriched in 33 different pathways, of which the AML pathway was the most significant. After analyzing the topology of the subnetwork, we propose that TCF3 was a potential key regulator in this regulatory network. In conclusion, this is the first study perform on global expression profiling of miRNAs and TFs relating to AML.

At the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), we developed the Pediatric Molecular Tumor Board (PMTB) to track, integrate, and interpret clinical genomic profiling and potential targeted therapeutic recommendations. PROCEDURE: This retrospective case series includes all patients reviewed by the MSKCC PMTB from July 2014 to June 2015. Cases were submitted by treating oncologists and potential treatment recommendations were based upon the modified guidelines of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. RESULTS: There were 41 presentations of 39 individual patients during the study period. Gliomas, acute myeloid leukemia, and neuroblastoma were the most commonly reviewed cases. Thirty nine (87%) of the 45 molecular sequencing profiles utilized hybrid-capture targeted genome sequencing. In 30 (73%) of the 41 presentations, the PMTB provided therapeutic recommendations, of which 19 (46%) were implemented. Twenty-one (70%) of the recommendations involved targeted therapies. Three (14%) targeted therapy recommendations had published evidence to support the proposed recommendations (evidence levels 1-2), eight (36%) recommendations had preclinical evidence (level 3), and 11 (50%) recommendations were based upon hypothetical biological rationales (level 4). CONCLUSIONS: The MSKCC PMTB enabled a clinically relevant interpretation of genomic profiling. Effective use of clinical genomics is anticipated to require new and improved tools to ascribe pathogenic significance and therapeutic actionability. The development of specific rule-driven clinical protocols will be needed for the incorporation and evaluation of genomic and molecular profiling in interventional prospective clinical trials.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Ortiz, Michael V', 'Kobos, Rachel', 'Walsh, Michael', 'Slotkin, Emily K', 'Roberts, Stephen', 'Berger, Michael F', 'Hameed, Meera', 'Solit, David', 'Ladanyi, Marc', 'Shukla, Neerav', 'Kentsis, Alex']","['Ortiz MV', 'Kobos R', 'Walsh M', 'Slotkin EK', 'Roberts S', 'Berger MF', 'Hameed M', 'Solit D', 'Ladanyi M', 'Shukla N', 'Kentsis A']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160415,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Precision Medicine/*methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/16 06:00,2017/03/28 06:00,['2016/04/16 06:00'],"['2016/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.26002 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Aug;63(8):1368-74. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26002.

Leukemia stem cells are in a hypoxic condition, which induces the expression of HIF-1alpha. Aberrant activation of HIF-1alpha is implicated in the poor prognosis of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Herein, we investigated the expression of HIF-1alpha in AML and tested 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2) as a candidate HIF-1alpha inhibitor for the treatment of AML. We found that HIF-1alpha was overexpressed in AML. HIF-1alpha suppression by 2ME2 significantly induced apoptosis of AML cells, and it outperformed traditional chemotherapy drugs such as cytarabine. At the same time, 2ME2 downregulated the transcriptional levels of VEGF, GLUT1 and HO-1 in cellular assays. Additionally, 2ME2 displayed antileukemia activity in bone marrow blasts from AML patients, but showed little effect on normal cells. 2ME2-induced activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), which decreased the slight effect of drug on normal cells. Our data show that supression of HIF-1alpha expression significantly reduced the survival of AML cell lines, suggesting that 2ME2 may represent a powerful therapeutic approach for patients with AML.",,"['Zhe, Nana', 'Chen, Shuya', 'Zhou, Zhen', 'Liu, Ping', 'Lin, Xiaojing', 'Yu, Meisheng', 'Cheng, Bingqing', 'Zhang, Yaming', 'Wang, Jishi']","['Zhe N', 'Chen S', 'Zhou Z', 'Liu P', 'Lin X', 'Yu M', 'Cheng B', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang J']","['a Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang, Guizhou , China.', 'a Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang, Guizhou , China.', 'b Department of Pharmacy , Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang , Guizhou , China.', 'a Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang, Guizhou , China.', 'c Department of Pharmacy , Affiliated BaiYun Hospital of Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang , Guizhou , China.', 'a Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang, Guizhou , China.', 'a Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang, Guizhou , China.', 'a Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang, Guizhou , China.', 'a Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang, Guizhou , China.', 'b Department of Pharmacy , Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang , Guizhou , China.', 'd Guizhou Province Laboratory of Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center , Guiyang , Guizhou , China.', 'e Department of Hematology , Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang , Guizhou , China.', 'd Guizhou Province Laboratory of Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center , Guiyang , Guizhou , China.', 'e Department of Hematology , Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang , Guizhou , China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160415,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '6I2QW73SR5 (2-Methoxyestradiol)']",IM,"['2-Methoxyestradiol', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/16 06:00,2017/09/28 06:00,['2016/04/16 06:00'],"['2016/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15384047.2016.1177679 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2016 Jun 2;17(6):625-34. doi: 10.1080/15384047.2016.1177679.

However, its mechanism of action remains to be fully understood. The present study demonstrates the effects of metformin on KB human oral cancer cells and explores the role of myeloid cell leukaemia1 (Mcl1) in metformininduced mitochondriadependent cellular apoptosis. It was demonstrated that metformin exposure caused significant suppression of KB cell proliferation and induced cell death. Furthermore, metformin induced apoptosis through the downregulation of Mcl1 in KB human oral cancer cells, and the overexpression of Mcl1 in metformintreated KB cells significantly increased cell viability. Consistently, Bax and Bim were upregulated in metformintreated cells. The results also reveal that microRNA (miR)26a expression was markedly increased by metformin. Subsequent to enforced miR26a expression in KB cells using miR26a mimics, cell viability and the level of Mcl1 decreased. These results suggest that the antiproliferative effects of metformin in KB cells may result partly from induction of apoptosis by miR-26a-induced downregulation of Mcl-1.",,"['Wang, Fang', 'Xu, Jincheng', 'Liu, Hao', 'Liu, Zhe', 'Xia, Fei']","['Wang F', 'Xu J', 'Liu H', 'Liu Z', 'Xia F']","['Department of Oncology, Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, Anhui 233000, P.R.

A prospective study was conducted between March 2013 and March 2015 at Iakentro, Infertility Treatment Center (Thessaloniki, Greece) and the 3rd Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (Thessaloniki, Greece). The patient group consisted of women diagnosed with infertility, whereas the control group consisted of women who had delivered at least one live newborn (fertile women). An endometrial biopsy was obtained using a Pipelle on day 7 or 8 postovulation, and the expression of LIF and LIFR was assessed by immunohistochemistry in epithelial and stromal cells. Primary outcomes included positive cellular percentage, staining intensity and Hscore. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. Overall, 45 women were included in the present analysis (15 fertile women and 30 infertile women). Mean age was 32.8+/-6.0 years for the fertile group, and 37.6+/-3.7 for the infertile group. LIF and LIFR expression was significantly reduced in the epithelial cells of infertile women (P=0.05 and P=0.006, respectively).

Through positive coping with uncertainty, parents can demonstrate positive psychological changes, including higher adaptability. OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were to measure uncertainty, coping strategies, and growth through uncertainty (GTU) and explore the relationships among them in parents of children with AL in China. Related factors of parental uncertainty were also explored. METHODS: A descriptive and correlative design was used. Ninety-five parents of children with AL participated. Parental uncertainty, coping, and GTU were measured by the translated Chinese versions of scales originally developed by Mishel, McCubbin, and Mishel. RESULTS: Parental uncertainty was found to be prevalent in parents of children with AL in China. It did not have a direct impact on GTU, but rather was mediated through coping. Coping was negatively associated with unpredictability (r = -0.225, P < .05), while positively associated with GTU (r = 0.391, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Through reordering of priorities of life events, parents acquired GTU during the process of their child's illness and treatment. Use of positive coping strategies by parents could help them to manage the stress associated with the unpredictability of child's illness and to promote a healthy maintenance of GTU. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurses could assume a more active role in identifying sources and level of parental uncertainty, encouraging parents to stay optimistic, and promoting change in perceptions of uncertainty from danger to opportunity.",,"['He, Shan', 'You, Li-Ming', 'Zheng, Jing', 'Bi, Yu-Lan']","['He S', 'You LM', 'Zheng J', 'Bi YL']","['Author Affiliations: School of Nursing, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing (Ms He); and School of Nursing (Ms He and Drs You and Zheng) and Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou (Ms Bi), China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Nurs,Cancer nursing,7805358,,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Child', 'China', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology', '*Uncertainty', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/16 06:00,2017/06/06 06:00,['2016/04/16 06:00'],"['2016/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/NCC.0000000000000279 [doi]', '00002820-201605000-00007 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Nurs. 2016 May-Jun;39(3):205-12. doi: 10.1097/NCC.0000000000000279.,10.1097/NCC.0000000000000279 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the functional relevance of many microRNAs in the context of tumor biology remains unclear. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we performed a global loss-of-function screen to simultaneously test the functions of individual microRNAs and protein-coding genes during the growth of a myeloid leukemia cell line. This approach identified evolutionarily conserved human microRNAs that suppress or promote cell growth, revealing that microRNAs are extensively integrated into the molecular networks that control tumor cell physiology. miR-155 was identified as a top microRNA candidate promoting cellular fitness, which we confirmed with two distinct miR-155-targeting CRISPR-Cas9 lentiviral constructs. Further, we performed anti-correlation functional profiling to predict relevant microRNA-tumor suppressor gene or microRNA-oncogene interactions in these cells. This analysis identified miR-150 targeting of p53, a connection that was experimentally validated.

In the present work two existing feature selection/extraction algorithms, namely independent component analysis (ICA) and fuzzy backward feature elimination (FBFE) are used which is a new combination of selection/extraction. The main objective of this paper is to select the independent components of the DNA microarray data using FBFE to improve the performance of support vector machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) classifier, while making the computational expenses affordable. To show the validity of the proposed method, it is applied to reduce the number of genes for five DNA microarray datasets namely; colon cancer, acute leukemia, prostate cancer, lung cancer II, and high-grade glioma. Now these datasets are then classified using SVM and NB classifiers. Experimental results on these five microarray datasets demonstrate that gene selected by proposed approach, effectively improve the performance of SVM and NB classifiers in terms of classification accuracy. We compare our proposed method with principal component analysis (PCA) as a standard extraction algorithm and find that the proposed method can obtain better classification accuracy, using SVM and NB classifiers with a smaller number of selected genes than the PCA. The curve between the average error rate and number of genes with each dataset represents the selection of required number of genes for the highest accuracy with our proposed method for both the classifiers.

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is among the most common, but it is currently incurable. It is characterized by the progressive death of photoreceptor cells, eventually leading to blindness. Neurotrophic factors play an important role in such retinopathies, and much research has been performed on their use as treatments. Our group previously demonstrated the ability of the synthetic progestin norgestrel to rescue photoreceptors from cell death, the mechanism of which is believed to include upregulation of the neurotrophic factor basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the protection provided by norgestrel is likely to be mediated by other neurotrophins. METHODS: The 661W photoreceptor cells and retinal explants from P30 to P40 wild-type (wt) C57BL/6 mice were treated with norgestrel over time. Homozygous rd10/rd10 mice that mimic the human form of RP were fed either a control or a norgestrel-containing diet. Changes in neurotrophic factor expression in response to norgestrel were detected with real-time PCR, western blotting, or immunofluorescence staining. Using specific siRNA, leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif) expression was knocked down in 661W photoreceptor cells that were stressed by serum starvation. Cells were treated with norgestrel followed by measurement of cell viability with (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tet razolium) (MTS) assay. RESULTS: LIF, a potent neuroprotective cytokine, was found to be upregulated in response to norgestrel in vitro and in vivo. Upregulation of LIF in degenerating rd10 retinas coincided with preservation of the photoreceptor layer. We also found LIF was necessary for the norgestrel-mediated rescue of stressed photoreceptor cells from cell death in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: LIF was upregulated in response to norgestrel in all models studied and is necessary for the protective effects of norgestrel in vitro. The increase in LIF expression in rd10 mice undergoing retinal degeneration was concurrent with rescue of the photoreceptor cell layer. These results highlight the ability of norgestrel to induce prosurvival molecules in the compromised retina, underlining norgestrel's potential as a viable drug for treatment of RP.",,"['Byrne, Ashleigh M', 'Roche, Sarah L', 'Ruiz-Lopez, Ana M', 'Jackson, Alice C Wyse', 'Cotter, Thomas G']","['Byrne AM', 'Roche SL', 'Ruiz-Lopez AM', 'Jackson AC', 'Cotter TG']","['Cell Development and Disease Laboratory, Biochemistry Department, Biosciences Institute, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.', 'Cell Development and Disease Laboratory, Biochemistry Department, Biosciences Institute, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.', 'Cell Development and Disease Laboratory, Biochemistry Department, Biosciences Institute, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.', 'Cell Development and Disease Laboratory, Biochemistry Department, Biosciences Institute, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.', 'Cell Development and Disease Laboratory, Biochemistry Department, Biosciences Institute, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160325,United States,Mol Vis,Molecular vision,9605351,"['0 (Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '3J8Q1747Z2 (Norgestrel)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Diet', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Norgestrel/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Photoreceptor Cells, Vertebrate/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retinitis Pigmentosa/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2016/04/16 06:00,2016/11/09 06:00,['2016/04/16 06:00'],"['2015/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/09 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Mol Vis. 2016 Mar 25;22:264-74. eCollection 2016.,,,,PMC4812511,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Azacitidine is an important new therapy in high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia but its role in patients who relapse post allograft has not been defined. We studied the tolerability and activity of azacitidine in 181 patients who relapsed after an allograft for acute myeloid leukemia (n=116) or myelodysplastic syndromes (n=65). Sixty-nine patients received additional donor lymphocyte infusions. Forty-six of 157 (25%) assessable patients responded to azacitidine therapy: 24 (15%) achieved a complete remission and 22 a partial remission. Response rates were higher in patients transplanted in complete remission (P=0.04) and those transplanted for myelodysplastic syndromes (P=0.023). In patients who achieved a complete remission, the 2-year overall survival was 48% versus 12% for the whole population. Overall survival was determined by time to relapse post transplant more than six months (P=0.001) and percentage of blasts in the bone marrow at time of relapse (P=0.01). The concurrent administration of donor lymphocyte infusion did not improve either response rates or overall survival in patients treated with azacitidine. An azacitidine relapse prognostic score was developed which predicted 2-year overall survival ranging from 3%-37% (P=0.00001).

We previously introduced a strategy of sequential intensified conditioning and early rapid immunosupressant withdrawal for refractory leukemia undergoing allo-HSCT, with 5-year overall survival (OS) and 3-year relapse rate of 44.6% and 33.3%. To reduce leukemia relapse, prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) was administered based on our historical strategy. A total of 153 refractory advanced acute leukemia patients were enrolled in this prospective study. According to the availability of donor lymphocytes and the criteria for DLI, 144 patients surviving day +60 were divided into two groups (80 DLI versus 64 non-DLI). The relapse rate was less and OS was better in patients receiving DLI than in those not receiving DLI (22.7% vs 33.9%, P=0.048; 58.1% vs 54.9%, P=0.043). The non-relapse mortality (NRM) was similar between DLI and non-DLI groups (P=0.104). Overall, the 5-year overall and disease-free survival post-transplantation were 51.1%+/-5.7% and 49.2%+/-5.3%. The 5-year relapse rate and NRM were 27.3%+/-4.4% and 29.7%+/-5.3%. Multivariate analysis revealed that lower bone marrow blasts on day 0, DLI and chronic graft-versus-host disease were associated with less relapse and better OS.

Nationwide population-based registers were used to identify patients diagnosed with CML in Sweden 2002-2012 and to estimate the prevalence of other malignancies, AD and CID prior to their CML diagnosis. For each patient with CML, five matched controls were selected from the general population. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR). Nine hundred and eighty-four CML patients were assessed, representing more than 45 000 person-years of follow-up. Compared with matched controls, the prevalence of prior malignancies and AD was elevated in CML patients: OR 1.47 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-1.82) and 1.55 (95% CI 1.21-1.98), respectively.

Findings from single-arm studies suggest that addition of rituximab to these regimens could improve patient outcomes. Our objective was to test this possibility in a randomised trial. METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients older than 18 years with untreated HIV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma (including Burkitt's leukaemia) from 45 haematological centres in France. Exclusion criteria were contraindications to any drug included in the chemotherapy regimens, any serious comorbidity, poor renal (creatinine concentration >150 mumol/L) or hepatic (cirrhosis or previous hepatitis B or C) function, pregnancy, and any history of cancer except for non-melanoma skin tumours or stage 0 (in situ) cervical carcinoma. Patients were stratified into two groups based on disease extension (absence [group B] or presence [group C] of bone marrow or central nervous system involvement). Patients were further stratified in group C according to age (<40 years, 40-60 years, and >60 years) and central nervous system involvement. Participants were randomly assigned in each group to either intravenous rituximab injections and chemotherapy (lymphome malin B [LMB]) or chemotherapy alone by the Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes de l'Adulte datacentre. Randomisation was stratified by treatment group and centre using computer-assisted permuted-block randomisation (block size of four; allocation ratio 1:1). We gave rituximab (375 mg/m(2)) on day 1 and day 6 during the first two courses of chemotherapy (total of four infusions). The primary endpoint is 3 year event-free survival (EFS). We analysed all patients who had data available according to their originally assigned group. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00180882. RESULTS: Between Oct 14, 2004, and Sept 7, 2010, we randomly allocated 260 patients to rituximab or no rituximab (group B 124 patients [64 no rituximab; 60 rituximab]; group C 136 patients [66 no rituximab; 70 rituximab]). With a median follow-up of 38 months (IQR 24-59), patients in the rituximab group achieved better 3 year EFS (75% [95% CI 66-82]) than did those in the no rituximab group (62% [53-70]; log-rank p stratified by treatment group=0.024). The hazard ratio estimated with a Cox model stratified by treatment group, assuming proportionality, was 0.59 for EFS (95% CI 0.38-0.94; p=0.025). Adverse events did not differ between the two treatment groups. The most common adverse events were infectious (grade 3-4 in 137 [17%] treatment cycles in the rituximab group vs 115 [15%] in the no rituximab group) and haematological (mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia of 3.31 days per cycle [95% CI 3.01-3.61] vs 3.38 days per cycle [3.05-3.70]) events. INTERPRETATION: Addition of rituximab to a short intensive chemotherapy programme improves EFS in adults with Burkitt's leukaemia or lymphoma.

Whether GABA may be involved with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is unclear. Therefore, the goal of this report was to examine if GABAergic signaling expression is altered in bone marrow lymphocytes of ALL children. RT-PCR and western blot analysis were used to examine the expression of the GABA synthetizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) isoforms (GAD65 and GAD67), and type-A GABA receptor (GABAAR) subunits [alpha(1-6), beta(1-3), gamma(1-3), delta, epsilon, theta, pi, and rho(1-3)] in bone marrow lymphocytes of 19 ALL children before chemotherapy. The data obtained were compared with those in 13 age-matched non-ALL children. Immunofluorescent staining was used to examine the cellular localization of GAD. We found that GAD and GABAAR subunits were expressed in bone marrow lymphocytes of ALL children. Moreover, RT-PCR and western blot showed that GAD and several GABAAR subunits were significantly increased in ALL children as compared with the data of non-ALL children. Our present study reveals up-regulation of GABAergic signaling events in bone marrow lymphocytes in ALL children.

We have previously observed that conservative valine-to-isoleucine amino acid substitutions in a conserved stretch of hydrophobic amino acids have a profound effect on Myb activity. Here, we have explored the function of the hydrophobic region as a mediator of protein-protein interactions. We show that the hydrophobic region facilitates Myb self-interaction and binding of the histone acetyl transferase Tip60, a previously identified Myb interacting protein. We show that these interactions are affected by the valine-to-isoleucine amino acid substitutions and suppress Myb activity by interfering with the interaction of Myb and the KIX domain of p300. Taken together, our work identifies the hydrophobic region in the Myb transactivation domain as a binding site for homo- and heteromeric protein interactions and leads to a picture of the c-Myb transactivation domain as a composite protein binding region that facilitates interdependent protein-protein interactions of Myb with regulatory proteins.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The transcriptional repressor growth factor independence 1 (GFI1) regulates hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal and differentiation. A single-nucleotide polymorphism of GFI1 (rs34631763) generates a protein with an asparagine (N) instead of a serine (S) at position 36 (GFI1(36N)) and has a prevalence of 3%-5% among Caucasians. Because GFI1 regulates myeloid development, we examined the role of GFI1(36N) on the course of MDS disease. To this end, we determined allele frequencies of GFI1(36N) in four independent MDS cohorts from the Netherlands and Belgium, Germany, the ICGC consortium, and the United States. The GFI1(36N) allele frequency in the 723 MDS patients genotyped ranged between 9% and 12%. GFI1(36N) was an independent adverse prognostic factor for overall survival, acute myeloid leukemia-free survival, and event-free survival in a univariate analysis. After adjustment for age, bone marrow blast percentage, IPSS score, mutational status, and cytogenetic findings, GFI1(36N) remained an independent adverse prognostic marker. GFI1(36S) homozygous patients exhibited a sustained response to treatment with hypomethylating agents, whereas GFI1(36N) patients had a poor sustained response to this therapy.

METHODS: We utilized the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) 9 database to identify 104 cases of sAML. RESULTS: Patients with sAML (median age: 47 years; 82% <60 years) were significantly younger than de novo AML cases (66 years; p < 0.01). sAML had worse overall survival (OS) than de novo AML (p < 0.01). OS was better in younger patients and in more recent years. CONCLUSION: Older patients with sAML have a dismal OS and should be enrolled in trials of novel therapies.

Serum TK1 activity has been used for prognosis and monitoring of leukemia and lymphoma patients for many years. Here, we describe the first clinical results with the newly developed TK 210 ELISA from AroCell AB. Sera from 124 breast cancer patients with known TNM classification along with sera from 53 healthy females were analyzed by TK 210 ELISA for TK1 protein and TK1 activity levels by the (3)[H]-deoxythymidine (dThd) phosphorylation assay. The limit of detection for the TK 210 ELISA was 0.17 ng/ml, and 60 % of the sera from female blood donors were below this value. The median TK1 levels found in sera from breast cancer patients with T1 to T4 stage disease were 0.31, 0.46, 0.47, and 0.55 ng/ml, and these levels significantly differed from healthy controls. The median values of the biomarker CA 15-3 were also increased in patient sera from T1 to T4 patients (16, 34, 36, 40 U/ml, respectively). TK 210 ELISA showed significantly higher sensitivity for the T1 and T2 breast cancer patients compared to the TK activity assay. The combination of the TK1 ELISA and CA 15-3 biomarkers demonstrated a significant increase in sensitivity up to 15 % compared to each marker alone. This evaluation of the TK 210 ELISA strongly suggests that it can provide independent and complementary information for patients with breast cancer.",,"['Kumar, J Kiran', 'Aronsson, A C', 'Pilko, G', 'Zupan, M', 'Kumer, K', 'Fabjan, T', 'Osredkar, J', 'Eriksson, S']","['Kumar JK', 'Aronsson AC', 'Pilko G', 'Zupan M', 'Kumer K', 'Fabjan T', 'Osredkar J', 'Eriksson S']","['Department of Anatomy, Physiology and Biochemistry, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, VHC, PO Box 7011, SE 75007, Uppsala, Sweden.

METHODS: Totally 46 elderly AML patients were assigned to the treatment group (24 cases; treated with MSBD + CAG) and the control group (22 cases; treated with CAG + placebos of Chinese medicine) according to random digit table. The therapeutic course of CM placebo or MSBD was 21 days. The clinical efficacy and adverse reactions were observed. Meanwhile, physical state (ECOG Score), transfusion dependency, and TCM syndrome score were compared before and after treatment. RESULTS: (1) The complete remission rate was 54% (13/24) and the objective response rate (ORR) was 71% (17/24) in the treatment group, obviously higher than those of the control group [36% (8/22); 54% (13/24)], with statistical difference (P = 0.036, 0.042). When comparing the efficacy based on risk level, the moderate and poor ORR was 71% (10/14) and 67% (6/9) in the treatment group, and 57% (8/14) and 33% (2/6) in the control group, with statistical difference between the two groups (P = 0.048; P = 0.010). (2) Compared with before treatment in the same group, the ECOG score significantly decreased, the average infusion time of red cells and platelets were markedly prolonged in the treatment group after treatment (P < 0.05).

Here, we searched for novel biomarker proteins in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that can impact diagnosis, treatment and prognosis by comparing the protein expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CLL patients and healthy donors using specific antibodies, mass spectrometry and binary logistic regression analyses and other bioinformatics tools. Mass spectrometry (LC-HR-MS/MS) analysis identified 1,360 proteins whose expression levels were modified in CLL-derived lymphocytes. Some of these proteins were previously connected to different cancer types, including CLL, while four other highly expressed proteins were not previously reported to be associated with cancer, and here, for the first time, DDX46 and AK3 are linked to CLL. Down-regulation expression of two of these proteins resulted in cell growth inhibition. High DDX46 expression levels were associated with shorter survival of CLL patients and thus can serve as a prognosis marker. The proteins with modified expression include proteins involved in RNA splicing and translation and particularly mitochondrial proteins involved in apoptosis and metabolism. Thus, we focused on several metabolism- and apoptosis-modulating proteins, particularly on the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), regulating both metabolism and apoptosis. Expression levels of Bcl-2, VDAC1, MAVS, AIF and SMAC/Diablo were markedly increased in CLL-derived lymphocytes. VDAC1 levels were highly correlated with the amount of CLL-cancerous CD19+/CD5+ cells and with the levels of all other apoptosis-modulating proteins tested. Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated the ability to predict probability of disease with over 90% accuracy.

They are key players in the innate immune system and play major roles in cancer biology. Neutrophils have been proposed as key mediators of malignant transformation, tumor progression, angiogenesis and in the modulation of the antitumor immunity; through their release of soluble factors or their interaction with tumor cells. To characterize the specific functions of neutrophils, a fast and reliable method is coveted for in vitro isolation of neutrophils from human blood. Here, a density gradient separation method is demonstrated to isolate neutrophils as well as mononuclear cells from the blood. The procedure consists of layering the density gradient solution such as Ficoll carefully above the diluted blood obtained from patients diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), followed by centrifugation, isolation of mononuclear layer, separation of neutrophils from RBCsby dextran then lysis of residual erythrocytes. This method has been shown to isolate neutrophils >/= 90 % pure. To mimic the tumor microenvironment, 3-dimensional (3D) experiments were performed using basement membrane matrix such as Matrigel. Given the short half-life of neutrophils in vitro, 3D experiments with fresh human neutrophils cannot be performed. For this reason promyelocytic HL60 cells are differentiated along the granulocytic pathway using the differentiation inducers dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and retinoic acid (RA). The aim of our experiments is to study the role of neutrophils on the sensitivity of lymphoma cells to anti-lymphoma agents.

Alterations in histone methylation lead to aberrant silencing of expression of multiple genes involved in tumor suppression and cell cycling, resulting in myeloid maturation arrest and proliferation of early myeloid progenitors. One promising approach targeting chromatin regulatory proteins is inhibition of lysine specific demethylase-1 (LSD1), an enzyme responsible for demethylation of histone H3 as well as other functions AREAS COVERED: Available literature on LSD1 in normal and malignant hematopoiesis was identified in PubMed and reviewed. Areas addressed here include the biology of LSD1, pharmacologic inhibitors, and preclinical data supporting the rationale for LSD1 inhibition in AML therapy. EXPERT OPINION: LSD1 inhibitors represent a promising novel epigenetic approach for AML therapy. Preclinical studies have revealed that pharmacologic LD1 inhibitors function primarily by altering stem cell programs and restoring myeloid differentiation to AML cells. These effects are markedly enhanced in combination with trans-retinoic acid or histone deacetylase inhibitors with little toxicity. Currently, multiple oral LSD1 inhibitors are undergoing phase 1 investigation in patients with AML. The results of these clinical trials are eagerly awaited.",,"['Przespolewski, Amanda', 'Wang, Eunice S']","['Przespolewski A', 'Wang ES']","['a Department of Medicine , Roswell Park Cancer Institute , Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo , NY , USA.', 'a Department of Medicine , Roswell Park Cancer Institute , Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo , NY , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160421,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histones)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.5.- (KDM1A protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Design', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Histone Demethylases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology']",2016/04/15 06:00,2017/03/11 06:00,['2016/04/15 06:00'],"['2016/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/13543784.2016.1175432 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2016 Jul;25(7):771-80. doi: 10.1080/13543784.2016.1175432.

METHODS: Thirty six newly diagnosed patients with MDS were studied for parameters of iron metabolism in addition to C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene. RESULTS: Mutations were present in 11 out of 36 patients (31%), which were not different from our general population and were equally distributed among MDS subtypes. Mutated patients had higher ferritin levels (P = 0.039) and lower TIBC (P = 0.018). Ferritin was found to be higher for the untransfused mutated patients (P = 0.017), but not for transfusion-dependent patients in whom ferritin levels correlated significantly with the number of blood units received (P = 0.04). There was no difference in the number of blood units received between the mutated and wild type patients. A new observation made was that the mutated patients had a lower overall survival in addition to a poorer leukemia free survival (LFS) (P = 0.004 and P = 0.003, respectively). DISCUSSION: The HFE gene mutations are not more frequent in MDS patients. Iron overload in mutated patients was higher but there was no correlation found using supportive therapy for anemia. The effect of mutations on survival could be mediated by changes in iron metabolism. CONCLUSION: The HFE genotype may predict MDS prognosis and there is a need for further studies.

In this study, we also demonstrated that acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients not only had elevated CD34+ cell count, but also had some clinical features. METHODS: Fifty APL patients and 19 healthy volunteers were included in the study. The enumeration of circulating CD34+ cells, cytogenetic subgroup, immunophenotype analysis, and leukemic-related gene mutation detection were performed. RESULTS: Some APL patients with higher count of CD34+ cells (</=10 x 10(6)/l) usually possessed one or more poor prognostic factors (higher WBCs count, PML/RARa gene complex fusion, chemotherapy-related APL, normal karyotype/complex karyotype abnormalities, CD56/CD34 antigen positive expression, FLT3-ITD positive mutation, myelofibrosis, and marrow necrosis). A cut-off value of 10 x 10(6)/l CD34+ cells may have the power to distinguish APL patients with above adverse clinical prognostic factor from other APL subjects. CONCLUSION: The circulating CD34+ cell count appears to increase in some APL patients and a higher CD34+ cell count may be indicative of inferior survival and serve as an adverse biomarker for APL.",,"['Zeng, Hui', 'Yin, Ling-Di', 'Li, Ping', 'Yuan, Yan-Hui', 'Guan, Chao-Yang', 'Xie, Ting', 'Zhang, Qi-Guo']","['Zeng H', 'Yin LD', 'Li P', 'Yuan YH', 'Guan CY', 'Xie T', 'Zhang QG']","['a Department of Hematology , Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing 210008 , China.', 'b First School of Clinical Medicine, Nanjing Medical University , Nanjing 210029 , China.', 'a Department of Hematology , Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing 210008 , China.', 'a Department of Hematology , Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing 210008 , China.', 'a Department of Hematology , Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing 210008 , China.', 'a Department of Hematology , Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing 210008 , China.', 'a Department of Hematology , Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing 210008 , China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160331,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*blood/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*blood/genetics', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/15 06:00,2017/04/12 06:00,['2016/04/15 06:00'],"['2016/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/10245332.2016.1150410 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2016 Oct;21(9):513-9. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2016.1150410.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of clinical heterogeneous disorders characterized by bone marrow failure and dysplasia of blood cells. However, the involvement of HERG K(+) channels in MDS development is poorly understood. METHODS: The expression of HERG K(+) channels in untreated MDS, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and the control group was detected by flow cytometry. The roles of HERG K(+) channels in regulation of SKM-1 cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle were determined by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS: We found that expression of HERG K(+) channels in MDS patients was significantly higher than controls and was lower than AML. Percentage of HERG K(+) channels on CD34+CD38- cells gradually increased from controls to high-grade MDS subtypes. And HERG K(+) channel levels showed an ascending tendency from low-risk to high-risk MDS group. In addition, the CCK-8 assay, apoptosis and cell cycle analysis were performed and showed that blockage of HERG K(+) channels decreased the proliferation of MDS cells but rarely had effects on cell apoptosis and cell cycle distribution.

However, the available data regarding the optimal treatment for relapsed/refractory T-LGLL patients are limited. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 10 patients treated with immunosuppressive therapy consisting of intravenous moderate-dose cyclophosphamide (MD-CTX) together with oral cyclosporine A for relapsed/refractory T-LGLL in our hospital between July 2006 and March 2013. RESULTS: The overall response rate to MD-CTX was 60% (6/10; hematologic complete remission rate, 50%; hematologic partial remission rate, 10%). The median time to response was 28.5 days (range, 20-118 days). The relapse rate of MD-CTX was 50% (3/6); two of these three patients achieved hematologic complete remission after receiving a second course of MD-CTX. Neutropenia was the major adverse event of the MD-CTX regimen. The median time to neutropenia was 5.5 days (range, 1-10 days) and the median neutropenia duration was 5 days (range, 3-15 days).

Two cytogenetic methods, karyotype, and FISH, with still ongoing improvements, are used for CLL investigation, but the panel of chromosomal abnormalities, their prognostic significance and contribution in CLL pathogenesis have not been elucidated yet. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: Our study deals with the cytogenetic investigation of 237 CLL patients trying to answer ambiguous issues of the disease in the light of new CLL stimulation methodology. More specifically, we compared the detection rate and type of chromosomal aberrations between cultures stimulated with and without the new mitogens and we combined them with the data obtained from interphase (iFISH) and metaphase FISH (mFISH). RESULTS: Approximately 70% of the abnormal karyotypes and all the subclonal abnormalities were detected exclusively in DSP-30/IL-2 cultures. DSP-30/IL-2 exhibited approximately 10-fold greater ability to detect abnormalities compared to TPA and unstimulated cultures, revealing >60 different chromosomal aberrations. Moreover, the comparison between DSP-30/IL-2 cultures and unstimulated cultures indicated that loss of chromosome Y is rather an age-related phenomenon and not a specific aberration of CLL. Clonal evolution was also detected in 50% of patients with available follow-up karyotypic data and changed the prognosis in 86.4% of them. Finally, it was shown that mFISH must be performed in DSP-30/IL-2 cultures in addition to iFISH to uncover submicroscopic translocations or insertions undetectable by iFISH. CONCLUSION: All the above argue in favor of the parallel application of karyotype, iFISH and mFISH after DSP-30/IL-2 stimulation for CLL clinical practice and research.",,"['Karakosta, Maria', 'Manola, Kalliopi N']","['Karakosta M', 'Manola KN']","['a Laboratory of Health Physics, Radiobiology and Cytogenetics, NCSR ""Demokritos"" , Athens , Greece.', 'a Laboratory of Health Physics, Radiobiology and Cytogenetics, NCSR ""Demokritos"" , Athens , Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160315,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,IM,"['Aged', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Interphase/*genetics', 'Karyotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Metaphase/*genetics']",2016/04/15 06:00,2017/04/12 06:00,['2016/04/15 06:00'],"['2016/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/10245332.2015.1110948 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2016 Oct;21(9):526-35. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2015.1110948.

Therefore, a meta-analysis to study the impact of ASXL1 mutations on patients with MDS and CMML is useful. METHODS: The identified articles were retrieved from some common databases. We extracted hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) and leukemic-free survival (LFS) and P-value of some clinical parameters, which compared AXSL1 mutations to those without from the available studies. Each individual HR and P-value was used to calculate the pooled HR and P-value. RESULTS: Six studies covering 1689 patients were selected for this meta-analysis. The pooled HRs for OS and LFS were 1.45 (95% confidential interval (CI), 1.24-1.70) and 2.20 (95% CI, 1.53-3.17), respectively. When considering CMML patients alone the HR for OS was 1.50 (95% CI, 1.18-1.90). Additionally, ASXL1 mutations were more frequently found in male (P = 0.008), older (P = 0.019), and patients with lower platelets (P = 0.009) or hemoglobin level (P = 0.0015) and associated with other mutations such as EZH2, IDH1/2, RUNX1, and TET2. DISCUSSION: Although our analysis has its limitation, it showed that ASXL1 mutations had significant inferior impact on OS and LFS for French-American-British-defined MDS patients. However, the influence of different types of ASXL1 mutations on patients with MDS still needs illustrating. CONCLUSION: ASXL1 mutations were associated with poor prognosis in MDS, which may contribute to risk stratification and prognostic assessment in the disease.",,"['Lin, Yun', 'Zheng, Yi', 'Wang, Ze-Chuan', 'Wang, Shao-Yuan']","['Lin Y', 'Zheng Y', 'Wang ZC', 'Wang SY']","['a Union Clinical Medical College, Fujian Medical University , Fuzhou , P.R.

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been recognized to play a role in helping leukemic cells to evade immunesurveillance. The mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are essential contributors in immunomodulation of the microenvironment as they can promote differentiation of Tregs via the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the expression of IDO in bone marrow derived MSCs and to study its correlation to percentage of Tregs. METHODS: Thirty-seven adult bone marrow samples were cultured in appropriate culture medium to isolate MSCs. Successful harvest of MSCs was determined by plastic adherence, morphology, and positive expression of CD271 and CD105; negative expression of CD34 and CD45 using flowcytometry. MSCs were examined for IDO expression by immunocytochemistry using anti-IDO monoclonal antibody. CD4+ CD25+ cells (Tregs) were measured in bone marrow samples by flowcytometry. RESULTS: MSCs were successfully isolated from 20 of the 37 bone marrow samples cultured. MSCs showed higher expression of IDO and Tregs percentage was higher in AML patients compared to control subjects (P = 0.002 and P < 0.001, respectively). A positive correlation was found between IDO expression and Tregs percentage (P value = 0.012, r = 0.5). CONCLUSION: In this study, we revealed an association between high IDO expression in MSCs and elevated levels of Tregs which could have an important role in the pathogenesis of AML, providing immunosuppressive microenvironment.",,"['Mansour, Iman', 'Zayed, Rania A', 'Said, Fadwa', 'Latif, Lamyaa Abdel']","['Mansour I', 'Zayed RA', 'Said F', 'Latif LA']","['a Clinical and Chemical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine , Cairo University , El Saraya Street, Infront of El Manial Palace, Cairo 11451 , Egypt.', 'a Clinical and Chemical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine , Cairo University , El Saraya Street, Infront of El Manial Palace, Cairo 11451 , Egypt.', 'a Clinical and Chemical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine , Cairo University , El Saraya Street, Infront of El Manial Palace, Cairo 11451 , Egypt.', 'a Clinical and Chemical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine , Cairo University , El Saraya Street, Infront of El Manial Palace, Cairo 11451 , Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160304,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/15 06:00,2017/03/14 06:00,['2016/04/15 06:00'],"['2016/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/10245332.2015.1106814 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2016 Sep;21(8):447-53. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2015.1106814.

Simultaneously, there has been an increase in the number of immunocompromised patients with life threatening complications requiring intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. ICU admission is necessary in up to 15% of patients with acute leukemia and 20% of bone marrow transplantation recipients, and the main reason for ICU referral in this patient population is acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is associated with a high mortality rate, particularly in patients requiring endotracheal intubation. The application of non-invasive ventilation (NIV), and thus the avoidance of endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation with its side effects, appears therefore of great importance in this patient population. Early trials supported the benefits of NIV in these settings, and the 2011 Canadian guidelines for the use of NIV in critical care settings suggest the use of NIV in immune-compromised patients with a grade 2B recommendation. However, the very encouraging results from initial seminal trials were not confirmed in subsequent observational and randomized clinical studies, questioning the beneficial effect of NIV in immune-compromised patients. Based on these observations, a French group led by Azoulay decided to assess whether early intermittent respiratory support with NIV had a role in reducing the mortality rate of immune-compromised patients with non-hypercapnic hypoxemic respiratory failure developed in less than 72 h, and hence conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) in experienced ICUs in France. This perspective reviews the findings from their RCT in the context of the current critical care landscape, and in light of recent results from other trials focused on the early management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.",,"['Del Sorbo, Lorenzo', 'Jerath, Angela', 'Dres, Martin', 'Parotto, Matteo']","['Del Sorbo L', 'Jerath A', 'Dres M', 'Parotto M']","[""1 Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, 2 Department of Anesthesia, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada ; 3 Department of Anesthesia and Pain Management, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada ; 4 Keenan Research Center at the Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute of St, Michael's Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada."", ""1 Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, 2 Department of Anesthesia, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada ; 3 Department of Anesthesia and Pain Management, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada ; 4 Keenan Research Center at the Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute of St, Michael's Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada."", ""1 Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, 2 Department of Anesthesia, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada ; 3 Department of Anesthesia and Pain Management, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada ; 4 Keenan Research Center at the Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute of St, Michael's Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada."", ""1 Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, 2 Department of Anesthesia, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada ; 3 Department of Anesthesia and Pain Management, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada ; 4 Keenan Research Center at the Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute of St, Michael's Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,J Thorac Dis,Journal of thoracic disease,101533916,,,,2016/04/15 06:00,2016/04/15 06:01,['2016/04/15 06:00'],"['2016/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/jtd.2016.02.11 [doi]', 'jtd-08-03-E208 [pii]']",ppublish,J Thorac Dis. 2016 Mar;8(3):E208-16. doi: 10.21037/jtd.2016.02.11.,10.21037/jtd.2016.02.11 [doi],,,PMC4805836,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Non-invasive ventilation (NIV)', 'immunosuppression', 'respiratory failure']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Cataloging antineoplastic agents according to their effectiveness against platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive EOC cell lines is valuable for development of therapeutic strategies to avoid platinum inefficacy and to exploit platinum sensitivity. TOV-21G devoid of FANCF expression, OV-90 and SKOV-3 were employed as examples of platinum-sensitive, platinum-intermediate and platinum-resistant cell lines, respectively. Antineoplastic agents examined included mitomycin C, doxorubicin, etoposide, gemcitabine, chlorambucil, paclitaxel, triapine and X-rays. Their effectiveness against cell lines was analyzed by clonogenic assays. Cytotoxic profiles of mitomycin C and carboplatin were similar, with mitomycin C exhibiting greater potency and selectivity against TOV-21G than carboplatin. Cytotoxic profiles of doxorubicin, etoposide and X-rays overlapped with that of carboplatin, while OV-90 overexpressing Rad51 was more resistant to chlorambucil than SKOV-3. The efficacy of paclitaxel and triapine was independent of platinum sensitivity or resistance. Consistent with these cytotoxic profiles, cisplatin/mitomycin C, triapine, and paclitaxel differed in the capacity to induce phosphorylation of H2AX, and produced unique inhibitory patterns of DNA/RNA syntheses in HL-60 human leukemia cells. Paclitaxel and triapine in combination produced additive antitumor effects in M109 murine lung carcinoma. In conclusion, mitomycin C is potentially more effective against Fanconi anemia pathway-deficient EOCs than carboplatin. Doxorubicin and etoposide, because of their overlapping cytotoxic properties with carboplatin, are unlikely to be efficacious against platinum-refractory EOCs. Paclitaxel and triapine are effective regardless of platinum sensitivity status, and promising in combination for both platinum-sensitive and platinum-refractory EOCs.",,"['Ishiguro, Kimiko', 'Zhu, Yong-Lian', 'Lin, Z Ping', 'Penketh, Philip G', 'Shyam, Krishnamurthy', 'Zhu, Rui', 'Baumann, Raymond P', 'Sartorelli, Alan C', 'Rutherford, Thomas J', 'Ratner, Elena S']","['Ishiguro K', 'Zhu YL', 'Lin ZP', 'Penketh PG', 'Shyam K', 'Zhu R', 'Baumann RP', 'Sartorelli AC', 'Rutherford TJ', 'Ratner ES']","['Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Yale Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, United States.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Yale Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, United States.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Yale Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, United States.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Yale Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yale Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yale Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yale Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yale Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, United States.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Yale Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, United States.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Yale Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160305,England,J Transl Sci,Journal of translational science,101661355,,,,2016/04/15 06:00,2016/04/15 06:01,['2016/04/15 06:00'],"['2016/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/15 06:01 [medline]']",['10.15761/JTS.1000127 [doi]'],ppublish,J Transl Sci. 2016;2(2):117-124. doi: 10.15761/JTS.1000127.

Although we previously found that STAT3 protects CLL cells from apoptosis, STAT3 levels were significantly higher in cells from patients with high counts than in cells from patients with low counts. Furthermore, overexpression of STAT3 did not protect the cells. Rather, it upregulated caspase-3 and induced apoptosis. Remarkably, putative STAT3 binding sites were identified in the caspase-3 promoter, and a luciferase assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and an EMSA revealed that STAT3 activated caspase-3 However, caspase-3 levels increased only when STAT3 levels were sufficiently high. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and EMSA, we found that STAT3 binds with low affinity to the caspase-3 promoter, suggesting that at high levels, STAT3 activates proapoptotic mechanisms and induces apoptosis in CLL cells.","['Copyright (c) 2016 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Rozovski, Uri', 'Harris, David M', 'Li, Ping', 'Liu, Zhiming', 'Wu, Ji Yuan', 'Grgurevic, Srdana', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Wierda, William G', 'Martinez, Matthew', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Estrov, Zeev']","['Rozovski U', 'Harris DM', 'Li P', 'Liu Z', 'Wu JY', 'Grgurevic S', 'Faderl S', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Wierda WG', 'Martinez M', 'Verstovsek S', 'Keating MJ', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030 zestrov@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160413,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2016/04/15 06:00,2017/07/01 06:00,['2016/04/15 06:00'],"['2014/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/01 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1402108 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1402108 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2016 May 15;196(10):4400-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1402108.

High-risk, metastatic cases are explained in part by amplification or mutation of oncogenes, such as MYCN and ALK, and loss of tumor suppressor genes in chromosome band 1p. However, it is fundamental to identify other pathways responsible for the large portion of neuroblastomas with no obvious molecular alterations. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Neuroblastoma cell lines were used for the assessment of tumor growth in vivo and in vitro Protein expression in tissues and cells was assessed using immunofluorescence and IHC. The association of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) expression with neuroblastoma outcome and relapse was calculated using log-rank and Mann-Whitney tests, respectively. Gene expression was assessed using chip microarrays. RESULTS: PML is detected in the developing and adult sympathetic nervous system, whereas it is not expressed or is low in metastatic neuroblastoma tumors. Reduced PML expression in patients with low-risk cancers, that is, localized and negative for the MYCN proto-oncogene, is strongly associated with tumor recurrence. PML-I, but not PML-IV, isoform suppresses angiogenesis via upregulation of thrombospondin-2 (TSP2), a key inhibitor of angiogenesis. Finally, PML-I and TSP2 expression inversely correlates with tumor angiogenesis and recurrence in localized neuroblastomas. CONCLUSIONS: Our work reveals a novel PML-I-TSP2 axis for the regulation of angiogenesis and cancer relapse, which could be used to identify patients with low-risk, localized tumors that might benefit from chemotherapy.

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is the most significant and life-threatening toxicity. To improve understanding of CRS, we measured cytokines and clinical biomarkers in 51 CTL019-treated patients. Peak levels of 24 cytokines, including IFNgamma, IL6, sgp130, and sIL6R, in the first month after infusion were highly associated with severe CRS. Using regression modeling, we could accurately predict which patients would develop severe CRS with a signature composed of three cytokines. Results were validated in an independent cohort. Changes in serum biochemical markers, including C-reactive protein and ferritin, were associated with CRS but failed to predict development of severe CRS. These comprehensive profiling data provide novel insights into CRS biology and, importantly, represent the first data that can accurately predict which patients have a high probability of becoming critically ill. SIGNIFICANCE: CRS is the most common severe toxicity seen after CAR T-cell treatment. We developed models that can accurately predict which patients are likely to develop severe CRS before they become critically ill, which improves understanding of CRS biology and may guide future cytokine-directed therapy.

Of these drugs, those that inhibit the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway are the most promising. Ibrutinib inhibits BTK in the BCR pathway and can be administered orally. The results of several clinical trials suggest that ibrutinib is highly effective against relapsed/resistant (RR) and treatment-naive CLL. Furthermore, ibrutinib shows equivalent efficacy on CLL with the 17p deletion. Idelalisib, which also blocks the BCR pathway, inhibits PIK3delta and induces CLL cell death. Clinical trials have shown outstanding efficacy of idelalisib against RR-CLL, especially when administered with antiCD20 antibodies. This drug is also effective against CLL with the 17p deletion. ABT-199 is another novel drug; it inhibits BCL2 signaling, not the BCR pathway, and can be administered orally. The efficacy of ABT-199 against RR-CLL has been demonstrated in a number of clinical trials. These drugs have only mild toxicity and can be used for patients in poor general condition.

The objective of the study was to assess whether a combinational therapy of nanoparticle-based therapeutic vaccination and concomitant transient ablation of Tregs augments anti-viral immunity and improves virus control in chronically retrovirus-infected mice. Therefore, chronically Friend retrovirus (FV)-infected mice were immunized with calcium phosphate (CaP) nanoparticles functionalized with TLR9 ligand CpG and CD8(+) or CD4(+) T cell epitope peptides (GagL85-93 or Env gp70123-141) of FV. In addition, Tregs were ablated during the immunization process. Reactivation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) effector T cells was analysed and the viral loads were determined. RESULTS: Therapeutic vaccination of chronically FV-infected mice with functionalized CaP nanoparticles transiently reactivated cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells and significantly reduced the viral loads. Transient ablation of Tregs during nanoparticle-based therapeutic vaccination strongly enhanced anti-viral immunity and further decreased viral burden. CONCLUSION: Our data illustrate a crucial role for CD4(+) Foxp3(+) Tregs in the suppression of anti-viral T cell responses during therapeutic vaccination against chronic retroviral infection. Thus, the combination of transient Treg ablation and therapeutic nanoparticle-based vaccination confers robust and sustained anti-viral immunity.",,"['Knuschke, Torben', 'Rotan, Olga', 'Bayer, Wibke', 'Sokolova, Viktoriya', 'Hansen, Wiebke', 'Sparwasser, Tim', 'Dittmer, Ulf', 'Epple, Matthias', 'Buer, Jan', 'Westendorf, Astrid M']","['Knuschke T', 'Rotan O', 'Bayer W', 'Sokolova V', 'Hansen W', 'Sparwasser T', 'Dittmer U', 'Epple M', 'Buer J', 'Westendorf AM']","['Institute of Medical Microbiology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, 45122, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Inorganic Chemistry and Center for Nanointegration (CeNIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, 45122, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Inorganic Chemistry and Center for Nanointegration (CeNIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, 45122, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Infection Immunology, TWINCORE, Centre for Experimental and Clinical Medicine, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, 45122, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Inorganic Chemistry and Center for Nanointegration (CeNIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, 45141, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, 45122, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, 45122, Essen, Germany. astrid.westendorf@uk-essen.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20160414,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,['0 (Viral Vaccines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Combined Modality Therapy/methods', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', '*Leukocyte Reduction Procedures', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nanoparticles/*administration & dosage', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/*therapy', 'Viral Vaccines/*administration & dosage']",2016/04/15 06:00,2016/10/13 06:00,['2016/04/15 06:00'],"['2016/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-016-0258-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-016-0258-9 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2016 Apr 14;13:24. doi: 10.1186/s12977-016-0258-9.,10.1186/s12977-016-0258-9 [doi],,,PMC4831142,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic retrovirus infection', 'Nanoparticles-based vaccine', 'Regulatory T cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have revealed an increase in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotent progenitor (MPP) cells in conditional Runx1-knockout (KO) mice, but the molecular mechanism is unresolved. We investigated the myeloid progenitor (MP) compartment in KO mice, arguing that disruptions at the HSC/MPP level may be amplified in downstream cells. We demonstrate that the MP compartment is increased by more than fivefold in Runx1 KO mice, with a prominent skewing toward megakaryocyte (Meg) progenitors. Runx1-deficient granulocyte-macrophage progenitors are characterized by increased cloning capacity, impaired development into mature cells, and HSC and Meg transcription signatures. An HSC/MPP subpopulation expressing Meg markers was also increased in Runx1-deficient mice. Rescue experiments coupled with transcriptome analysis and Runx1 DNA-binding assays demonstrated that granulocytic/monocytic (G/M) commitment is marked by Runx1 suppression of genes encoding adherence and motility proteins (Tek, Jam3, Plxnc1, Pcdh7, and Selp) that support HSC-Meg interactions with the BM niche. In vitro assays confirmed that enforced Tek expression in HSCs/MPPs increases Meg output. Interestingly, besides this key repressor function of Runx1 to control lineage decisions and cell numbers in progenitors, our study also revealed a critical activating function in erythroblast differentiation, in addition to its known importance in Meg and G/M maturation. Thus both repressor and activator functions of Runx1 at multiple hematopoietic stages and lineages likely contribute to the tumor suppressor activity in MDS and AML.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Behrens, Kira', 'Triviai, Ioanna', 'Schwieger, Maike', 'Tekin, Nilgun', 'Alawi, Malik', 'Spohn, Michael', 'Indenbirken, Daniela', 'Ziegler, Marion', 'Muller, Ursula', 'Alexander, Warren S', 'Stocking, Carol']","['Behrens K', 'Triviai I', 'Schwieger M', 'Tekin N', 'Alawi M', 'Spohn M', 'Indenbirken D', 'Ziegler M', 'Muller U', 'Alexander WS', 'Stocking C']","['Retroviral Pathogenesis, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany;', 'Retroviral Pathogenesis, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany; Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany;', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Signal Transduction, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany;', 'Retroviral Pathogenesis, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany; Biotechnology Institute, University of Ankara, Ankara, Turkey;', 'Virus Genomics, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany; Bioinformatics Core, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany;', 'Virus Genomics, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany;', 'Virus Genomics, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany;', 'Retroviral Pathogenesis, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany;', 'Retroviral Pathogenesis, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany;', 'Cancer and Haematology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; and Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Retroviral Pathogenesis, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160413,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2016/04/15 06:00,2017/07/28 06:00,['2016/04/15 06:00'],"['2015/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34412-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-09-668129 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jun 30;127(26):3369-81. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-09-668129.

While both normal activated and leukemic T cells can utilize aerobic glycolysis to support proliferation, it is unclear to what extent these cell populations are metabolically similar and if differences reveal T-ALL vulnerabilities. Here we show that aerobic glycolysis is surprisingly less active in T-ALL cells than proliferating normal T cells and that T-ALL cells are metabolically distinct. Oncogenic Notch promoted glycolysis but also induced metabolic stress that activated 5' AMP-activated kinase (AMPK). Unlike stimulated T cells, AMPK actively restrained aerobic glycolysis in T-ALL cells through inhibition of mTORC1 while promoting oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial Complex I activity. Importantly, AMPK deficiency or inhibition of Complex I led to T-ALL cell death and reduced disease burden. Thus, AMPK simultaneously inhibits anabolic growth signaling and is essential to promote mitochondrial pathways that mitigate metabolic stress and apoptosis in T-ALL.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: In this multicentric retrospective study, the charts of 20 patients with CDC following cytotoxic agent protocols for hematological malignancies, diagnosed from 2003 to 2013, were analyzed. The response to systemic antifungal therapy within 90 days from CDC diagnosis and the possible delay in chemotherapy plan, due to the infection, were evaluated. RESULTS: Six patients were treated with high-dose (HD; 5 mg/kg/daily) liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB), whereas three received standard-dose (SD) L-AmB (3 mg/kg/daily). Azoles were given to six patients; the remaining five were treated with echinocandins. All patients treated with HD L-AmB (6/6-100 %) achieved complete resolution of CDC; one of them had to interrupt the chemotherapy program for the infection. In the SD L-AmB group, treatment failed in the 100 % of cases and one patient had to delay chemotherapy for the infection. Of the six patients who received azoles, two achieved complete resolution of the infection, four experienced treatment failure, and only three performed chemotherapy as planned. Echinocandins treatment resulted in complete resolution of the infection in 2/5 cases, partial response in 2/5 cases, and failure in one case. In this group, 3/5 patients completed chemotherapy as planned. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that HD L-AmB was particularly effective against CDC in hematologic patients, allowing most patients to continue cytotoxic agent program.",,"['Della Pepa, Roberta', 'Picardi, M', 'Sora, F', 'Stamouli, M', 'Busca, A', 'Candoni, A', 'Delia, M', 'Fanci, R', 'Perriello, V', 'Zancanella, M', 'Nosari, A', 'Salutari, P', 'Marchesi, F', 'Pane, F', 'Pagano, L']","['Della Pepa R', 'Picardi M', 'Sora F', 'Stamouli M', 'Busca A', 'Candoni A', 'Delia M', 'Fanci R', 'Perriello V', 'Zancanella M', 'Nosari A', 'Salutari P', 'Marchesi F', 'Pane F', 'Pagano L']","['Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Hematology, Federico II University, via Sergio Pansini, 5, Naples, 80131, Italy. roberta.dellapepa@unina.it.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Hematology, Federico II University, via Sergio Pansini, 5, Naples, 80131, Italy.', 'Hematology Catholic University Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology Catholic University Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology Le Molinette Hospital, Torino, Italy.', 'Hematology University of Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Hematology University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology University of Firenze, Florence, Italy.', 'Hematology University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology Niguarda Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology Niguarda Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology Pescara Hospital, Pescara, Italy.', 'Haematology, Istituti Fisioterapici Ospitalieri (IFO), Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Hematology, Federico II University, via Sergio Pansini, 5, Naples, 80131, Italy.', 'Hematology Catholic University Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20160414,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (liposomal amphotericin B)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'Systemic candidiasis']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Candidiasis/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/15 06:00,2017/10/07 06:00,['2016/04/15 06:00'],"['2016/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00520-016-3208-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-016-3208-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2016 Sep;24(9):3839-45. doi: 10.1007/s00520-016-3208-0.

Here we performed quantitative biophysical and structural analysis of the central short coiled coil domain (CCD) of STIL that is critical for its function. Using biophysical, biochemical and cell biology approaches, we identified the specific residues in the CCD that mediate the oligomerization, centrosomal localization and protein interactions of STIL. We characterized the structural properties of the coiled coil peptide using circular dichroism spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography. We identified two regions in this domain, containing eight hydrophobic residues, which mediate the coiled coil oligomerization. Mutations in these residues destabilized the coiled coil thermodynamically but in most cases did not affect its secondary structure. Reconstituting mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking endogenous Stil, we show that STIL oligomerization mediated by these residues is not only important for the centrosomal functions of STIL during the canonical duplication process but also for de-novo formation of centrosomes.",,"['David, Ahuvit', 'Amartely, Hadar', 'Rabinowicz, Noa', 'Shamir, Mai', 'Friedler, Assaf', 'Izraeli, Shai']","['David A', 'Amartely H', 'Rabinowicz N', 'Shamir M', 'Friedler A', 'Izraeli S']","['Sheba Cancer Research Center and the Edmond and Lily Safra Children Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer 52621, Israel.', 'Department of molecular genetics and biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Chemistry, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Safra Campus, Givat Ram, Jerusalem 91904, Israel.', 'Sheba Cancer Research Center and the Edmond and Lily Safra Children Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer 52621, Israel.', 'Department of molecular genetics and biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Chemistry, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Safra Campus, Givat Ram, Jerusalem 91904, Israel.', 'Institute of Chemistry, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Safra Campus, Givat Ram, Jerusalem 91904, Israel.', 'Sheba Cancer Research Center and the Edmond and Lily Safra Children Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer 52621, Israel.', 'Department of molecular genetics and biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160414,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Biophysical Phenomena', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Centrosome/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', '*Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1']",2016/04/15 06:00,2017/03/01 06:00,['2016/04/15 06:00'],"['2016/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['srep24296 [pii]', '10.1038/srep24296 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Apr 14;6:24296. doi: 10.1038/srep24296.,10.1038/srep24296 [doi],,,PMC4830966,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfavorable cytogenetic changes such as complex karyotypes or chromosome 7 anomalies are predictive of the progression to AML and poor prognosis. Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is the result of a deficiency of arginine vasopressin, and its major causes are idiopathic, primary or secondary tumors, neurosurgery and trauma. Importantly, CDI is a rare complication of MDS. To date, only 5 cases of MDS co-occurring with CDI have been reported; 3 of 5 had cytogenetic abnormalities uncovered by metaphase cytogenetics and 3 of 5 evolved to AML. Here, we describe a 74-year-old woman who presented with CDI as her initial symptom of MDS and eventually progressed to AML. The metaphase cytogenetics, combined with the single-nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A)-based karyotyping, with superiority in resolution and detecting copy number variation, revealed a complex karyotype that included monosomy of chromosome 7, deletion of 20q, and absence of heterogeneity (AOH) in more than one chromosome. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of MDS co-occurring with CDI with numerous cytogenetic abnormalities revealed by the SNP-A-based karyotyping. Our case supports that the cytogenetic abnormalities may be associated with the clinical features and the prognosis of MDS co-occurring with CDI. The SNP-A-based karyotyping is helpful in revealing more subtle cytogenetic abnormalities and unveiling their roles in the pathogenesis of MDS.",,"['Sun, Ruixue', 'Wang, Chun', 'Zhong, Xushu', 'Wu, Yu']","['Sun R', 'Wang C', 'Zhong X', 'Wu Y']","['Department of Hematology and Hematology Research Laboratory, West China Hospital, Sichuan University.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Tohoku J Exp Med,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,0417355,,IM,"['Aged', 'Diabetes Insipidus/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",2016/04/15 06:00,2017/05/31 06:00,['2016/04/15 06:00'],"['2016/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1620/tjem.238.305 [doi]'],ppublish,Tohoku J Exp Med. 2016 Apr;238(4):305-10. doi: 10.1620/tjem.238.305.,10.1620/tjem.238.305 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have reported that the TALE-class homeodomain transcription factor Pbx1 is essential in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) for stem cell maintenance and progenitor expansion. However, the role of Pbx1 in the hematopoietic niche has not been investigated. Here we explored the effects that genetic perturbation of the splenic mesenchymal niche has on hematopoiesis upon loss of members of the Pbx family of homeoproteins. Splenic mesenchyme-specific inactivation of Pbx1 (SKO) on a Pbx2- or Pbx3-deficient genetic background (DKO) resulted in abnormal development of the spleen, which is dysmorphic and severely hypoplastic. This phenotype, in turn, affected the number of HSPCs in the fetal and adult spleen at steady state, as well as markedly impairing the kinetics of hematopoietic regeneration in adult mice after sub-lethal and lethal myelosuppressive irradiation. Spleens of mice with compound Pyx deficiency 8 days following sublethal irradiation displayed significant downregulation of multiple cytokine-encoding genes, including KitL/SCF, Cxcl12/SDF-1, IL-3, IL-4, GM-CSF/Csf2 IL-10, and Igf-1, compared with controls. KitL/SCF and Cxcl12/SDF-1 were recently shown to play key roles in the splenic niche in response to various haematopoietic stresses such as myeloablation, blood loss, or pregnancy. Our results demonstrate that, in addition to their intrinsic roles in HSPCs, non-cell autonomous functions of Pbx factors within the splenic niche contribute to the regulation of hematopoiesis, at least in part via the control of KitL/SCF and Cxcl12/SDF-1. Furthermore, our study establishes that abnormal spleen development and hypoplasia have deleterious effects on the efficiency of hematopoietic recovery after bone marrow injury.",['(c) 2016 Anatomical Society.'],"['Zewdu, Rediet', 'Risolino, Maurizio', 'Barbulescu, Alexandru', 'Ramalingam, Pradeep', 'Butler, Jason M', 'Selleri, Licia']","['Zewdu R', 'Risolino M', 'Barbulescu A', 'Ramalingam P', 'Butler JM', 'Selleri L']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Program in Craniofacial Biology, Department of Orofacial Sciences & Department of Anatomy, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Genetic Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Genetic Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Program in Craniofacial Biology, Department of Orofacial Sciences & Department of Anatomy, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160414,England,J Anat,Journal of anatomy,0137162,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/metabolism', '*Hematopoiesis, Extramedullary', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Spleen/physiology', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology']",2016/04/15 06:00,2017/03/03 06:00,['2016/04/15 06:00'],"['2016/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/joa.12479 [doi]'],ppublish,J Anat. 2016 Jul;229(1):153-69. doi: 10.1111/joa.12479.

Although several studies suggest the Hh pathway is activated in CD138- immature cells, differentiated CD138+ plasma cells might also be able to self-renew by producing themselves the Hh ligands. We studied the gene expression profiles of 126 newly diagnosed MM patients analyzed in both the CD138+ plasma cell fraction and CD138-CD19+ B-cell compartment. Results demonstrated that an Hh-gene signature was able to cluster patients in two subgroups characterized by the opposite Hh pathway expression in mature plasma cells and their precursors. Strikingly, patients characterized by Hh hyperactivation in plasma cells, but not in their B cells, displayed high genomic instability and an unfavorable outcome in terms of shorter progression-free survival (hazard ratio: 1.92; 95% confidence interval: 1.19-3.07) and overall survival (hazard ratio: 2.61; 95% confidence interval: 1.26-5.38).

However, AML, with the exception of APL, fails to respond to differentiation therapy. Therefore, research strategies to further sensitize cells to retinoids and to extend the range of AMLs that respond to retinoids beyond APLs are urgently needed. In this study, we showed that TAK165, a HER2 inhibitor, exhibited a strong synergy with ATRA to promote AML cell differentiation. We observed that TAK165 sensitized the AML cells to ATRA-induced cell growth inhibition, G0/G1 phase arrest, CD11b expression, mature morphologic changes, NBT reduction and myeloid regulator expression. Unexpectedly, HER2 pathway might not be essential for TAK165-enhanced differentiation when combined with ATRA, while the enhanced differentiation was dependent on the activation of the RARalpha/STAT1 axis. Furthermore, the MEK/ERK cascade regulated the activation of STAT1. Taken together, our study is the first to evaluate the synergy of TAK165 and ATRA in AML cell differentiation and to assess new opportunities for the combination of TAK165 and ATRA as a promising approach for future differentiation therapy.",,"['Shao, Xuejing', 'Liu, Yujia', 'Li, Yangling', 'Xian, Miao', 'Zhou, Qian', 'Yang, Bo', 'Ying, Meidan', 'He, Qiaojun']","['Shao X', 'Liu Y', 'Li Y', 'Xian M', 'Zhou Q', 'Yang B', 'Ying M', 'He Q']","['Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160414,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Protein Interaction Maps/drug effects', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha/*metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/metabolism']",2016/04/15 06:00,2017/03/03 06:00,['2016/04/15 06:00'],"['2015/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['srep24589 [pii]', '10.1038/srep24589 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Apr 14;6:24589. doi: 10.1038/srep24589.,10.1038/srep24589 [doi],,,PMC4830980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No functional STAT5 binding site has been identified so far within the c-Myc gene locus, therefore a direct transcriptional regulation by STAT5 remains uncertain. c-Myc super-enhancer, located 1.7 Mb downstream of the c-Myc gene locus, was recently reported as essential for the regulation of c-Myc gene expression by hematopoietic transcription factors and bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins and for leukemia maintenance. c-Myc super-enhancer is composed of five regulatory regions (E1-E5) which recruit transcription and chromatin-associated factors, mediating chromatin looping and interaction with the c-Myc promoter. RESULTS: We now show that STAT5 strongly binds to c-Myc super-enhancer regions E3 and E4, both in normal and transformed Ba/F3 cells. We also found that the BET protein bromodomain-containing protein 2 (BRD2), a co-factor of STAT5, co-localizes with STAT5 at E3/E4 in Ba/F3 cells transformed by the constitutively active STAT5-1*6 mutant, but not in non-transformed Ba/F3 cells. BRD2 binding at E3/E4 coincides with c-Myc transcriptional activation and is lost upon treatment with deacetylase and BET inhibitors, both of which inhibit STAT5 transcriptional activity and c-Myc gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that constitutive STAT5 binding to c-Myc super-enhancer might contribute to BRD2 maintenance and thus allow sustained expression of c-Myc in Ba/F3 cells transformed by STAT5-1*6.",,"['Pinz, Sophia', 'Unser, Samy', 'Rascle, Anne']","['Pinz S', 'Unser S', 'Rascle A']","['Stat5 Signaling Research Group, Institute of Immunology, University of Regensburg, 93053, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Stat5 Signaling Research Group, Institute of Immunology, University of Regensburg, 93053, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Stat5 Signaling Research Group, Institute of Immunology, University of Regensburg, 93053, Regensburg, Germany. anne.rascle@klinik.uni-regensburg.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160414,England,BMC Mol Biol,BMC molecular biology,100966983,"['0 (BRD2 protein, human)', '0 (Dner protein, mouse)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, myc', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Transcription Factors']",2016/04/15 06:00,2016/10/14 06:00,['2016/04/15 06:00'],"['2016/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12867-016-0063-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12867-016-0063-y [pii]']",epublish,BMC Mol Biol. 2016 Apr 14;17:10. doi: 10.1186/s12867-016-0063-y.,10.1186/s12867-016-0063-y [doi],,,PMC4831086,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BET', 'BRD2', 'Chromatin', 'STAT5', 'Super-enhancer', 'c-Myc']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We now show that the sensitivity of fresh CLL cells to spontaneous apoptosis is highly variable among different patients during 48 hours' cell culture and inversely correlated with in vivo constitutively activated STAT3 and NF-kappaB (p < 0.001). Both activated STAT3 and NF-kappaB maintain the levels of anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1/Bcl-xL and autocrine IL-6 production. CLL cells with higher susceptibility to in vitro spontaneous apoptosis show the greatest chemosensitivity (p < 0.001), which is reflected clinically as achieving a complete response (CR) (p < 0.001), longer lymphocyte doubling times (p < 0.01), time to first treatment (p < 0.01), and progression free survival (p < 0.05).

Here we report that combination treatment of carfilzomib and vorinostat enhanced cell apoptosis and induced a marked increase in G2-M arrest, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and activated the members of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) family, including the stress-activated kinases JNK, p38MAPK, and ERK1/2. Carfilzomib/vorinostat-mediated apoptosis was blocked by the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC). The JNK inhibitor SP600125 and the p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 but not the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 significantly attenuated carfilzomib/vorinostat-induced apoptosis, suggesting that p38MAPK and JNK activation contribute to carfilzomib and vorinostat-induced apoptosis. This was further confirmed via short hairpin (shRNA) RNA knockdown of p38MAPK and JNK. Interestingly, the ROS scavenger NAC attenuated carfilzomib/vorinostat-mediated activation of p38MAPK and JNK. However, p38MAPK shRNA but not JNK shRNA diminished carfilzomib/vorinostat-mediated ROS generation. In contrast, overexpression of p38MAPK significantly increased carfilzomib/vorinostat-mediated ROS generation, suggesting that an amplification loop exists between ROS and p38MAPK pathway. Combination treatment of carfilzomib and vorinostat enhanced their individual antitumor activity in both a human xenograft model as well as human primary T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cells. These data suggest the potential clinical benefit and underlying molecular mechanism of combining carfilzomib with vorinostat in the treatment of human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.",,"['Gao, Minjie', 'Chen, Gege', 'Wang, Houcai', 'Xie, Bingqian', 'Hu, Liangning', 'Kong, Yuanyuan', 'Yang, Guang', 'Tao, Yi', 'Han, Ying', 'Wu, Xiaosong', 'Zhang, Yiwen', 'Dai, Bojie', 'Shi, Jumei']","['Gao M', 'Chen G', 'Wang H', 'Xie B', 'Hu L', 'Kong Y', 'Yang G', 'Tao Y', 'Han Y', 'Wu X', 'Zhang Y', 'Dai B', 'Shi J']","[""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", 'College of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '72X6E3J5AR (carfilzomib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Oligopeptides/administration & dosage', 'Vorinostat', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2016/04/14 06:00,2018/01/09 06:00,['2016/04/14 06:00'],"['2015/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/09 06:00 [medline]']","['8667 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.8667 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 May 17;7(20):29102-15. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.8667.,10.18632/oncotarget.8667 [doi],,,PMC5045381,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['T-cell leukemia and lymphoma', 'carfilzomib', 'vorinostat']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Serbia has been designated as an endemic region for isolates carrying the blaNDM-1 gene, as well as one of several commonly proposed countries of origin. This is the first report of NDM-1-positive Escherichia coli from Serbia. A carbapenem-resistant clinical isolate of E. coli strain IMD989, isolated from the blood culture of a pediatric patient with leukemia, was subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility tests, molecular typing, and conjugation experiments. The strain exhibited resistance to meropenem and was classified as a novel sequence type, ST5123, belonging to E. coli phylogenetic group A. ST5123 showed similarity to veterinary isolates ST93 and ST3977. The blaNDM-1 gene was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Cloning and sequencing of genomic clones confirmed that strain IMD989 produces an NDM-1 variant. Conjugation experiments, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and Southern blot hybridization revealed that blaNDM-1 was located in IMD989 on a transmissible 80 kb plasmid, designated as pIMD989. PCR analysis confirmed that pIMD989 belongs to the IncF plasmid family. Propagation of IMD989 and selected transconjugants carrying pIMD989 over 14 days in solid media with and without antibiotic selection showed that pIMD989 is a stable plasmid.",,"['Novovic, Katarina', 'Vasiljevic, Zorica', 'Kuzmanovic, Milos', 'Lozo, Jelena', 'Begovic, Jelena', 'Kojic, Milan', 'Jovcic, Branko']","['Novovic K', 'Vasiljevic Z', 'Kuzmanovic M', 'Lozo J', 'Begovic J', 'Kojic M', 'Jovcic B']","['1 Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade , Belgrade, Serbia .', '2 Institute for Mother and Child Health Care ""Dr. Vukan Cupic ,"" Belgrade, Serbia .', '2 Institute for Mother and Child Health Care ""Dr. Vukan Cupic ,"" Belgrade, Serbia .', '3 Belgrade Medical School, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia .', '1 Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade , Belgrade, Serbia .', '4 Faculty of Biology, University of Belgrade , Belgrade, Serbia .', '1 Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade , Belgrade, Serbia .', '1 Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade , Belgrade, Serbia .', '1 Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade , Belgrade, Serbia .', '4 Faculty of Biology, University of Belgrade , Belgrade, Serbia .']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20160413,United States,Microb Drug Resist,"Microbial drug resistance (Larchmont, N.Y.)",9508567,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Thienamycins)', 'EC 3.5.2.6 (beta-Lactamases)', 'EC 3.5.2.6 (beta-lactamase NDM-1)', 'FV9J3JU8B1 (Meropenem)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Bacterial Typing Techniques', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Conjugation, Genetic', 'Escherichia coli/drug effects/*genetics/growth & development/isolation & purification', 'Escherichia coli Infections/complications/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Male', 'Meropenem', 'Plasmids/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Thienamycins/pharmacology', 'beta-Lactam Resistance/*genetics', 'beta-Lactamases/*genetics/metabolism']",2016/04/14 06:00,2017/04/27 06:00,['2016/04/14 06:00'],"['2016/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/mdr.2015.0264 [doi]'],ppublish,Microb Drug Resist. 2016 Dec;22(8):707-711. doi: 10.1089/mdr.2015.0264.

The parameters that determine this clinically observed heterogeneity are not fully understood. Here, we report the generation of a cell culture model that reflects part of this heterogeneity. We have used the catalytic subunit of human telomerase hTERT and large T to immortalize primary UV-unexposed keratinocytes. Then, mutant HRAS G12V has been introduced to transform these immortal keratinocytes. When injected into immunosuppressed mice, transformed cells grew as xenografts with distinct histopathological characteristics. We observed three major tissue architectures: solid, sarcomatoid and cystic growth types, which were primarily composed of pleomorphic and basaloid cells but in some cases displayed focal apocrine differentiation. We demonstrate that the cells generated represent different stages of skin cancerogenesis and as such can be used to identify novel tumor-promoting alterations such as the overexpression of the PADI2 oncogene in solid-type SCC. Importantly, the cultured cells maintain the characteristics from the xenograft they were derived from while being amenable to manipulation and analysis.

Mass cytometry data were analyzed using established computational techniques. Within this pilot study, longitudinal immune monitoring with mass cytometry revealed fundamental changes in leukemia phenotypes that occurred over time during and after induction in the refractory disease setting. Persisting AML blasts became more phenotypically distinct from stem and progenitor cells due to expression of novel marker patterns that differed from pre-treatment AML cells and from all cell types observed in healthy bone marrow.

RESULTS: Crosslinker-mediated immobilization showed significant FN grafting on surfaces, which provided K562 cell adhesion and growth advantage. siRNA nanoparticle silencing was similarly effective on FN-adhered and suspension-growing K562 cells. CONCLUSION: This study provided initial data to develop a cell-adhesive system to investigate therapeutic effects on leukemic cells. The response of chronic myeloid leukemia cells to siRNA nanoparticles was independent on cell attachment.",,"['Valencia-Serna, Juliana', 'Chevallier, Pascale', 'Kc, Remant Bahadur', 'Laroche, Gaetan', 'Uludag, Hasan']","['Valencia-Serna J', 'Chevallier P', 'Kc RB', 'Laroche G', 'Uludag H']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta T6G 2V2, Canada.', 'Departement de genie des mines, de la metallurgie et des Materiaux & Centre de recherche du CHU de Quebec, Universite Laval, Quebec, Quebec G1L 3L5, Canada.', 'Department of Chemical & Materials Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta T6G 2G6, Canada.', 'Departement de genie des mines, de la metallurgie et des Materiaux & Centre de recherche du CHU de Quebec, Universite Laval, Quebec, Quebec G1L 3L5, Canada.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta T6G 2V2, Canada.', 'Department of Chemical & Materials Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta T6G 2G6, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta T6G 2G6, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160413,England,Nanomedicine (Lond),"Nanomedicine (London, England)",101278111,"['0 (Biocompatible Materials)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Biocompatible Materials/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Cell Adhesion/genetics', 'Fibronectins/administration & dosage/chemistry/*genetics', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Nanoparticles/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'RNA, Small Interfering/administration & dosage/*genetics', 'Surface Properties']",2016/04/14 06:00,2016/12/29 06:00,['2016/04/14 06:00'],"['2016/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/nnm.16.32 [doi]'],ppublish,Nanomedicine (Lond). 2016 May;11(9):1123-38. doi: 10.2217/nnm.16.32.

This study aimed to assess the prognostic value of AMC on survival in 193 adult patients with de novo non-M3 acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The median AMC for all patients at diagnosis was 0.26 x 10(9)/L, with 41.4, 31.1 and 27.5% of patients showed low (<0.12 x 10(9)/L), normal (0.12-0.80 x 10(9)/L), and high AMC (>0.80 x 10(9)/L), respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that high AMC appeared as a poor prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) (p = 0.0055), but not for disease free survival (DFS) (p = 0.1195). On multivariate analysis, initial high AMC remained an independent predictor of OS (hazard ratio 2.01, p = 0.017).

We evaluated the outcomes in 30 patients with acute leukemia who underwent allo-HSCT from human leukocyte antigen-matched donors after conditioning with busulfan and fludarabine (BuFlu). The regimen comprised injection of busulfan 3.2 mg/kg daily on 4 consecutive days and fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) daily for 4 doses. All 30 patients achieved hematopoiesis reconstitution with full donor chimerism confirmed by short tandem repeat DNA analysis. The most common regimen-related toxicity was mucositis (86.7%), followed by cytomegalovirus infection (80%). Serious regimen-related toxicities were rare. Acute graft vs. host disease (aGVHD) was detected in 46.7% of the patients; 33.4% had grade I-II aGVHD and 13.3% had grade III-IV aGVHD. Chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was noted in 20% of the patients. The overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 66.7 and 53%, respectively, with a median follow-up of 25 months for surviving patients.

In the present study, 30 bone marrow samples derived from patients with AML were collected prior and subsequent to chemotherapy. The methylation status of the MGMT promoter in the bone marrow specimens was determined by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The results indicated that the methylation status of the MGMT promoter was influenced by different chemotherapeutic regimens. The MGMT methylation status of M4 patients (3 out of 6) were more chemosensitive, compared with that of patients with other AML subtypes (M1, 1 out of 3; M2, 0 out of 8; M3, 3 out of 7; M5, 0 out of 3; and M6, 1 out of 3). Age-based analysis revealed that the group aged </=60 years (7 out of 24 patients) exhibited more methylation changes than patients aged >60 years (1 out of 6). Male patients (4 out of 13) were more susceptible to chemotherapy-induced methylation changes than female patients (4 out of 17).

The mutation is clinically significant as an important prognostic factor. Direct sequencing is the current standard method of mutation detection, however, it is quite costly and time consuming. The present study aimed to establish a highly sensitive quenching probe (QP) method to detect NPM1 mutations efficiently. Melting curve analysis was performed using a QP, following polymerase chain reaction for amplification of the involved region of the gene. The curve derived from the fluorescent intensity with respect to the temperature of OCI/AML3, a heterozygous NPM1 mutant AML cell line, was W-shaped with melting peaks at 61 degrees C and 68 degrees C. That of M-07e, the homozygous wild type cell line, was V-shaped with a melting peak at 68 degrees C. Thus, the curve derived from the mutant allele was easily discriminated from that of the wild-type allele. The mutant allele was detected in concentrations as low as 3% as determined by a subsequent sensitivity study. With a short testing time and a high sensitivity, this assay was applicable for NPM1-mutated AML patient samples and is appropriate for screening NPM1 mutations. It does require further examination as to whether it would be useful as a detection method for other mutant alleles since NPM1 mutations may consist of 61 known types of mutant sequences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the QP method for the detection of NPM1 mutations.",,"['Kawaguchi-Ihara, Noriko', 'Itoh, Mai', 'Murohashi, Ikuo', 'Tohda, Shuji']","['Kawaguchi-Ihara N', 'Itoh M', 'Murohashi I', 'Tohda S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan; Department of Health Sciences, Saitama Prefectural University, Koshigaya, Saitama 343-8540, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Health Sciences, Saitama Prefectural University, Koshigaya, Saitama 343-8540, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160211,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,,2016/04/14 06:00,2016/04/14 06:01,['2016/04/14 06:00'],"['2014/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2016.4225 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-4225 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2016 Apr;11(4):2429-2432. doi: 10.3892/ol.2016.4225.

Progress in modern medicine has led to an increased risk of therapeutic and diagnostic radiation exposure of patients. Although clear evidence of a radiation dose-dependent risk of chronic myeloid leukaemia, particularly for patients exposed to radiation at a young age, has been established, it is not known whether radiation exposure during diagnostic imaging also increases the risk of cancer. The present study reports the case of a patient who underwent several diagnostic imaging tests (including repeated chest radiography and computed tomography) for recurrent pneumothorax. At around one year subsequent to these tests, the patient was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia. The patient exhibited an increase in white blood cell count over time, and a bone marrow smear test showed a myeloid/erythroid ratio of 13.9:1. In addition, the qualitative breakpoint cluster region (BCR)/Abelson (ABL) gene test revealed positive results for BCR/ABL fusion (p210). Based on the data reported in the current case, research aimed at elucidating the potential risks associated with diagnostic radiation is urgently required.

However, the mechanism of its effects on megakaryocytes remains unclear. In the present study, the effect of decitabine on megakaryocyte maturation was investigated. A total of 20 MDS patients diagnosed with thrombocytopenia were enrolled, including 16 refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB)-1 patients and 4 RAEB-2 patients], in addition to 20 leukemia patients that had achieved complete remission and 20 healthy donors. Overall, 65% of MDS patients exhibited a response to decitabine, with an increase in platelet count identified in 80% of patients. In the MDS group, the mean platelet count was significantly increased following one cycle of decitabine chemotherapy (36.85+/-24.54 vs. 84.90+/-61; P=0.001); however, no significant difference in megakaryocyte number was identified prior to and following treatment. Additionally, bone marrow mononuclear cells of the MDS patients were cultured in vitro with various concentrations of decitabine (0.0, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 microM), and cluster of differentiation (CD)41 levels were examined via flow cytometry. The MDS and normal control groups exhibited the highest levels of CD41 expression following treatment with 2.0 microM decitabine (mean fluorescence intensity, 294.07+/-47.34 and 258.95+/-28.05, respectively). In conclusion, these results indicate that the DNA-hypomethylating agent, decitabine, may induce the differentiation and maturation of myelodysplastic megakaryocytes in MDS patients, even at low concentrations. Thus, the repeated administration of decitabine at lower doses in MDS patients may be useful in clinical practice, and may lead to the development of alternative treatments for other diseases of abnormal megakaryocyte differentiation, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, however, future studies are required to investigate this.",,"['Ding, Kai', 'Fu, Rong', 'Liu, Hui', 'Nachnani, Deepak Anil', 'Shao, Zong-Hong']","['Ding K', 'Fu R', 'Liu H', 'Nachnani DA', 'Shao ZH']","['Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, P.R.

While the treatment goal for younger patients is to achieve a cure with intensive therapeutic protocols, including standard chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, these goals are less well defined in the elderly population. This is in part due to the continuous decline in treatment outcomes with increasing age secondary to a number of patient-related and disease-specific factors, ranging from the presence of comorbid conditions to the higher frequency of adverse cytogenetic and unfavorable molecular markers. Although best supportive care, low-dose cytarabine, and epigenetic drugs represent well recognized treatment concepts, no universally accepted strategy for the management of elderly patients with AML exists. Therapeutic decisions are widely based on the patient's age, general health, the disease features, as well as the patient's personal wishes.

We examined the association of presenting symptoms on risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and hospital death among patients with cancer admitted through an emergency department (ED). METHODS: We queried MD Anderson Cancer Center databases for all patients who visited the ED in 2010. Presenting symptoms, ICU admissions, and hospital deaths were reviewed; patient data analyzed; and risk factors for ICU admission and hospital mortality identified. RESULTS: The main presenting symptoms were pain, fever, and respiratory distress. Of the patients with cancer who visited the ED, 5,362 (58%) were admitted to the hospital at least once (range, 1 to 13 admissions), 697 (13%) were admitted to the ICU at least once, and 587 (11%) died during hospitalization (31% of 233 patients with hematologic malignancies and 27% of 354 patients with solid tumors died in the ICU; P < .001). In multivariable logistic regression, presenting symptoms of respiratory distress or altered mental status; lung cancer, leukemia, or lymphoma; and nonwhite race were independent predictors of hospital death. Patients who died had a longer median length of hospital stay than patients discharged alive (14 v 6 days for hematologic malignancies and 7 v 5 days for solid tumors; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Patients with cancer admitted through an ED experience high ICU admission and hospital mortality rates. Patients with advanced cancer and respiratory distress or altered mental status may benefit from palliative care that avoids unnecessary interventions.",['Copyright (c) 2016 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Elsayem, Ahmed F', 'Merriman, Kelly W', 'Gonzalez, Carmen E', 'Yeung, Sai-Ching J', 'Chaftari, Patrick S', 'Reyes-Gibby, Cielito', 'Todd, Knox H']","['Elsayem AF', 'Merriman KW', 'Gonzalez CE', 'Yeung SC', 'Chaftari PS', 'Reyes-Gibby C', 'Todd KH']","['Department of Emergency Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX aelsayem@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160412,United States,J Oncol Pract,Journal of oncology practice,101261852,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cancer Care Facilities/*statistics & numerical data', 'Emergency Service, Hospital/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', '*Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units/*statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/14 06:00,2017/10/04 06:00,['2016/04/14 06:00'],"['2016/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/04 06:00 [medline]']","['JOP.2015.009019 [pii]', '10.1200/JOP.2015.009019 [doi]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pract. 2016 May;12(5):e554-63. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2015.009019.

Residual disease (RD) detection by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) was performed at day 15 and before consolidation therapy in 101 patients enrolled in the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haemato-Oncology AML 2004 study. A multicentre laboratory approach to RD analysis was used. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) was significantly different in patients with and without RD at both time points, using a 0.1% RD cut-off level. RD-negative and -positive patients after first induction showed a 5-year EFS of 65 +/- 7% and 22 +/- 7%, respectively (P < 0.001) and an OS of 77 +/- 6% (P = 0.025) and 51 +/- 8%. RD-negative and -positive patients at start of consolidation therapy had a 5-year EFS of 57 +/- 7% and 11 +/- 7%, respectively (P < 0.001) and an OS of 78 +/- 6% and 28 +/- 11%) (P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis only RD was significantly correlated with survival.

Some interactions have recently been discovered between XIAP and NF-kappaB pathways, but the effects of these inhibitors in combination have not been investigated yet. We have studied possible synergistic effects of embelin in combination with celastrol, in an acute myeloid leukemia model, HL-60 cell line. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytotoxicity of embelin and celastrol, separately and in combination, was determined by MTT assay and flow cytometry. Chou-Talalay's method was used to assess the synergistic effect of two components. Immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis of the two tumor marker proteins. (survivin and COX-2) was also performed to investigate downstream effects of two components. RESULTS: Analysis of MTT assay and flow cytometry showed that there is a substantial synergistic effect in some affected fractions of drug-treated HL-60. cells, while in other affected fractions a mild synergism or additive effect was observed. Immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis revealed that the expression of survivin and COX-2 proteins was reduced in treated cells. CONCLUSION: Embelin and celastrol showed potent antitumor activity and synergistic effects in combination. Therefore targeting XIAP and NF-kappaB pathways simultaneously can be investigated in more detail to make use of embelin and celastrol as a combination therapy of cancer.",,"['Pazhang, Yaghub', 'Jaliani, Hossein Zarei', 'Imani, Mehdi', 'Dariushnejad, Hassan']","['Pazhang Y', 'Jaliani HZ', 'Imani M', 'Dariushnejad H']","['Department of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,India,J Cancer Res Ther,Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,101249598,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Pentacyclic Triterpenes)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', 'L8GG98663L (celastrol)', 'SHC6U8F5ER (embelin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzoquinones/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Pentacyclic Triterpenes', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Triterpenes/*administration & dosage', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",2016/04/14 06:00,2016/12/24 06:00,['2016/04/14 06:00'],"['2016/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['JCanResTher_2016_12_1_155_150407 [pii]', '10.4103/0973-1482.150407 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Ther. 2016 Jan-Mar;12(1):155-60. doi: 10.4103/0973-1482.150407.,10.4103/0973-1482.150407 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) secrete CXCL12, the ligand for CXCR4, and protect B-ALL cells from cytotoxic drugs. Therefore, the therapeutic use of CXCR4 antagonists has been proposed to disrupt cross talk between B-ALL cells and the protective stroma. Because CXCR4 antagonists can have activating agonistic function, we compared the genetic and pharmacological deletion of CXCR4 in B-ALL cells, using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and CXCR4 antagonists that are in clinical use (plerixafor, BKT140). Both genetic and pharmacological CXCR4 inhibition significantly reduced B-ALL cell migration to CXCL12 gradients and beneath BMSC, and restored drug sensitivity to dexamethasone, vincristine and cyclophosphamide. NOD/SCID/IL-2rgammanull mice injected with CXCR4 gene-deleted B-ALL cells had significant delay in disease progression and superior survival when compared to control mice injected with CXCR4 wild-type B-ALL cells. These findings indicate that anti-leukaemia activity of CXCR4 antagonists is primarily due to CXCR4 inhibition, rather than agonistic activity, and corroborate that CXCR4 is an important target to overcome stroma-mediated drug resistance in B-ALL.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Randhawa, Shubhchintan', 'Cho, Byung S', 'Ghosh, Dipanjan', 'Sivina, Mariela', 'Koehrer, Stefan', 'Muschen, Markus', 'Peled, Amnon', 'Davis, Richard E', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Burger, Jan A']","['Randhawa S', 'Cho BS', 'Ghosh D', 'Sivina M', 'Koehrer S', 'Muschen M', 'Peled A', 'Davis RE', 'Konopleva M', 'Burger JA']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', ""Department of Haematology, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Centre, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Department of Lymphoma, The University of Texas M.

While many inhibitors targeting these pathways have been developed, the anti-leukemic effect was not as robust as expected. As part of the molecular link between PI3K/Akt and mTOR kinase, the role of Rheb1 in AML remains unexplored. Our study aims to explore the role of Rheb1 in AML and estimate whether Rheb1 could be a potential target of AML treatment. METHODS: The expressions of Rheb1 and other indicated genes were analyzed using real-time PCR. AML mouse model was established by retrovirus transduction. Leukemia cell properties and related signaling pathways were dissected by in vitro and in vivo studies. The transcriptional changes were analyzed via gene chip analysis. Molecular reagents including mTOR inhibitor and mTOR activator were used to evaluate the function of related signaling pathway in the mouse model. RESULTS: We observed that Rheb1 is overexpressed in AML patients and the change of Rheb1 level in AML patients is associated with their median survival. Using a Rheb1-deficient MLL-AF9 murine AML model, we revealed that Rheb1 deletion prolonged the survival of AML mice by weakening LSC function. In addition, Rheb1 deletion arrested cell cycle progression and enhanced apoptosis of AML cells. Furthermore, while Rheb1 deletion reduced mTORC1 activity in AML cells, additional rapamycin treatment further decreased mTORC1 activity and increased the apoptosis of Rheb1 (Delta/Delta) AML cells. The mTOR activator 3BDO partially rescued mTORC1 signaling and inhibited apoptosis in Rheb1 (Delta/Delta) AML cells.

While studying the regulation of TCL1 expression, we identified the microRNA cluster miR-4521/3676 and discovered that these two microRNAs are associated with tRNA sequences and that this region can produce two small RNAs, members of a recently identified class of small noncoding RNAs, tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs). We further proved that miR-3676 and miR-4521 are tsRNAs using Northern blot analysis. We found that, like ts-3676, ts-4521 is down-regulated and mutated in CLL. Analysis of lung cancer samples revealed that both ts-3676 and ts-4521 are down-regulated and mutated in patient tumor samples. Because tsRNAs are similar in nature to piRNAs [P-element-induced wimpy testis (Piwi)-interacting small RNAs], we investigated whether ts-3676 and ts-4521 can interact with Piwi proteins and found these two tsRNAs in complexes containing Piwi-like protein 2 (PIWIL2). To determine whether other tsRNAs are involved in cancer, we generated a custom microarray chip containing 120 tsRNAs 16 bp or more in size. Microarray hybridization experiments revealed tsRNA signatures in CLL and lung cancer, indicating that, like microRNAs, tsRNAs may have an oncogenic and/or tumor-suppressor function in hematopoietic malignancies and solid tumors.

HSCs exist alongside several cell types in the bone marrow microenvironment that comprise the stem cell niche. These cells regulate HSC function and can contribute to leukemogenesis. In this review we will discuss recent advances in this field. RECENT FINDINGS: In the vascular niche, arteriolar and sinusoidal zones appear to play distinct roles in HSC function. Endothelial cells modulate HSC function via Notch and other signaling pathways. In the endosteal niche multiple cell types regulate HSCs. Osteoblasts promote HSC quiescence via secreted factors and possibly physical interactions, whereas adipocytes may oppose HSC quiescence. The balance of these opposing factors depends on metabolic cues. Feedback from HSC-derived cells, including macrophages and megakaryocytes also appears to regulate HSC quiescence. Dysfunction of the bone marrow microenvironment, including mesenchymal stem cell-derived stromal cells and the sympathetic nervous system can induce or alter the progression of hematologic malignancies. SUMMARY: Many cell types in the bone marrow microenvironment affect HSC function and contribute to malignancy. Further understanding how HSCs are regulated by the microenvironment has clinical implications for stem cell transplantation and other therapies for hematologic malignancies.",,"['Seshadri, Madhav', 'Qu, Cheng-Kui']","['Seshadri M', 'Qu CK']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Self Renewal', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism', '*Cellular Microenvironment', 'Endothelial Cells/metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Niche']",2016/04/14 06:00,2017/10/20 06:00,['2016/04/13 06:00'],"['2016/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000251 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2016 Jul;23(4):339-45. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000251.,10.1097/MOH.0000000000000251 [doi],,,PMC5086033,,,,,,"['R01 HL068212/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL130995/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,['NIHMS802961'],,,,,,,,,

Gene Ontology analysis showed that differential regulation of genes involved in pathways for leukemogenesis, apoptosis, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and antigen processing/presentation may offer a survival benefit to TCRgammadelta+T-ALL patients. Genes involved in disease biology and having equal expression in both the subgroups, were further analysed for mutations and CNV using droplet digital PCR. TCRgammadelta+T-ALL patients exhibited differential level of mutations for NOTCH1 and IKZF3; however BRAF mutations were detected at equal levels in both the subgroups. Although TCRgammadelta+T-ALL patients with these mutations demonstrated improved disease-free survival (DFS) as compared TCRalphabeta+T-ALL patients, it was not statistically significant. Patients with homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/CDKN2B showed poor DFS in each subgroup. TCRgammadelta+T-ALL patients with wild type/heterozygous deletion of CDKN2A/CDKN2B possess significantly better DFS over TCRalphabeta+T-ALL patients (p=0.017 and 0.045, respectively). Thus, the present study has for the first time demonstrated TCRgammadelta clonality and CDKN2A/CDKN2B CNV together as potential prognostic markers in management of T-ALL.

Lentiviral transduction of the BCR/ABL gene in Ba/F3 cells increased EZH2 levels in parallel with phosphorylation of STAT5. Notably, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that STAT5A bound to a promoter region of the EZH2 gene, resulting in an increase in the transcriptional activity of EZH2 in leukemia cells. Importantly, downregulation of EZH2 by short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) inhibited the expression of XIAP and increased the miR-219 levels associated with a decrease in hypermethylation of miR-219-1 CpG islands. Moreover, overexpression of miR-219 decreased the levels of XIAP in CML cells. Since the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of XIAP contains miR219-5p-complementary binding site, miR-219 might modulate the expression of XIAP through binding of miR-219 on the 3'-UTR of XIAP. Taken together, BCR/ABL positively regulates the expression of EZH2 via STAT5 signaling. EZH2 modulates epigenetic changes at DNA methylated regions encoding miR-219 and downregulates the level of miR-219, resulting in upregulation of XIAP.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigated the effects of dasatinib on signaling mechanisms driving-resistance in imatinib-resistant CML cell line K562 (K562R(IMT)). Compared with K562 control cells, exsomal release, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/ mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and autophagic activity were increased significantly in K562R(IMT) cells and mTOR-independent beclin-1/Vps34 signaling was shown to be involved in exosomal release in these cells. We found that Notch1 activation-mediated reduction of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) was responsible for the increased Akt/mTOR activities in K562R(IMT) cells and treatment with Notch1 gamma-secretase inhibitor prevented activation of Akt/mTOR. In addition, suppression of mTOR activity by rapamycin decreased the level of activity of p70S6K, induced upregulation of p53 and caspase 3, and led to increase of apoptosis in K562R(IMT) cells. Inhibition of autophagy by spautin-1 or beclin-1 knockdown decreased exosomal release, but did not affect apoptosis in K562R(IMT) cells. In summary, in K562R(IMT) cells dasatinib promoted apoptosis through downregulation of Akt/mTOR activities, while preventing exosomal release and inhibiting autophagy by downregulating expression of beclin-1 and Vps34. Our findings reveal distinct dasatinib-induced mechanisms of apoptotic response and exosomal release in imatinib-resistant CML cells.",,"['Liu, Juan', 'Zhang, Yujing', 'Liu, Aichun', 'Wang, Jinghua', 'Li, Lianqiao', 'Chen, Xi', 'Gao, Xinyu', 'Xue, Yanming', 'Zhang, Xiaomin', 'Liu, Yao']","['Liu J', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu A', 'Wang J', 'Li L', 'Chen X', 'Gao X', 'Xue Y', 'Zhang X', 'Liu Y']","['Department of Hematology, Harbin Medical University Second Hospital, Harbin 150086, China. liujuancheng79@163.com.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Harbin Medical University Second Hospital, Harbin 150086, China. zhangyujing73@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin 150086, China. liuaichun65@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Harbin Medical University Second Hospital, Harbin 150086, China. jinghua_wang57@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin 150086, China. lilianqiao85@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Harbin Medical University Second Hospital, Harbin 150086, China. chenxihan78@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Harbin Medical University Second Hospital, Harbin 150086, China. gaoxinyujiang83@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Harbin Medical University Second Hospital, Harbin 150086, China. xueyanming82@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Harbin Medical University Second Hospital, Harbin 150086, China. zhangxiaominli81@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Harbin Medical University Second Hospital, Harbin 150086, China. liuyaoliu87@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160408,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dasatinib/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Exosomes/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism']",2016/04/14 06:00,2016/12/16 06:00,['2016/04/13 06:00'],"['2016/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/25 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms17040531 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms17040531 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2016 Apr 8;17(4):531. doi: 10.3390/ijms17040531.,10.3390/ijms17040531 [doi] E531 [pii],,,PMC4848987,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Imatinib-resistant K562', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'dasatinib', 'exosome', 'mTOR']",,,,,,,,,,,,

New monoclonal antibodies targeting immune checkpoints are showing meaningful responses in the treatment of relapsed and refractory Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The basis for success of anti-PD-1 therapy appears to be expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells and cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME). While adverse events associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors are capable of generating auto-immune phenomena, in general these therapies are well tolerated. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors discuss the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors and activators which hold promise as useful therapies in malignancies of hematologic origin, since many exploit endogenous pathways to induce tolerance. By programming the immune response to attack hematologic malignancies, unique regimens can be developed to optimally treat patients with curative potential. EXPERT OPINION: The utilization of immune checkpoint targeting agents to boost the innate and acquired immune systems to eradicate human malignancies represents a unique opportunity to develop novel therapies with increased clinical efficacy.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-seven splenic biopsy specimens taken from patients with different B-cell lymphoproliferative diseases were examined in the Hematology Research Center in 2013-2014. The diagnosis of SRPL was based on the morphological, immunohistochemical, immunophenotypic, and molecular examinations of the splenic biopsy specimens, blood and bone marrow (BM) tests in 4 (4.6%) cases. RESULTS: There was significant splenomegaly in all SRPL cases, lymphocytosis in 56 to 94% (leukocytes, 55 and 75.109/l in 2 cases), circulation of hairy lymphocytes with the phenotypes CD20+ (markedly), CD11c+/+/-, CD103+/+/- (weakly), LAIR-1+, CD25-, CD5-, CD10-, and CD23-, which did not contain tartate-resistant acid phosphatase, without BRAFV600E mutation, BM with insignificant lymphoid infiltration of CD20+, CD25-, Annexin 1-, and Cyclin D1-. The weight of the spleen averaged 3900 g (1450-9500 g); its tissue exhibited lymphoid infiltration of the red pulp with the phenotypes CD20+, DBA.44+, CD25-, Annexin1-, Cyclin D1-, CD103-, CD123-, CD27-, focal capital ES, CyrillicD11c+/-, and TRAP+/-. Four patients (2 after splenectomy (SE) and 2 after SE and chemotherapy with cladribine and rituximab) are being followed up in remission. CONCLUSION: SRPL is a rare disease that should be presumed to be in significant splenomegaly and lymphocytosis with hairy lymphocytes, which have only some markers for classical hairy cell leukemia (HCL), in minor BM lesion. SE is the standard for diagnosis and treatment. The differential diagnosis of SRPL with HCL has clear criteria and that with HCL-v is undetected.",,"['Al-Radi, L S', 'Moiseeva, T N', 'Julhakyan, H L', 'Ntanishyan, K I', 'Kovrigina, A M', 'Glebova, S M', 'Lugovskaya, S A', 'Dvirnyk, V N', 'Khvastunova, A N', 'Yakutik, I A', 'Savchenko, V G']","['Al-Radi LS', 'Moiseeva TN', 'Julhakyan HL', 'Ntanishyan KI', 'Kovrigina AM', 'Glebova SM', 'Lugovskaya SA', 'Dvirnyk VN', 'Khvastunova AN', 'Yakutik IA', 'Savchenko VG']","['National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'Russian Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'Dmitry Rogachev Federal Research-and-Clinical Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.']",['rus'],['Journal Article'],,Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biopsy', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Spleen', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*diagnosis']",2016/04/14 06:00,2018/08/28 06:00,['2016/04/13 06:00'],"['2016/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.17116/terarkh201688453-60 [doi]'],ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2016;88(4):53-60. doi: 10.17116/terarkh201688453-60.,10.17116/terarkh201688453-60 [doi],Opyt izucheniya limfomy krasnoi pul'py selezenki.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Venetoclax (ABT-199) is a small-molecule selective inhibitor of BCL2 currently in clinical trials for CLL and other malignancies. In conjunction with the phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial of venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL (M12-175), we investigated the mechanism of action of venetoclax in vivo, explored whether in vitro sensitivity assays or BH3 profiling correlated with in vivo responses in patients, and determined whether loss of TP53 function affected responses in vitro and in vivo. In all samples tested, venetoclax induced death of CLL cells in vitro at concentrations achievable in vivo, with cell death evident within 4 hours. Apoptotic CLL cells were detected in vivo 6 or 24 hours after a single 20-mg or 50-mg dose in some patients. The extent of mitochondrial depolarization by a BIM BH3 peptide in vitro was correlated with percentage reduction of CLL in the blood and bone marrow in vivo, whereas the half lethal concentration derived from standard cytotoxicity assays was not. CLL cell death in vitro and the depth of clinical responses were independent of deletion of chromosome 17p, TP53 mutation, and TP53 function.

CASE REPORT: A 76-year-old female was referred to our Hospital for resection of a gastric adenoma that was suspicious for malignancy. Routine preoperative laboratory studies showed severe neutropenia and increased atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. One day before surgery, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was administered. Laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomy was performed. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged after 10 days. The histopathological findings revealed well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (pT1a, pN0, and stage IA). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic gastrectomy may be considered a primary approach in patients with neutropenia because it is associated with lower risk of postoperative infection and a lower mortality rate compared to open resection.","['Copyright(c) 2016 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']","['Nakashima, Yuichiro', 'Nakanishi, Ryota', 'Sugiyama, Masahiko', 'Ohgaki, Kippei', 'Sonoda, Hideto', 'Saeki, Hiroshi', 'Oki, Eiji', 'Matsuyama, Ayumi', 'Maeda, Takashi', 'Tsutsui, Shinichi', 'Matsuda, Hiroyuki', 'Ishida, Teruyoshi', 'Maehara, Yoshihiko']","['Nakashima Y', 'Nakanishi R', 'Sugiyama M', 'Ohgaki K', 'Sonoda H', 'Saeki H', 'Oki E', 'Matsuyama A', 'Maeda T', 'Tsutsui S', 'Matsuda H', 'Ishida T', 'Maehara Y']","['Department of Surgery and Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, Japan Department of Surgery, Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital and Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery and Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery and Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery and Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery and Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery and Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery and Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital and Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital and Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital and Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital and Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital and Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery and Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, Japan maehara@surg2.med.kyushu-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/pathology', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Gastrectomy/methods', 'Humans', 'Laparoscopy/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology/*surgery', 'Neutropenia/*pathology/*surgery', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*pathology/*surgery']",2016/04/14 06:00,2016/08/23 06:00,['2016/04/13 06:00'],"['2015/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [medline]']",['36/4/1779 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2016 Apr;36(4):1779-83.,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Gastric cancer', 'chronic lymphocytic lymphoma', 'laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomy', 'neutropenia']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To account for the effect of SCT and determine the impact of chemotherapy alone, the National Cancer Data Base from 1998-2011 was analyzed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with AML from 1998-2011 aged 18-64 years were included. Chi-square analysis was used to assess the association between treatment and factors investigated. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess overall survival. Log-rank methods were used to determine factors significant for survival. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to determine the effect of chemotherapy alone, and both chemotherapy and SCT on survival while adjusting for other variables. RESULTS: A total of 34,816 patients from the National Cancer Database were eligible for this study. Eighty-four percent of patients received chemotherapy alone, 8.3% no chemotherapy or SCT, and 7.5 % received both chemotherapy and SCT. Five-year survival for patients without chemotherapy without SCT was 12%, survival for the group treated with chemotherapy alone was 37.8% and for those receiving both chemotherapy and SCT was 44.1%. Treatment with chemotherapy only and chemotherapy plus SCT had a hazard ratio for death of 0.42 and 0.35 compared to no chemotherapy or SCT. Advanced age, male sex, Black race, diagnosis prior to 2004, multiple comorbidities, Medicare insurance, Medicaid insurance, no insurance, lower income and low education level, distance less than 30 miles from treatment Center, diagnosis and treatment at same facility, were independently associated with worse survival. CONCLUSION: Survival analysis of AML in the National Cancer Database showed multiple factors to be independently associated with survival. Outcomes based on treatment suggest an improved survival when utilizing chemotherapy and SCT as the primary treatment modality.","['Copyright(c) 2016 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']","['Master, Samip', 'Mansour, Richard', 'Devarakonda, Srinivas S', 'Shi, Zhenzhen', 'Mills, Glenn', 'Shi, Runhua']","['Master S', 'Mansour R', 'Devarakonda SS', 'Shi Z', 'Mills G', 'Shi R']","['Department of Medicine & Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, Louisiana State University Health Shreveport, Shreveport, LA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Medicine & Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, Louisiana State University Health Shreveport, Shreveport, LA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Medicine & Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, Louisiana State University Health Shreveport, Shreveport, LA, U.S.A.', 'Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, U.S.A.', 'Department of Medicine & Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, Louisiana State University Health Shreveport, Shreveport, LA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Medicine & Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, Louisiana State University Health Shreveport, Shreveport, LA, U.S.A. rshi@lsuhsc.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/14 06:00,2016/08/23 06:00,['2016/04/13 06:00'],"['2015/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [medline]']",['36/4/1719 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2016 Apr;36(4):1719-27.,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'survival', 'transplant']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The study covered 15 anticancer drugs, conventional and new-generation. Well-expressed synergistic cytotoxic effects were observed after treatment of leukemia lymphocytes (Jurkat) with DHA in combination with: barasertib, lonafarnib, everolimus, and palbociclib. We selected two synergistic combinations, DHA with everolimus or barasertib, and investigated their effects on viability of normal lymphocytes, as well as on the production of ROS and induction of apoptosis in both cell lines (leukemia and normal). At the selected concentrations, DHA, everolimus and barasertib (applied separately) were cytotoxic towards leukemia lymphocytes, but not normal lymphocytes. In leukemia cells, the cytotoxicity of combinations was accompanied by strong induction of apoptosis and production of ROS. In normal lymphocytes, drugs alone and in combination with DHA did not affect the level of ROS and did not induce apoptosis. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to report synergistic ROS-dependent cytotoxicity between DHA and new-generation anticancer drugs, such as everolimus and barasertib, that is cancer cell-specific (particularly for acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells Jurkat). These combinations are harmless to normal lymphocytes and do not induce abnormal production of ROS in these cells. The data suggest that DHA could be used as a supplementary component in anticancer chemotherapy, allowing therapeutic doses of everolimus and barasertib to be reduced, minimizing their side-effects.","['Copyright(c) 2016 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']","['Zhelev, Zhivko', 'Ivanova, Donika', 'Lazarova, Desislava', 'Aoki, Ichio', 'Bakalova, Rumiana', 'Saga, Tsuneo']","['Zhelev Z', 'Ivanova D', 'Lazarova D', 'Aoki I', 'Bakalova R', 'Saga T']","['Medical Faculty, Trakia University, Stara Zagora, Bulgaria Institute of Biophysics and Biomedical Engineering, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'Medical Faculty, Trakia University, Stara Zagora, Bulgaria.', 'Medical Faculty, Sofia University ""St. Kliment Ohridski"", Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'Molecular Imaging Center, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Inage-ku, Chiba, Japan.', 'Medical Faculty, Sofia University ""St. Kliment Ohridski"", Sofia, Bulgaria Molecular Imaging Center, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Inage-ku, Chiba, Japan bakalova@nirs.go.jp.', 'Molecular Imaging Center, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Inage-ku, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0', '(2-((3-((4-((5-(2-((3-fluorophenyl)amino)-2-oxoethyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)amino)quina', 'zolin-7-yl)oxy)propyl)(ethyl)amino)ethyl dihydrogen phosphate)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organophosphates)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '25167-62-8 (Docosahexaenoic Acids)', '9HW64Q8G6G (Everolimus)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Everolimus/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Organophosphates/pharmacology', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2016/04/14 06:00,2016/08/23 06:00,['2016/04/13 06:00'],"['2016/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [medline]']",['36/4/1673 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2016 Apr;36(4):1673-82.,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['DHA', 'Docosahexaenoic acid', 'barasertib', 'everolimus', 'leukemia lymphocytes', 'reactive oxygen species']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to evaluate the mechanistic pathways of anoikis resistance in human lung cancer cells and test the possible therapeutic effect of renieramycin M (RM) from the sponge Xestospongia sp. in conversion of anoikis resistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anoikis-resistant H460 (AR_H460) lung cancer cells in a detached condition were treated with RM at subtoxic concentrations for 24 h. Cell viability, cell morphology, and expression of the proteins involved in survival and apoptotic pathways were determined. RESULTS: Anoikis resistance in H460 cells is mediated through the up-regulation of survival and anti-apoptotic proteins, namely phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), phosphorylated ATP-dependent tyrosine kinase (p-AKT), B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2), and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL1). RM significantly reduced cell viability and inhibited spontaneous aggregation of AR_H460 cells. Western blot analysis revealed that RM suppressed the levels of survival proteins p-ERK and p-AKT and anti-apoptotic proteins BCL2 and MCL1. CONCLUSION: RM is a potential anti-metastatic agent by sensitizing anoikis-resistant lung cancer cells to anoikis by the suppression of anoikis-resistance mechanisms.","['Copyright(c) 2016 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']","['Sirimangkalakitti, Natchanun', 'Chamni, Supakarn', 'Suwanborirux, Khanit', 'Chanvorachote, Pithi']","['Sirimangkalakitti N', 'Chamni S', 'Suwanborirux K', 'Chanvorachote P']","['Center for Bioactive Natural Products from Marine Organisms and Endophytic Fungi, Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Pathumwan, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Center for Bioactive Natural Products from Marine Organisms and Endophytic Fungi, Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Pathumwan, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Center for Bioactive Natural Products from Marine Organisms and Endophytic Fungi, Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Pathumwan, Bangkok, Thailand pithi_chan@yahoo.com khanit.s@pharm.chula.ac.th.', 'Cell-Based Drug and Health Product Development Research Unit, Chulalongkorn University, Pathumwan, Bangkok, Thailand Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Pathumwan, Bangkok, Thailand pithi_chan@yahoo.com khanit.s@pharm.chula.ac.th.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tetrahydroisoquinolines)', '0 (renieramycin M)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Anoikis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Tetrahydroisoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2016/04/14 06:00,2016/08/23 06:00,['2016/04/13 06:00'],"['2016/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [medline]']",['36/4/1665 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2016 Apr;36(4):1665-71.,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Renieramycin M', 'anoikis resistance', 'anoikis-sensitizing activity', 'anti-matastasis', 'lung cancer']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Identifying the mechanism of lymphomagenesis and cell-of-origin from which PTCLs arise is crucial for the development of efficient treatment strategies. In addition to the well-described thymic lymphomas, we found that p53-deficient mice also developed mature PTCLs that did not originate from conventional T cells but from CD1d-restricted NKT cells. PTCLs showed phenotypic features of activated NKT cells, such as PD-1 up-regulation and loss of NK1.1 expression. Injections of heat-killed Streptococcus pneumonia, known to express glycolipid antigens activating NKT cells, increased the incidence of these PTCLs, whereas Escherichia coli injection did not. Gene expression profile analyses indicated a significant down-regulation of genes in the TCR signaling pathway in PTCL, a common feature of chronically activated T cells. Targeting TCR signaling pathway in lymphoma cells, either with cyclosporine A or anti-CD1d blocking antibody, prolonged mice survival. Importantly, we identified human CD1d-restricted lymphoma cells within Vdelta1 TCR-expressing PTCL.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Southwest Oncology Group S0816 (Fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET/CT Imaging and Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Additional Chemotherapy and G-CSF in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Hodgkin Lymphoma) trial enrolled 358 HIV-negative patients between July 1, 2009, and December 2, 2012. A PET scan was performed after two initial cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) and was labeled PET2. PET2-negative patients (Deauville score 1 to 3) received an additional four cycles of ABVD, whereas PET2-positive patients (Deauville score 4 to 5) were switched to escalated bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (eBEACOPP) for six cycles. Among 336 eligible and evaluable patients, the median age was 32 years (range, 18 to 60 years), with 52% stage III, 48% stage IV, 49% International Prognostic Score 0 to 2, and 51% score 3 to 7. RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-six of the enrolled patients were evaluable. Central review of the interim PET2 scan was performed in 331 evaluable patients, with 271 (82%) PET2-negative and 60 (18%) PET2-positive. Of 60 eligible PET2-positive patients, 49 switched to eBEACOPP as planned and 11 declined. With a median follow-up of 39.7 months, the Kaplan-Meier estimate for 2-year overall survival was 98% (95% CI, 95% to 99%), and the 2-year estimate for progression-free survival (PFS) was 79% (95% CI, 74% to 83%). The 2-year estimate for PFS in the subset of patients who were PET2-positive after two cycles of ABVD was 64% (95% CI, 50% to 75%). Both nonhematologic and hematologic toxicities were greater in the eBEACOPP arm than in the continued ABVD arm. CONCLUSION: Response-adapted therapy based on interim PET imaging after two cycles of ABVD seems promising with a 2-year PFS of 64% for PET2-positive patients, which is much higher than the expected 2-year PFS of 15% to 30%.",['(c) 2016 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Press, Oliver W', 'Li, Hongli', 'Schoder, Heiko', 'Straus, David J', 'Moskowitz, Craig H', 'LeBlanc, Michael', 'Rimsza, Lisa M', 'Bartlett, Nancy L', 'Evens, Andrew M', 'Mittra, Erik S', 'LaCasce, Ann S', 'Sweetenham, John W', 'Barr, Paul M', 'Fanale, Michelle A', 'Knopp, Michael V', 'Noy, Ariela', 'Hsi, Eric D', 'Cook, James R', 'Lechowicz, Mary Jo', 'Gascoyne, Randy D', 'Leonard, John P', 'Kahl, Brad S', 'Cheson, Bruce D', 'Fisher, Richard I', 'Friedberg, Jonathan W']","['Press OW', 'Li H', 'Schoder H', 'Straus DJ', 'Moskowitz CH', 'LeBlanc M', 'Rimsza LM', 'Bartlett NL', 'Evens AM', 'Mittra ES', 'LaCasce AS', 'Sweetenham JW', 'Barr PM', 'Fanale MA', 'Knopp MV', 'Noy A', 'Hsi ED', 'Cook JR', 'Lechowicz MJ', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Leonard JP', 'Kahl BS', 'Cheson BD', 'Fisher RI', 'Friedberg JW']","['Oliver W.

This study aims to optimize and validate the 8-color CLL-MRD assay, with the desired outcome of it being implemented in St. James's Hospital Dublin and potentially other hospitals worldwide as the most accurate flow-based B-CLL-MRD detection currently available. METHOD: The single-tube assay incorporates 8 antibodies, namely, CD5, CD3, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD43, CD79b, and CD81. We tested a combination of 52 peripheral blood and bone marrow specimens with the antibodies to develop a sequential gating strategy that uses the typical phenotype of B-CLL cells to enumerate small residual B-CLL populations after treatment, effectively distinguishing them from the normal polyclonal and regenerating B-cells. We performed sensitivity assays via a set of serial dilutions and compared the assay with the current International Standardized Approach (ISA) method currently in use for MRD testing in B-CLL. RESULTS: The 52 specimens that we analyzed displayed MRD levels from 0.004% through 78.000%. Dilutional studies demonstrated detection of disease to a level of 0.00702%, and an excellent correlation was achieved against the current ISA method (R(2)= 0.991).

It is associated with serum or urine monoclonal protein and organ damage including renal failure, anaemia, hypercalcaemia and bone lesions. Despite recent improvements MM still remains an incurable disease. Previous studies have shown that the adoptive transfer of autologous T-cells modified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) is effective in cases of acute and chronic lymphoid leukaemia. However, the adjustment of CAR-T-cell therapy to MM is hindered by the scarcity of antigens specific to the tumour plasma cells. Most candidate targets are shared by healthy tissues, and entail high risks of toxicity. Therefore several strategies have been proposed to regulate CAR-T-cell function as well as to enhance CAR-T-cell specificity against tumour cells. In this article we summarize the surface markers that have been investigated as targets to eliminate MM plasma cells and the MM-specific CARs that have been developed to date. Then we describe the different CAR-T-cell designs that could be applied in the case of MM to circumvent current problems of toxicity.",['(c) 2016 Authors; published by Portland Press Limited.'],"['Martinez-Cingolani, Carolina', 'Bories, Jean Christophe']","['Martinez-Cingolani C', 'Bories JC']","[""INSERM 1126 Unit, Institut Universitaire d'hematologie, Hopital Saint Louis, 75475 Paris, France carolina.martinez-cingolani@inserm.fr."", ""INSERM 1126 Unit, Institut Universitaire d'hematologie, Hopital Saint Louis, 75475 Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2016/04/14 06:00,2016/12/31 06:00,['2016/04/13 06:00'],"['2016/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['BST20150280 [pii]', '10.1042/BST20150280 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2016 Apr 15;44(2):397-405. doi: 10.1042/BST20150280.,10.1042/BST20150280 [doi],,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['antibody', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'multiple myeloma', 'plasma cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, in patients with lymphoma durable responses are still rare and heavy preconditioning required. Apoptosis resistance is considered a hallmark of cancer, often conveyed by a halted apoptosis signalling. Tumours regularly skew the balance of the components of the apoptotic machinery either through up-regulating anti-apoptotic proteins or silencing pro-apoptotic ones. Malignant B-cells frequently up-regulate anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins leading to therapy resistance. CAR T-cells kill tumour cells via apoptosis induction and their efficacy may be affected by the level of Bcl-2 family proteins. Hence, there is an interesting possibility to increase the effect of CAR T-cell therapy by combining it with apoptosis inhibitor blockade agents. Compounds that inhibit Bcl-2, B-cell lymphoma extra large (Bcl-xL) and Bcl-2-like protein 2 (Bcl-w), can restore execution of apoptosis in tumour cells or sensitize them to other apoptosis-dependent treatments. Hence, there is a great interest to combine such agents with CAR T-cell therapy to potentiate the effect of CAR T-cell killing.

Here, we show that BET inhibition causes a rapid release of Mediator from a subset of cis-regulatory elements in the genome of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. These sites of Mediator eviction were highly correlated with transcriptional suppression of neighboring genes, which are enriched for targets of the transcription factor MYB and for functions related to leukemogenesis. A shRNA screen of Mediator in AML cells identified the MED12, MED13, MED23, and MED24 subunits as performing a similar regulatory function to BRD4 in this context, including a shared role in sustaining a block in myeloid maturation. These findings suggest that the interaction between BRD4 and Mediator has functional importance for gene-specific transcriptional activation and for AML maintenance.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

ChIP-seq in mouse THY1(+) spermatogonia identified 4176 PLZF-bound and 2696 SALL4-bound genes, including 1149 and 515 that were unique to each factor, respectively, and 1295 that were bound by both factors. PLZF and SALL4 preferentially bound gene promoters and introns, respectively. Motif analyses identified putative PLZF and SALL4 binding sequences, but rarely both at shared sites, indicating significant non-autonomous binding in any given cell. Indeed, the majority of PLZF/SALL4 shared sites contained only PLZF motifs. SALL4 also bound gene introns at sites containing motifs for the differentiation factor DMRT1. Moreover, mRNA levels for both unique and shared target genes involved in both SSC self-renewal and differentiation were suppressed following SALL4 or PLZF knockdown. Together, these data reveal the full profile of PLZF and SALL4 regulatory targets in undifferentiated spermatogonia, including SSCs, which will help elucidate mechanisms controlling the earliest cell fate decisions in spermatogenesis.",['(c) 2016.

Secondary malignancies have been associated with cranial radiation exposure. We present our experience with intracranial radiation-induced meningioma (RIM) and discuss the implications of its presentation and natural history for patient management. Patients diagnosed with meningioma who had received radiation therapy between 1960 and 2014 were identified. Records were retrospectively reviewed for details of radiation exposure, previous malignancies, meningioma subtypes, multiplicity and pathologic descriptions, treatment and follow-up. Thirty patients were diagnosed with RIM. Initial malignancies included acute lymphocytic leukemia (33.3%), medulloblastoma (26.7%) and glioma (16.7%) at a mean age of 8.1years (range 0.04-33years). The mean radiation dose was 34Gy (range 16-60Gy) and latency time to meningioma was 26years (range 8-51years). Twenty-one patients (70%) underwent surgery. Of these, 57.1% of tumors were World Health Organization (WHO) grade I while 42.9% were WHO II (atypical). The mean MIB-1 labeling index for patients with WHO I tumors was 5.44%, with 33.3% exhibiting at least 5% staining. Mean follow-up after meningioma diagnosis was 5.8years. Mortality was zero during the follow-up period. Meningioma is an important long-term complication of therapeutic radiation. While more aggressive pathology occurs more frequently in RIM than in sporadic meningioma, it remains unclear whether this translates into an effect on survival.

METHODS: One hundred sixty-five consecutive adults with common B-cell ALL were tested for IKZF1 deletion and for BCR/ABL. Deletions in IKZF1 were detected using multiplex RQ-PCR, multiplex fluorescent PCR, sequence analysis and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). BCR/ABL was detected using RQ-PCR. All subjects received chemotherapy and some also received an allotransplant and tyrosine kinase-inhibitors. Multivariate analyses were done to identify associations between IKZF1 deletion and other variables on non-relapse mortality (NRM), cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), leukemia-free survival (LFS) and survival. RESULTS: Amongst subjects achieving complete remission those with IKZF1 deletion had similar 5-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) (11% [2-20%] vs. 16% [4-28%]; P = 0.736), a higher 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) (55% [35-76%] vs. 25% [12-38%]; P = 0.004), and worse 5-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) (33% [16-52%] vs. 59% [42-73%]; P = 0.012) and survival (48% [33-62%] vs. 75% [57-86%]; P = 0.002). In multivariate analyses IKZF1 deletion was associated with an increased relapse (relative risk [RR] =2.7, [1.4-5.2]; P = 0.002), a higher risk of treatment-failure (inverse of LFS; RR = 2.1, [1.2-3.6]; P = 0.007) and a higher risk of death (RR = 2.8, [1.5-5.5]; P = 0.002). The adverse impact of IKZF1 deletion on outcomes was stronger in subjects without vs. with BCR-ABL1 and in subjects receiving chemotherapy-only vs. an allotransplant. CONCLUSIONS: IKZF1 deletion was independently-associated with a higher relapse risk and worse LFS and survival in adults with common B-cell ALL after adjusting for other prognostic variables and differences in therapies. These data suggest IKZF1 deletion may be a useful prognostic variable in adults with common B-cell ALL, especially in persons without BCR-ABL1 and those receiving chemotherapy-only. Transplants appear to overcome the adverse impact of IKZF1 deletion on therapy-outcomes but confirmation in a randomized study is needed.

While imatinib remains to be the first line therapy, about 30% of patients develop resistance or intolerance to this drug and are recommended to switch to other TKIs. Nilotinib and dasatinib are currently implemented into the first line therapy and other inhibitors have already entered the clinical practice. This opens further questions on how to select the best TKI for each patient not only during the therapy but also at diagnosis. The individualized therapy concept requires a reliable establishment of prognosis and prediction of response to the available TKIs. We tested the ex vivo sensitivity of patient primary leukocytes to imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib - two concentrations of each inhibitor for 48h incubation - and we evaluated the usefulness of such tests for the clinical practice. Besides reflecting the actual sensitivity to the therapy, our optimized simple tests were able to predict the outcome in 90/87% of patients, for the next 12/24months, respectively. According to these results, the presented ex vivo testing could help clinicians to select the appropriate drug for each patient at diagnosis and also at any time of the therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Previous data from our group has shown that in an SDF-1/CXCL12 transgenic mouse model, lineage(-) Sca-1(+) c-Kit(+) (LSK) bone marrow cells have reduced mitochondrial membrane potential versus wild-type. These results suggested that SDF-1/CXCL12 may function to keep mitochondrial respiration low in immature blood cells in the bone marrow. Low mitochondrial metabolism helps to maintain low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can influence differentiation. To test whether SDF-1/CXCL12 regulates mitochondrial metabolism, we employed the human leukemia cell line HL-60, that expresses high levels of the SDF-1/CXCL12 receptor, CXCR4, as a model of hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro. We treated HL-60 cells with SDF-1/CXCL12 for 2 and 24h. Oxygen consumption rates (OCR), mitochondrial-associated ATP production, mitochondrial mass, and mitochondrial membrane potential of HL-60 cells were significantly reduced at 2h and increased at 24h as compared to untreated control cells. These biphasic effects of SDF-1/CXCL12 were reproduced with lineage negative primary mouse bone marrow cells, suggesting a novel function of SDF-1/CXCL12 in modulating mitochondrial respiration by regulating mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, ATP production and mitochondrial content.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

To better evaluate their potential as source of effective NK cells, we revisited the study of NK cell repertoire from a large cohort of CB samples. Our study showed that the CB NK cell repertoire appears to be constructed early, depending on KIR gene content, but not on the autologous HLA environment. NKG2A was expressed on a large proportion of CB NK cells that inversely correlated with KIR(+) NK cell frequency. Self-HLA class I molecule-educated CB KIR(+) NK cells present a lower spontaneous lysis than do their adult counterparts, which is probably related to the low expression of activating NK receptors. We describe for the first time a proliferative and cytotoxic NKG2C(+) NK cell subset representing more than 10% of CB NK cells. NKG2A strongly inhibited CB NK cell degranulation, and its coexpression on NKG2C(+) NK cells may contribute to limiting their activation.

In this study, the impact of intestinal mucositis on posaconazole exposure is investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective pharmacokinetic study was performed including allogeneic HSCT patients receiving posaconazole prophylaxis with the oral suspension or tablets. Steady state PPCs were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection at the day of transplantation (=day 0), day +7, and +14. Citrulline was measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to evaluate severity of mucositis, at baseline (day -7 or -6), and at day 0, +7 and +14. Additionally, citrulline plasma concentrations and steady state trough PPCs were determined in hematological patients without HSCT or mucositis. RESULTS: Thirty-four HSCT patients received posaconazole oral suspension together with 25 cL of Coca Cola, 6 HSCT patients received posaconazole tablets and 33 hematological patients not receiving HSCT received posaconazole oral suspension. The median (interquartile range) average PPC was 0.26 mg/L (0.17-0.43), 0.67 mg/L (0.27-1.38), and 1.08 mg/L (0.96-1.38), with suspension in HSCT patients, suspension in hematological patients and tablets in HSCT patients, respectively. A higher trough PPC was encountered with the oral suspension when citrulline plasma concentrations were above 10 mumol/L compared to values below 10 mumol/L (p < 0.001), whereas for tablets, average PPCs remained high with citrulline plasma concentrations below or above 10 mumol/L (p = 0.64).

HES1 is a transcription factor which is regulated by the NOTCH, Hedgehog and Wnt signalling pathways. Aberrant expression of these pathways is a common feature of cancerous cells. There appears to be a fine and complicated crosstalk at the molecular level between the various signalling pathways and HES1, which contributes to its effects on the immune response and cancers such as leukaemia. Several mechanisms have been proposed, including an enhanced invasiveness and metastasis by inducing epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), in addition to its strict requirement for tumour cell survival. In this review, we summarize the current biology and molecular mechanisms as well as its use as a clinical target in cancer therapeutics.",['Copyright (c) 2016.

HSCT donors include HLA-identical siblings, matched or mismatched unrelated donors and haploidentical related donors. Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), mediated by donor alloreactive T-cells in the graft, can be triggered by minor histocompatibility antigens in HLA-identical pairs, by alleles at loci not considered for MUD-matching or by the mismatched haplotype in haplo-HSCT. Therefore, removal of donor T-cells, that contain the alloreactive precursors, is required, but T-cell depletion associates with opportunistic infections and with reduced graft-versus-leukemia effect. Selective T-cell depletion strategies have been introduced, like removal of alphabeta T-lymphocytes and of naive T-cells, two subsets including the alloreactive precursors, but the ultimate goal is specific removal of alloreactive T-cells. Here we review the different approaches to deplete alloreactive T-cells only and discuss pros and cons, specificity, efficiency and efficacy. Combinations of different methods and innovative approaches are also proposed for depleting specific alloreactive T-cells with high efficiency.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Chemotherapy (CT), used for non-central nervous system (CNS) cancer, can cross the blood brain barrier and contribute to changes in the functional state of brain that can alter background EEG activity. Quantitative EEG (qEEG) is superior to conventional EEG in the detection of subtle alterations of EEG background activity and for this reason, the use of qEEG might assist the clinician in evaluating the possible effect of CT on the CNS. The nucleoside analog cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) is one of the milestone chemotherapeutic agents used for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Our observational study evaluates the possible effect of Ara-C on the qEEG of patients with AML, without CNS involvement. We conducted an observational study on newly diagnosed AML patients without CNS involvement, undergoing treatment with Ara-C to analyze the possible effect of Ara-C high doses on EEG background activity using qEEG analyses. A total of nine AML patients, 5 with Ara-C i.v. high dose (>/=3 g/m(2) die), 4 with standard dose (100 mg/m(2) die) underwent qEEG (at rest, during hyperpnoea, mental arithmetic task and blocking reaction). We compared the EEG background activity of the two groups at baseline and after 6 months. Statistical analysis showed no significant differences between the two groups in mean relative power for all frequency bands, at rest and during hyperpnoea, mental arithmetic task and blocking reaction.

We conducted this study to demonstrate circulating levels of Ang-1 and Ang-2 in MPN patients since no data exists in literature. Thirty-three newly diagnosed MPN, 27 newly diagnosed AML patients and 25 controls (HC) were enrolled and Angiopoietin levels were determined with ELISA. We found that Ang-1 levels were higher whereas Ang-2 levels were lower in MPN and HC when compared to AML. Our results suggest that though angiogenesis is increased in both AML and MPN, angiopoietin serum level profile of the two diseases are different, and MPN patients have similar Ang-1 and Ang-2 levels as HC.

ALL is the most common hematologic malignancy in early childhood, and it reaches peak incidence between the ages of 2 and 3 years. The prognosis of ALL is associated with aberrant gene expression, in addition to the presence of numerical or structural chromosomal alterations, age, race, and immunophenotype. The Relapse rate with regard to pharmacological treatment rises in childhood; thus, the expression of biomarkers associated with the activation of cell signaling pathways is crucial to establish the disease prognosis. Intracellular pathways involved in ALL are diverse, including Janus kinase/Signal transducers and transcription activators (JAK-STAT), Phosphoinositide-3-kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K-AKT), Ras mitogen-activated protein kinase (Ras-MAPK), Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), Nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-kappaB), and Hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha), among others.

Based on previous observations that CLL cells exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction and altered lipid metabolism and that carnitine palmitoyltransferases (CPT) have a major role in transporting fatty acid into mitochondria to support cancer cell metabolism, we tested several clinically relevant inhibitors of lipid metabolism for their ability to eliminate primary CLL cells. We discovered that perhexiline, an antiangina agent that inhibits CPT, was highly effective in killing CLL cells in stromal microenvironment at clinically achievable concentrations. These effective concentrations caused low toxicity to normal lymphocytes and normal stromal cells. Mechanistic study revealed that CLL cells expressed high levels of CPT1 and CPT2. Suppression of fatty acid transport into mitochondria by inhibiting CPT using perhexiline resulted in a depletion of cardiolipin, a key component of mitochondrial membranes, and compromised mitochondrial integrity, leading to rapid depolarization and massive CLL cell death. The therapeutic activity of perhexiline was further demonstrated in vivo using a CLL transgenic mouse model. Perhexiline significantly prolonged the overall animal survival by only four drug injections. Our study suggests that targeting CPT using an antiangina drug is able to effectively eliminate leukemia cells in vivo, and is a novel therapeutic strategy for potential clinical treatment of CLL.",,"['Liu, P-P', 'Liu, J', 'Jiang, W-Q', 'Carew, J S', 'Ogasawara, M A', 'Pelicano, H', 'Croce, C M', 'Estrov, Z', 'Xu, R-H', 'Keating, M J', 'Huang, P']","['Liu PP', 'Liu J', 'Jiang WQ', 'Carew JS', 'Ogasawara MA', 'Pelicano H', 'Croce CM', 'Estrov Z', 'Xu RH', 'Keating MJ', 'Huang P']","['Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160411,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cardiolipins)', 'EC 2.3.1.21 (Carnitine O-Palmitoyltransferase)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'KU65374X44 (Perhexiline)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cardiolipins/metabolism', 'Carnitine O-Palmitoyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Perhexiline/*pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2016/10/28 06:00,2017/09/07 06:00,['2016/04/12 06:00'],"['2015/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/01 00:00 [revised]', '2016/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc2016103 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2016.103 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2016 Oct 27;35(43):5663-5673. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.103.

To provide a better understanding of the molecular etiology of these relatively rare individual AML variants, it is necessary to generate in vivo models, which can also serve as a means to evaluate targeted therapies based on their specific genetic abnormalities. Here, we describe the development of a human cell AML, generated in CD34+ human hematopoietic progenitor cells xenografted into immunocompromised mice that express human myeloid cell growth factors. Within 6 months, these mice develop a human cell AML with phenotypic characteristics of the primary t(6;9) disease and a CD45+CD13+CD34+CD38+ immunophenotype. Gene expression studies show that members of the HOX family of genes (HOXA9, 10, B3, B4 and PBX3) are highly upregulated in the AML from this mouse model as well as from primary human t(6;9) AML.

In this study, we found that N-cadherin mRNA was highly expressed in the bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) of patients with t(8;21) translocation. To determine the role of N-cadherin in maintaining LSCs self-renewal and stationary properties, colony-forming assay, cell cycle analysis, and engraftment in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice were used to compare N-cadherin(+) and N-cadherin(-) cells. Both leukemic cell lines KG1a and CD34(+) /CD38(-) BMMNCs derived from acute myeloid leukemia patients were used, and cells were divided into N-cadherin(+) and N-cadherin(-) fraction after sorting by FACS. The results showed that N-cadherin(+) cells had remarkable increased numbers of colonies with cytokines stimulation when compared with the negative control, suggesting a higher proliferative capacity of N-cadherin(+) cells with cytokines stimulation. The results also showed that most cells in N-cadherin(+) fraction stayed in the G0 -G1 stage, indicating the involvement of N-cadherin in maintaining the quiescent state of LSCs in niche. The results of engraftment showed that there was a higher proportion of hCD45(+) cells in mice transplanted with N-cadherin(+) cells than N-cadherin(-) cells. In addition, it was obvious that NOD/SCID mice transplanted with N-cadherin(+) cells had a shorter lifetime than the negative control, suggesting that LSCs self-renewal capacity resides predominantly in N-cadherin(+) fraction. In summary, N-cadherin might play an important role in maintaining the self-renewal and stationary properties of LSCs. Anat Rec, 299:990-998, 2016.

We found that CRISPR/Cas9 introduced InDel mutations into exon 2 of the ICP0 gene profoundly reduced HSV-1 infectivity in permissive human cell culture models and protected permissive cells against HSV-1 infection. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated targeting ICP0 prevented HSV-1-induced disintegration of promonocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, an intracellular event critical to productive HSV-1 infection that is initiated by interaction of the ICP0 N-terminus with PML.

However, the efficacy of EM in treating human leukemia is currently unknown. In the current study, we report that EM23, a natural sesquiterpene lactone isolated from EM, inhibits the proliferation of human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) K562 cells and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) HL-60 cells by inducing apoptosis. Translocation of membrane-associated phospholipid phosphatidylserines, changes in cell morphology, activation of caspases, and cleavage of PARP were concomitant with this inhibition. The involvement of the mitochondrial pathway in EM23-mediated apoptosis was suggested by observed disruptions in mitochondrial membrane potential. Mechanistic studies indicated that EM23 caused a marked increase in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a ROS scavenger, almost fully reversed EM23-mediated apoptosis. In EM23-treated cells, the expression levels of thioredoxin (Trx) and thioredoxinreductase (TrxR), two components of the Trx system involved in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis, were significantly down-regulated. Concomitantly, Trx regulated the activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and its downstream regulatory targets, the p38, JNK, and ERK MAPKs. EM23-mediated activation of ASK1/MAPKs was significantly inhibited in the presence of NAC. Furthermore, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-mediated activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) was suppressed by EM23, as suggested by the observed blockage of p65 nuclear translocation, phosphorylation, and reversion of IkappaBalpha degradation following EM23 treatment. Taken together, these results provide important insights into the anticancer activities of the EM component EM23 against human CML K562 cells and AML HL-60 cells.",,"['Li, Hongyu', 'Li, Manmei', 'Wang, Guocai', 'Shao, Fangyuan', 'Chen, Wenbo', 'Xia, Chao', 'Wang, Sheng', 'Li, Yaolan', 'Zhou, Guangxiong', 'Liu, Zhong']","['Li H', 'Li M', 'Wang G', 'Shao F', 'Chen W', 'Xia C', 'Wang S', 'Li Y', 'Zhou G', 'Liu Z']","['Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Natural Products, College of Pharmacy, Jinan University Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Natural Products, College of Pharmacy, Jinan University Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Natural Products, College of Pharmacy, Jinan University Guangzhou, China.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau Macau, China.', 'Guangzhou Jinan Biomedicine Research and Development Center, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Bioengineering Medicine, College of Life Science and Technology, Jinan University Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Natural Products, College of Pharmacy, Jinan University Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangzhou Jinan Biomedicine Research and Development Center, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Bioengineering Medicine, College of Life Science and Technology, Jinan University Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Natural Products, College of Pharmacy, Jinan University Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Natural Products, College of Pharmacy, Jinan University Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangzhou Jinan Biomedicine Research and Development Center, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Bioengineering Medicine, College of Life Science and Technology, Jinan University Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160329,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,2016/04/12 06:00,2016/04/12 06:01,['2016/04/12 06:00'],"['2015/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2016.00077 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2016 Mar 29;7:77. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2016.00077. eCollection 2016.,10.3389/fphar.2016.00077 [doi],,,PMC4809879,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ASK1', 'ROS', 'apoptosis', 'myeloid leukemia', 'thioredoxin']",,,,,,,,,,,,

As is well known, thrombopoietin (TPO) can induce MKs to differentiate. The effect of thrombin on MKs differentiation is not clear. In this study, we used a human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line (Meg-01) to assess the effect of thrombin on MKs differentiation. METHODS: In order to interrogate the role of thrombin in Meg-01 cells differentiation, the changes of morphology, cellular function, and expression of diverse factors were analyzed. RESULTS: The results show that thrombin suppresses Meg-01 cells proliferation and induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Thrombin upregulates the expression of CD41b, which is one of the most important MK markers. Globin transcription factor 1 (GATA-1), an important transcriptional regulator, controls MK development and maturation. The expression of GATA-1 is also upregulated by thrombin in Meg-01 cells. The expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), an apoptosis-inhibitory protein, is downregulated by thrombin. Phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-AKT) and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) were upregulated by thrombin in Meg-01 cells. All the results are consistent with Meg-01 cells treated with TPO. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In conclusion, all these data indicate that thrombin maybe plays an important role in MK differentiation into platelets. However, whether the platelet-like particles are certainly platelets remains unknown.",,"['Yang, Xiao-Lei', 'Ge, Meng-Kai', 'Mao, De-Kui', 'Lv, Ying-Tao', 'Sun, Shu-Yan', 'Yu, Ai-Ping']","['Yang XL', 'Ge MK', 'Mao DK', 'Lv YT', 'Sun SY', 'Yu AP']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 100850, China; College of Chemical Engineering, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao 266042, China.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 100850, China.', 'College of Chemical Engineering, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao 266042, China.', 'The 107th Hospital of PLA and The Affiliated Hospital of Bin Zhou Medical University, Yantai 264000, China.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 100850, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160315,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (ITGB3 protein, human)', '0 (Integrin beta3)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)']",IM,"['*Blood Platelets/cytology/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta3', '*Megakaryocytes/cytology/drug effects', '*Thrombin/metabolism/pharmacology']",2016/04/12 06:00,2017/01/04 06:00,['2016/04/12 06:00'],"['2015/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/28 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2016/9313269 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2016;2016:9313269. doi: 10.1155/2016/9313269.

Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is one of the main pathways for repairing DSBs. Decreased NHEJ activity has been reported with HDACi treatment. However, mechanisms through which these effects are regulated in the context of chromatin are unclear. We show that pan-HDACi, trichostatin A (TSA), causes differential acetylation of DNA repair factors Ku70/Ku80 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP1), and impairs NHEJ. Repair effects are reversed by treatments with p300/CBP inhibitor C646, with significantly decreased acetylation of PARP1. In keeping with these findings, TSA treatment significantly increases PARP1 binding to DSBs in chromatin. Notably, AML patients treated with HDACi entinostat (MS275) in vivo also show increased formation of poly ADP-ribose (PAR) that co-localizes with DSBs. Further, we demonstrate that PARP1 bound to chromatin increases with duration of TSA exposure, resembling PARP ""trapping"". Knockdown of PARP1 inhibits trapping and mitigates HDACi effects on NHEJ. Finally, combination of HDACi with potent PARP inhibitor talazoparib (BMN673) shows a dose-dependent increase in PARP ""trapping"", which correlates with increased apoptosis. These results provide a mechanism through which HDACi inhibits deacetylation and increases binding of PARP1 to DSBs, leading to decreased NHEJ and cytotoxicity of leukemia cells.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We analyzed age, WBC counts and lymphocyte counts by principal component analyses to create a distribution chart of the principle component scores. Using the chart, we categorized cows into four quadrants based on additional information, such as the presence of antibody and the levels of proviral DNA. Antibody-positive cows and cows with high BLV proviral load were found mostly in one quadrant of the chart, indicating that it is possible to predict the risk of infection without any knowledge on antibody status by using information, such as WBC counts as a biomarker. When only antibody-positive cows were included in the analysis, a characteristic distribution of different levels of proviral DNA was seen in the quadrants, suggesting that it is possible to estimate the extent of bovine leukosis infection by using this analysis.

We studied results in 289 patients transplanted between June 2004 and December 2013. Minimal identifiable disease (MID) markers pre-HCT were determined by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) and cytogenetics on marrow aspirates. The impact of MID on outcome after low- and high-intensity conditioning HCT was determined. Among 287 assessable patients, 68 (23.7%) had more than 5% marrow blasts at HCT; 219 patients were in morphologic remission but 154 (53.7%) were MID positive, whereas 65 (22.6%) were MID negative. The impact of MID on outcome was significantly different between patients who received low-intensity conditioning and patients who received a high-intensity regimen. The impact of conditioning intensity differed across the various MID categories. In particular, the risk of overall mortality was higher with low-intensity than with high-intensity regimens for patients who were positive for MID by cytogenetics regardless of positivity by MFC (HR, 1.67 if MFC positive/cytogenetics positive, HR, 7.23 if MFC negative/cytogenetics positive). On the other hand, patients who were MID negative by both MFC and cytogenetics had similar risks of mortality with low- and high-intensity regimens (HR, .99). The main factor responsible for mortality after low-intensity conditioning in MID-positive patients was relapse. The presence of MID should be considered when deciding on conditioning intensity because it identifies subgroups of patients who may benefit from high- or low-intensity conditioning.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The use of conventional chemotherapy for induction of complete remission (CR) results in profound anemia and thrombocytopenia requiring frequent transfusions of blood products, without which such treatment will be life-threatening. Finding a well tolerable, minimally myelosuppressive induction regimen for such patients with AML is a clear example of area of unmet medical need. Here, we report a successful treatment of a 52-year-old Jehovah's Witness with newly diagnosed AML with peg-asparaginase, vincristine and methylprednisolone. The AML was characterized with normal karyotype, and mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1-Arg132Ser), nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1-Trp289Cysfs*12) and neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS-G1y12Va1). After one 28-day cycle of treatment, the patient achieved complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi) and after the second cycle, he achieved CR with full blood count recovery. The patient has never received any blood products. Notwithstanding that myeloperoxidase-induced oxidative degradation of vincristine results in its lack of activity as monotherapy in AML, its combination with corticosteroid and asparaginase has resulted in a robust remission in this patient. Diminished steroid clearance by asparaginase activity as well as reduction in serum glutamine level induced by glutaminase enzymatic activity of asparaginase may have contributed to effective killing of the myeloblasts that carry IDH1/NPM1/NRAS mutations. In conclusion, asparaginase-containing regimens, which are approved for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) but not AML, can be used to treat patients with AML who do not accept blood transfusion.",,"['Emadi, Ashkan', 'Bade, Najeebah A', 'Stevenson, Brandi', 'Singh, Zeba']","['Emadi A', 'Bade NA', 'Stevenson B', 'Singh Z']","['School of Medicine, Marlene &amp; Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland, 22 South Greene Street, Room N9E24, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA. aemadi@umm.edu.', 'School of Medicine, Marlene &amp; Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland, 22 South Greene Street, Room N9E24, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA. nabade@gmail.com.', 'School of Medicine, Marlene &amp; Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland, 22 South Greene Street, Room N9E24, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA. bstevenson@umm.edu.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA. zsingh@umm.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160310,Switzerland,Pharmaceuticals (Basel),"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",101238453,,,,2016/04/12 06:00,2016/04/12 06:01,['2016/04/12 06:00'],"['2016/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/12 06:01 [medline]']","['ph9010012 [pii]', '10.3390/ph9010012 [doi]']",epublish,Pharmaceuticals (Basel). 2016 Mar 10;9(1). pii: ph9010012. doi: 10.3390/ph9010012.,10.3390/ph9010012 [doi] E12 [pii],,,PMC4812376,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'asparaginase', 'isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Osteopontin (OPN) plays an important role in promoting survival and drug resistance in LSCs. The aim of this study was to explore OPN roles in modulating curcumin-mediated LSC enrichment and survival in AML cell lines and primary CD34+/CD38- bone-marrow-derived AML cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The growth inhibitory effects of curcumin (CUR) were evaluated by MTT assay in U937 and CD34+ KG-1 AML cell lines as well as primary CD34+/CD38- bone-marrow derived AML cells isolated by MACS technique. The proportion of LSC markers (CD34, CD38 and CD123) were evaluated by flow cytometry. The expression levels of OPN, AKT, mTOR, PTEN, beta-catenin and NF-kappaB were investigated by qRT-PCR. Short interfering RNA (siRNA) against OPN was used in AML cells incubated with or without CUR. KEY FINDINGS: Proportions of CD34+/CD38-/CD123+ and CD34+/CD38+/CD123+ LSCs compartment co-expressing an increased level of OPN could be enriched in AML cell lines and in patient's primary cells by CUR treatment. The expression levels of AKT, mTOR, PTEN, and beta-catenin and NF-kappaB1, were also significantly up-regulated concurrently with OPN in the enriched CD34+ AML cells. SIGNIFICANCE: The increased in CUR-mediated OPN level is involved in a complex interplay of various signaling pathways resulting in cytoprotection and enrichment of CD34+ LSC compartment in CUR-treated AML cells. AKT/mTOR/PTEN/beta-catenin/NF-kB signaling pathways may play roles in modulating OPN-mediated LSC cell survival and enrichment.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Cancer is characterized as a condition with complex signs and symptoms. It has been recommended that ethnopharmacological usages such as immune and skin disorders, inflammatory, infectious, parasitic and viral diseases should be taken into account when selecting plants for anticancer screenings, since these reflect disease states bearing relevance to cancer or cancer-like symptoms. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study aims at investigating 20 methanol extracts from 15 Cameroonian medicinal plants on a panel of human cancer cell lines, including various drug-resistant phenotypes. Possible modes of action of the of the most active plant were analyzed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanol extracts from different plant parts (leaves, bark, roots, fruits or whole plant) were evaluated for their cytotoxicity using resazurin reduction assay on a panel of nine sensitive and multi-drug resistant (MDR) cancer cell lines. Cell cycle, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Prescreening of extracts at 80microg/mL showed that 6 extracts out of 20 inhibited more than 50% proliferation of leukemia CCRF-CEM cells; these include extracts from Anthocleista schweinfurthii fruits (ASF; 48.28%), Morus mesozygia bark (MMB; 42.76%), Nauclea latifolia bark (NLB; 38.75%), Tridesmostemon omphalocarpoides bark (TOB; 38.53%), Nauclea latifolia leaves (NLL; 35.17%) and Erythrina sigmoidea bark (ESB; 33.77%). Subsequent investigations revealed IC50 values below or around 20microg/mL for extracts from MMB, NLB, NLL and ESB towards sensitive CCRF-CEM cells and its resistant P-glycoprotein over-expressing subline CEM/ADR5000. The best extract, ESB also displayed IC50 values below 20microg/mL colon carcinoma HCT116 (p53(+/+)) cells with an IC50 value of 19.63microg/mL and it resistant p53 knockout subline HCT116 (p53(-)(/-)) with an IC50 value of 16.22microg/mL. CONCLUSION: Erythrina sigmoidea, Anthocleista schweinfurthii, Morus mesozygia, Nauclea latifolia, Tridesmostemon omphalocarpoides used in African traditional medicine are good cytotoxic plants that can be exploited to develop phytomedicine to fight cancers including MDR phenotypes.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

OTX015 is active in haematological preclinical entities including leukaemia, lymphoma, and myeloma. We aimed to establish the recommended dose of OTX015 in patients with haematological malignancies. We report the results from a cohort of patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma (non-leukaemia cohort). METHODS: In this dose-escalation, open-label, phase 1 study, we recruited patients from seven university hospital centres (in France [four], Switzerland [one], UK [one], and Italy [one]). Adult patients with non-leukaemia haematological malignancies who had disease progression on standard therapies were eligible to participate. Patients were treated with oral OTX015 once a day continuously over five doses (10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, and 120 mg), using a conventional 3 + 3 design, with allowance for evaluation of alternative administration schedules. The primary endpoint was dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first treatment cycle (21 days). Secondary objectives were to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary clinical activity of OTX015. The study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01713582. FINDINGS: Between Feb 4, 2013, and Sept 5, 2014, 45 patients (33 with lymphoma and 12 with myeloma), with a median age of 66 years (IQR 55-72) and a median of four lines of prior therapy (IQR 3-5), were enrolled and treated. No DLTs were observed in the doses up to and including 80 mg once a day (first three patients). We then explored a schedule of 40 mg twice a day (21 of 21 days). DLTs were reported in five of six patients receiving OTX015 at this dose and schedule (all five patients had grade 4 thrombocytopenia). We explored various schedules at 120 mg once a day but none was tolerable, with DLTs of thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal events (diarrhoea, vomiting, dysgeusia, mucositis), fatigue, and hyponatraemia in 11 of 18 evaluable patients. At this point, the Safety Monitoring Committee decided to establish the feasibility of 80 mg once a day on a continuous basis, and four additional patients were enrolled at this dose. DLTs (grade 4 thrombocytopenia) was noted in two of the patients. In light of these DLTs and other toxicities noted at 120 mg, the dose of 80 mg once a day was selected, although on a schedule of 14 days on, 7 days off. Common toxic effects reported in the study were thrombocytopenia (43 [96%] patients), anaemia (41 [91%]), neutropenia (23 [51%]), diarrhoea (21 [47%]), fatigue (12 [27%]), and nausea (11 [24%]). Grade 3-4 adverse events were infrequent other than thrombocytopenia (26 [58%]). OTX015 plasma peak concentrations and areas under the concentration versus time curve increased proportionally with dose. Trough concentrations increased less than proportionally at lower doses, but reached or exceeded the in-vitro active range at 40 mg twice a day and 120 mg once a day. Three patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma achieved durable objective responses (two complete responses at 120 mg once a day, and one partial response at 80 mg once a day), and six additional patients (two with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, four with indolent lymphomas) had evidence of clinical activity, albeit not meeting objective response criteria. INTERPRETATION: The once-daily recommended dose for oral, single agent oral OTX015 in patients with lymphoma is 80 mg on a 14 days on, 7 days off schedule, for phase 2 studies. OTX015 is under evaluation in expansion cohorts using this intermittent administration (14 days every 3 weeks) to allow for recovery from toxic effects.

BET proteins bind acetylated histone tails via their bromodomain, bringing the elongation complex to the promoter region. OTX015 (MK-8628) specifically binds to BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4, preventing BET proteins from binding to the chromatin, thus inhibiting gene transcription. OTX015 inhibits proliferation in many haematological malignancy cell lines and patient cells, in vitro and in vivo. We aimed to establish the recommended dose of OTX015 in patients with haematological malignancies. We report the results of patients with acute leukaemia (leukaemia cohort). METHODS: In this dose-escalation, phase 1 study we recruited patients from seven university hospital centres (in France [five], UK [one], and Canada [one]). Adults with acute leukaemia who had failed or had a contraindication to standard therapies were eligible to participate. OTX015 was given orally at increasing doses from 10 mg/day to 160 mg/day (14 of 21 days), using a conventional 3 + 3 design. In this open-label trial, OTX015 was initially administered once a day, with allowance for exploration of other schedules. The primary endpoint was dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), assessed during the first treatment cycle (21 days). The study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01713582. FINDINGS: Between Jan 18, 2013, and Sept 9, 2014, 41 patients, 36 with acute myeloid leukaemia, a median age of 70 years (IQR 60-75) and two lines of previous therapy, were recruited and treated across six dose levels of OTX015. No DLT was recorded until 160 mg/day, when one patient had grade 3 diarrhoea and another had grade 3 fatigue. However, concomitant grade 1-2 non-DLT toxic effects (ie, gastrointestinal, fatigue, or cutaneous) from 120 mg doses hampered patient compliance and 80 mg once a day was judged the recommended dose with a 14 days on, 7 days off schedule. Common toxic effects for all OTX015 doses were fatigue (including grade 3 in three patients) and bilirubin concentration increases (including grade 3-4 in two patients). OTX015 plasma exposure increased proportionally up to 120 mg/day with trough concentrations in the in-vitro active range from 80 mg/day (274 nmol/L). Three patients (receiving 40 mg/day, 80 mg/day, and 160 mg/day) achieved complete remission or complete remission with incomplete recovery of platelets lasting 2-5 months, and two additional patients had partial blast clearance. No predictive biomarkers for response have been identified so far. INTERPRETATION: The once-daily recommended dose for oral, single agent oral OTX015 use in patients with acute leukaemia for further phase 2 studies is 80 mg on a 14 days on, 7 days off schedule.

We therefore did a pooled analysis of data to investigate the association between childhood leukaemia and caesarean delivery. METHODS: We pooled data from 13 case-control studies from the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium done in nine countries (Canada, Costa Rica, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, New Zealand, and the USA) for births from 1970-2013. We analysed caesarean delivery overall and by indications that probably resulted in prelabour caesarean delivery or emergency caesarean delivery. We used multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted for child's birthweight, sex, age, ethnic origin, parental education, maternal age, and study, to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for the risk of ALL and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in children aged 0-14 years at diagnosis. FINDINGS: The studies provided data for 8780 ALL cases, 1332 AML cases, and 23 459 controls, of which the birth delivery method was known for 8655 (99%) ALL cases, 1292 (97%) AML cases, and 23 351 (>99%) controls. Indications for caesarean delivery were available in four studies (there were caesarean deliveries for 1061 of 4313 ALL cases, 138 of 664 AML cases, and 1401 of 5884 controls). The OR for all indications of caesarean delivery and ALL was 1.06 (95% CI 0.99-1.13), and was significant for prelabour caesarean delivery and ALL (1.23 [1.04-1.47]; p=0.018). Emergency caesarean delivery was not associated with ALL (OR 1.02 [95% CI 0.81-1.30]). AML was not associated with caesarean delivery (all indications OR 0.99 [95% CI 0.84-1.17]; prelabour caesarean delivery 0.83 [0.54-1.26]; and emergency caesarean delivery 1.05 [0.63-1.77]). INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest an increased risk of childhood ALL after prelabour caesarean delivery. If this association is causal, maladaptive immune activation due to an absence of stress response before birth in children born by prelabour caesarean delivery could be considered as a potential mechanism.

Besides the presence of chromosomal rearrangement t(15;17), leading to the formation of PML-RARA (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha) fusion, other genetic alterations have also been implicated in APL. Here, we performed comprehensive mutational analysis of primary and relapse APL to identify somatic alterations, which cooperate with PML-RARA in the pathogenesis of APL. We explored the mutational landscape using whole-exome (n=12) and subsequent targeted sequencing of 398 genes in 153 primary and 69 relapse APL. Both primary and relapse APL harbored an average of eight non-silent somatic mutations per exome. We observed recurrent alterations of FLT3, WT1, NRAS and KRAS in the newly diagnosed APL, whereas mutations in other genes commonly mutated in myeloid leukemia were rarely detected. The molecular signature of APL relapse was characterized by emergence of frequent mutations in PML and RARA genes. Our sequencing data also demonstrates incidence of loss-of-function mutations in previously unidentified genes, ARID1B and ARID1A, both of which encode for key components of the SWI/SNF complex. We show that knockdown of ARID1B in APL cell line, NB4, results in large-scale activation of gene expression and reduced in vitro differentiation potential.",,"['Madan, V', 'Shyamsunder, P', 'Han, L',

This report now demonstrates particularly high expression of GPR56 in patients with mutant NPM1 and FLT3-length mutation and association of high GPR56 expression with inferior prognosis in a large patient cohort treated in two independent multicenter phase III trials. Functional relevance of GPR56 expression was validated in mice, in which co-expression of Gpr56 significantly accelerated HOXA9-induced leukemogenesis and vice versa knockdown of Gpr56 delayed onset of HOXA9/MEIS1-induced AML. Overexpression of Gpr56 grossly changed the molecular phenotype of Hoxa9-transduced cells affecting pathways involved in G protein-coupled receptors (GPRCs) and associated intracellular signaling. Blockage of surface GPR56 by an anti-GPR56 antibody successfully impaired engraftment of primary human AML cells. In summary, these data demonstrate that high expression of GPR56 is able to contribute to AML development and characterize the GPR56 as a potential novel target for antibody-mediated antileukemic strategies.",,"['Daria, D', 'Kirsten, N', 'Muranyi, A', 'Mulaw, M', 'Ihme, S', 'Kechter, A', 'Hollnagel, M', 'Bullinger, L', 'Dohner, K', 'Dohner, H', 'Feuring-Buske, M', 'Buske, C']","['Daria D', 'Kirsten N', 'Muranyi A', 'Mulaw M', 'Ihme S', 'Kechter A', 'Hollnagel M', 'Bullinger L', 'Dohner K', 'Dohner H', 'Feuring-Buske M', 'Buske C']","['Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160411,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ADGRG1 protein, human)', '0 (GPR56 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Npm1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Female', 'Heterografts', 'Homeodomain Proteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/deficiency/genetics/*physiology']",2016/04/12 06:00,2017/08/29 06:00,['2016/04/12 06:00'],"['2016/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/02 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201676 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.76 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Aug;30(8):1734-41. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.76.

Mutant IDH1 collaborates with HoxA9 to induce monocytic leukemia in vivo. We used two mouse models and a patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia xenotransplantation (PDX) model to evaluate the in vivo transforming potential of R-2HG, S-2HG and alphaKG independent of the mutant IDH1 protein. We show that R-2HG, but not S-2HG or alphaKG, is an oncometabolite in vivo that does not require the mutant IDH1 protein to induce hyperleukocytosis and to accelerate the onset of murine and human leukemia. Thus, circulating R-2HG acts in a paracrine manner and can drive the expansion of many different leukemic and preleukemic clones that may express wild-type IDH1, and therefore can be a driver of clonal evolution and diversity. In addition, we show that the mutant IDH1 protein is a stronger oncogene than R-2HG alone when comparable intracellular R-2HG levels are achieved. We therefore propose R-2HG-independent oncogenic functions of mutant IDH1 that may need to be targeted in addition to R-2HG production to exploit the full therapeutic potential of IDH1 inhibition.",,"['Chaturvedi, A', 'Araujo Cruz, M M', 'Jyotsana, N', 'Sharma, A', 'Goparaju, R', 'Schwarzer, A', 'Gorlich, K', 'Schottmann, R', 'Struys, E A', 'Jansen, E E', 'Rohde, C', 'Muller-Tidow, C', 'Geffers, R', 'Gohring, G', 'Ganser, A', 'Thol, F', 'Heuser, M']","['Chaturvedi A', 'Araujo Cruz MM', 'Jyotsana N', 'Sharma A', 'Goparaju R', 'Schwarzer A', 'Gorlich K', 'Schottmann R', 'Struys EA', 'Jansen EE', 'Rohde C', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Geffers R', 'Gohring G', 'Ganser A', 'Thol F', 'Heuser M']","['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Halle, Halle, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Halle, Halle, Germany.', 'Genome Analytics Group, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160411,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Glutarates)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Ketoglutaric Acids)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '2889-31-8 (alpha-hydroxyglutarate)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

Chemotherapy is the first choice for leukemia treatment, but the major limitations of standard therapy are its side effects and poor patient compliances. Therefore it is imperative to look for a therapeutic system with lesser side effects urgently to address the underlying causes of poor treatment outcomes. In such a scenario transdermal route for delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs could be a better alternative to provide sustained drug level, enhanced activity, self administration and better patient compliances. The present work is focus on the design of nanolipid based transdermal carrier, deformable liposomes bearing cytarabine as a model drug for effective delivery of drug with enhanced transdermal flux. Developed nanocarriers were characterized for their size, morphology, entrapment efficiency, skin penetration and irritation.

Since T cell dysfunction has previously been reported in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC; clear cell type), we aimed to analyze these immune cells for genetic and protein differences when compared to normal donor T cells freshly after isolation and 35 days after in vitro stimulation (IVS) with HLA-matched RCC tumor cells. METHODS: We investigated gene expression profiles of tumor-reactive CD8(+) T cells obtained from RCC patient and compared with their HLA-matched healthy sibling donors using a microarray approach. In addition, miRNAs analysis was performed in a validation cohort of peripheral blood CD8(+) T cells from 25 RCC patients compared to 15 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: We observed that CD8(+) T cells from RCC patients expressed reduced levels of anti-apoptotic and proliferation-associated gene products when compared with normal donor T cells both pre- and post-IVS. In particular, JAK3 and MCL-1 were down-regulated in patient CD8(+) T cells versus their normal counterparts, likely due to defective suppressor activity of miR-29b and miR-198 in RCC CD8(+) T cells. Indeed, specific inhibition of miR-29b or miR-198 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from RCC patients, resulted in the up-regulation of JAK3 and MCL-1 proteins and significant improvement of cell survival in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that miR-29b and miR-198 dysregulation in RCC patient CD8(+) T cells is associated with dysfunctional immunity and foreshadow the development of miR-targeted therapeutics to correct such T cell defects in vivo.",,"['Gigante, Margherita', 'Pontrelli, Paola', 'Herr, Wolfgang', 'Gigante, Maddalena', ""D'Avenia, Morena"", 'Zaza, Gianluigi', 'Cavalcanti, Elisabetta', 'Accetturo, Matteo', 'Lucarelli, Giuseppe', 'Carrieri, Giuseppe', 'Battaglia, Michele', 'Storkus, Walter J', 'Gesualdo, Loreto', 'Ranieri, Elena']","['Gigante M', 'Pontrelli P', 'Herr W', 'Gigante M', ""D'Avenia M"", 'Zaza G', 'Cavalcanti E', 'Accetturo M', 'Lucarelli G', 'Carrieri G', 'Battaglia M', 'Storkus WJ', 'Gesualdo L', 'Ranieri E']","['Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Foggia, Viale Luigi Pinto, 1, 71100, Foggia, Italy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Oncology, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Renal Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Foggia, Viale Luigi Pinto, 1, 71100, Foggia, Italy.', 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Dermatology and Immunology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Foggia, Viale Luigi Pinto, 1, 71100, Foggia, Italy. elena.ranieri@unifg.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160411,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN198 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Separation', 'Down-Regulation/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Kidney Neoplasms/genetics/immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transfection', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",2016/04/12 06:00,2016/11/08 06:00,['2016/04/12 06:00'],"['2015/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12967-016-0841-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12967-016-0841-9 [pii]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2016 Apr 11;14:84. doi: 10.1186/s12967-016-0841-9.,10.1186/s12967-016-0841-9 [doi],,,PMC4827202,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'CD8+ T cells', 'JAK3', 'MCL-1', 'Renal cell carcinoma', 'miRNA']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical data, laboratory findings, chemotherapy and prognosis of 21 children with DS-AL were analyzed. RESULTS: Most of the children had disease onset of leukemia at 1 to 5 years of age (85.7%), and acute myeloid leukemia accounted for 57.1% of these cases; 61.9% of the patients had increased lactate dehydrogenase level by 2 folds or more. Of the 13 cases undergoing echocardiaography, 10 (67.9%) showed abnormal findings, and complex congenital heart disease was common (38.5%). Six of the children received chemotherapy and complete remission was achieved in 4 cases; 2 patients died of infection, and the treatment-related mortality was 33.3%. The 2 patients receiving reduced intensive chemotherapy have so far had event-free survival for 21 and 43 months. CONCLUSION: Acute myeloid leukemia is the most common subtype of DS-AL.

Here, we collected 273 breast cancer (BC) specimens as a training set and 310 specimens as a validation set to examine the expression of HMGA2 by immunohistochemical staining. It was found that HMGA2 expression was significantly positively correlated with advanced tumor grade and poor survival. Subgroup analysis indicated that high level of HMGA2 was significantly correlated with poor prognosis, especially in the subgroups of stage II-III, low pathological grade and non-triple negative breast cancer cases. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrated a significant positive correlation between HMGA2 level and the gene expression signature of metaplastic and mesenchymal phenotype. Importantly, we also observed that ectopic expression of HMGA2 promoted the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells, and protected cancer cells against genotoxic stress from agents stimulating P53 (Ser15) phosphorylation. As a conclusion, expression of HMGA2 might indicate more advanced malignancy of breast cancer. Thus we believe HMGA2 could serve as a biomarker of poor prognosis and a novel target in treating BC tumors.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Current management of FN is expensive and may induce side effects. Honey, as a natural honeybee product, has antioxidant, antimicrobial, immunomodulator and anticancer effects. Additionally, honey is not expensive. The aim of this study is to test the effects of a 12-week honey consumption on children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) particularly with regard to FN. DESIGN: A randomized crossover clinical trial. Forty patients of both sexes, aged 2.5-10 years, were randomized into two equal groups [intervention to control (I/C) and control to intervention (C/I)]. SETTING: Children Hospital of Ain Shams University-Cairo-Egypt. The dietary intervention consisted of honey in a dose of 2.5 g//kg body weight per dose twice weekly for 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Febrile neutropenia in terms of frequency and duration of hospital admission. RESULTS: The intervention resulted in a significant decrease of FN episodes, the number of patients admitted with FN and the duration of hospital stay. Also, honey consumption improved the levels of hemoglobin and did not produce any serious side effect. As a possible effect of honey withdrawal in the I/C group, the Hb%, the absolute neutrophil count and the platelet count decreased. CONCLUSION: Honey intervention in a group of children with ALL resulted in positive effects on FN and hematologic parameters. Further studies that include a larger number of patients are recommended to confirm that honey, has beneficial effects, as a complementary agent, in children with ALL.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It is used for the treatment of several kinds of ailments, such as gastrointestinal disorders, diabetes, high cholesterol, leukemia, bronchitis, etc. In this review, traditional use, phytochemistry, and pharmacology of O. onites reported between 1988 and 2014 were discussed. This review was prepared based on literature survey on scientific journals and books from libraries and electronic sources, such as Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, etc. All databases were searched up to June 2014. Several different classes of terpenoids, triterpene acids, phenolic acids, hydroquinones, flavonoids, hydrocarbons, sterols, pigments, fatty acids, tocopherols, and inorganic compounds were detected mainly in the aerial parts of this plant. Pharmacological studies revealed that extracts obtained from several solvents and individual compounds exhibited antimicrobial, antiviral, antioxidant, insecticidal, anticancer, hepatoprotective, genotoxic, antidiabetic, cholinesterase inhibitory, anti-inflammatory, analgesic activities, etc. O. onites, in general, exhibited remarkable activity potential in almost all test systems. The results of toxicity studies indicated that O. onites did not show any significant toxicity and mutagenicity on Drosophila and Salmonella. Toxicity of the extracts/essential oils and also individual compounds should be evaluated on mammalian cells to ensure their safety. The bioactivity of individual compounds aside from terpenoids should also be assessed in detail. Additionally, mode of action for the bioactive compounds should be evaluated to understand the complex pharmacological effects of these phytochemicals.","['(c) 2016 Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta AG, Zurich.']","['Tepe, Bektas', 'Cakir, Ahmet', 'Sihoglu Tepe, Arzuhan']","['Tepe B', 'Cakir A', 'Sihoglu Tepe A']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science and Literature, Kilis 7 Aralik University, TR-79000, Kilis.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Literature, Kilis 7 Aralik University, TR-79000, Kilis. acakir@kilis.edu.tr, ahmedcakir@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science and Literature, Kilis 7 Aralik University, TR-79000, Kilis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Switzerland,Chem Biodivers,Chemistry & biodiversity,101197449,"['0 (Analgesics)', '0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Cholinesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)', '0 (Insecticides)', '0 (Phytochemicals)']",IM,"['Analgesics/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Anti-Infective Agents/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Cholinesterase Inhibitors/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Insecticides/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Origanum/*chemistry', 'Phytochemicals/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",2016/04/12 06:00,2017/01/14 06:00,['2016/04/11 06:00'],"['2015/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cbdv.201500069 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Biodivers. 2016 May;13(5):504-20. doi: 10.1002/cbdv.201500069.,10.1002/cbdv.201500069 [doi],,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Biological activity', 'Carvacrol', 'Lamiaceae', 'Origanum onites', 'Pharmacology', 'Phytochemistry']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim was to estimate the incidence of TH and to identify risk factors, thus serving as markers for identifying candidates for prevention interventions. PROCEDURE: All patients treated with induction treatment for ALL in our department from January 2004 to April 2015 had their data retrieved from medical files and retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred and two children with ALL treated at our department were identified (49 females and 53 males) with a mean age of 6.03 +/- 3.78 years at the time of diagnosis. Sixteen patients developed TH (15.68%). Age at diagnosis >10 years is associated with an 11-fold increase in the risk of developing TH. Additionally, fasting glucose on the eighth day of treatment is an important prognostic factor as fasting glucose >100 mg/dl at that time point is associated with a threefold increase in developing TH during residual treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: Fasting glucose levels >110 mg/dl on the eighth day of treatment could serve as a trigger for intervention strategies that will prevent the development of TH in pediatric patients treated for ALL. Additional studies are needed to confirm and further extend this preliminary observation.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Gatzioura, Irene', 'Papakonstantinou, Eugene', 'Dimitriadou, Meropi', 'Kourti, Maria', 'Sidi, Vassiliki', 'Triantafyllou, Panagiota', 'Koliouskas, Dimitrios', 'Christoforidis, Athanasios']","['Gatzioura I', 'Papakonstantinou E', 'Dimitriadou M', 'Kourti M', 'Sidi V', 'Triantafyllou P', 'Koliouskas D', 'Christoforidis A']","['Pediatric Oncology Department, Ippokration Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Pediatric Oncology Department, Ippokration Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.', '1st Pediatric Department, Aristotle University of, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Pediatric Oncology Department, Ippokration Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Pediatric Oncology Department, Ippokration Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.', '1st Pediatric Department, Aristotle University of, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Pediatric Oncology Department, Ippokration Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.', '1st Pediatric Department, Aristotle University of, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160408,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Blood Glucose)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Blood Glucose/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Hyperglycemia/blood/chemically induced', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2016/04/12 06:00,2017/03/18 06:00,['2016/04/11 06:00'],"['2016/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/01 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25956 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Jul;63(7):1181-4. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25956.

IR-AML samples (N=95) were sequenced by Illumina Hiseq and mutations in 101 genes were identified. Only seven genes (CEBPA, NPM1, DNMT3A, FLT3-ITD, NRAS, IDH2 and WT1) were mutated in more than 10% of patients. Genetic interaction analysis identified several cooperative and exclusive patterns of overlapping mutations. Mutational analysis indicated some correlation between genotype and phenotype. FLT3-ITD mutations were identified as independent factors of poor prognosis, while CEBPA mutations were independent favorable factors. Co-occurrence of FLT3-ITD, NPM1 and DNMT3A mutations was identified with associated with specific clinical AML features and poor outcomes. Furthermore, by integrating multiple mutations in the survival analysis, 95 IR-AML patients could be stratified into three distinct risk groups allowing reductions in IR-AML by one-third.

These cargo molecules follow the secretory pathway, which is a vital part of cellular trafficking machinery in all eukaryotic cells. This secretory pathway is well conserved in all eukaryotes from low-level eukaryotes, such as yeast, to higher level eukaryotes like mammals. The molecular mechanisms of protein sorting by adaptor proteins, membrane elongation and transport to the final destinations by motor proteins and the cytoskeleton, and membrane pinching-off by scission proteins must be choreographically managed for efficient cargo delivery, and the understanding of these detailed processes is not yet completed. Functionally, defects in these mechanisms are associated with the pathology of prominent diseases such as acute myeloid leukaemia, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, I-cell disease and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. The present review points out the recent advances in our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in the transportation of the cargo from the TGN towards the endosome.","['(c) 2016 Societe Francaise des Microscopies and Societe de Biologie Cellulaire de', 'France.

Here, we report the clinical history of three patients affected with haematological malignancies who developed an infection caused by Geotrichum (G.) clavatum. Two out of three patients were affected by acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), and one by mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). All patients received cytarabine-based chemotherapeutic regimens and developed G. clavatum infection within 3 weeks from therapy initiation. In all cases, G. clavatum was isolated from central venous catheter and peripheral blood cultures. In vitro susceptibility test confirmed an intrinsic resistance to echinocandins and, in all cases, visceral localisations (spleen, liver and lung) were documented by total body computed tomography (CT) scan. A prolonged antifungal therapy with high doses liposomal amphotericin-B was necessary to obtain fever resolution. Only the patient with MCL died while the other two AML recovered, and one of them after received an allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

Data obtained following adoption of the World Health Organization classification of haematopoietic neoplasms and JAK2 V617F mutation testing are sparse. Using population-based data, we comprehensively assessed subtype-specific MPN and MDS/MPN incidence rates (IRs), IR ratios (IRRs) and relative survival (RS) in the United States (2001-12). IRs were highest for polycythaemia vera (PV) (IR = 10.9) and essential thrombocythaemia (ET) (IR = 9.6). Except for ET and mastocytosis, overall IRs were significantly higher among males (IRRs = 1.4-2.3). All evaluable MPNs were associated with lower IRs among Hispanic whites than non-Hispanic whites (NHWs), with the exception of BCR-ABL1-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), chronic eosinophilic leukaemia (CEL) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia. Except for CEL, Asians/Pacific Islanders had significantly lower MPN IRs than NHWs. ET, MPN-unclassifiable and CEL IRs were 18%, 19% and 60% higher, respectively, among blacks than NHWs. Five-year RS was more favourable for younger (<60 years) than older individuals and for women compared with men, except for PV at older ages. RS was highest (>90%) for younger PV and ET patients and lowest (<20%) for older chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia and atypical BCR-ABL1-negative CML patients. Varying MPN and MDS/MPN incidence patterns by subtype support distinct aetiologies and/or susceptible populations. Decreased survival rates as compared to that expected in the general population were associated with every MPN subtype, highlighting the need for new treatments, particularly among older individuals.","['Published 2016.

Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have enabled genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation. However, DNA methylation profiling often employs different designs and platforms with varying resolution, which hinders joint analysis of methylation data from multiple platforms. In this study, we propose a penalized functional regression model to impute missing methylation data. By incorporating functional predictors, our model utilizes information from nonlocal probes to improve imputation quality. Here, we compared the performance of our functional model to linear regression and the best single probe surrogate in real data and via simulations. Specifically, we applied different imputation approaches to an acute myeloid leukemia dataset consisting of 194 samples and our method showed higher imputation accuracy, manifested, for example, by a 94% relative increase in information content and up to 86% more CpG sites passing post-imputation filtering. Our simulated association study further demonstrated that our method substantially improves the statistical power to identify trait-associated methylation loci. These findings indicate that the penalized functional regression model is a convenient and valuable imputation tool for methylation data, and it can boost statistical power in downstream epigenome-wide association study (EWAS).","['(c) 2016 WILEY PERIODICALS, INC.']","['Zhang, Guosheng', 'Huang, Kuan-Chieh', 'Xu, Zheng', 'Tzeng, Jung-Ying', 'Conneely, Karen N', 'Guan, Weihua', 'Kang, Jian', 'Li, Yun']","['Zhang G', 'Huang KC', 'Xu Z', 'Tzeng JY', 'Conneely KN', 'Guan W', 'Kang J', 'Li Y']","['Department of Genetics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Curriculum in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Statistics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Genetics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Statistics, Bioinformatics Research Center, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Human Genetics, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota, Minnesota, United States of America.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.', 'Department of Genetics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Curriculum in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160407,United States,Genet Epidemiol,Genetic epidemiology,8411723,,IM,"['CpG Islands/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Genetic Association Studies/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Linear Models', 'Models, Genetic']",2016/04/12 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/04/11 06:00'],"['2015/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/03 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gepi.21969 [doi]'],ppublish,Genet Epidemiol. 2016 May;40(4):333-40. doi: 10.1002/gepi.21969.

Cytoreductive chemotherapy followed by donor leukocyte infusion (DLI) is one of the treatment modalities in relapsed patients. The current study evaluated the factors affecting overall survival (OS) in allo-SCT patients who received DLI after the first relapse. METHODS: In this retrospective study 54 patients (26 with acute myeloid leukemia [AML] and 28 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]) in their first relapse after allo-SCT who received fludarabine-based chemotherapy followed by DLI were evaluated. RESULTS: The relative risk for mortality was significantly higher in patients with acute leukemia (AL) within the high-risk group who went through transplantation (risk ratio: 4.866; 95% CI: 2.029-11.670;p<0.001) and in transplants performed in the remission phases following the first complete remission (risk ratio: 2.371; 95% CI: 1.154 - 4.872; p=0.019). Additionally, the relative mortality risk of transplantation in patients with acute leukemia (AL) with a number of DLIs applied (risk ratio: 0.456; 95% CI: 0.29 - 0.717; p=0.001) nd non-myeloablative regimen (risk ratio: 0.229; 95% CI: 0.053-0.992; p=0.049) was significantly lower.

Spanish section of the EUTOS population-based registry.,293-300,"OBJECTIVES: To provide more reliable data on the epidemiology of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in Spain than are currently available. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The EUTOS population-based project of European LeukemiaNet is a population registry of new CML cases in patients 18 years of age or older from 22 European areas. The Spanish section included the autonomous communities of Madrid, Castilla-La Mancha and Aragon, from 1-2-2010 to 31-12-2012. RESULTS: A total of 250 cases were recorded in 35 months. The overall incidence was 1.08 cases/10(5) inhabitants-year, with a predominance of men (58%) and clear differences among the communities. The incidence standardised by age was similar (overall, 1.04; men, 1.31; women, 0.81). The median age was 54 years. The incidence increased with age, reaching a peak at>65 years, although 31.7% of cases appeared between the ages of 20 and 44 years. Four percent of cases were diagnosed in advanced stages (2.4% in accelerated phase, 1.6% in blast crisis), 56% were asymptomatic, 38% had splenomegaly, and the Sokal score was high in 11% (lower than what was previously reflected in the literature). CONCLUSIONS: The current incidence of CML in Spain is higher than previously reported and similar to that of the European studies. Unlike the classical descriptions, CML presented mostly in asymptomatic form, with no splenomegaly, less leucocytosis and in stages with better prognosis.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. and Sociedad Espanola de Medicina', 'Interna (SEMI).

Incidence of MBL is higher among first-degree relatives of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and also increases with age and among men. We compared the incidence of MBL found in the same environment in both an open general population and relatives of CLL patients. METHODS: Samples were analyzed with 5-parameter flow cytometry using following monoclonal antibodies: kappa and lambda clonality, CD5, CD19, CD20. We analyzed 216 samples of patients in the Slovenian area of Lower Carniola aged 23-88 years. Fifty-four patients who came from families where CLL is present were compared by age and gender to 162 healthy individuals from the general population of the same region. RESULTS: We found 10 cases of MBL (4.6%). In 9.4% of younger (</= 50 years) first-degree relatives of CLL patients with immunophenotypic characteristics of atypical MBL, we observed a prevailingly normal kappa to lambda ratio. The difference in incidence of MBL cases between relatives and the general population decreases with age.

However, cartilage regeneration via chondrocyte transplantation is challenging, because chondrocytes lose their innate characteristics during in vitro expansion. Here, we investigated the mechanistic underpinning of the gene Ras homologue enriched in brain (RHEB) in the control of senescence and dedifferentiation through the modulation of oxidative stress in chondrocytes, a hallmark of osteoarthritis. Serial expansion of human chondrocytes led to senescence, dedifferentiation and oxidative stress. RHEB maintained the innate characteristics of chondrocytes by regulating senescence, dedifferentiation and oxidative stress, leading to the upregulation of COL2 expression via SOX9 and the downregulation of p27 expression via MCL1. RHEB also decreased the expression of COL10. RHEB knockdown mimics decreased the expression of SOX9, COL2 and MCL1, while abrogating the suppressive function of RHEB on p27 and COL10 in chondrocytes. RHEB-overexpressing chondrocytes successfully formed cartilage tissue in vitro as well as in vivo, with increased expression of GAG matrix and chondrogenic markers. RHEB induces a distinct gene expression signature that maintained the innate chondrogenic properties over a long period. Therefore, RHEB expression represents a potentially useful mechanism in terms of cartilage tissue regeneration from chondrocytes, by which chondrocyte phenotypic and molecular characteristics can be retained through the modulation of senescence, dedifferentiation and oxidative stress.

A survey on 460 Italian patients.,692-9,"Systemic mastocytosis is a rare heterogeneous myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by abnormal proliferation and activation of mast cells. We describe a large multicentre series of 460 adult patients with systemic mastocytosis, with a diagnosis based on WHO 2008 criteria, in a ""real-life"" setting of ten Italian centers with dedicated multidisciplinary programs. We included indolent forms with (n = 255) and without (n = 165) skin lesions, smouldering (n = 20), aggressive (n = 28), associated with other hematological diseases mastocytosis (n = 21) and mast cell leukemia (n = 1). This series was uniquely characterized by a substantial proportion of patients with low burden of neoplastic mast cells; notably, 38% of cases were diagnosed using only minor diagnostic criteria according to WHO 2008 classification, underlying the feasibility of early diagnosis where all diagnostic approaches are made available. This has particular clinical relevance for prevention of anaphylaxis manifestations, that were typically associated with indolent forms. In multivariate analysis, the most important features associated with shortened overall survival were disease subtype and age at diagnosis >60 years. Disease progression was correlated with mastocytosis subtype and thrombocytopenia. As many as 32% of patients with aggressive mastocytosis suffered from early evolution into acute leukemia. Overall, this study provides novel information about diagnostic approaches and current presentation of patients with SM and underlines the importance of networks and specialized centers to facilitate early diagnosis and prevent disease-associated manifestations.

The objective of this study was to describe the profile of CML patients in chronic phase currently receiving first-line therapy, including treatment, monitoring and response kinetics. A multicentre, cross-sectional, epidemiological survey in unselected chronic phase CML patients in France attending consultations during a one-month period was performed. 438 of 697 (62.8%) reported patients were currently receiving first-line treatment and were analysed. Imatinib was the most frequently received treatment (72.4% of patients). Retrospective cytogenetic and molecular assessments at 3, 6, 12 or 18 months were available in 88.4% of patients. At the 12-month assessment, 32.2% were not in major molecular response (MMR). At last assessment, among 355 patients with duration of treatment >/= 12 months, 91.5% had achieved MMR and 66.5% were in deep molecular response. This study, performed in everyday practice population of CML patients, suggests that monitoring of molecular responses in real-life practice is aligned with European LeukaemiaNet recommendations.

Using RNA sequencing, we determined in-frame fusion points and also analyzed the gene expression profile of NUP98-PHF23 positive AML. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrates that NUP98-PHF23 fusion shares gene expression signature of NUP98-HOXA9 fusion, the prototype of the NUP98-associated fusions, as well as the signature of leukemic stem cells. To our knowledge this is the first transcriptome analysis of human samples with NUP98-PHF23 positive AML.

The probability of finding a matched unrelated donor through the registries varies from 20 to 70%, depending on the ethnicity of the patients. Therefore, patients in need may benefit of an HLA-mismatched hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from haploidentical donors or from UCB. One of the advantages of using UCB is the lower incidence of acute graft-versus-host-disease and allowance of greater HLA mismatch. Conversely, the low number of HSCs and lymphocytes and specific immunological features of T cells are associated with delayed engraftment and immune reconstitution and consequently, increased opportunistic infections. Nevertheless, retrospective studies showed similar results comparing UCB with other stem cell sources, both in pediatric and adult setting. The ability to use partially HLA-matched UCB units allows expanding the donor pool. Many UCB banks have strategies to increase their inventory including UCB grafts that have rare haplotypes. HLA and cell dose are very important factors associated with outcomes after umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) that interact with each other. Increasing cell dose counterbalances the number of HLA disparities. Understanding those interactions, the role of HLA mismatches and other immunogenic factors, are important to allow clinicians to choose the best cord blood graft for patients.

While the degree of axonal damage is correlated with clinical disability, it is believed that remyelination can protect axons from degeneration and slow disease progression. Therefore, understanding the intricacies associated with myelination and remyelination may lead to therapeutics that can enhance the remyelination process and slow axon degeneration and loss of function. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) family cytokines such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin 11 (IL-11) are known to promote oligodendrocyte maturation and remyelination in experimental models of demyelination. Because CNTF family member binding to the gp130 receptor results in activation of the JAK2/Stat3 pathway we investigated the necessity of oligodendroglial Stat3 in transducing the signal required for myelination and remyelination. We found that Stat3 activation in the CNS coincides with myelination during development. Stimulation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) with CNTF or LIF promoted OPC survival and final differentiation, which was completely abolished by pharmacologic blockade of Stat3 activation with JAK2 inhibitor. Similarly, genetic ablation of Stat3 in oligodendrocyte lineage cells prevented CNTF-induced OPC differentiation in culture. In vivo, while oligodendroglial Stat3 signaling appears to be dispensable for developmental CNS myelination, it is required for oligodendrocyte regeneration and efficient remyelination after toxin-induced focal demyelination in the adult brain.

For the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), purine analogs, like clofarabine and cytarabine act synergistically. Little is known, however, on their interaction in vivo. We developed a method for the simultaneous determination of clofarabine and cytarabine in human plasma. The substances were extracted from plasma samples by protein precipitation with acetonitrile. Cladribine was the internal standard (IS). The analytes were separated on Synergi HydroRP column (150mmx2.0mm, 4mum) and a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry with an electrospray ionisation (ESI) source was applied for detection. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile, ammonium acetate 2mM and 0.5% formic acid in a gradient mode at a flow rate of 0.5ml/min. The injection volume was 10mul and the total run time was 6.0min. Retention times were 2.46min for clofarabine, 0.97min for cytarabine and 2.43min for the IS. Calibration ranges were 8-1000ng/ml for clofarabine and 20-2500ng/ml for cytarabine. The intra-day and inter-day precision was less than 15% and the relative standard deviation was all within +/-15%. This new method allows a rapid and simple determination of both clofarabine and cytarabine in human plasma.

Previous studies have shown that urolithins, the intestinal microflora metabolites of ellagitannin, exhibit anti-inflammation and antioxidative properties. This study aims to investigate the protective effect of urolithin A (UA) on ox-LDL-induced (where ox-LDL is oxidized low-density lipoprotein) endothelial dysfunction and possible modes of action. METHODS AND RESULTS: Human artery endothelial cells were incubated with 50 mug/mL ox-LDL and various concentrations of UA for 24 h. UA improved the productions of nitric oxide and endothelial nitric oxide synthase in a dose-dependent manner. UA markedly reduced the expressions of ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) and MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic protein 1) and further attenuated THP-1 (human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) cell adhesion. In addition, UA suppressed expressions of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6, and endothelin 1, and increased PPAR-gamma (peroxisome proliferators activated receptor gamma) mRNA expression. Moreover, UA decreased miR-27 expression, and overexpression of miR-27 by adding pre-miR-27 abolished the ability of UA to improve ox-LDL-induced PPAR-gamma decrease. Furthermore, UA significantly downregulated phosphorylated ERK1/2 (where ERK is extracellular signal-regulated kinase) while decreasing interleukin 6 level and elevating PPAR-gamma. CONCLUSIONS: UA could alleviate endothelial dysfunction induced by ox-LDL partially through modulating miR-27 expression and ERK/PPAR-gamma pathway.","['(c) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

METHODS: The karyotypes of 122 initially treated MDS patients were analyzed with conventional R-banding and FISH using probes including GLP CSF1R/D5S23, D5S721, GLP EGR1/D5S23, D5S721, GLP D7S486/CSP7, GLP D7S522/CSP7, GLP D20S108, CSP8 and CSP X/Y. RESULTS: The detection rate of chromosomal abnormalities was 54.9% for the 122 patients. Among these, those involving 3 or more chromosomes are most common (16.4%), followed by +8(14.8%), -7/7q-(7.4%), -5/5q-(5.7%), 20q-(2.5%), and -Y in male patients (5.0%). Two MDS-RAEB II patients detected with t(8;21) should be diagnosed with acute myelocytic leukemia. FISH analysis showed that 54 patients were positive (44.3%).

METHODS: p15AS and p15 mRNA in two leukemia cell lines was detected with strand-specific primer RT-qPCR. To explore the connection between p15AS and AML, 43 patients with newly diagnosed AML and 21 patients with benign diseases (Iron deficiency anemia) as controls were enrolled. The expression level of p15AS in bone marrow cells derived from the patients and the controls were determined by strand-specific primer RT-qPCR, and its relationship with clinical features was analyzed. RESULTS: The two AML lines displayed high p15AS and low p15 expression. Samples derived from the AML patients showed relatively increased expression of p15AS and down-regulated p15 expression in their bone cells. In contrast, the 21 controls showed high expression of p15 but relatively low expression of the p15AS. Compared with the normal controls, the expression levels of p15 protein were significantly lower among the AML patients (P<0.01). No relationships were detected between the level of p15AS and the patient's age, gender, FAB subtype, total white blood cell count, platelet count, proliferative degree of bone marrow cell and karyotype classification (P>0.05 for all comparisons).

We found that cabozantinib was significantly cytotoxic to MV4-11 and Molm-13 cells that harbored FLT3-ITD, resulting in IC50 values of 2.4 nM and 2.0 nM, respectively. However, K562, OCI-AML3 and THP-1 (leukemia cell lines lacking FLT3-ITD) were resistant to cabozantinib, showing IC50 values in the micromolar range. Cabozantinib arrested MV4-11 cell growth at the G0/G1 phase within 24 h, which was associated with decreased phosphorylation of FLT3, STAT5, AKT and ERK. Additionally, cabozantinib induced MV4-11 cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (as indicated by annexin V staining and high levels of cleaved caspase 3 and PARP-1), down-regulated the anti-apoptotic protein survivin and up-regulated the pro-apoptotic protein Bak. Thus, cabozantinib is selectively cytotoxic to leukemia cells with FLT3-ITD, causing cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. In mouse xenograft model, cabozantinib significantly inhibited MV4-11 and Molm-13 tumor growth at a dosage of 10 mg/kg and showed longer survival rate.

Cellular responses to hypoxia are largely mediated by the hypoxia-inducible factors, Hif-1 and Hif-2. The oxygen-regulated alpha subunits of Hif-1 and Hif-2 (namely, Hif-1alpha and Hif-2alpha) form dimers with their stably expressed beta subunits and control the transcription of downstream hypoxia-responsive genes to facilitate adaptation to low oxygen tension. An initial study concluded that Hif-1alpha is essential for HSC maintenance, whereby Hif-1alpha-deficient HSCs lost their ability to self-renew in serial transplantation assays. In another study, we demonstrated that Hif-2alpha is dispensable for cell-autonomous HSC maintenance, both under steady-state conditions and following transplantation. Given these unexpected findings, we set out to revisit the role of Hif-1alpha in cell-autonomous HSC functions. Here we demonstrate that inducible acute deletion of Hif-1alpha has no impact on HSC survival. Notably, unstressed HSCs lacking Hif-1alpha efficiently self-renew and sustain long-term multilineage hematopoiesis upon serial transplantation. Finally, Hif-1alpha-deficient HSCs recover normally after hematopoietic injury induced by serial administration of 5-fluorouracil. We therefore conclude that despite the hypoxic nature of the bone marrow microenvironment, Hif-1alpha is dispensable for cell-autonomous HSC maintenance.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Vukovic, Milica', 'Sepulveda, Catarina', 'Subramani, Chithra', 'Guitart, Amelie V', 'Mohr, Jasmine', 'Allen, Lewis', 'Panagopoulou, Theano I', 'Paris, Jasmin', 'Lawson, Hannah', 'Villacreces, Arnaud', 'Armesilla-Diaz, Alejandro', 'Gezer, Deniz', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Ratcliffe, Peter J', 'Kranc, Kamil R']","['Vukovic M', 'Sepulveda C', 'Subramani C', 'Guitart AV', 'Mohr J', 'Allen L', 'Panagopoulou TI', 'Paris J', 'Lawson H', 'Villacreces A', 'Armesilla-Diaz A', 'Gezer D', 'Holyoake TL', 'Ratcliffe PJ', 'Kranc KR']","['MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom;', 'MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom;', 'MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom;', 'MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom;', 'MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom;', 'MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom;', 'MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom;', 'MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom;', 'MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom;', 'MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom;', 'MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom;', ""MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom; Klinik fuer Haematologie, Onkologie und Stammzelltransplantation, Universitaetsklinikum Aachen, Aachen, Germany; Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute for Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom; and."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute for Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom; and."", 'Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160408,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Hif1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['Adult Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic']",2016/04/10 06:00,2017/08/09 06:00,['2016/04/10 06:00'],"['2015/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34495-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-10-677138 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jun 9;127(23):2841-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-10-677138.

Only a handful of recurring genetic mutations have been identified and none is specific to BPDCN. In this study, through molecular cloning in an index case that presented a balanced t(3;5)(q21;q31) and molecular cytogenetic analyses in a further 46 cases, we identify monoallelic deletion of NR3C1 (5q31), encoding the glucocorticoid receptor (GCR), in 13 of 47 (28%) BPDCN patients. Targeted deep sequencing in 36 BPDCN cases, including 10 with NR3C1 deletion, did not reveal NR3C1 point mutations or indels. Haploinsufficiency for NR3C1 defined a subset of BPDCN with lowered GCR expression and extremely poor overall survival (P = .0006). Consistent with a role for GCR in tumor suppression, functional analyses coupled with gene expression profiling identified corticoresistance and loss-of-EZH2 function as major downstream consequences of NR3C1 deletion in BPDCN. Subsequently, more detailed analyses of the t(3;5)(q21;q31) revealed fusion of NR3C1 to a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) gene (lincRNA-3q) that encodes a novel, nuclear, noncoding RNA involved in the regulation of leukemia stem cell programs and G1/S transition, via E2F. Overexpression of lincRNA-3q was a consistent feature of malignant cells and could be abrogated by bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) protein inhibition. Taken together, this work points to NR3C1 as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in a subset of BPDCN and identifies BET inhibition, acting at least partially via lncRNA blockade, as a novel treatment option in BPDCN.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Emadali, Anouk', 'Hoghoughi, Neda', 'Duley, Samuel', 'Hajmirza, Azadeh', 'Verhoeyen, Els', 'Cosset, Francois-Loic', 'Bertrand, Philippe', 'Roumier, Christophe', 'Roggy, Anne', 'Suchaud-Martin, Celine', 'Chauvet, Martine', 'Bertrand, Sarah', 'Hamaidia, Sieme', 'Rousseaux, Sophie', 'Josserand, Veronique', 'Charles, Julie', 'Templier, Isabelle', 'Maeda, Takahiro', 'Bruder-Costa, Juliana', 'Chaperot, Laurence', 'Plumas, Joel', 'Jacob, Marie-Christine', 'Bonnefoix, Thierry', 'Park, Sophie', 'Gressin, Remy', 'Tensen, Cornelis P', 'Mecucci, Cristina', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth', 'Leroux, Dominique', 'Brambilla, Elisabeth', 'Nguyen-Khac, Florence', 'Luquet, Isabelle', 'Penther, Dominique', 'Bastard, Christian', 'Jardin, Fabrice', 'Lefebvre, Christine', 'Garnache, Francine', 'Callanan, Mary B']","['Emadali A', 'Hoghoughi N', 'Duley S', 'Hajmirza A', 'Verhoeyen E', 'Cosset FL', 'Bertrand P', 'Roumier C', 'Roggy A', 'Suchaud-Martin C', 'Chauvet M', 'Bertrand S', 'Hamaidia S', 'Rousseaux S', 'Josserand V', 'Charles J', 'Templier I', 'Maeda T', 'Bruder-Costa J', 'Chaperot L', 'Plumas J', 'Jacob MC', 'Bonnefoix T', 'Park S', 'Gressin R', 'Tensen CP', 'Mecucci C', 'Macintyre E', 'Leroux D', 'Brambilla E', 'Nguyen-Khac F', 'Luquet I', 'Penther D', 'Bastard C', 'Jardin F', 'Lefebvre C', 'Garnache F', 'Callanan MB']","['INSERM U1209, CNRS UMR 5309, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Grenoble Alpes, Institut Albert Bonniot, Grenoble, France;', 'INSERM U1209, CNRS UMR 5309, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Grenoble Alpes, Institut Albert Bonniot, Grenoble, France;', 'INSERM U1209, CNRS UMR 5309, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Grenoble Alpes, Institut Albert Bonniot, Grenoble, France;', 'INSERM U1209, CNRS UMR 5309, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Grenoble Alpes, Institut Albert Bonniot, Grenoble, France;', 'International Center for Infectiology Research, Universite de Lyon 1, Lyon, France;

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To uncover mutations associated with CLL relapse, we have performed whole-exome sequencing in a discovery cohort of 61 relapsed CLL patients identifying 86 recurrently mutated genes. The variant allele fractions (VAF) of 19 genes with mutations in >/=3 of 61 cases were measured in 53 paired pre- and posttreatment CLL samples sorted to purity using panel-based deep resequencing or by droplet digital PCR. RESULTS: We identify mutations in TP53 as the dominant subclonal gene driver of relapsed CLL often demonstrating substantial increases in VAFs. Subclonal mutations in SAMHD1 also recurrently demonstrated increased VAFs at relapse. Mutations in ATP10A, FAT3, FAM50A, and MGA, although infrequent, demonstrated enrichment in >/=2 cases each. In contrast, mutations in NOTCH1, SF3B1, POT1, FBXW7, MYD88, NXF1, XPO1, ZMYM3, or CHD2 were predominantly already clonal prior to therapy indicative of a pretreatment pathogenetic driver role in CLL. Quantitative analyses of clonal dynamics uncover rising, stable, and falling clones and subclones without clear evidence that gene mutations other than in TP53 and possibly SAMHD1 are frequently selected for at CLL relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Data in aggregate support a provisional categorization of CLL-associated recurrently mutated genes into three classes (i) often subclonal before therapy and strongly enriched after therapy, or, (ii) mostly clonal before therapy or without further enrichments at relapse, or, (iii) subclonal before and after therapy and enriching only in sporadic cases.

P2X7 is a member of the P2X family ligand-gated ion channels respond to extracellular ATP. High level expression of P2X7 was detected in leukemia samples, especially in relapsed cases. However, the role of P2X7 mediated signaling in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) as well as its potential role in leukemogenesis have not been established. In this study, the expression of P2X7 in hematopoietic cells in different lineages and stages was analyzed. Over-expression of P2X7 in HSPCs was carried out by retrovirus infection to study the impact on HSPCs. The results showed that low level expression of P2X7 was detected in HSPCs. Over-expression of P2X7 in HSPCs resulted in decreased colony forming ability in vitro and engraftment potential in vivo.

Elderly women had significantly more circulating B cells than men, whereas men had more CD4 central memory T cells and higher monocyte levels. Plasma adiponectin levels were higher in women, plasma retinol-binding protein 4 levels were higher in men, but there were no significant gender differences in C-reactive protein, IL-15, or sphingosine-1-phosphate. Women had a higher ratio of immature CD56(bright) NK cells to mature CD56(dim) NK cells, indicating a gender difference in NK cell maturation in the elderly. Comparing sexes, female mature NK cells had more vigorous cytotoxic granule responses to K562 leukemia cells and IFN-gamma responses to NKp46 crosslinking.

The development of nanostructured recombinant materials in innovative nanomedical activities expands such a need beyond plain functional polypeptides to complex protein assemblies. While Escherichia coli has been recently modified for the production of endotoxin-free proteins, no data has been so far recorded regarding how the system performs in the fabrication of smart nanostructured materials. RESULTS: We have here explored the nanoarchitecture and in vitro and in vivo functionalities of CXCR4-targeted, self-assembling protein nanoparticles intended for intracellular delivery of drugs and imaging agents in colorectal cancer. Interestingly, endotoxin-free materials exhibit a distinguishable architecture and altered size and target cell penetrability than counterparts produced in conventional E. coli strains. These variant nanoparticles show an eventual proper biodistribution and highly specific and exclusive accumulation in tumor upon administration in colorectal cancer mice models, indicating a convenient display and function of the tumor homing peptides and high particle stability under physiological conditions. DISCUSSION: The observations made here support the emerging endotoxin-free E. coli system as a robust protein material producer but are also indicative of a particular conformational status and organization of either building blocks or oligomers. This appears to be promoted by multifactorial stress-inducing conditions upon engineering of the E. coli cell envelope, which impacts on the protein quality control of the cell factory.",,"['Rueda,

Immunogenetic studies of the clonotypic BCR Ig of CLL subset #4 suggested a resemblance with B cells rendered anergic through chronic autoantigenic stimulation. In this article, we provide experimental evidence that subset #4 CLL cells show low IgG levels, constitutive ERK1/2 activation, and fail to either release intracellular Ca(2+) or activate MAPK signaling after BCR cross-linking, thus displaying a signature of B cell anergy at both biochemical and functional levels. Interestingly, TLR1/2 triggering restored BCR functionality, likely breaching the anergic state, and this was accompanied by induction of the miR-17 approximately 92 cluster, whose members target critical BCR-associated molecules, including MAPKs. In conclusion, we demonstrate BCR anergy in CLL subset #4 and implicate TLR signaling and the miR-17 approximately 92 cluster in the regulation of the anergic state. This detailed signaling profiling of subset #4 has implications for advanced understanding of the complex regulation of intracellular signaling pathways in CLL, currently a major therapeutic target of the disease.","['Copyright (c) 2016 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Ntoufa, Stavroula', 'Papakonstantinou, Nikos', 'Apollonio, Benedetta', 'Gounari, Maria', 'Galigalidou, Chrysi', 'Fonte, Eleonora', 'Anagnostopoulos, Achilles', 'Belessi, Chrysoula', 'Muzio, Marta', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas']","['Ntoufa S', 'Papakonstantinou N', 'Apollonio B', 'Gounari M', 'Galigalidou C', 'Fonte E', 'Anagnostopoulos A', 'Belessi C', 'Muzio M', 'Ghia P', 'Stamatopoulos K']","['Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki 57001, Greece; Hematology Department and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Unit, George Papanikolaou Hospital, Thessaloniki 57010, Greece;', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki 57001, Greece; Hematology Department and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Unit, George Papanikolaou Hospital, Thessaloniki 57010, Greece;', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy;', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy;', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki 57001, Greece;', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy;', 'Hematology Department and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Unit, George Papanikolaou Hospital, Thessaloniki 57010, Greece;', 'Hematology Department, Nikea General Hospital, Pireaus 18454, Greece;', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy;', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy; Lymphoma Unit, Department of Onco-Hematology, Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan 20132, Italy; and.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki 57001, Greece; Hematology Department and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Unit, George Papanikolaou Hospital, Thessaloniki 57010, Greece; Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala 75105, Sweden kostas.stamatopoulos@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160408,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (MIR17HG, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (TLR11 protein, human)', '0 (TLR2 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', '*Clonal Anergy', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/*genetics', 'Toll-Like Receptors/*genetics']",2016/04/10 06:00,2017/07/01 06:00,['2016/04/10 06:00'],"['2015/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/01 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1502297 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1502297 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2016 May 15;196(10):4410-7. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1502297.

However, their function during early embryo development has been poorly explored. In this study, we investigated the role of mixed-lineage leukemia protein 2 (MLL2) in the development of porcine preimplantation embryos. To explore the function of MLL2 in porcine embryo development, expression and localization of MLL2 were assessed by qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence assays. Results showed that expression of MLL2 was significantly reduced after the four-cell stage. However, immunofluorescence results showed that MLL2 only localized in the nucleus of blastocysts, revealing a potential role of MLL2 in regulating the gene expression in the blastocyst stage. Knockdown of Mll2 by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) caused a reduction in MLL2 signal in porcine blastocyst cells and in blastocyst formation. No significant differences in the cleavage and morula stages were observed. The mechanism of MLL2 regulation in blastocysts was assessed by assaying the trimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 4 (H3K4m3). MLL2 knockdown significantly reduced H3K4m3 in the nucleus and further reduced expression of Sox2 and Magoh genes.

METHODS: We studied 77,233 women with breast cancer aged >/=65 in 1992-2009 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked data with up to 19 years of follow-up. RESULTS: Incidence of VTE increased from 9 cases in women receiving no chemotherapy and no CSFs/ESAs to 22.79 cases per 1,000 person-years in those receiving chemotherapy with CSFs and ESAs. Women with chemotherapy who received both CSFs and ESAs (adjusted hazard ratio and 95 % confidence interval 2.01, 1.80-2.25) or received ESAs without CSFs (2.03, 1.74-2.36) were twice as likely to develop VTE than those receiving no chemotherapy and no CSFs/ESAs, whereas those receiving CSF alone without ESA were 64 % more likely to have VTE (1.64, 1.45-1.85). Risk of MDS was significantly increased by fivefold in patients receiving ESA following chemotherapy.

METHODS: We developed a particle-based method that is simple, effective and specifically expands cytotoxic NK cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) both ex vivo and in vivo. This method uses particles prepared from plasma membranes of K562-mb21-41BBL cells, expressing 41BBL and membrane bound interleukin-21 (PM21 particles). RESULTS: Ex vivo, PM21 particles caused specific NK-cell expansion from PBMCs from healthy donors (mean 825-fold, range 163-2216, n = 13 in 14 days) and acute myeloid leukemia patients. The PM21 particles also stimulated in vivo NK cell expansion in NSG mice. Ex vivo pre-activation of PBMCs with PM21 particles (PM21-PBMC) before intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection resulted in 66-fold higher amounts of hNK cells in peripheral blood (PB) of mice compared with unactivated PBMCs on day 12 after injection. In vivo administration of PM21 particles resulted in a dose-dependent increase of PB hNK cells in mice injected i.p. with 2.0 x 10(6) PM21-PBMCs (11% NK cells). Optimal dose of 800 microg/injection of PM21 particles (twice weekly) with low-dose interleukin 2 (1000 U/thrice weekly) resulted in 470 +/- 40 hNK/microL and 95 +/- 2% of total hCD45(+) cells by day 12 in PB. Furthermore, hNK cells were found in marrow, spleen, lung, liver and brain (day 16 after i.p. PM21/PBMC injection), and mice injected with PM21 particles had higher amounts. CONCLUSIONS: The extent of NK cells observed in PB, their persistence and the biodistribution would be relevant for cancer treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2016 International Society for Cellular Therapy.

Although this shift away from traditional cytotoxic therapies represents an innovative approach to AML therapy, a number of obstacles stand in the way of widespread adoption of targeted therapy into daily practice. For example, the effects of single agents are marginal, and the degree of variability among patients is great. Some have advocated incorporation of newly identified biomarkers into clinical trials to guide patient-specific treatment, but the relevance of these biomarkers to clinical response is uncertain and requires further validation. Combining targeted agents with other targeted agents or with conventional chemotherapy to overcome the biological heterogeneity of AML may enhance treatment efficacy; however, drug toxicities also are increased and drug resistance continues to occur. Overall survival is an impractical endpoint for clinical trials of AML, which may be addressed by using the endpoint of event-free survival to evaluate novel targeted agents. Another barrier to implementation is the high cost and limited availability of targeted agents.

These screens reveal the heterodimeric, circadian rhythm TFs Clock and Bmal1 as genes required for the growth of AML cells in vitro and in vivo. Disruption of canonical circadian pathway components produces anti-leukemic effects, including impaired proliferation, enhanced myeloid differentiation, and depletion of LSCs.

Cancer belongs to the leading disease burden in industrialized and developing countries. Successful cancer therapy is hampered by the development of resistance towards established anticancer drugs. AIM: In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of 29 extracts from 26 medicinal plants of South-Africa against leukemia cell lines, most of which are used traditionally to treat cancer and related symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We have investigated the plant extracts for their cytotoxic activity towards drug-sensitive parental CCRF-CEM leukemia cells and their multidrug-resistant P-glycoprotein-overexpressing subline, CEM/ADR5000 by means of the resazurin assay. A panel of 60 NCI tumor cell lines have been investigated for correlations between selected phytochemicals from medicinal plants and the expression of resistance-conferring genes (ABC-transporters, oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes). RESULTS: Seven extracts inhibited both cell lines (Acokanthera oppositifolia, Hypoestes aristata, Laurus nobilis, Leonotis leonurus, Plectranthus barbatus, Plectranthus ciliates, Salvia apiana). CEM/ADR5000 cells exhibited a low degree of cross-resistance (3.35-fold) towards the L. leonurus extract, while no cross-resistance was observed to other plant extracts, although CEM/ADR5000 cells were highly resistant to clinically established drugs. The log10IC50 values for two out of 14 selected phytochemicals from these plants (acovenoside A and ouabain) of 60 tumor cell lines were correlated to the expression of ABC-transporters (ABCB1, ABCB5, ABCC1, ABCG2), oncogenes (EGFR, RAS) and tumor suppressors (TP53). Sensitivity or resistance of the cell lines were not statistically associated with the expression of these genes, indicating that multidrug-resistant, refractory tumors expressing these genes may still respond to acovenoside A and ouabain. CONCLUSION: The bioactivity of South African medicinal plants may represent a basis for the development of strategies to treat multidrug-resistant tumors either by phytotherapeutic approaches with whole plant preparations or by classical drug development with isolated compounds such as acovenoside A or ouabain.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We previously showed that PML knockdown promotes early-onset hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg)-transgenic mice. Here we report the effects of PML restoration on late-onset HBsAg-induced HCC. We compared protein expression patterns, genetic mutations and the effects of pharmacologically targeting PML in wild-type, PML-/-, PML+/+HBsAgtg/o and PML-/-HBsAgtg/o mice. PML-/- mice exhibited somatic mutations in DNA repair genes and developed severe steatosis and proliferative disorders, but not HCC. PML-/-HBsAgtg/o mice exhibited early mutations in cancer driver genes and developed hyperplasia, fatty livers and indolent adipose-like HCC. In PML+/+HBsAg-transgenic mice, HBsAg expression declined over time, and HBsAg-associated PML suppression was concomitantly relieved. Nevertheless, these mice accumulated mutations in genes contributing to oxidative stress pathways and developed aggressive late-onset angiogenic trabecular HCC. PML inhibition using non-toxic doses of arsenic trioxide selectively killed long-term HBsAg-affected liver cells in PML+/+HBsAgtg/o mice with falling HBsAg and rising PML levels, but not normal liver cells or early-onset HCC cells in PML-/-HBsAgtg/0 mice.

We compared postremission treatment with chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in 169 FLT3-ITDmut intermediate cytogenetic risk AML patients with allelic ratio evaluable at diagnosis who achieved first complete remission (CR1) with induction therapy. To minimize selection bias, the analysis was limited to patients who remained in CR1 for at least 4 months (median time to HSCT) after achieving CR1, and propensity score matching was implemented. Sensitivity analysis including patients who remained in CR1 for at least 3 months was applied as well. HSCT in CR1 was associated with longer relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS), with 3-year estimated rates of 18% and 24%, respectively (P < .001), for patients receiving chemotherapy and 46% and 54%, respectively (P < .001), for those undergoing HSCT. Multivariate regression models showed that HSCT remained statistically significant with improved RFS and OS independent of FLT3-ITD allelic ratio and NPM1 status. Irrespective of postremission therapy, relapse remains the main reason for treatment failure, with a 3-year incidence of 68% in chemotherapy recipients versus 41% in HSCT recipients. Allogeneic HSCT improved disease outcomes compared with chemotherapy after propensity score matching was applied. The improvement observed for RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.55; P = .09) and OS (HR, 0.58; P = .10) with HSCT as postremission therapy in patients who remained in CR1 for at least 4 months did not reach statistical significance; however, the sensitivity analyses including patients who remained in CR1 for at least 3 months showed significant improvement in both RFS (HR, 0.31; P = .002) and OS (HR, 0.27; P = .02) after propensity score matching. Our results indicate that HSCT in CR1 for AML FLT3-ITDmut patients is associated with longer RFS and OS.

METHODS: We calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for ANLL/AML using lifetable analyses, with various exposure quantile categories and lag times. RESULTS: Workers in the highest exposure categories had significantly elevated risks of ANLL and AML; no leukemia cases occurred in lower exposure categories. Exposure within 10 years of cancer onset appears most relevant for leukemia induction. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed the association between high-level benzene exposures and leukemia risks, and provided further evidence of a threshold effect and relevant exposure window.

Nucleophosmin plays crucial roles in ribosome maturation and export, centrosome duplication, cell cycle progression, histone assembly and response to a variety of stress stimuli. Much interest in this protein has arisen in the past ten years, since the discovery of heterozygous mutations in the terminal exon of the NPM1 gene, which are the most frequent genetic alteration in acute myeloid leukemia. Nucleophosmin is also frequently overexpressed in solid tumours and, in many cases, its overexpression correlates with mitotic index and metastatization. Therefore it is considered as a promising target for the treatment of both haematologic and solid malignancies. NPM1 targeting molecules may suppress different functions of the protein, interfere with its subcellular localization, with its oligomerization properties or drive its degradation. In the recent years, several such molecules have been described and here we review what is currently known about them, their interaction with nucleophosmin and the mechanistic basis of their toxicity. Collectively, these molecules exemplify a number of different strategies that can be adopted to target nucleophosmin and we summarize them at the end of the review.",,"['Di Matteo, Adele', 'Franceschini, Mimma', 'Chiarella, Sara', 'Rocchio, Serena', 'Travaglini-Allocatelli, Carlo', 'Federici, Luca']","['Di Matteo A', 'Franceschini M', 'Chiarella S', 'Rocchio S', 'Travaglini-Allocatelli C', 'Federici L']","['Istituto di Biologia e Patologia Molecolari, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Rome, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche, Orali e Biotecnologiche, Universita di Chieti ""G. d\'Annunzio"", Chieti, Italy.', 'Ce.S.I.-MeT Centro Scienze dell\'Invecchiamento-Medicina Traslazionale, Universita di Chieti ""G. d\'Annunzio"", Chieti, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche, Orali e Biotecnologiche, Universita di Chieti ""G. d\'Annunzio"", Chieti, Italy.', 'Ce.S.I.-MeT Centro Scienze dell\'Invecchiamento-Medicina Traslazionale, Universita di Chieti ""G. d\'Annunzio"", Chieti, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Biochimiche ""A.

We evaluated the role of variations in the bilirubin uridine-5-diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase gene (UGT1A1) in unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia development during chemotherapy in pediatric patients with leukemia. METHODS: UGT1A1 allelic variations were evaluated in 25 Japanese pediatric leukemia patients with hyperbilirubinemia (peak serum bilirubin concentration 3.57 +/- 1.02 mg/dl) and 25 control patients without hyperbilirubinemia (0.92 +/- 0.32 mg/dl) by PCR-direct sequencing. RESULTS: In the hyperbilirubinemic group, 22 of 25 patients showed biallelic variations of UGT1A1. Nine (36%) patients were homozygous for UGT1A1*6 and eight (32%) were compound heterozygous for UGT1A1*6 and UGT1A1*28. Three (12%) patients were homozygous for UGT1A1*28. There were no biallelic variations in UGT1A1 in the non-hyperbilirubinemic group. The allelic frequencies of UGT1A1*6 in the hyperbilirubinemic group (0.58) was significantly higher than those of the non-hyperbilirubinemic group (0.1) (chi(2) = 25.7, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The high frequency of biallelic variations of UGT1A1 in the hyperbilirubinemic group suggests an association with Gilbert syndrome. Therefore, it is not necessary to cease chemotherapy in patients with these mutations who develop unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia without associated liver dysfunction.",,"['Nomura, Akitaka', 'Maruo, Yoshihiro', 'Taga, Takashi', 'Takeuchi, Yoshihiro']","['Nomura A', 'Maruo Y', 'Taga T', 'Takeuchi Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160408,United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (UGT1A1 enzyme)', 'EC 2.4.1.17 (Glucuronosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Glucuronosyltransferase/*genetics', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Hyperbilirubinemia/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Japan', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Genetic']",2016/04/09 06:00,2017/05/23 06:00,['2016/04/09 06:00'],"['2015/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['pr201675 [pii]', '10.1038/pr.2016.75 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Res. 2016 Aug;80(2):252-7. doi: 10.1038/pr.2016.75.

The mechanisms that activate BCR signaling differ substantially among subtypes of B-cell lymphoma and leukemia. These include BCR stimulation by foreign or self-antigens, or the acquisition of mutations in components of the BCR pathway that result in autonomous or enhanced antigen-induced BCR signaling. Targeting BCR signaling with selective inhibitors of the BCR-associated kinases Bruton's tyrosine kinase, spleen tyrosine kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta induces high response rates in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the activated B-cell-like subtype and is currently transforming the therapeutic landscape in these diseases.

The aim of the current investigation was to evaluate the effect of oral magnesium oxide (MgO) supplementation on cisplatin-induced hypomagnesemia. METHODS: This parallel-randomized controlled, open label trial was conducted in a hospital of Iran University of Medical Sciences in Tehran between December 2009 and May 2011. Participants were 69 adult patients with newly diagnosed non- leukemia neoplasms candidate for starting cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Oral MgO supplement according to cisplatin dose (500 mg MgO per 50 mg/m(2) of cisplatin) as 2-3 divided daily doses was started after completion of each chemotherapy cycle and continued to the next cycle for the intervention group. Patients in the control group did not receive any supplementation. Serum magnesium (Mg) was measured before each chemotherapy cycle. The main outcome was measuring serum Mg change and hypomagnesaemia rate during chemotherapy treatment. RESULTS: Sixty-two participants (31 intervention- 31 controls) enrolled into the study. Serum Mg levels showed significant difference between the two groups (P=0.01). There was a significant decrease in serum Mg of the control group (P=0.001). At the end of follow-up period prevalence of hypomagnesaemia in the intervention group was 10.7% versus 23.1% in the control group. CONCLUSION: Continuously oral supplementation with MgO according to cisplatin dose (500 mg MgO per 50 mg/m(2) cisplatin) as 2-3 divided daily doses at rest days between chemotherapy cycles reduces the decline in serum Mg levels and also the prevalence of hypomagnesaemia in cancer patients.",,"['Zarif Yeganeh, Maryam', 'Vakili, Masoud', 'Shahriari-Ahmadi, Ali', 'Nojomi, Marzieh']","['Zarif Yeganeh M', 'Vakili M', 'Shahriari-Ahmadi A', 'Nojomi M']","['Dept. of Nutrition, Rasoul-e-Akram Hospital, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Oncopathology Research Center, Dept. of Hematology-Oncology, Rasoul-e-Akram Hospital, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Dept. of Hematology-Oncology, Rasoul-e-Akram Hospital, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Dept. of Community Medicine, School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Public Health,Iranian journal of public health,7505531,,,,2016/04/09 06:00,2016/04/09 06:01,['2016/04/09 06:00'],"['2016/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/09 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Public Health. 2016 Jan;45(1):54-62.,,,,PMC4822394,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Cisplatin', 'Hypomagnesaemia', 'Magnesium', 'Magnesium oxide']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we investigated the number and function of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in fresh peripheral blood and matched bone marrow samples from 42 MDS patients and the potential correlation with risk of disease progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In peripheral blood, very low-/low risk patients had significantly lower median MDSC number (0.16x10(9)/L(0.03-0.40)) compared to intermediate-/high-/very high risk patients, in whom median MDSC counts was 0.52x10(9)/L(0.10-1.78), p < 0.005. When co-cultured with CD4+ effector T-cells (T-effectors), MDSCs suppress Teffector proliferation in both allogeneic and autologous settings. There was a positive correlation between the number of Tregs and MDSCs (Spearman R = 0.825, p < 0.005) in high risk and not low risk patients. We also investigated MDSCs' expression of bone marrow-homing chemokine receptors, and our data shows that MDSCs from MDS patients express both CXCR4 and CX3CR1 which might facilitate migration of MDSCs to bone marrow. Monocytic MDSCs(M-MDSCs) which are more frequent in the peripheral blood express higher levels of CX3CR1 and CXCR4 than the granulocytic subtype (G-MDSCs), and circulating M-MDSCs had significantly higher CX3CR1 expression compared to bone-marrow M-MDSCs in intermediate-/high-/very high risk MDS. Our results suggest that MDSCs contribute significantly to the dysregulation of immune surveillance in MDS, which is different between low and high risk disease.

In this study, the selective BCL-2 inhibitor ABT199 was tested in a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines with diverse expression levels of BCL-2 and other BCL-2 family proteins. ABT199 caused apoptosis more potently in neuroblastoma cell lines expressing high BCL-2 and BIM/BCL-2 complex levels than low expressing cell lines. Effects on cell viability correlated with effects on BIM displacement from BCL-2 and cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. ABT199 treatment of mice with neuroblastoma tumors expressing high BCL-2 levels only resulted in growth inhibition, despite maximum BIM displacement from BCL-2 and the induction of a strong apoptotic response. We showed that neuroblastoma cells might survive ABT199 treatment due to its acute upregulation of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein myeloid cell leukaemia sequence 1 (MCL-1) and BIM sequestration by MCL-1. In vitro inhibition of MCL-1 sensitized neuroblastoma cell lines to ABT199, confirming the pivotal role of MCL-1 in ABT199 resistance. Our findings suggest that neuroblastoma patients with high BCL-2 and BIM/BCL-2 complex levels might benefit from combination treatment with ABT199 and compounds that inhibit MCL-1 expression.",,"['Bate-Eya, Laurel T', 'den Hartog, Ilona J M', 'van der Ploeg, Ida', 'Schild, Linda', 'Koster, Jan', 'Santo, Evan E', 'Westerhout, Ellen M', 'Versteeg, Rogier', 'Caron, Huib N', 'Molenaar, Jan J', 'Dolman, M Emmy M']","['Bate-Eya LT', 'den Hartog IJ', 'van der Ploeg I', 'Schild L', 'Koster J', 'Santo EE', 'Westerhout EM', 'Versteeg R', 'Caron HN', 'Molenaar JJ', 'Dolman ME']","['Department of Oncogenomics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Oncogenomics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Oncogenomics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Oncogenomics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Oncogenomics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Oncogenomics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Oncogenomics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Oncogenomics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Emma Kinderziekenhuis, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Oncogenomics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Oncogenomics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/metabolism', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Neuroblastoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2016/04/09 06:00,2017/12/12 06:00,['2016/04/09 06:00'],"['2015/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['8547 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.8547 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 May 10;7(19):27946-58. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.8547.,10.18632/oncotarget.8547 [doi],,,PMC5053701,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['ABT199', 'BCL-2', 'MCL-1', 'neuroblastoma', 'resistance']",,,,,,,,,,,,

While it is established that all proapoptotic Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-only proteins bind and neutralize the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, how this neutralization leads to Bax/Bak activation has been actively debated. Here, genome editing was used to generate cells deficient for all eight proapoptotic BH3-only proteins (OctaKO) and those that lack the entire Bcl-2 family (Bcl-2 allKO). Although the OctaKO cells were resistant to most apoptotic stimuli tested, they underwent Bax/Bak-dependent and p53/Rb-independent apoptosis efficiently when both Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, two anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, were inactivated or eliminated. Strikingly, when expressed in the Bcl-2 allKO cells, both Bax and Bak spontaneously associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) through their respective helix 9, and this association triggered their homo-oligomerization/activation. Together, these results strongly suggest that the OMM, not BH3-only proteins or p53/Rb, is the long-sought-after direct activator of Bax/Bak following BH3-only-mediated neutralization of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins.","[""(c) 2016 O'Neill et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.""]","[""O'Neill, Katelyn L"", 'Huang, Kai', 'Zhang, Jingjing', 'Chen, Yi', 'Luo, Xu']","[""O'Neill KL"", 'Huang K', 'Zhang J', 'Chen Y', 'Luo X']","['Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska 68198, USA;', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska 68198, USA;', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska 68198, USA; Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska 68198, USA;', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska 68198, USA;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160407,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Silencing', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*genetics/*metabolism']",2016/04/09 06:00,2016/08/27 06:00,['2016/04/09 06:00'],"['2015/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['gad.276725.115 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.276725.115 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2016 Apr 15;30(8):973-88. doi: 10.1101/gad.276725.115.

While rehabilitation clinics support patients in coping with the disease, studies evaluating an inpatient rehabilitation program on promoting physical activity (PA) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are missing. METHODS: A 4-week inpatient rehabilitation program was prospectively evaluated. One hundred fifty patients with leukemia or lymphoma (N = 86), brain tumors (N = 38), and sarcomas (N = 26) were enrolled on average 17 months after cessation of acute medical treatment. PA amount and cadence (indicating the intensity of walking activity) using the StepWatch 3 Activity Monitor and HRQoL global and physical well-being scores using the KINDL((R)) questionnaire were assessed before, immediately after, and 6 and 12 months following the program and analyzed using multiple linear mixed models. RESULTS: Significant effects on PA were only found at 12-month follow-up for amount and cadence variables (all p < 0.05). While leukemia and lymphoma patients revealed the highest PA level throughout the study, rehabilitation effects were more pronounced for cadence variables in brain tumor and sarcoma patients. The rehabilitation program had immediate (t = 4.56, p < 0.001) and sustainable effects on HRQoL global scores (6-month follow-up, t = 4.08, p < 0.001; 12-month follow-up, t = 3.13, p < 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Immediate and sustainable increases in HRQoL indicate that a 4-week rehabilitation program is beneficial for improving psychosocial well-being, while the significant increase in PA levels could be related to general recovery as well. The lack of a control group hampers the evaluation of the rehabilitation program on promoting PA levels in pediatric cancer patients.",,"['Muller, Carsten', 'Krauth, Konstantin A', 'Gerss, Joachim', 'Rosenbaum, Dieter']","['Muller C', 'Krauth KA', 'Gerss J', 'Rosenbaum D']","['Institute of Sports Science, Work Unit Human Performance and Training in Sports, University of Munster, Horstmarer Landweg 62b, 48149, Munster, Germany. c.mueller@uni-muenster.de.', 'Institute of Experimental Musculoskeletal Medicine, Movement Analysis Laboratory, University Hospital Munster, Domagkstr. 3, 48149, Munster, Germany. c.mueller@uni-muenster.de.', 'Klinik Bad Oexen, Kinderhaus, Oexen 27, 32549, Bad Oeynhausen, Germany.', 'Institute of Biostatistics and Clinical Research, University of Munster, Schmeddingstr. 56, 48149, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Musculoskeletal Medicine, Movement Analysis Laboratory, University Hospital Munster, Domagkstr. 3, 48149, Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160407,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Child', 'Exercise/*psychology', 'Exercise Therapy/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inpatients', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/psychology/*rehabilitation', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Survivors/psychology', 'Time Factors']",2016/04/09 06:00,2017/10/07 06:00,['2016/04/09 06:00'],"['2015/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00520-016-3198-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-016-3198-y [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2016 Sep;24(9):3793-802. doi: 10.1007/s00520-016-3198-y.

Detection of del(7q) in patients following cytotoxic therapies is highly suggestive of an emerging therapy-related myeloid neoplasm. In this study, we describe 39 patients who acquired del(7q) as a sole abnormality in their bone marrow following cytotoxic therapies for malignant neoplasms. The median interval from cytotoxic therapies to detection of del(7q) was 40 months (range, 4-190 months). Twenty-eight patients showed an interstitial and 11 showed a terminal 7q deletion. Fifteen patients (38%) had del(7q) as a large clone and 24 (62%) as a small clone. With a median follow-up of 21 months (range, 1-135 months), 18 (46%) patients developed therapy-related myeloid neoplasms, including all 15 patients with a large del(7q) clone and 3/24 (12.5%) with a small clone. Of the remaining 21 patients with a small del(7q) clone, 16 showed no evidence of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms and 5 had an inconclusive pathological diagnosis. We conclude that isolated del(7q) emerging in patients after cytotoxic therapy may not always be associated with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms in about half of patients.

The older patients more frequently harbored one or more adverse genetic alterations. Multivariate analysis showed that DNMT3A and TP53 mutations were independent poor prognostic factors among the elderly, while NPM1 mutation in the absence of FLT3/ITD was an independent favorable prognostic factor. Furthermore, the status of mutations could well stratify older patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics into three risk groups.

As deregulated apoptosis is a frequent hallmark of lymphomagenesis, we analyzed gene expression profiles and protein levels of primary human T-NHL samples for various apoptotic regulators. We identified the apoptotic regulator MCL-1 as the only pro-survival BCL-2 family member to be highly expressed throughout all human T-NHL subtypes. Functional validation of pro-survival protein members of the BCL-2 family in two independent T-NHL mouse models identified that the partial loss of Mcl-1 significantly delayed T-NHL development in vivo. Moreover, the inducible reduction of MCL-1 protein levels in lymphoma-burdened mice severely impaired the continued survival of T-NHL cells, increased their susceptibility to chemotherapeutics and delayed lymphoma progression. Lymphoma viability remained unaffected by the genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of all alternative BCL-2 family members. Consistent with a therapeutic window for MCL-1 treatment within the context of the whole organism, we observed an only minimal toxicity after systemic heterozygous loss of Mcl-1 in vivo. We conclude that re-activation of mitochondrial apoptosis by blockade of MCL-1 represents a promising therapeutic strategy to treat T-cell lymphoma.",,"['Spinner, S', 'Crispatzu, G', 'Yi, J-H', 'Munkhbaatar, E', 'Mayer, P', 'Hockendorf, U', 'Muller, N', 'Li, Z', 'Schader, T', 'Bendz, H', 'Hartmann, S', 'Yabal, M', 'Pechloff, K', 'Heikenwalder, M', 'Kelly, G L', 'Strasser, A', 'Peschel, C', 'Hansmann, M-L', 'Ruland, J', 'Keller, U', 'Newrzela, S', 'Herling, M', 'Jost, P J']","['Spinner S', 'Crispatzu G', 'Yi JH', 'Munkhbaatar E', 'Mayer P', 'Hockendorf U', 'Muller N', 'Li Z', 'Schader T', 'Bendz H', 'Hartmann S', 'Yabal M', 'Pechloff K', 'Heikenwalder M', 'Kelly GL', 'Strasser A', 'Peschel C', 'Hansmann ML', 'Ruland J', 'Keller U', 'Newrzela S', 'Herling M', 'Jost PJ']","['III.

However, CLL etiology remains unclear. CLL is an adult leukemia with an incidence that increases with advancing age. A unique feature of CLL is biased B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) usage, autoreactivity with polyreactivity and CD5 expression, all suggest a role for the BCR in driving CLL pathogenesis. Among human CLLs, BCRs autoreactive with non-muscle myosin IIA (AMyIIA) are recurrent. Here we identify an unmutated AMyIIA BCR in mouse, with distinctive CDR3 segments capable of promoting leukemogenesis. B cells with this AMyIIA BCR are generated by BCR-dependent signaling during B-1 fetal/neonatal development with CD5 induction, but not in adults. These early-generated AMyIIA B-1 B cells self-renew, increase during aging and can progress to become monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, followed by aggressive CLL in aged mice, often with the loss of a chromosomal region containing the miR15a/16-1 locus of varying length, as in human CLL.

Protein phosphorylation regulates the activity of many ETS factors but little is known about ERG in leukemic cells. To characterize ERG phosphorylation in leukemic cells, we applied liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry and identified five phosphorylated serines on endogenous ERG in T-ALL and AML cells. S283 was distinct as it was abundantly phosphorylated in leukemic cells but not in healthy hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Overexpression of a phosphoactive mutant (S283D) increased expansion and clonogenicity of primary HSPCs over and above wild-type ERG. Using a custom antibody, we screened a panel of primary leukemic xenografts and showed that ERG S283 phosphorylation was mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) signaling and in turn regulated expression of components of this pathway. S283 phosphorylation facilitates ERG enrichment and transactivation at the ERG +85 HSPC enhancer that is active in AML and T-ALL with poor prognosis.

They act to modulate the expression of multiple genes that control diverse cellular processes including proliferation, survival and differentiation that are consequentially disrupted by small-molecule BET bromodomain inhibitors such as JQ1. By assessing the impact of these inhibitors on normal mouse hematopoietic cells or their transformed counterparts, we establish definitively that their cytotoxic action in vitro and in vivo relies predominantly on the activation of BAX/BAK-dependent mitochondrial (intrinsic) apoptosis. In large part, this is triggered by marked upregulation of the BH3-only protein BIM when the BET inhibitors suppress miR-17-92, a key post-transcriptional repressor of BIM expression. Thus, our study strongly suggests that mutations that permit the evasion of apoptosis (for example, BCL2 overexpression, BIM inactivation) are likely to blunt the activity of the BET bromodomain inhibitors and should be anticipated when therapy resistance develops. Strikingly, we also found that certain normal hematopoietic cells, especially those of lymphoid origin, are as prone to apoptosis induced by the BET inhibitors as their transformed counterparts,

Here, we show that in a fraction of endogenous oncogenic Kras-induced hematopoietic malignancies, including acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) and myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), WT Kras expression is lost through epigenetic or genetic mechanisms. Using conditional Kras(G12D/-) mice, we find that WT Kras deficiency promotes oncogenic Kras-induced MPN, but not T-ALL, in a cell-autonomous manner. Loss of WT Kras rescues oncogenic Kras-mediated hematopoietic stem cell depletion and further enhances granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor signaling in myeloid cells expressing oncogenic Kras. Quantitative signaling studies reveal that oncogenic Kras but not oncogenic Nras leads to cross-activation of WT Ras, whereas loss of WT Kras further promotes the activation of all Ras isoforms.

B cell receptor (BCR) signaling appears to have a crucial role in disease onset and is thought to be induced by self or non-self-antigen recognition leading to chronic stimulation. Several of the kinases functioning downstream of the BCR are aberrantly expressed or constitutively activated in CLL. Yet, these kinases have additional roles, particularly in chemokine receptor signaling, which is essential for homing and survival of CLL cells in lymphoid organs, or in toll-like receptor signaling. Recently, small molecule inhibitors of kinases in the BCR signaling pathway have shown impressive anti-tumor activity in clinical trials. Remarkably, the observed durable responses in CLL patients were accompanied by transient increases in blood lymphocyte numbers, indicating the importance of these kinases in chemokine receptor signaling.

In light of these considerations there remains a need for alternative treatment strategies. Lenalidomide, a second-generation derivative of thalidomide, has been demonstrated to have significant clinical activity in CLL. Its effect appears to be mediated by reduction of CLL-cell proliferation, improvement of anti-tumor immune responses and reduction of pro-tumoral factors in the CLL microenvironment.

Two large randomized trials recently demonstrated that addition of monoclonal anti-CD20 antibodies (obinutuzumab, rituximab, and ofatumumab) to chlorambucil in untreated comorbid patients lead to improvement in complete remission rate, progression-free survival and even overall survival (obinutuzumab-chlorambucil and rituximab-chlorambucil), with acceptable toxicity profile. Thus, chemoimmunotherapy combining chlorambucil with an anti-CD20 antibody is the new standard approach for elderly/comorbid CLL patients in the first line. Treatment of relapsed/refractory disease in this patient population is very challenging and data regarding this subpopulation are rather limited. Impressive efficacy of novel targeted small molecules interfering with B-cell receptor signaling, namely Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase delta inhibitor idelalisib, radically changed the treatment paradigms for relapsed/refractory CLL; relatively mild toxicity of these agents make them very good candidates for elderly/comorbid patients. Other options for relapsed/refractory disease include alemtuzumab, ofatumumab, high-dose glucocorticoids+rituximab and bendamustine+rituximab.

Refractory CLL defined by non-response to treatment or relapse/progression within 6 months is associated with multiple unfavourable prognostic factors such as p53 pathway disruption, deteriorating patient condition, increased risk of severe infections, and poor response to treatment, resulting in a very short overall survival. Therefore, refractory CLL represents a highly challenging situation for the hematologist as well as the patient. The amount and quality of data on refractory CLL are rather limited as clinical trials usually combine patients with relapsed and refractory disease. Therapeutic options for refractory CLL include alemtuzumab, ofatumumab, fludarabine- and bendamustine-based regimens, platinum-based aggressive protocols and high-dose corticosteroids combined with monoclonal antibodies. The recent introduction of ibrutinib and idelalisib, small molecules interfering with B-cell receptor pathways, revolutionized the treatment of refractory CLL by the novel concept of long-term, oral treatment leading to impressive progression-free and overall survival improvement.

Our data indicate that in particular BCR-ABL, KRASG12V and STAT5 could impose hypoxic signaling under normoxic conditions. This coincided with an upregulation of glucose importers SLC2A1/3, hexokinases and HIF1 and 2. NMR-based metabolic profiling was performed in CB CD34+ cells transduced with BCR-ABL versus controls, both cultured under normoxia and hypoxia. Lactate and pyruvate levels were increased in BCR-ABL-expressing cells even under normoxia, coinciding with enhanced glutaminolysis which occurred in an HIF1/2-dependent manner. Expression of the glutamine importer SLC1A5 was increased in BCR-ABL+ cells, coinciding with an increased susceptibility to the glutaminase inhibitor BPTES. Oxygen consumption rates also decreased upon BPTES treatment, indicating a glutamine dependency for oxidative phosphorylation.

The aim was to assess to what extent progress against childhood and adolescent cancer has been made in Austria since the 1990s and to complement the childhood and adolescent cancer trends for Central Europe. METHODS: All malignant neoplasms and non-malignant tumours of the Central Nervous System (CNS) in patients aged less than 20 years and diagnosed between 1994 and 2011 (N=5425) were derived from the Austrian National Cancer Registry (ANCR). Incidence and mortality trends were evaluated by the average annual percentage change (AAPC). Observed survival rates were calculated based on follow-up until December 31st 2013. RESULTS: Childhood cancer remained stable with 182 cases per million in 2011, but rose among girls by 1.4% (95% CI: .1, 3.6) annually due to an increase of non-malignant CNS tumours and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Adolescent cancer rose by 1.5% (95% CI: .4, 2.6) annually, from 182 cases per million in 1994-269 in 2011, especially leukaemia, CNS tumours (including non-malignant types) and epithelial tumours. Five-year survival improved by 5-7% reaching 86% for both groups (p<.05). Mortality declined by -2.4% (95% CI: -3.7, -1.2) and -2.0% (95% CI: -4.6, .5), respectively, especially for childhood leukaemia. CONCLUSION: Progress is demonstrated by improved survival and declined mortality most likely related to improved diagnostic techniques, more effective therapeutic regimes, supportive care and a central advisory function of experts in the Austrian paediatric oncology.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

With the exception of some BCR-ABL1(+) patients who benefit from tyrosine kinase inhibitors, there are no effective targeted therapies for adult B-ALL patients and chemotherapy remains first-line therapy despite adverse side effects and poor efficacy. We show that, although the MEK/ERK pathway is activated in B-ALL cells driven by different oncogenes, MEK inhibition does not suppress B-ALL cell growth. However, MEK inhibition synergized with BCL-2/BCL-XL family inhibitors to suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis in B-ALL cells. We show that this synergism is mediated by the pro-apoptotic factor BIM, which is dephosphorylated as a result of MEK inhibition, allowing it to bind to and neutralize MCL-1, thereby enhancing BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitor-induced cell death. This cooperative effect is observed in B-ALL cells driven by a range of genetic abnormalities and therefore has significant therapeutic potential.",,"['Korfi, K', 'Smith, M', 'Swan, J', 'Somervaille, T C P', 'Dhomen, N', 'Marais, R']","['Korfi K', 'Smith M', 'Swan J', 'Somervaille TC', 'Dhomen N', 'Marais R']","['Molecular Oncology Group, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Molecular Oncology Group, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Core Research Facilities, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Leukemia Biology Group, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Molecular Oncology Group, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Molecular Oncology Group, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160407,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Thioglycolates)', '0 (UMI-77)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '33E86K87QN (trametinib)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyridones/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidinones/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA Interference', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Thioglycolates/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2016/04/08 06:00,2016/12/22 06:00,['2016/04/08 06:00'],"['2016/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis201670 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2016.70 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2016 Apr 7;7:e2177. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2016.70.,10.1038/cddis.2016.70 [doi],,,PMC4855656,,,,,,['C15759/A12328/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5009-4509', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7484-4183']",,,,,,

We aimed to evaluate the 46 new cases of de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients for common translocations and to assess the effect of geographic and ethnic differences on their frequencies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this descriptive study, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used on 46 fresh bone marrow or peripheral blood samples to detect translocations t (8; 21), t (15; 17), t (9; 11) and inv (16). Patients were classified using the French-American-British (FAB) criteria in to eight sub-groups (M0-M7). Immunophenotyping and biochemical test results of patients were compared with RT-PCR results. RESULTS: Our patients were relatively young with a mean age of 44 years. AML was relatively predominant in female patients (54.3%) and most of patients belonged to AML-M2. Translocation t (8; 21) had the highest frequency (13%) and t (15; 17) with 2.7% incidence was the second most frequent. CD19 as an immunophenotypic marker was at a relatively high frequency (50%) in cases with t (8; 21), and patients with this translocation had a specific immunophenotypic pattern of complete expression of CD45, CD38, CD34, CD33 and HLA-DR. CONCLUSION: Similarities and differences of results in Iran with different parts of the world can be explained with ethnic and geographic factors in characterizations of AML. Recognition of these factors especially in other comprehensive studies may aid better diagnosis and management of this disease.",,"['Amanollahi Kamaneh, Elnaz', 'Shams Asenjan, Karim', 'Movassaghpour Akbari, Aliakbar', 'Akbarzadeh Laleh, Parvin', 'Chavoshi, Hadi', 'Eivazi Ziaei, Jamal', 'Nikanfar, Alireza', 'Asvadi Kermani, Iraj', 'Esfahani, Ali']","['Amanollahi Kamaneh E', 'Shams Asenjan K', 'Movassaghpour Akbari A', 'Akbarzadeh Laleh P', 'Chavoshi H', 'Eivazi Ziaei J', 'Nikanfar A', 'Asvadi Kermani I', 'Esfahani A']","['Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160404,Iran,Cell J,Cell journal,101566618,,,,2016/04/08 06:00,2016/04/08 06:01,['2016/04/08 06:00'],"['2015/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.22074/cellj.2016.3985 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell J. 2016 Spring;18(1):37-45. doi: 10.22074/cellj.2016.3985.

Medication-based and therapist-delivered interventions are promising but have limitations. Computerized interventions completed at home may be more appealing for survivors. We evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a remotely administered, computerized WM intervention (Cogmed) for pediatric cancer survivors using a single-blind, randomized, wait-list control design. METHODS: Of 80 qualifying patients, 12 were excluded or declined to participate. Participants randomized to intervention (n = 34/68) included survivors of childhood brain tumors (32%) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; 68%) between the ages of 8 and 16 years ([Formula: see text] = 12.2) who were at least 1 year post therapy ([Formula: see text] = 5.0). The majority of brain tumor participants were treated with cranial radiation therapy (72.7%), whereas most of the ALL participants were treated with chemotherapy only (87%). Participants completed 25 WM training sessions over 5-9 weeks at home with weekly phone-based coaching. RESULTS: Participants lived in 16 states. Compliance was strong, with 30 of the 34 participants (88%) completing intervention. Almost all participants completed pre- and postintervention neuroimaging exams (91% and 93%, respectively). Families had the necessary skills to utilize the computer program successfully. Caregivers reported they were generally able to find time to complete training (63%), viewed training as beneficial (70%), and would recommend this intervention to others (93%). CONCLUSIONS: Cogmed is a feasible and acceptable intervention for childhood cancer survivors. It is a viable option for survivors who do not live in close proximity to cancer care centers.

However, the occurrence of relapse and development of rituximab-refractory disease highlight the need to develop novel anti-CD20 mAbs, with improved mechanisms of action. Obinutuzumab is the first humanized type II glycoengineered anti-CD20 mAb. In vitro and in vivo data suggested several differences compared with rituximab, including a low level of complement-dependent cytotoxicity and an increased direct nonapoptotic cell death. Moreover, the glycoengineered Fc-linked nonfucosylated oligosaccharide enhanced the Fc-Fcgamma receptor (FcgammaR) IIIa interaction, resulting in improved antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis. Preclinical models suggested that these differences translate into superior survival in murine lymphoma models. Phase I/II trials in monotherapy in relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL demonstrated that obinutuzumab has an acceptable safety profile, infusion-related reactions being the most common adverse event. In rituximab-refractory indolent NHL, the recent randomized phase III GADOLIN study demonstrated an improved median progression-free survival for patients treated with obinutuzumab plus bendamustine rather than bendamustine alone.

Consequently, we performed a meta-analysis to accurately evaluate the association between TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and leukemia risk. A comprehensive search was conducted to find all eligible studies of TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and leukemia risk. Fourteen case-control studies, with 2,506 cases and 4,386 controls, were selected for analysis. The overall data failed to indicate a significant association between TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and the risk of leukemia (C vs. G: OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.93-1.26; CC vs. GC + GG: OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.96-1.57). In a subgroup analysis of clinical types, an increased risk was observed in the acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) subgroup (CC vs. GC + GG: OR = 1.73; 95% CI = 1.07-2.81) but not in the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subgroup. In the subgroup analysis, no significant associations with ethnicity and the source of the controls were observed. In conclusion, the results suggest that there is no association between TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and the risk of leukemia, but the CC genotype may increase the risk of ALL TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism CC genotype may increase the risk of ALL but is not associated with AML.

In this study, we expressed the wild-type MMLV RT (WT) and MM4 using a cell-free protein expression system from insect cells. WT exhibited DNA polymerase and RNase H activities, while MM4, in which the catalytic residue for RNase H activity, Asp524 is changed into Ala, exhibited only DNA polymerase activity. MM4, when held at 60 degrees C for 10 min, retained DNA polymerase activity, while WT, held at 54 degrees C for 10 min, lost this activity. In the cDNA synthesis reaction (0.5 mul) in which WT or MM4 were exposed to various temperatures and amounts of target RNA in a microarray chip, MM4 exhibited higher thermostability than WT.

RESULTS: Among 221 patients (male to female ratio = 133:88; median age, 39 (18-65) years; median duration of imatinib, 4 years), the nonadherence rate was 55% (N = 122/221). None of the demographic parameters, including occupation, education status, income, and availability of caregiver, were associated with nonadherence. QoL scores, especially the symptom scores associated with side effects of imatinib, significantly differed between adherent and nonadherent patients. Multivariate analysis revealed global health status as the sole predictor of adherent behavior (odds ratio, 0.978; 95% confidence interval, 0.963-0.994; P = .007). A higher proportion of adherent patients achieved deeper molecular responses. Low QoL was associated with nonadherence to imatinib in patients with CML. CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that increased long-term symptom burden due to side effects of imatinib could contribute to nonadherence. Interventions targeting individual components of QoL may improve adherence and outcomes in CML.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated miR26A1 methylation and expression levels in a well-characterized series of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). From 450K methylation arrays, we first observed miR26A1 (cg26054057) as uniformly hypermethylated in MCL (n = 24) (all >75%), while CLL (n = 18) showed differential methylation between prognostic subgroups. Extended analysis using pyrosequencing confirmed our findings and real-time quantitative PCR verified low miR26A1 expression in both CLL (n = 70) and MCL (n = 38) compared to normal B-cells. Notably, the level of miR26A1 methylation predicted outcome in CLL, with higher levels seen in poor-prognostic, IGHV-unmutated CLL. Since EZH2 was recently reported as a target for miR26A1, we analyzed the expression levels of both miR26A1 and EZH2 in primary CLL samples and observed an inverse correlation. By overexpression of miR26A1 in CLL and MCL cell lines, reduced EZH2 protein levels were observed using both Western blot and flow cytometry. In contrast, methyl-inhibitor treatment led to upregulated miR26A1 expression with a parallel decrease of EZH2 expression. Finally, increased levels of apoptosis were observed in miR26A1-overexpressing cell lines, further underscoring the functional relevance of miR26A1. In summary, we propose that epigenetic silencing of miR26A1 is required for the maintenance of increased levels of EZH2, which in turn translate into a worse outcome, as shown in CLL, highlighting miR26A1 as a tumor suppressor miRNA.",,"['Kopparapu, Pradeep Kumar', 'Bhoi, Sujata', 'Mansouri, Larry', 'Arabanian, Laleh S', 'Plevova, Karla', 'Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Wasik, Agata M', 'Croci, Giorgio Alberto', 'Sander, Birgitta', 'Paulli, Marco', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Kanduri, Meena']","['Kopparapu PK', 'Bhoi S', 'Mansouri L', 'Arabanian LS', 'Plevova K', 'Pospisilova S', 'Wasik AM', 'Croci GA', 'Sander B', 'Paulli M', 'Rosenquist R', 'Kanduri M']","['a Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine , Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University , Sweden.', 'b Department of Immunology , Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University , Uppsala , Sweden.', 'b Department of Immunology , Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University , Uppsala , Sweden.', 'a Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine , Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University , Sweden.', 'c Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University and University Hospital Brno , Czech Republic.', 'c Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University and University Hospital Brno , Czech Republic.', 'd Department of Laboratory Medicine , Division of Pathology, Karolinska University Hospital , Sweden.', 'e Department of Molecular Medicine , University of Pavia , Italy.', 'd Department of Laboratory Medicine , Division of Pathology, Karolinska University Hospital , Sweden.', 'e Department of Molecular Medicine , University of Pavia , Italy.', 'b Department of Immunology , Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University , Uppsala , Sweden.', 'a Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine , Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University , Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160406,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,"['0 (MIRN26A microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",2016/04/08 06:00,2017/05/24 06:00,['2016/04/08 06:00'],"['2016/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15592294.2016.1164375 [doi]'],ppublish,Epigenetics. 2016 May 3;11(5):335-43. doi: 10.1080/15592294.2016.1164375.

The aim of the present study was to examine the changes in the expression of homeobox (Hox) A5 gene and its relationship with cell cycle and apoptosis through the intervention of human K562 myeloid leukemia cell line by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), to analyze the role of HOXA5 in the pathogenesis and development process of myeloid leukemia. The optimal concentration of ATRA to be used with K562 cells was determined using a cell counting kit8 (CCK8). After 24, 72 and 48 h following treatment of K562 cells with 10 micromol/l ATRA, cell cycle events and apoptosis were measured using flow cytometry. HOXA5 mRNA and protein expression in K562 cells was assessed by RTPCR and western blot analysis, and the relationship between HOXA5 expression and cell cycle and apoptosis was analyzed. The HOXA5 mRNA and protein expression levels were increased following treatment with ATRA in K562 cells. Apoptosis was increased significantly. The cell cycle was inhibited in G0/G1 phase. Cell proliferation was also inhibited. HOXA5 mRNA and protein expression rates positively correlated with cell apoptosis and the increased percentage and cell cycle of the G0/G1 phase. However, HOXA5 negatively correlated with the reduced percentage of S stage. In conclusion, the expression of HOXA5 in cells was increased following treatment with ATRA in K562 cells, in a time-dependent manner. Additionally, ATRA may inhibit the proliferation of K562 cells and promote apoptosis by upregulating the HOXA5 mRNA and protein expression.",,"['Liu, Wen-Jun', 'Zhang, Teng', 'Guo, Qu-Lian', 'Liu, Chun-Yan', 'Bai, Yong-Qi']","['Liu WJ', 'Zhang T', 'Guo QL', 'Liu CY', 'Bai YQ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Affiliated Hospital of Sichuan Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan 64600, P.R.

Lenalidomide has a manageable safety profile whether administered as a single agent or in combination with rituximab. The combination of lenalidomide with rituximab, known as the 'R(2)' regimen, enhances efficacy over what has been shown with monotherapy and has demonstrated activity in patients considered resistant to rituximab. Tolerability of these regimens has been consistent among studies. Asymptomatic neutropenia is the most common grade 3/4 adverse event, typically managed by dose interruption, followed by dose reduction once neutrophils have recovered. Nonhematologic toxicities (e.g. fatigue) are generally low-grade, manageable with concomitant treatment, and/or lenalidomide dose modification. More frequent with R(2), immune-related symptoms such as rash and tumor flare are important to recognize as lenalidomide-associated treatment effects in patients with lymphoma who require supportive care and potential dose modifications. Severe tumor flare reactions with painful lymphadenopathy are not typically observed outside of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. Venous thromboembolism is uncommon in lymphomas, though prophylaxis is recommended. The general safety profile, differences between lenalidomide monotherapy and R(2) treatment, and optimal strategies for managing adverse events are discussed here.","['(c) The Author 2016.

Among the various AMLs, the bone marrow angiogenetic response is particularly pronounced in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this angiogenetic response are largely unknown. In the present study, we have explored the role of HHEX, a homeodomain transcription factor, as a possible mediator of the pro-angiogenetic response observed in APL. This transcription factor seems to represent an ideal candidate for this biologic function because it is targeted by PML-RARalpha, is capable of interaction with PML and PML-RARalpha, and acts as a regulator of the angiogenetic response. METHODS: We used various cellular systems of APL, including primary APL cells and leukemic cells engineered to express PML-RARalpha, to explore the role of the PML-RARalpha fusion protein on HHEX expression. Molecular and biochemical techniques have been used to investigate the mechanisms through which PML-RARalpha downmodulates HHEX and the functional consequences of this downmodulation at the level of the expression of various angiogenetic genes, cell proliferation and differentiation. RESULTS: Our results show that HHEX expression is clearly downmodulated in APL and that this effect is directly mediated by a repressive targeting of the HHEX gene promoter by PML-RARalpha. Studies carried out in primary APL cells and in a cell line model of APL with inducible PML-RARalpha expression directly support the view that this fusion protein through HHEX downmodulation stimulates the expression of various genes involved in angiogenesis and inhibits cell differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that HHEX downmodulation by PML-RARalpha is a key event during APL pathogenesis.",,"['Saulle, Ernestina', 'Petronelli, Alessia', 'Pelosi, Elvira', 'Coppotelli, Elena', 'Pasquini, Luca', 'Ilari, Ramona', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Testa, Ugo']","['Saulle E', 'Petronelli A', 'Pelosi E', 'Coppotelli E', 'Pasquini L', 'Ilari R', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Testa U']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"" and Fondazione Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy. ugo.testa@iss.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160407,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (HHEX protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/genetics/metabolism']",2016/04/08 06:00,2016/10/19 06:00,['2016/04/08 06:00'],"['2015/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-016-0262-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-016-0262-5 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2016 Apr 7;9:33. doi: 10.1186/s13045-016-0262-5.,10.1186/s13045-016-0262-5 [doi],,,PMC4823896,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The data of 243 donors for alloHSCT recipients diagnosed with mostly acute leukemia and myelodsyplastic syndromes (MDS) were analyzed, retrospectively. Data for stem cell mobilization have been recorded from patients' files. Donors who received Filgrastim (Neupogen(R), Group I), biosimilar Filgrastim (Leucostim(R), Group II) and Lenograstim (Granocyte(R), Group III) were analyzed for total CD34(+) cell count at the end of mobilization procedures. RESULTS: A total of 243 donors and patients for alloHSCT were analyzed retrospectively. The diagnosis of the patients were; acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (110 patients, 45.2%), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) (61 patients, 25.1%), aplastic anemia (AA) (38 patients, 15.6%), lymphomas (14 patients, 5.7%) and others (20 patients, 8.4%). The median number of total collected PB CD34(+) cells (x10(6)/kg) was 7.12 (min-max: 5.38-7.90) in the Neupogen(R) group, 7.27 (min-max: 6.79-7.55) in the Leucostim(R) group and 7.15 (min-max: 5.34-7.58) in the Granocyte(R) group. There was no statistically significant difference among groups in terms of total collected PB CD34(+) cells (p = 0.919). The median doses of G-CSF agents (microg/kg/day) in PBSC collection in Neupogen(R) group was; 11.00 (10.00-12.00) in Leucostim(R) group10.35 (min-max: 10.00-11.10) and in Granocyte(R) group11.00 (min-max: 10.00-11.00). There was no statistical significance among groups (p = 0.215). CONCLUSION: Biosimilar filgrastim (Leucostim(R)) was found comparable to original Filgrastim (Neupogen(R)) and Lenograstim (Granocyte(R)) for PBSC mobilization in donors of the patients that underwent alloHSCT.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we have explored the underlying basis for CTL suppression in the context of B cell malignancies. We document that human B cells have an intrinsic ability to resist killing by freshly isolated cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), but are susceptible to lysis by IL-2 activated CTL blasts and CTLs isolated from immunotherapy-treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Impaired killing was associated with the formation of dysfunctional non-lytic immune synapses characterized by the presence of defective linker for activation of T cells (LAT) signaling and non-polarized release of the lytic granules transported by ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 8 (Arl8). We propose that non-lytic degranulation of CTLs are a key regulatory mechanism of evasion through which B cells may interfere with the formation of functional immune synapses by CTLs.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

Posaconazole is considered the standard of care. Voriconazole, a generic cheaper alternative is a newer generation azole with broad anti-fungal activity. There is limited data on the use of voriconazole as a prophylactic drug. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center, prospective study was performed during which patients with AML undergoing induction chemotherapy received voriconazole as AFP (April 2012 to February 2014). Outcomes were compared with historical patients who received fluconazole as AFP (January 2011-March 2012, n = 66). RESULTS: Seventy-five patients with AML (median age: 17 years [range: 1-75]; male:female 1.6:1) received voriconazole as AFP. The incidence of proven/probable/possible (ppp) IFI was 6.6% (5/75). Voriconazole and fluconazole cohorts were well-matched with respect to baseline characteristics. Voriconazole (when compared to fluconazole) reduced the incidence of pppIFI (5/75, 6.6% vs. 19/66, 29%; P < 0.001), need to start therapeutic (empiric + pppIFI) antifungals (26/75, 34% vs. 51/66, 48%; P < 0.001) and delayed the start of therapeutic antifungals in those who needed it (day 16 vs. day 10; P < 0.001). Mortality due to IFI was also reduced with the use of voriconazole (1/75, 1.3% vs. 6/66, 9%; P = 0.0507), but this was not significant. Three patients discontinued voriconazole due to side-effects.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent treatment for ALL during the period 2003-2011 were enrolled into this retrospective study. Patients on supportive or palliative care only and patients with age <10 years were excluded. The hospital records and tumor registry records were studied. Patients were stratified into two groups, Group A (prior to the introduction of state health insurance [SHI], 2003-2007) and Group B (after the introduction of SHI, 2008-2011). Overall survival (OS) was calculated using Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: A total of 420 patients with suspected or confirmed ALL visited our center during the study period and 179 patients (87 in Group A and 92 in Group B) were considered for inclusion. The median age in years (range) was 18 (10-57) and 18 (10-58) respectively in Groups A and B with males more than females. Median OS (95% CI) was 9 (6.7-11.2) and 12 (7.3-16.7) months in the Groups A and B respectively (P = 0.265). Poor treatment compliance in both groups was high (36% in Group A and 41% in Group B, [P = 0.107]) with lower default rates in Group B (P = 0.019). Patients with good compliance in the total study population and the individual study groups had significantly better OS. CONCLUSIONS: Insurance based health care has improved outcomes in the present study but not compliance to treatment.

However, the role of NLRC5, which is a member of the NLR family, in NF-kappaB activation and MHC-I expression remains debatable. Infection with the J group avian leukosis virus (ALV-J) can result in immunosuppression and a subsequent increase in susceptibility to secondary infection. This results in huge economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), we investigated the mRNA expression levels of NLRC5 signal pathway-related genes in secondary chicken embryo fibroblasts 7 days after infection with ALV-J. The results indicated that, compared with the control groups, the expression levels of TLR7, MHC-I, and IL-18 increased significantly in the infected groups at 7 days post-infection (d.p.i.). The expression levels of NLRC5 and IL-6 were conspicuously downregulated at 7 d.p.i., but the expression levels of NF-kappaB, STAT1, and STAT3 were not significantly altered. These results suggest that NLRC5 and some genes involved in the NLRC5 pathway play a key role in antiviral immunity, typically the response to ALV-J infection.

Global transcription rates and chromatin changes accompanying the transformation process induced by MLL-ENL were monitored by nascent RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, revealing 165 direct target genes separated into two distinct clades. ME5 genes bound MLL-ENL at the promoter, relied on DOT1L-mediated histone methylation, and coded preferentially for transcription factors, including many homeobox genes. A distinct ME3 group accumulated MLL-ENL beyond the termination site, was dependent on P-TEFb-mediated phosphorylation of RNA Pol II for transcription, and translated mainly into proteins involved in RNA biology and ribosome assembly. This dichotomy was reflected by a differential sensitivity toward small molecule inhibitors, suggesting the possibility of a combinatorial strategy for treatment of MLL-induced leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

An integrated genetic prognostic (IGP) model using cytogenetics plus mutations in nine genes was recently proposed for patients </=60 years to improve classification. This model has not been validated in clinical practice. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We retrospectively studied 197 patients with newly diagnosed de novo AML. We compared OS curves among the mutational profiles defined by the IGP model. The IGP model assigned patients with intermediate cytogenetics as having favorable, intermediate or unfavorable mutational profiles. The IGP model reassigned 50 of 137 patients with intermediate cytogenetics to favorable or unfavorable mutational profiles. Median OS was 2.8 years among 14 patients with intermediate cytogenetics and favorable mutational profiles (mutant NPM1 and mutant IDH1 or IDH2) and 1.3 years among patients with intermediate mutational profiles. Among patients with intermediate cytogenetics labeled as having unfavorable mutational profiles, median OS was 0.8 years among 24 patients with FLT3-ITD positive AML and high-risk genetic changes (trisomy 8, TET2 and/or DNMT3A) and 1.7 years among 12 patients with FLT3-ITD negative AML and high-risk mutations (TET2, ASXL1 and/or PHF6). OS for patients with intermediate cytogenetics and favorable mutational profiles was similar to OS for patients with favorable cytogenetics (p = 0.697) and different from patients with intermediate cytogenetics and intermediate mutational profiles (p = 0.028). OS among patients with FLT3-ITD positive AML and high-risk genetic changes was similar to patients with unfavorable cytogenetics (p = 0.793) and different from patients with intermediate IGP profile (p = 0.022). Patients with FLT3-ITD negative AML and high-risk mutations, defined as 'unfavorable' in the IGP model, had OS similar to patients with intermediate IGP profile (p = 0.919). CONCLUSIONS: The IGP model was not completely validated in our cohort. However, mutations in six out of the nine genes can be used to characterize survival (NPMI, IDH1, IDH2, FLT3-ITD, TET2, DNMT3A) and allow for more robust prognostication in the patients who are re-categorized by the IGP model. These mutations should be incorporated into clinical testing for younger patients outside of clinical trials, in order to guide therapy.",,"['Sloan, Caroline E', 'Luskin, Marlise R', 'Boccuti, Anne M', 'Sehgal, Alison R', 'Zhao, Jianhua', 'Daber, Robert D', 'Morrissette, Jennifer J D', 'Luger, Selina M', 'Bagg, Adam', 'Gimotty, Phyllis A', 'Carroll, Martin']","['Sloan CE', 'Luskin MR', 'Boccuti AM', 'Sehgal AR', 'Zhao J', 'Daber RD', 'Morrissette JJ', 'Luger SM', 'Bagg A', 'Gimotty PA', 'Carroll M']","['Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Philadelphia Veterans Administration Medical Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160406,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Genetic', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/07 06:00,2016/08/23 06:00,['2016/04/07 06:00'],"['2016/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0153016 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-07856 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Apr 6;11(4):e0153016. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0153016. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0153016 [doi],,,PMC4822876,,,,,,"['P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA185365/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21CA185365/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, galectin-1 was identified as a candidate modulator of MDR1 by proteomic analysis of a model system of leukemia cell lines with a gradual increase of MDR1 expression and drug resistance. Coincidently, alteration of galectin-1 expression triggers the change of MDR1 expression as well as the resistance to the cytotoxic drugs, suggesting that augment of MDR1 expression engages in galectin-1-mediated chemoresistance. Moreover, we provided the first data showing that NF-kappaB translocation induced by P38 MAPK activation was responsible for the modulation effect of galectin-1 on MDR1 in the chronic myelogenous leukemia cells.

Curcumin derived from the plant Curcuma longa, shows anticancer effects. Exosomes released by CML cells treated with Curcumin contain a high amount of miR-21 that is shuttled into the endothelial cells in a biologically active form. The treatment of HUVECs with CML Curcu-exosomes reduced RhoB expression and negatively modulated endothelial cells motility. We showed that the addition of CML control exosomes to HUVECs caused an increase in IL8 and VCAM1 levels, but Curcu-exosomes reversed these effects thus attenuating their angiogenic properties. This antiangiogenic effect was confirmed with in vitro and in vivo vascular network formation assays. SWATH analysis of the proteomic profile of Curcu-exosomes revealed that Curcumin treatment deeply changes their molecular properties, in particular, Curcumin induces a release of exosomes depleted in pro-angiogenic proteins and enriched in proteins endowed with anti-angiogenic activity.

In total, 346 pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were enrolled in our study. Their carrier status was investigated by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis. Clinical and laboratory signs of glucocorticoid-related toxicities, day-8 prednisone response, 5-year event-free survival, and 5-year overall survival rates were analyzed and compared retrospectively. Hepatotoxicity occurred significantly more often in 363S carriers (P=0.004), and glucose metabolism abnormalities were more common in 363S carriers (P=0.001), but did not occur in patients with the ER22/23EK SNP.

In this study, we set out to compare and combine geriatric impairments with clinical judgment in predicting mortality and non-completion of chemotherapy in older patients with a hematological malignancy. Between March 2004 and August 2014, a multi-dimensional geriatric assessment was performed in consecutive patients aged >/=65 years diagnosed with a hematological malignancy at the Innsbruck university hospital. Associations between geriatric assessment, clinical judgment (derived from initial treatment decision) and outcome (mortality, non-completion) were analyzed. Patient sample consisted of 157 patients, of which 37% was 80 + years of age. Aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (29%), acute myeloid leukemia (27%) and myelodysplastic syndromes (20%) were most common diagnoses. Prevalence of an impaired geriatric assessment (i.e. impairments in >/=2 of eight assessed domains) was 71% and similar for patients receiving standard (71%) or attenuated treatment (72%). Clinical judgment was the strongest predictor of mortality (p = 0.003); addition of geriatric assessment allowed for further stratification of patients with a good (>75% one year survival), intermediate (50-60%) and poor prognosis (<30%). Cumulative burden of geriatric impairments further increased risk of mortality. Clinical judgment was greatly superior to geriatric assessment in identifying patients at risk for non-completion.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between TCIs and cancer among patients with atopic and endogenous eczema. METHODS: Incident cancers were identified from the National Cancer Registry. Data were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: 880 unique cases of cancer developed in 66 176 patients from 2004 to 2012. The adjusted HRs for overall malignancy were 0.82 (95%CI 0.44-1.39) for tacrolimus-exposed and 1.30 (95%CI 0.59-2.45) for pimecrolimus-exposed. The only significant cancer association observed was lymphoid leukemia among the tacrolimus-exposed: HR 7.58 (95%CI 1.64-25.8). All affected patients had young-onset B-cell leukemia. Subgroup analysis of pediatric patients (</=16 years) showed significant association between tacrolimus use and B-cell leukemia: HR 26.4 (95%CI 4.77-146). CONCLUSIONS: In this first Asian study on the risk of TCIs and malignancies, we do not find an association between use of tacrolimus and pimecrolimus in atopic and endogenous eczema and the overall development of malignancies.

Treatment is often associated with life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) which can be effectively treated with cytokine blockade using the antibodies, Siltuximab or Tocilizumab respectively targeting IL-6 or the IL-6 receptor. As IL-6 blockade is moving into the clinic for the treatment of CRS as well as IL-6-driven rheumatologic and malignant diseases, clinicians are utilizing serum cytokine panels more frequently to assess the effects of IL-6 inhibitors. It is paramount to ascertain whether levels obtained are accurate, especially as certain drugs may, in theory, affect quantification. We report the comparative quantification of IL-6 and sIL-6R using Luminex-based immunoassay kits from two vendors. Our results indicate good agreement of the commercial immunoassays in measurement of IL-6 but disagreement in quantitation of sIL-6R. We found that both Siltuximab and Tocilizumab can interfere with the measurement of their respective ligands using reagents from one vendor but not the second. This has significant implications for the analysis of IL-6 and sIL-6R pharmacokinetics analysis in Siltuximab or Tocilizumab-treated patients. We found that high levels of IL-6 can falsely reduce the measured levels of sIL-6R and high levels of sIL-6R can reduce levels of IL-6 when measured with some commercial assays.

In contrast, data from other clinical correlation studies suggest that hnRNP K may be more fittingly described as an oncogene, due to its increased levels in a variety of malignancies. hnRNP K is a multifunctional protein that can regulate both oncogenic and tumor suppressive pathways through a bevy of chromatin-, DNA-, RNA-, and protein-mediated activates, suggesting its aberrant expression may have broad-reaching cellular impacts.

CUDC-907 is an oral, first-in-class, small molecule that is designed to inhibit both histone deacetylase (HDAC) and PI3K enzymes, which are members of common oncogenic pathways in haematological malignancies. We aimed to assess overall safety and preliminary activity in this dose-escalation study of CUDC-907 monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma and multiple myeloma. METHODS: This open-label, first-in-man, phase 1 trial recruited adult patients (aged >/=18 years) with lymphoma or multiple myeloma who were refractory to or had relapsed after two or more previous regimens, from four US cancer centres. CUDC-907 was orally administered in a standard 3 + 3 dose-escalation design at four different dosing schedules, to which participants were sequentially assigned as follows: once daily, intermittently (twice or three times weekly; simultaneous enrolment), and daily for 5 days followed by a 2-day break (5/2), in 21-day cycles. Dosing started at 30 mg for the once-daily schedule and 60 mg for other schedules, escalating in 30 mg increments. Patients continued to receive CUDC-907 until disease progression or until other treatment discontinuation criteria were met. The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose, assessed in patients who received at least 66% of cycle 1 doses without modification and those who had a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in cycle 1 irrespective of dose modification. We assessed safety in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This ongoing trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01742988. FINDINGS: Between Jan 23, 2013, and July 27, 2015, we enrolled 44 patients, of whom ten were sequentially assigned to CUDC-907 once-daily (MTD 60 mg), 12 to twice-weekly (MTD 150 mg), 15 to three-times-weekly (MTD 150 mg), and seven to the 5/2 dosing schedule (MTD 60 mg). 37 (84%) patients had discontinued study drug as a result of progressive disease or clinical signs of progressive disease at the data cutoff. Four DLTs occurred in three of 40 DLT-evaluable patients (diarrhoea and hyperglycaemia in one patient on 60 mg once daily, hyperglycaemia in one patient on 150 mg twice weekly, and diarrhoea in one patient on 150 mg three times weekly); no DLTs were reported in patients on the 5/2 schedule. Grade 3 or worse adverse events occurred in 19 (43%) of 44 patients, the most common of which were thrombocytopenia (in nine [20%] of 44 patients), neutropenia (three [7%]), and hyperglycaemia (three [7%]). 11 (25%) of 44 patients had serious adverse events, three of which were regarded as treatment related (epistaxis and the DLTs of diarrhoea and hyperglycaemia). Adverse events led to dose reductions in six (14%) patients and treatment discontinuation in seven (16%). Five (14%) of 37 response-evaluable patients achieved an objective response (two complete responses and three partial responses). All five responses occurred in the subgroup of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; n=9), and three occurred in those with transformed follicular lymphoma DLBCL (n=5). 21 (57%) of 37 response-evaluable patients had stable disease, including those with DLBCL, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. On the basis of these findings, we selected CUDC-907 60 mg on the 5/2 dosing schedule as the recommended phase 2 dose. INTERPRETATION: The safety and tolerability profile of CUDC-907 and the promising preliminary evidence of response support continued development of CUDC-907 at the 60 mg 5/2 dosing schedule, alone and in combination with other therapies. A dose-expansion trial of this dose in patients with refractory and relapsed DLBCL in particular, is ongoing.

PRAME is expressed in a wide variety of tumors, but in contrast with most other tumor-associated antigens, it is also expressed in leukemias. The physiologic role of PRAME remains elusive. Recently, it has found PRAME could be involved in the regulation of cell death in leukemias, but the mechanism of the function is unclear. Here, we confirm that PRAME induces leukemias cell death by regulation of S100A4/p53 signaling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pCDNA3-PRAME plasmid and its control were transfected with the KG-1 cells. The pCDNA3-PRAME transfected KG-1 cells were then transiently transfected with S100A4 cDNA or wt-p53 siRNA. The PRAME siRNA and its control were transfected with the K562 cells. The PRAME siRNA transfected K562 cells were then transiently transfected with S100A4 siRNA or pGMp53-Lu. PRAME, S100A4 and P53 were detected by Western blot assay in different time point. Annexin V/propidium iodide and MTT methods were used to detect apoptosis and cell survival rate. RESULTS: KG-1 cells overexpressing the PRAME gene significantly induces apoptosis and decreases proliferation in vitro, followed by down-regulation of S100A4 and up-regulation of p53. Up-regulation of S100A4 by S100A4 transfection inhibits PRAME-induced p53 up-regulation. Furthermore, up-regulation of S100A4 by S100A4 transfection or down-regulation of p53 by p53 siRNA transfection reduces apoptosis and increases proliferation in vitro. Knockdown of PRAME in K562 cells significantly increases proliferation in vitro, followed by up-regulation of S100A4 and down-regulation of p53. The downregulation of S100A4 by S100A4 siRNA transfection increased p53 expression. Furthermore, downregulation of S100A4 by S100A4 siRNA transfection or up-regulation of p53 by p53 transfection decreases proliferation in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the leukemias expressing high levels of PRAME has a favorable prognosis.

Overexpression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), an anti-apoptotic protein, is associated with tumor progression and drug resistance in leukemia and several cancers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of specific Mcl-1 small interference RNA (siRNA) on the proliferation and chemosensitivity of U-937 AML cell to etoposide. The siRNA transfection was conducted using Lipofectamine 2000. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis were employed to measure the expression levels of mRNA and protein, respectively. To evaluate tumor cell growth after siRNA transfection, Trypan blue exclusion assay was conducted. The cytotoxic effects of siRNA and etoposide were determined using MTT assay on their own and in combination. DNA-histone ELISA and annexin-V/FITC assays were performed to study the apoptosis. Mcl-1 siRNA transfection significantly blocked the expression of Mcl-1 mRNA and protein in a time-dependent manner, leading to a strong growth inhibition and enhanced apoptosis (P less than 0.05). Furthermore, pretreatment with Mcl-1 siRNA, synergistically enhanced the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of etoposide (P less than 0.05). Our results demonstrated that Mcl-1 plays a fundamental role in the survival and resistance of U-937 cells to etoposide.

Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are an innate-like T-cell population that recognizes microbial riboflavin metabolite antigens in an MR1-dependent manner. The role of MAIT cells in the FGT mucosa is unknown. Here, we found that MAIT cells and MR1(+) antigen-presenting cells were present in the upper and lower FGT, with distinct tissue localization of MAIT cells in endometrium vs. cervix. The MAIT cells from the FGT and blood displayed a distinct phenotype with expression of interleukin (IL)-18Ralpha, CD127, alpha4beta7, PD-1, as well as the transcription factors promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), RORgammat, Helios, Eomes, and T-bet. Their expression levels of PLZF and Eomes were lower in the FGT compared with blood. When stimulated with Escherichia coli, MAIT cells from the FGT displayed a bias towards IL-17 and IL-22 expression, whereas blood MAIT cells produced primarily IFN-gamma, TNF, and Granzyme B. Furthermore, both FGT- and blood-derived MAIT cells were polyfunctional and contributed to the T-cell-mediated response to E. coli. Thus, MAIT cells in the genital mucosa have a distinct IL-17/IL-22 profile and may have an important role in the immunological homeostasis and control of microbes at this site.",,"['Gibbs, A', 'Leeansyah, E', 'Introini, A', 'Paquin-Proulx, D', 'Hasselrot, K', 'Andersson, E', 'Broliden, K', 'Sandberg, J K', 'Tjernlund, A']","['Gibbs A', 'Leeansyah E', 'Introini A', 'Paquin-Proulx D', 'Hasselrot K', 'Andersson E', 'Broliden K', 'Sandberg JK', 'Tjernlund A']","['Unit of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine Solna, Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Unit of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine Solna, Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Unit of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine Solna, Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Danderyd Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology/Cytology, Capio St Goran Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Unit of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine Solna, Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Unit of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine Solna, Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160406,United States,Mucosal Immunol,Mucosal immunology,101299742,"['0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (Interleukin-7 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (MR1 protein, human)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 3)', 'TLM2976OFR (Riboflavin)', 'XEO71E2E45 (interleukin-22)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Bacterial/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cervix Uteri/*immunology/pathology', 'Endometrium/*immunology/pathology', 'Escherichia coli/*immunology', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Interleukin-17/metabolism', 'Interleukin-7 Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Interleukins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/metabolism', 'Mucous Membrane/*immunology', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*immunology', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Riboflavin/immunology']",2016/04/07 06:00,2017/10/14 06:00,['2016/04/07 06:00'],"['2015/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['mi201630 [pii]', '10.1038/mi.2016.30 [doi]']",ppublish,Mucosal Immunol. 2017 Jan;10(1):35-45. doi: 10.1038/mi.2016.30.

Detailed analysis of cases with T/NK-cell lineage was done for their clinical, hematological and immunophenotypic features. RESULTS: A total of 262 cases of mature lymphoid neoplasms presented as leukemia during the study period. Of whom, only 8 (3.1%) cases were of T /NK-cell lineage and the remaining (96.9%) were of B-cell lineage. Of 8 cases, 4 (50%) had T-prolymphocytic leukemia, 2 (25%) had chronic lymphoproliferative disorder- natural killer cell and 1 (12.5%) case of each T-large granular lymphocytic leukemia and hepatosplenic gamma/delta T-NHL.

As HSCT improves the long-term survival, it is necessary to assess the late-onset complications affecting the quality of life following HSCT. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study included 122 patients (65 male, 57 female) with leukemia (72 AML and 50 ALL) who received transplants from fully- matched siblings, unrelated donors and unrelated cord blood donors between February 2013 and August 2014 in Shariati Hospital. All study participants were over 18 years of age and had the minimum and maximum survival of 2 and 5 years, respectively. Patients who received HLA-haploidentical SCT were excluded from the study. All allogeneic recipients received busulfan and cyclophosphamide as conditioning regimen. Nobody received TBI-based conditioning regimen in this study. Patients were evaluated for cardiovascular, vision, psychological, endocrine, fertility problems and secondary malignancies one year after transplantation. Results : Data were analyzed using SPSS 15.0. Mitral and tricuspid regurgitation (TR/MR) were the most common cardiac complications (n=12, 10.5%).Thirty-nine percent of patients had psychological problems, especially depression (34%). Cataract was observed in 13% of patients and 34% complained of dry eye. Symptomatic pulmonary changes were found in 13 patients (10.6%). None of the HSCT survivors had experienced fertility before study entry. According to LH and FSH levels, 15% and 9% of females had ovarian failure, respectively. Testosterone level was less than normal in 49(84%) men and, according to their FSH and LH level, 20 (41%) had secondary hypogonadism and 29 (59%) had primary gonadal dysfunction.

Two distinct types of mutations have been described: internal duplication of the juxtamembranous domain (ITD) and point mutations of the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD). Although both mutations lead to constitutive FLT3 signaling, only FLT3-ITD strongly activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5). In a murine transplantation model, FLT3-ITD induces a myeloproliferative neoplasm, whereas FLT3-TKD leads to a lymphoid malignancy with significantly longer latency. Here we report that the presence of STAT5 is critical for the development of a myeloproliferative disease by FLT3-ITD in mice. Deletion of Stat5 in FLT3-ITD-induced leukemogenesis leads not only to a significantly longer survival (82 vs 27 days) of the diseased mice, but also to an immunophenotype switch with expansion of the lymphoid cell compartment. Interestingly, we were able to show differential STAT5 activation in FLT3-ITD(+) myeloid and lymphoid murine progenitors. STAT5 target genes such as Oncostatin M were highly expressed in FLT3-ITD(+) myeloid but not in FLT3-ITD(+) lymphoid progenitor cells. Strikingly, FLT3-TKD expression in combination with Oncostatin M is sufficient to reverse the phenotype to a myeloproliferative disease in FLT3-TKD mice. Thus, lineage-specific STAT5 activation in hematopoietic progenitor cells predicts the FLT3(+)-mediated leukemic phenotype in mice.",,"['Muller, T A', 'Grundler, R', 'Istvanffy, R', 'Rudelius, M', 'Hennighausen, L', 'Illert, A L', 'Duyster, J']","['Muller TA', 'Grundler R', 'Istvanffy R', 'Rudelius M', 'Hennighausen L', 'Illert AL', 'Duyster J']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', '3rd Department of Internal Medicine, Klinikum Rechts der Isar der Technischen Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', '3rd Department of Internal Medicine, Klinikum Rechts der Isar der Technischen Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Klinikum Rechts der Isar der Technischen Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Julius-Maximilians-University and Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken, Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160405,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'Cell Lineage/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoid Progenitor Cells/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2016/04/06 06:00,2017/08/29 06:00,['2016/04/06 06:00'],"['2015/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/13 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201672 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.72 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Aug;30(8):1725-33. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.72.

The use of thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonists (TRA) has been extensively studied and remains an important component of experimental ex vivo stem cell expansion protocols, but its use in allogeneic transplantation is still evolving. METHODS: We describe the use of eltrombopag, a TRA, to stimulate the rescue of late graft failure in a patient following allogeneic HCT, and we performed a systematic review of published studies describing the use of TRAs following allogeneic transplantation. RESULTS: A total of eight publications were identified from our systematic search and included observational case studies (five studies, total of seven patients) that primarily addressed ITP or isolated thrombocytopenia at various time points after allogeneic HCT and prospective clinical trials (three studies, total of 177 patients with 95 patients receiving TRAs). No studies reported specifically on the use of TRAs for the treatment of trilineage graft failure as a means of in vivo stem cell expansion. The use of TRAs following allogeneic HCT appears safe and promising. CONCLUSION: The use of eltrombopag or other TRAs to treat poor graft function after allogeneic HCT is intriguing and warrants further study.",['(c) 2016 British Blood Transfusion Society.'],"['Dyba, J', 'Tinmouth, A', 'Bredeson, C', 'Matthews, J', 'Allan, D S']","['Dyba J', 'Tinmouth A', 'Bredeson C', 'Matthews J', 'Allan DS']","[""Department of Medicine, Queen's University at Kingston, Kingston, Ontario, Canada."", 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, and Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, and Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, and Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', ""Department of Medicine, Queen's University at Kingston, Kingston, Ontario, Canada."", 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, and Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20160405,England,Transfus Med,"Transfusion medicine (Oxford, England)",9301182,"['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', 'S56D65XJ9G (eltrombopag)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Allografts', 'Benzoates/*administration & dosage', 'Delayed Graft Function/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Graft Survival/*drug effects', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Pyrazoles/*administration & dosage']",2016/04/06 06:00,2017/03/25 06:00,['2016/04/06 06:00'],"['2015/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/01 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/tme.12300 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfus Med. 2016 Jun;26(3):202-7. doi: 10.1111/tme.12300.

Methods Retrospective review of the PTCL database at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. We identified 231 patients with any subtype of PTCL between 1994-2011 with a minimum six months of follow-up or an event defined as relapse or death. Results Histologies included peripheral T-cell lymphoma-not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) (31.6%), angioimmunoblastic (16.9%), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), ALK- (12.1%), ALCL, ALK + (6.1%), extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (7.4%), adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) (7.4%), and transformed mycosis fungoides (8.7%). Seventeen patients had CNS disease (7%). Fifteen had CNS involvement with PTCL and two had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and glioblastoma. Median time to CNS involvement was 3.44 months (0.16-103.1). CNS prophylaxis was given to 24 patients (primarily intrathecal methotrexate). Rates of CNS involvement were not different in patients who received prophylaxis. Univariate analysis identified stage III-IV, bone marrow involvement, >1 extranodal site and ATLL as risk factors for CNS disease. On multivariate analysis, >1 extranodal site and international prognostic index (IPI) >/= 3 were predictive for CNS involvement. The median survival of patients with CNS involvement was 2.63 months (0.10-75). Conclusions Despite high relapse rates, PTCL, except ATLL, carries a low risk of CNS involvement. Prognosis with CNS involvement is poor and risk factors include: >1 extra nodal site and IPI >/=3.",,"['Gurion, Ronit', 'Mehta, Neha', 'Migliacci, Jocelyn C', 'Zelenetz, Andrew', 'Moskowitz, Alison', 'Lunning, Matthew', 'Moskowitz, Craig', 'Hamlin, Paul', 'Horwitz, Steven']","['Gurion R', 'Mehta N', 'Migliacci JC', 'Zelenetz A', 'Moskowitz A', 'Lunning M', 'Moskowitz C', 'Hamlin P', 'Horwitz S']","['a Institute of Hematology, Rabin Medical Center , Petah-Tikva , Israel ;', 'b Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University , Tel Aviv , Israel ;', 'c Lymphoma Service, Department of Medicine , Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York , New York , USA ;', 'd Weill Cornell Medical College , New York , New York , USA ;', 'c Lymphoma Service, Department of Medicine , Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York , New York , USA ;', 'd Weill Cornell Medical College , New York , New York , USA ;', 'c Lymphoma Service, Department of Medicine , Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York , New York , USA ;', 'd Weill Cornell Medical College , New York , New York , USA ;', 'c Lymphoma Service, Department of Medicine , Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York , New York , USA ;', 'd Weill Cornell Medical College , New York , New York , USA ;', 'e Medical Oncology Service, Department of Medicine , University of Nebraska , Omaha , Nebraska , USA.', 'c Lymphoma Service, Department of Medicine , Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York , New York , USA ;', 'd Weill Cornell Medical College , New York , New York , USA ;', 'c Lymphoma Service, Department of Medicine , Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York , New York , USA ;', 'd Weill Cornell Medical College , New York , New York , USA ;', 'c Lymphoma Service, Department of Medicine , Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York , New York , USA ;', 'd Weill Cornell Medical College , New York , New York , USA ;']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160404,England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 1.1.- (Lactate Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 1.1.1.28 (D-lactate dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*epidemiology/pathology/prevention & control', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Glioblastoma/epidemiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Lactate Dehydrogenases/blood', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/epidemiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/drug therapy/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/06 06:00,2017/02/09 06:00,['2016/04/06 06:00'],"['2016/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/0284186X.2015.1118656 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2016 May;55(5):561-6. doi: 10.3109/0284186X.2015.1118656.

METHODS: Medical records of 7 patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus with acute orbital findings were reviewed. Clinical presentation, radiography, and treatment outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: One man and 6 women with a median age of 70 years (range 47-84) presented with herpes zoster ophthalmicus with acute clinical orbital signs. Two of the 7 patients had compromised immune systems, with 1 patient having chronic lymphocytic leukemia and another infected with human immunodeficiency virus. Clinical orbital findings included proptosis, blepharoptosis, ophthalmoplegia, diplopia, and visual loss. Orbital imaging detailed such findings as myositis in all 7 patients, dacryoadenitis in 2 patients, and optic nerve sheath enhancement in 1 patient. Treatment with intravenous acyclovir was universal in all 7 patients and in 2 cases systemic corticosteroids were also administered. Orbital signs improved in all patients over several months. CONCLUSIONS: Herpes zoster ophthalmicus can rarely cause an acute orbital syndrome and the authors present what may be the largest series of such patients to date. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus can affect various orbital structures including the lacrimal gland, extraocular muscles, cranial nerves and optic nerve sheath. A careful clinical examination and detailed orbital radiography are critical in proper diagnosis and treatment of such patients. Improvement of symptoms and signs with antiviral therapy can be expected; however, complete resolution does not always occur. The role of systemic steroids in treatment of orbital disease is yet to be determined.",,"['Temnogorod, Jenny', 'Pointdujour-Lim, Renelle', 'Mancini, Ronald', 'Chang, Shu-Hong', 'Allen, Richard C', 'Shinder, Roman']","['Temnogorod J', 'Pointdujour-Lim R', 'Mancini R', 'Chang SH', 'Allen RC', 'Shinder R']","['*Ophthalmology, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York, daggerOphthalmology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, double daggerOphthalmology, Jules Stein Eye Institute, Los Angeles, California, and section signDepartment of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinic, Iowa City, Iowa, U.S.A.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg,Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery,8508431,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Blepharoptosis/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Blindness/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Diplopia/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Exophthalmos/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Female', 'Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus/*complications', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Ophthalmoplegia', 'Syndrome', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2016/04/06 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/04/06 06:00'],"['2016/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/IOP.0000000000000688 [doi]'],ppublish,Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg. 2017 May/Jun;33(3):173-177. doi: 10.1097/IOP.0000000000000688.,10.1097/IOP.0000000000000688 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluated HRQoL in advanced CML patients receiving bosutinib in an ongoing phase 2 study following resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy. METHODS: This analysis included data from 76 accelerated-phase (AP) and 64 blast-phase (BP) patients resistant/intolerant to prior imatinib with or without prior exposure to other TKIs. Patient-reported HRQoL assessments completed at baseline; weeks 4, 8, and 12; every 12 weeks thereafter; and at treatment completion included the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia (FACT-Leu); general health status was assessed using the 5-item EuroQol (EQ-5D) instrument and a visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS: HRQoL at baseline was somewhat worse in BP versus AP CML patients. There was a significant improvement in the mean FACT-Leu Total scale at weeks 24, 36, and 48 in AP CML patients and at weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 96 in BP CML patients compared with baseline. EQ-5D Utility scores were stable throughout treatment in AP CML patients but significantly improved versus baseline in BP CML patients at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 36. Mean VAS scores were significantly improved at weeks 8, 36, and 48 in AP CML patients and at weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 96 in BP CML patients. The lack of a comparison group limits attribution of improvements in HRQoL specifically to bosutinib treatment; potential bias due to non-ignorable dropout may limit the ability to generalize these findings to situations where durations of therapy exceed the 96-week follow-up duration of the present study. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that bosutinib therapy is associated with improved HRQoL in advanced phase CML patients.

We retrospectively analyzed outcomes of 333 adult ALL patients who underwent alloHCT at our institution over a 10-year period. Patients were classified according to disease status at transplantation (complete response [CR] 1 [n = 202] or > CR1) and according to cytogenetic risk, defined as good (2%), intermediate (42%), poor (46%), or unknown (10%) based on available outcome data for each of the cytogenetic abnormalities. Three-year overall survival (OS), leukemia-free survival (LFS), and relapse incidence (RI) were 55.7%, 47.9% and 27.5%, respectively; 1-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 17.3%. For patients undergoing alloHCT in CR1, 3-year OS, LFS, and RI were 69.8%, 62.3%, and 17.1%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, cytogenetic risk did not impact OS or LFS for the whole cohort or for patients who underwent transplantation in CR1. Disease status at alloHCT was an independent predictor for LFS (CR1 versus others: hazard ratio [HR], 3.17; P < .01) and OS (CR1 versus others: HR, 2.90; P < .01). Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis with tacrolimus/sirolimus was associated with a low NRM of 11.5% in the alloHCT recipients in CR1.

As understanding of disease biology and molecular diagnostic tools are getting improved gradually, characterization of variation in CLL's clinical courses was facilitated, resulting in better risk stratification and targeted treatments. Consequently multiple new targeted agents have been used in treatment of CLL, it makes improved clinical outcome. Rituximab containing chemoimmunotherapy (combination of rituximab, fludarabine, and cyclophosphamide) have shown better overall response rate and progression-free survival on fit patients' group in front-line setting, result in standard first-line therapeutic option for CLL.

In this study, for the first time epigenetic chromatin modifications were characterized in tissues and tumours from murine xenograft model generated using the human acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) NB4 cells engrafted in immunodeficient NOG mice. Xenografts were subjected to combined epigenetic treatment by histone deacetylase inhibitor Belinostat, histone methyltransferase inhibitor 3-DZNeaplanocin A and all-trans-retinoic acid based on in vitro model, where such combination inhibited NB4 cell growth and enhanced retinoic acid-induced differentiation to granulocytes. Xenotransplantation was assessed by peripheral blood cells counts, the analysis of cell surface markers (CD15, CD33, CD45) and the expression of certain genes (PML-RAR alpha, CSF3, G-CSFR, WT1). The combined treatment prolonged APL xenograft mice survival and prevented tumour formation. The analysis of the expression of histone marks such as acetylation of H4, trimethylation of H3K4, H3K9 and H3K27 in APL xenograft mice tumours and tissues demonstrated tissue-specific changes in the level of histone modifications and the APL prognostic mark, WT1 protein.

MMP-9 efficiently degrades the extracellular matrix component gelatin, and the hemopexin domain of MMP-9 (PEX9) inhibits this degradation. To study the molecular basis of this inhibition, we generated GST fusion proteins containing PEX9 or truncated forms corresponding to specific structural blades (B1-B4) of PEX9. GST-PEX9 inhibited MMP-9-driven gelatin proteolysis, measured by gelatin zymography, FITC-gelatin conversion, and DQ-gelatin degradation assays. However, GST-PEX9 did not prevent the degradation of other MMP-9 substrates, such as a fluorogenic peptide, alphaB crystalline, or nonmuscular actin. Therefore, PEX9 may inhibit gelatin degradation by shielding gelatin and specifically preventing its binding to MMP-9. Accordingly, GST-PEX9 also abolished the degradation of gelatin by MMP-2, confirming that PEX9 is not an MMP-9 antagonist. Moreover, GST-B4 and, to a lesser extent, GST-B1 also inhibited gelatin degradation by MMP-9, indicating that these regions are responsible for the inhibitory activity of PEX9. Accordingly, ELISAs demonstrated that GST-B4 and GST-B1 specifically bound to gelatin. Our results establish new functions of PEX9 attributed to blades B4 and B1 and should help in designing specific inhibitors of gelatin degradation.","['(c) 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Ugarte-Berzal, Estefania', 'Vandooren, Jennifer', 'Bailon, Elvira', 'Opdenakker, Ghislain', 'Garcia-Pardo, Angeles']","['Ugarte-Berzal E', 'Vandooren J', 'Bailon E', 'Opdenakker G', 'Garcia-Pardo A']","['From the Cellular and Molecular Medicine Department, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, 28040 Madrid, Spain and the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, KULeuven-University of Leuven, Rega Institute for Medical Research, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, KULeuven-University of Leuven, Rega Institute for Medical Research, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'From the Cellular and Molecular Medicine Department, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, 28040 Madrid, Spain and.', 'the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, KULeuven-University of Leuven, Rega Institute for Medical Research, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'From the Cellular and Molecular Medicine Department, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, 28040 Madrid, Spain and agarciapardo@cib.csic.es.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160404,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['9000-70-8 (Gelatin)', '9013-71-2 (Hemopexin)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (MMP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Gelatin/*metabolism', 'Hemopexin/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*metabolism', 'Proteolysis/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2016/04/06 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/04/06 06:00'],"['2015/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)43205-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M115.708438 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2016 May 27;291(22):11751-60. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M115.708438.

Tcf1 and Lef1 transcription factors are expressed in HSCs, and targeting both factors modestly expanded the size of the HSC pool due to diminished HSC quiescence. Functional defects of Tcf1/Lef1-deficient HSCs in multi-lineage blood reconstitution was only evident under competitive conditions or when subjected to repeated regenerative stress. These are mechanistically due to direct positive regulation of Egr and Tcf3 by Tcf1 and Lef1, and significantly, forced expression of Egr1 in Tcf1/Lef1-deficient HSCs restored HSC quiescence. In a preclinical CML model, loss of Tcf1/Lef1 did not show strong impact on leukemia initiation and progression. However, when transplanted into secondary recipients, Tcf1/Lef1-deficient LSCs failed to propagate CML. By induced deletion of Tcf1 and Lef1 in pre-established CML, we further demonstrated an intrinsic requirement for these factors in LSC self-renewal. When combined with imatinib therapy, genetic targeting of Tcf1 and Lef1 potently diminished LSCs and conferred better protection to the CML recipients. LSCs are therefore more sensitive to loss of Tcf1 and Lef1 than HSCs in their self-renewal capacity. The differential requirements in HSCs and LSCs thus identify Tcf1 and Lef1 transcription factors as novel therapeutic targets in treating hematological malignancies, and inhibition of Tcf1/Lef1-regulated transcriptional programs may thus provide a therapeutic window to eliminate LSCs with minimal side effect on normal HSC functions.","['(c) 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Yu, Shuyang', 'Li, Fengyin', 'Xing, Shaojun', 'Zhao, Tianyan', 'Peng, Weiqun', 'Xue, Hai-Hui']","['Yu S', 'Li F', 'Xing S', 'Zhao T', 'Peng W', 'Xue HH']","['From the State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology, College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China, ysy@cau.edu.cn.', 'Department of Microbiology, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa 52242.', 'Department of Microbiology, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa 52242.', 'From the State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology, College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.', 'Department of Physics, The George Washington University, Washington, D.

Only a few people know that As has also been widely used in medicine. In the past years As and its compounds were used as a medicine for the treatment of such diseases as diabetes, psoriasis, syphilis, skin ulcers and joint diseases. Nowadays As is also used especially in the treatment of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has recognized arsenic as an element with carcinogenic effect evidenced by epidemiological studies, but as previously mentioned it is also used in the treatment of neoplastic diseases. This underlines the specificity of the arsenic effects. Arsenic occurs widely in the natural environment, for example, it is present in soil and water, which contributes to its migration to food products. Long exposure to this element may lead to liver damages and also to changes in myocardium. Bearing in mind that such serious health problems can occur, monitoring of the As presence in the environmental media plays a very important role. In addition, the occupational risk of As exposure in the workplace should be identified and checked. Also the standards for As presence in food should be established. This paper presents a review of the 2015 publications based on the Medical database like PubMed and Polish Medical Bibliography.

However, ~40% of relapsed patients have uncharacterized BCR-ABL1 kinase-independent mechanisms of resistance. To identify these mechanisms of resistance and potential treatment options, we generated ABL-TKI-resistant K562 cells through prolonged sequential exposure to imatinib and dasatinib. Dual-resistant K562 cells lacked BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations, but acquired other genomic aberrations that were characterized by next-generation sequencing and copy number analyses. Proteomics showed that dual-resistant cells had elevated levels of FOXO1, phospho-ERK and BCL-2, and that dasatinib no longer inhibited substrates of the PI3K/AKT pathway. In contrast to parental cells, resistant cells were sensitive to growth inhibition and apoptosis induced by the class I PI3K inhibitor, GDC-0941 (pictilisib), which also induced FOXO1 nuclear translocation. FOXO1 was elevated in a subset of primary specimens from relapsed CML patients lacking BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations, and these samples were responsive to GDC-0941 treatment ex vivo.

It also holds the promise for treating solid tumors, including gastric carcinoma. However, the molecular mechanism of the effectiveness of ATO to solid tumor is still poorly understood. In this study, we chosed gastric carcinoma as an example and tried to reveal the antitumor mechanism through metabolomics. Gastric carcinoma cell line SGC7901 was treated with ATO for 6, 12, and 24 h. The global metabolite profiles were monitored by metabolomics analysis using gas chromatography (GC)/mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography/MS/MS. A total of 281 certified metabolites were reliably detected. Bioinformatics analysis showed that glycerophospholipid synthesis, one-carbon synthesis, and glutathione synthesis were affected dramatically. Other cellular functions/pathways that had been affected included inflammatory response, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)), and polyamine biosynthesis pathway. The metabolomics data from this study, in combination with previous transcriptomics and proteomics data, could serve as valuable resources for the understanding of the specific antitumor mechanism of ATO treatment.","['(c) The Author 2016.

Remission rates in Hispanic population are almost 30% lower and Overall Survival (OS) nearly two years inferior than those reported in other ethnic groups. Only 61% of Colombian adult patients with ALL achieve complete remission (CR), median overall survival is 11.3 months and event-free survival (EFS) is 7.34 months. Identification of prognostic factors is crucial for the application of proper treatment strategies and subsequently for successful outcome. Our goal was to identify a gene expression signature that might correlate with response to therapy and evaluate the utility of these as prognostic tool in hispanic patients. METHODS: We included 43 adult patients newly diagnosed with B-ALL. We used microarray analysis in order to identify genes that distinguish poor from good response to treatment using differential gene expression analysis. The expression profile was validated by real-time PCR (RT-PCT). RESULTS: We identified 442 differentially expressed genes between responders and non-responders to induction treatment. Hierarchical analysis according to the expression of a 7-gene signature revealed 2 subsets of patients that differed in their clinical characteristics and outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that response to induction treatment and clinical outcome of Hispanic patients can be predicted from the onset of the disease and that gene expression profiles can be used to stratify patient risk adequately and accurately. The present study represents the first that shows the gene expression profiling of B-ALL Colombian adults and its relevance for stratification in the early course of disease.",,"['Cruz-Rodriguez, Nataly', 'Combita, Alba L', 'Enciso, Leonardo J', 'Quijano, Sandra M', 'Pinzon, Paula L', 'Lozano, Olga C', 'Castillo, Juan S', 'Li, Li', 'Bareno, Jose', 'Cardozo, Claudia', 'Solano, Julio', 'Herrera, Maria V', 'Cudris, Jennifer', 'Zabaleta, Jovanny']","['Cruz-Rodriguez N', 'Combita AL', 'Enciso LJ', 'Quijano SM', 'Pinzon PL', 'Lozano OC', 'Castillo JS', 'Li L', 'Bareno J', 'Cardozo C', 'Solano J', 'Herrera MV', 'Cudris J', 'Zabaleta J']","['Programa de Investigacion e Innovacion en Leucemias Agudas y Cronicas (PILAC), Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Group of Investigation in Biology of Cancer, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Calle 1 # 9-85, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Biologicas, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Programa de Investigacion e Innovacion en Leucemias Agudas y Cronicas (PILAC), Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Bogota, Colombia. acombita@cancer.gov.co.', 'Group of Investigation in Biology of Cancer, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Calle 1 # 9-85, Bogota, Colombia. acombita@cancer.gov.co.', 'Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota, Colombia. acombita@cancer.gov.co.', 'Programa de Investigacion e Innovacion en Leucemias Agudas y Cronicas (PILAC), Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Grupo de Hemato Oncologia, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Grupo de Inmunobiologia y Biologia Celular, Departamento de Microbiologia, Facultad de Ciencias, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Hospital Universitario San Ignacio, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Group of Investigation in Biology of Cancer, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Calle 1 # 9-85, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Group of Investigation in Biology of Cancer, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Calle 1 # 9-85, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Programa de Investigacion e Innovacion en Leucemias Agudas y Cronicas (PILAC), Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Stanley S.

One limitation of this approach is that it overlooks mutations in noncoding regulatory elements. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which mutations in transcriptionalcis-regulatory elements result in disease remain poorly understood. Here we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to interrogate three such elements harboring mutations in human erythroid disorders, which in all cases are predicted to disrupt a canonical binding motif for the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA1. Deletions of as few as two to four nucleotides resulted in a substantial decrease (>80%) in target gene expression. Isolated deletions of the canonical GATA1 binding motif completely abrogated binding of the cofactor TAL1, which binds to a separate motif. Having verified the functionality of these three GATA1 motifs, we demonstrate strong evolutionary conservation of GATA1 motifs in regulatory elements proximal to other genes implicated in erythroid disorders, and show that targeted disruption of such elements results in altered gene expression. By modeling transcription factor binding patterns, we show that multiple transcription factors are associated with erythroid gene expression, and have created predictive maps modeling putative disruptions of their binding sites at key regulatory elements.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to improve the transition to palliative care for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) through the development and implementation of a coordinated care plan program. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with AML who were no longer being treated with curative intent from March 2011 through September 2012 had hematology supportive care plans developed. Patients (n = 7) completed post-care plan implementation questionnaires to determine their level of understanding in relation to the change in treatment intent. Staff completed pre- (n = 26) and post- (n = 19) care plan implementation questionnaires to determine the communication, challenges, and accessibility of changed management goals. RESULTS: Seventy-seven percent of patients understood palliative care to be the primary team managing their symptoms, with 75% of patients viewing symptom control as the main goal of treatment. Staff findings demonstrated a significant improvement in the communication of treatment goals (53% preimplementation vs 86% postimplementation). Early timing of referrals remains a significant issue. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing the individualized care plan program was associated with better communication and accessibility of documented palliative treatment goals for patients with AML.

The disease arises from recurrent genetic insults that block differentiation of hematopoietic stem and/or progenitor cells (HSPCs) and drives uncontrolled proliferation and survival of the differentiation-blocked clone. Pediatric leukemia is phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous with an obscure etiology. The interaction between genetic factors and environmental agents represents a potential etiological driver. Although information is limited, the principal toxic mechanisms of potential leukemogenic agents (e.g., etoposide, benzene metabolites, bioflavonoids and some pesticides) include topoisomerase II inhibition and/or excessive generation of free radicals, which may induce DNA single- and double-strand breaks (DNA-DSBs) in early HSPCs. Chromosomal rearrangements (duplications, deletions and translocations) may occur if these lesions are not properly repaired.

The diagnostic/prognostic value of these profiles could then be validated in prospective clinical studies. Here, we consider the potential of exosomes to fulfill the role of future biomarkers of minimal residual disease in AML. The rationale for developing exosome-based methodology for minimal residual disease detection is based on promising early observations.

Whether the overexpression of EVI1 also predicts poor outcome of AML patients undergoing myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in first CR (CR1) is still unclear.

EVI1+ patients were significantly likely to harbor with translocations involving the MLL gene on 11q23 (8/9).

However, CD4(+)CD25(high)Foxp3(+) T cells reportedly contribute to disease progression by over suppressing immune responses in some chronic infections. In this study, kinetic and functional analyses of CD4(+)CD25(high)Foxp3(+) T cells were performed in cattle with bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infections, which have reported immunosuppressive characteristics. In initial experiments, production of the Th1 cytokines IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha was reduced in BLV-infected cattle compared with uninfected cattle, and numbers of IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha producing CD4(+) T cells decreased with disease progression. In contrast, IFN-gamma production by NK cells was inversely correlated with BLV proviral loads in infected cattle. Additionally, during persistent lymphocytosis disease stages, NK cytotoxicity was depressed as indicated by low expression of the cytolytic protein perforin. Concomitantly, total CD4(+)CD25(high)Foxp3(+) T cell numbers and percentages of TGF-beta(+) cells were increased, suggesting that TGF-beta plays a role in the functional declines of CD4(+) T cells and NK cells. In further experiments, recombinant bovine TGF-beta suppressed IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha production by CD4(+) T cells and NK cytotoxicity in cultured cells.

Baicalein is one type of flavonoids extracted from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (Huang Qin). It inhibited cell proliferation and subcutaneous tumor formation of many tumor cell lines. However, whether baicalein possesses anti-AMKL activities has not been tested. RESULTS: We found that baicalein potently inhibited proliferation of multiple AMKL cells including CMK, CMY, Y10, 6133, and 6133 MPL/W515L due to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. Unexpectedly, caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk did not restore cell proliferation. In contrast, ectopic expression of Cyclin D1 efficiently antagonized the inhibitory effect of baicalein. In addition, baicalein induced differentiation of 6133 MPL/W515L cells. Finally, baicalein promoted mice survival and reduced disease burden in a mouse model of AMKL.

This study aims to investigate the apoptosis-inducing effects of seed extracts from eight different cultivated species ('Apple', 'Bombay', 'Jumbo', 'Kaew', 'Nomsod', 'Rianthong', 'Samros', and 'Taiwan') on human Jurkat leukemia T cells. METHODS: We evaluated the effects of seed extracts from eight jujube cultivated species on human Jurkat leukemia T cells. The crude seed extracts were prepared sequentially by using water, 95 % ethanol, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, chloroform or hexane. The antiproliferative effects of the jujube seed extracts relative to that of melphalan were evaluated by neutral red assays. Apoptotic cell death induced by the ethanolic extracts at 1 x IC50 and 2 x IC50 concentrations was demonstrated by DAPI staining, gel electrophoresis, flow cytometry with Annexin V/propidium iodide staining, and caspase-3, -8, and -9 enzyme activities. RESULTS: Ethanolic extracts of 'Taiwan', 'Jumbo', 'Nomsod', 'Rianthong', 'Samros', and 'Bombay', significantly inhibited the proliferation of Jurkat cells compared with untreated cells (all P < 0.001), while the extracts of 'Kaew' and 'Apple' were inactive. The six active extracts preferentially induced apoptotic cell death in a concentration-dependent manner with DNA fragmentation (2 x IC50). Increased caspase-3 activity was detected after treatment with the six extracts. The 'Taiwan', 'Nomsod', 'Jumbo', and 'Rianthong' extracts (2 x IC50) induced both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways by increasing caspase-8 and caspase-9 activity, respectively. Alkaloids (Dragendorff's method) and reducing sugars (Fehling's test) were mainly identified in the apoptosis-inducing extracts.

NCCR estimated the numbers of new cancer cases and cancer deaths in China with compiled cancer incidence and mortality rates. METHODS: In 2015, there were 261 cancer registries submitted cancer incidence and deaths occurred in 2012. All the data were checked and evaluated based on the NCCR criteria of data quality. Qualified data from 193 registries were used for cancer statistics analysis as national estimation. The pooled data were stratified by area (urban/rural), gender, age group [0, 1-4, 5-9, 10-14, ..., 85+] and cancer type. New cancer cases and deaths were estimated using age-specific rates and corresponding national population in 2012. The Chinese census data in 2000 and Segi's population were applied for age-standardized rates. All the rates were expressed per 100,000 person-year. RESULTS: Qualified 193 cancer registries (74 urban and 119 rural registries) covered 198,060,406 populations (100,450,109 in urban and 97,610,297 in rural areas). The percentage of cases morphologically verified (MV%) and death certificate-only cases (DCO%) were 69.13% and 2.38%, respectively, and the mortality to incidence rate ratio (M/I) was 0.62. A total of 3,586,200 new cancer cases and 2,186,600 cancer deaths were estimated in China in 2012. The incidence rate was 264.85/100,000 (289.30/100,000 in males, 239.15/100,000 in females), the age-standardized incidence rates by Chinese standard population (ASIRC) and by world standard population (ASIRW) were 191.89/100,000 and 187.83/100,000 with the cumulative incidence rate (0-74 age years old) of 21.82%. The cancer incidence, ASIRC and ASIRW in urban areas were 277.17/100,000, 195.56/100,000 and 190.88/100,000 compared to 251.20/100,000, 187.10/100,000 and 183.91/100,000 in rural areas, respectively. The cancer mortality was 161.49/100,000 (198.99/100,000 in males, 122.06/100,000 in females), the age-standardized mortality rates by Chinese standard population (ASMRC) and by world standard population (ASMRW) were 112.34/100,000 and 111.25/100,000, and the cumulative mortality rate (0-74 years old) was 12.61%. The cancer mortality, ASMRC and ASMRW were 159.00/100,000, 107.231/100,000 and 106.13/100,000 in urban areas, 164.24/100,000, 118.22/100,000 and 117.06/100,000 in rural areas, respectively. Cancers of lung, stomach, liver, colorectum, esophagus, female breast, thyroid cervix, brain tumor and pancreas were the most common cancers, accounting for about 77.4% of all cancer new cases. Lung cancer, liver cancer, stomach cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, female breast cancer, brain tumor, leukemia and lymphoma were the leading causes of cancer death, accounting for about 84.5% of all cancer deaths. The cancer spectrum showed difference between urban and rural, males and females both in incidence and mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer surveillance information in China is making great progress with the increasing number of cancer registries, population coverage and the improving data quality. Cancer registration plays a fundamental role in cancer control by providing basic information on population-based cancer incidence, mortality, survival and time trend.

Current front-line regimes include agents such as fludarabine, which act primarily via the DNA damage response pathway. Key to this is the transcription factor p53. Mutations in the TP53 gene, altering p53 functionality, are associated with genetic instability, and are present in aggressive CLL. Furthermore, the emergence of clonal TP53 mutations in relapsed CLL, refractory to DNA-damaging therapy, suggests that accurate detection of sub-clonal TP53 mutations prior to and during treatment may be indicative of early relapse. In this study, we describe a novel deep sequencing workflow using multiple polymerases to generate sequencing libraries (MuPol-Seq), facilitating accurate detection of TP53 mutations at a frequency as low as 0.3%, in presentation CLL cases tested.

However, addiction to oncogenes is not the only drive to lymphoid tumor pathogenesis. Dependence on non-oncogenes, which act by propelling basic mechanisms of cell proliferation and survival, has also been recognized in the pathobiology of lymphoid leukemias, lymphomas and multiple myeloma. Among the growing number of molecules that may uphold non-oncogene addiction, a key place is increasingly being recognized to the serine-threonine kinase CK2. This enzyme is overexpressed and overactive in B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, such as mantle cell, follicular, Burkitt's and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. In these tumors, CK2 may serve the activity of oncogenes, similar to BCR-ABL and c-MYC, control the activation of critical signaling cascades, such as NF-kappaB (nuclear factor-kappaB), STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) and PTEN/PI3K/AKT (phosphatase and tensin homolog protein/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKR thymoma), and sustain multiple cellular stress-elicited pathways, such as the proteotoxic stress, unfolded protein and DNA-damage responses. CK2 has also been shown to have an essential role in tuning signals derived from the stromal tumor microenvironment. Not surprisingly, targeting CK2 in lymphoid tumor cell lines or mouse xenograft models can boost the cytotoxic effects of both conventional chemotherapeutics and novel agents, similar to heat-shock protein 90, proteasome and tyrosine kinases inhibitors. In this review, we summarize the evidence indicating how CK2 embodies most of the features of a cancer growth-promoting non-oncogene, focusing on lymphoid tumors. We further discuss the preclinical data of the use of small ATP-competitive CK2 inhibitors, which hold the promise to be additional options in novel drug combinations for the therapy of lymphoid and plasmacellular malignancies.",,"['Mandato, E', 'Manni, S', 'Zaffino, F', 'Semenzato, G', 'Piazza, F']","['Mandato E', 'Manni S', 'Zaffino F', 'Semenzato G', 'Piazza F']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology Branch, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology Branch, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology Branch, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology Branch, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology Branch, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160404,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Casein Kinase II/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogenes', 'Signal Transduction']",2016/04/05 06:00,2017/09/07 06:00,['2016/04/05 06:00'],"['2015/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc201686 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2016.86 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2016 Nov 24;35(47):6045-6052. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.86.

In recent years various clinical trials have confirmed the safety and efficacy of this drug in ET, with some also considering Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutational status, but have not confirmed the impact that the other driver mutations, i.e., calreticulin (CALR) and myeloproliferative leukemia virus (MPL), may have on the response to this therapy. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of JAK2, MPL, CALR gene mutational status on response to anagrelide therapy in patients with ET treated at the Oncohematology Division, IRCCS Ca' Granda-Maggiore Policlinico Hospital Foundation, Milan between 2004 and 2015. METHODS: Among 213 ET patients who were diagnosed between January 1983 to November 2014, 21 consecutive cases who were started on anagrelide as a second-line therapy and received at least 1-year of treatment were included. Inclusion criteria were the availability of demographic, clinical, histological, and hematologic data at diagnosis, and at least one granulocyte DNA sample to assess the mutational status of the JAK2, MPL, and CALR genes. RESULTS: The JAK2V617F mutation was detected in seven patients (33.3 %), CALR mutations were identified in another seven cases, and the remaining seven patients were defined as ""triple-negative"" (i.e., no JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutation). After a median anagrelide treatment duration of 4.6 years, 16 of 21 patients (76.2 %) achieved at least a partial platelet response: in particular, the hematological response rate was substantially comparable between JAK2-positive and ""triple-negative"" patients, whereas the five patients who did not achieve any platelet response all had CALR mutations. CONCLUSION: Although it needs to be confirmed with a larger number of ET patients treated with anagrelide, we suggest that mutational status should be considered carefully when deciding on the most appropriate therapy for each patient, mainly because anagrelide alone was not able to achieve an appropriate hematological response in CALR-mutated ET cases.",,"['Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Cattaneo, Daniele', 'Orofino, Nicola', 'Bucelli, Cristina', 'Fabris, Sonia', 'Cortelezzi, Agostino']","['Iurlo A', 'Cattaneo D', 'Orofino N', 'Bucelli C', 'Fabris S', 'Cortelezzi A']","[""Oncohematology Division, IRCCS Ca' Granda-Maggiore Policlinico Hospital Foundation and University of Milan, Via Francesco Sforza 35, 20122, Milan, Italy. aiurlo@policlinico.mi.it."", ""Oncohematology Unit of the Elderly, IRCCS Ca' Granda-Maggiore Policlinico Hospital Foundation, Milan, Italy. aiurlo@policlinico.mi.it."", ""Oncohematology Division, IRCCS Ca' Granda-Maggiore Policlinico Hospital Foundation and University of Milan, Via Francesco Sforza 35, 20122, Milan, Italy."", ""Oncohematology Division, IRCCS Ca' Granda-Maggiore Policlinico Hospital Foundation and University of Milan, Via Francesco Sforza 35, 20122, Milan, Italy."", ""Oncohematology Division, IRCCS Ca' Granda-Maggiore Policlinico Hospital Foundation and University of Milan, Via Francesco Sforza 35, 20122, Milan, Italy."", ""Oncohematology Division, IRCCS Ca' Granda-Maggiore Policlinico Hospital Foundation and University of Milan, Via Francesco Sforza 35, 20122, Milan, Italy."", ""Oncohematology Division, IRCCS Ca' Granda-Maggiore Policlinico Hospital Foundation and University of Milan, Via Francesco Sforza 35, 20122, Milan, Italy.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,BioDrugs,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",9705305,"['0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'K9X45X0051 (anagrelide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Calreticulin/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Quinazolines/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",2016/04/05 06:00,2017/01/25 06:00,['2016/04/05 06:00'],"['2016/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s40259-016-0170-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s40259-016-0170-9 [pii]']",ppublish,BioDrugs. 2016 Jun;30(3):219-23. doi: 10.1007/s40259-016-0170-9.,10.1007/s40259-016-0170-9 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adaptive changes of skeletal muscle in response to physical activity include adjustments in the production and secretion of muscle-derived bioactive factors, known as myokines, such as myostatin, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7 and IL-15, myonectin, follistatin-like 1 or leukaemia inhibitory factor. These myokines not only act locally in the muscle in an autocrine/paracrine manner, but also are released to the bloodstream as endocrine factors to regulate physiological processes in other tissues. Irisin, derived from the cleavage of FNDC5 protein, constitutes a myokine that induces myogenesis and fat browning (switch of white adipocytes to brown fat-like cells) together with a concomitant increase in energy expenditure. Besides being a target for irisin actions, the adipose tissue also constitutes a production site of FNDC5. Interestingly, irisin secretion from subcutaneous and visceral fat depots is decreased by long-term exercise training and fasting, suggesting a discordant regulation of FNDC5/irisin in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Accordingly, our group has recently reported that the adipokine leptin differentially regulates FNDC5/irisin expression in skeletal muscle and fat, confirming the crosstalk between both tissues. Moreover, irisin secretion and function are regulated by other myokines, such as follistatin or myostatin, as well as by other adipokines, including fibroblast growth factor 21 and leptin. Taken together, myokines have emerged as novel molecular mediators of fat browning and their activity can be modulated by adipokines, confirming the crosstalk between skeletal muscle and adipose tissue to regulate thermogenesis and energy expenditure.",['(c) 2016 Scandinavian Physiological Society.

Rarely, CML patients may present with a normal or mildly elevated WBC and are asymptomatic, and we describe 7 patients in this study. The WBC in these patients ranged from 3.6 to 14.3 K/mm(3) with 50% to 73% granulocytes and 0% blasts. In all patients, t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) was detected by conventional cytogenetics, and BCR-ABL1 fusion was shown, supporting the diagnosis of preleukemic CML (pre-CML). We compared these patients with a group of 5 cases of CML in chronic phase (CML-CP) and 5 bone marrow specimens with a leukemoid reaction (n=5). Reticulin, CD34, and CD61 immunostains were performed on all bone marrow biopsy specimens. Peripheral blood absolute basophilia (>/=200/mm(3)) was noted in only 4 of 7 pre-CML cases, whereas it was present in all CML-CP cases and absent in leukemoid reaction cases. The mean +/-SD of microvascular density of pre-CML cases (10.0 +/- 4.3 vessels/200x field) was twice that of leukemoid reaction cases (5.0 +/- 1.0) (P=.02; Student t test) but similar to that of CML-CP cases (12.5 +/- 3.6). Microvessels in pre-CML, highlighted by CD34, were tortuous with abnormal branching, although to a lesser extent than those found in CML-CP. Microvessels in leukemoid reaction were generally straight. The percentage of small, hypolobated megakaryocytes, highlighted by CD61 in pre-CML, was 40%, 3 times that found in leukemoid reaction cases (13%) but less than that of CML-CP cases (86%). We conclude that pre-CML should be suspected in patients with a normal to mildly elevated WBC and absolute basophilia. Bone marrow examination can usually distinguish pre-CML from a leukemoid reaction based on the percentage of small, hypolobated megakaryocytes; microvascular density; and morphologic features.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

One of the major strategies of the bsAb platform is the recruitment of immune effector T cells by incorporating an anti-CD3 domain. A bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE), with one end having an affinity for CD3 and the other end with affinity for CD19, has been approved in the US and Europe for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, due to their small size and lack of Fc region, these single-chain variable fragment (scFv) bsAbs have short half-lives in vivo. Additionally, poor solubility, structural instability, and low production yields have also become major challenges in the bulk production process. To overcome these challenges, we have engineered a tetravalent bsAb with bivalent binding specificity for the CD20 and CD3 antigen in an immunoglobulin G (IgG) format. The fusion of the anti-CD3 scFvs to the CD20 antibody via a linker-hinge domain (LHD) results in improved antibody stabilization and properties. Here we demonstrate this antibody's highly efficient cancer cell elimination in a dose-dependent manner in a CD20-expressing B lymphoblastoid cell line in vitro.

Molecular lesions of regulators of tumor suppression (TP53), cell cycle (CDKN2A), and cell proliferation (NOTCH1, MYC) overall account for ~90% of RS and may be responsible for the aggressive clinical phenotype observed in this disease because of the combined effect of chemoresistance and rapid disease kinetics.

While CDKs do play critical roles in cell cycle, including in cancer, the study of CDK inhibitors in the relatively non-proliferative disease chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) revealed alternate mechanisms both for CDKs, as well as for the role of CDK inhibitors in cancer therapy. In this review, we will consider three CDK inhibitors: alvocidib (flavopiridol), dinaciclib, and TG02.

Idelalisib is a first-in-class inhibitor of the PI3K delta isoform that shows near complete inhibition of AKT phosphorylation in CLL cells in vitro and in vivo. Idelalisib shows the classic pattern of response to BCR inhibition in CLL, with rapid nodal response and transient increase in lymphocytosis. The phase I study established the recommended dose as 150 mg twice per day. Subsequent registration trials have focused predominantly on antibody combinations, leading to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of idelalisib with rituximab for relapsed CLL patients for whom rituximab is appropriate therapy in summer 2014. The median progression-free survival (PFS) of idelalisib-rituximab in this heavily pretreated CLL population with multiple comorbidities and frequent 17p deletion was an impressive 19.4 months.

Additionally, many of these therapies have a high rate of infectious toxicity in a population already at increased risk. Targeting the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway has emerged as a promising therapeutic advance in a variety of B-cell malignancies, including CLL. Bruton agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase (Btk) is a tyrosine kinase in the BCR pathway critical to the survival of both normal and malignant B cells and inhibition of this kinase has shown to block the progression of CLL. Ibrutinib, a first in class oral inhibitor of Btk, has shown promise as a very effective agent in the treatment of CLL-in both relapsed and upfront therapy, alone and in combination with other therapies, and in patients of all-risk disease-which has led to its approval in relapsed CLL and as frontline therapy in patients with the high-risk del(17p13) disease.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs that regulate transcription and translation of genes, have been found to be involved in CLL initiation, progression, and resistance to therapy. In addition, they can be used as prognostic biomarkers and as targets for novel therapies. In this review, we describe the association between miRNAs and the cytogenetic aberrations commonly found in CLL, as well as with other prognostic factors. We describe the presence of miRNAs as extracellular entities in the plasma and serum of CLL patients and discuss their role in resistance to therapy.

According to the immunophenotype, MBL is labeled as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)-like (75% of cases), atypical CLL, and CD5-negative. Concentration of clonal B cells differentiates low- (LC) and high-count (HC)-MBL (< or >/= 0.5 x 10(9)/L, respectively). Thanks to technical improvements, we are able to identify CLL-like clonal B-cell populations at increased frequency with age, but we are still far from understanding its relationship with clinically overt CLL. LC-MBL, requiring high-throughput screening technique to be identified in population studies, seems to be a bird of a different feather and several hints suggest that LC-MBL is related to aging and/or chronic antigenic stimulation. Immunogenetic, cytogenetic and genetic data support the notion that HC-MBL, usually identified in the clinical setting, is a premalignant condition and, based on biological parameters, it is frequently difficult to differentiate it from early stage CLL. The rapid improvement and widespread availability of cutting-edge technology, in particular next-generation sequencing (NGS), raises hope that we are getting closer to unveiling the fundamental nature of MBL and CLL and how they are related to each other.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Adjusted means of the patient-reported EQ-5D index were used as quality-of-life (QOL) estimates. In 332 patients for which FLT3-ITD status was available, FLT3-ITD was present in 60. In 272 patients without FLT3-ITD, NPM1 mutations were present in 83. CEBPA biallelic mutations were detected in 53 patients. For patients harboring FLT3-ITD, allo-HCT improved life expectancy (LE) (52 versus 32 months during 10-year observation) and QOL-adjusted life expectancy (QALE, 36 versus 21). Monte-Carlo simulation identified allo-HCT as the favored strategy in 100% of simulations. In patients without FLT3-ITD, allo-HCT improved LE/QALE with or without NPM1 mutations. However, sensitivity analyses showed that the results were not robust enough. For patients harboring CEBPA biallelic mutations, chemotherapy was favored (LE, 53 versus 84; QALE, 37 versus 59), whereas, for patients with monoallelic mutations or wild-type CEBPA, allo-HCT was favored (LE, 68 versus 54; QALE, 48 versus 37). Sensitivity analyses did not change the results in either group. In conclusion, based on a Markov decision analysis, allo-HCT was a favored postremission strategy in patients with FLT3-ITD, and chemotherapy was favored in patients with biallelic CEBPA mutations. A prospective study is warranted to determine the value of allo-HCT, especially in FLT3-ITD-negative patients.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The exact reasons for this dysfunction are not fully understood. Here we show that the glycogen synthase kinase beta (GSK3beta) expression is elevated in AML-NK cells. Interestingly, GSK3 overexpression in normal NK cells impairs their ability to kill AML cells, while genetic or pharmacological GSK3 inactivation enhances their cytotoxic activity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the increased cytotoxic activity correlates with an increase in AML-NK cell conjugates. GSK3 inhibition promotes the conjugate formation by upregulating LFA expression on NK cells and by inducing ICAM-1 expression on AML cells. The latter is mediated by increased NF-kappaB activation in response to TNF-alpha production by NK cells. Finally, GSK3-inhibited NK cells show significant efficacy in human AML mouse models.

The aim of this study was to evaluate prognostic factors and survival of AML patients in the Northeast of Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study covered 96 patients with AML referred to Emam Reza Hospital, Mashhad city, Iran, from 2009 to 2015. Age, sex, blood group, type of AML, fever, consumption of amphotericin B, cytogenetic forms and survival were analyzed. Also, WBC, hemoglobin and platelet levels were checked. Mean follow-up was 30.5 months (60.4% mortality). Survival was plotted by GraphPad Prism 5 with Log-rank test. RESULTS: The mean age for all AML patients at diagnosis was 40.4 years (range, 17-77 years). Some 42.7% patients were aged <35 years and 40.6% were male. In all patients, 76% had fever and 50% consumed amphotericin. T(15;17)(q22;q21) had the most prevalence (37.7%) compared to other forms. Out of 92 patients, O+(30.4%) was the most common blood group and AML-M5 (28.3%) the most common subtype. There was a significant difference in survival based on WBC and consumption of amphotericin B (P<0.05).

MMP-2 and -9 are well known to impact on solid cancer susceptibility, whereas, in hematological malignancies, a paucity of data is available to resolve the function of these regulatory molecules in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) and stromal cells of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to investigate mRNA expression and gelatinase A and B secretion from BM-MNCs in vitro and genotypic associations of MMP-2 (-1306 C/T; rs243865), MMP-9 (-1562 C/T; rs3918242), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase -1 (TIMP-1) (372T/C; rs4898, Exon 5) and TIMP-2 (-418G/C; rs8179090) in MDS and AML. RESULTS: The study covered cases of confirmed MDS (n=50), AML (n=32) and healthy controls (n=110). MMP- 9 mRNA expression revealed 2 fold increased expression in MDS-RAEB II and 2.5 fold in AML M-4 (60-70% blasts). Secretion of gelatinase- B also revealed the MMP-9 mRNA expression and ELISA data also supported these data. We noted that those patients having more blast crises presented with more secretion of MMP-9 and its mRNA expression. In contrast MMP-9 (-1562 C/T) showed significant polymorphic associations in MDS (p<0.02) and AML (p<0.02). MMP-9 mRNA expression of C/T and T/T genotypes were 1.5 and 2.5 fold increased in MDS and AML respectively. In AML, MMP-2 C/T and T/T genotypes showed 2.0 fold mRNA expression. Only MMP-9 (-1306 C/T) showed significant 4 fold (p<0.001) increased risk with chemical and x-ray exposed MDS, while tobacco and cigarette smokers have 3 fold (p<0.04) risk in AML. CONCLUSIONS: In view of our results, MMP-9 revealed synergistic secretion and expression in blast crises of MDS and AML with 'gene' polymorphic effects and is significantly associated with increased risk with tobacco, cigarette and environmental exposure. Release and secretion of these enzymes may influence hematopoietic cell behavior and may be important in the clinical point of view.

Proactive consultation by a clinical pathologist (PCCP) may help clinical diagnosis and therapeutic strategy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January to November, 2015, abnormal results of hematological laboratory testing with added laboratory comment were selectively screened out, and patients with such abnormalities in hematological laboratory testing and accompanied laboratory comment with PCCP were enrolled. RESULTS: A total of 125 aberrant results of hematological laboratory testing were given with accompanied laboratory comments with PCCP and 40.8% (n=51) of these patient-oriented comments had an effect on clinical diagnosis and therapeutic strategy. Twelve of the subjects belonged to newly diagnosed hematological malignancies with the assistance of PCCP, and the help-seeking to diagnostic interval was also shortened from 42 days to 26 days in chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL), from 83 days to 11 days in multiple myeloma (MM), and from 128 days to 15 days in myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN). During the monitoring interval, neither complication events nor deaths were reported in the study group. CONCLUSIONS: It was seemingly that PCCP prevented diagnostic delay in hematological malignancies via shortening the help-seeking to diagnostic interval, particularly in CLL, MM and MDS/MPN cases.

Their function is to protect and aid in the delivery of viral genes to the nucleus of the host, and, in many cases, infection pathways are influenced by capsid-cellular interactions. From a mathematical perspective, capsid cores are polyhedral cages and, as such, follow well-defined geometric rules. However, marked morphological differences in shapes exist, depending on virus type. Given the specific roles of capsid in the viral life cycle, the availability of detailed molecular structures, particularly at assembly interfaces, opens novel avenues for targeted drug development against these pathogens.

Ambient air pollution has been classified as a Group 1 carcinogen, but studies have not established whether traffic-related air pollution is associated with leukemia. The goal of our study was to determine if children with acute leukemia had higher odds of exposure to traffic-related air pollution at birth compared to controls. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study using the Oklahoma Central Cancer Registry to identify cases of acute leukemia in children diagnosed before 20 years of age between 1997 and 2012 (n=307). Controls were selected from birth certificates and matched to cases on week of birth (n=1013). Using a novel satellite-based land-use regression model of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and estimating road density based on the 2010 US Census, we evaluated the association between traffic-related air pollution and childhood leukemia using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: The odds of exposure to the fourth quartile of NO2 (11.19-19.89ppb) were similar in cases compared to controls after adjustment for maternal education (OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 0.75, 1.55). These estimates were stronger among children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) than acute lymphoid leukemia, with a positive association observed among urban children with AML (4th quartile odds ratio: 5.25, 95% confidence interval: 1.09, 25.26). While we observed no significant association with road density, male cases had an elevated odds of exposure to roads at 500m from the birth residence compared to controls (OR: 1.39, 95% CI: 0.93, 2.10), which was slightly attenuated at 750m. CONCLUSIONS: Although we observed no association overall between NO2 or road density, this was the first study to observe an elevated odds of exposure to NO2 among children with AML compared to controls suggesting further exploration of traffic-related air pollution and AML is warranted.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Cytotoxicity assays indicated that K562/Adr resistance to adriamycin (ADR) did not occur in the presence of chaetominine and that chaetominine increased chemosensitivity of K562/Adr to ADR. Data show that chaetominine enhanced ADR-induced apoptosis and intracellular ADR accumulation in K562/Adr cells. Accordingly, chaetominine induced apoptosis by upregulating ROS, pro-apoptotic Bax and downregulating anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. RT-PCR and western-blot confirmed that chaetominine suppressed highly expressed MRP1 at mRNA and protein levels. But little obvious alternation of another drug transporter MDR1 mRNA was observed. Furthermore, inhibition of MRP1 by chaetominine relied on inhibiting Akt phosphorylation and nuclear Nrf2. In summary, chaetominine strongly reverses drug resistance by interfering with the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling, resulting in reduction of MRP1-mediated drug efflux and induction of Bax/Bcl-2-dependent apoptosis in an ADR-resistant K562/Adr leukemia cell line.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, patients with relapsed or refractory lymphomas still have a poor prognosis. METHODS: We report the characteristics and evolution of T-LBL and pB-LBL relapses in two multicenter prospective studies (LMT 96, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 58951). RESULTS: From 1997 to 2008, 194 patients were included in these studies (157 T-LBL; 37 pB-LBL); among them, 23 patients underwent relapse or progression (18 T-LBL and 5 pB-LBL). The median age was 7.7 years (range 1.4-16.3). The survival rate at 8 years was 8.7% (21 deaths). The median time from diagnosis to relapse was 9 months [1-69] and 11 months [1-45] for T-LBL and pB-LBL, respectively. Twenty-two patients received a second-line treatment but remission was achieved in only seven patients. In 10 patients, intensification with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed and four of them had a second relapse. Two patients still alive had T-LBL, experienced relapses 15 and 69 months after diagnosis, and received HSCT. Relapse during the intensive phase and second-line treatment without HSCT were identified as risk factors for bad prognosis (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The results of second-line treatment, including intensive chemotherapy and HSCT, show that salvage treatment is still disappointing in controlling refractory forms. Early identification of patients at high risk of relapse is mandatory, allowing earlier intensification. Valid prognostic parameters, such as biological markers, are needed. International cooperation is warranted to collect more data on these rare diagnoses.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Michaux, Katell', 'Bergeron, Christophe', 'Gandemer, Virginie', 'Mechinaud, Francoise', 'Uyttebroeck, Anne', 'Bertrand, Yves']","['Michaux K', 'Bergeron C', 'Gandemer V', 'Mechinaud F', 'Uyttebroeck A', 'Bertrand Y']","['Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Department (IHOP), Hospices Civils de Lyon and Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Department (IHOP), Hospices Civils de Lyon and Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.', 'Pediatric Hematology Department, University Hospital, Rennes, France.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Department, University Hospital, Nantes, France.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Department, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Department (IHOP), Hospices Civils de Lyon and Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.', 'Pediatric Hematology Department, University Hospital, Rennes, France.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Department, University Hospital, Nantes, France.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Department, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20160401,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Allografts', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*mortality/*therapy', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*mortality/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",2016/04/03 06:00,2017/03/18 06:00,['2016/04/03 06:00'],"['2015/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/25 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25990 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Jul;63(7):1214-21. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25990.

We hypothesized that circulating absolute monocyte count (AMC) reflects the monocyte-derived cells in the microenvironment, and that higher AMC is associated with increased CLL cell survival in vivo and thus inferior CLL patient outcomes. We assessed the extent to which AMC at diagnosis of CLL is correlated with clinical outcomes, and whether this information adds to currently used prognostic markers. We evaluated AMC, clinically used prognostic markers, and time to event data from 1,168 CLL patients followed at the Mayo Clinic, the Duke University Medical Center, and the Durham VA Medical Center. Elevated AMC was significantly associated with inferior clinical outcomes, including time to first therapy (TTT) and overall survival (OS). AMC combined with established clinical and molecular prognostic markers significantly improved risk-stratification of CLL patients for TTT. As an elevated AMC at diagnosis is associated with accelerated disease progression, and monocyte-derived cells in the CLL microenvironment promote CLL cell survival and proliferation, these findings suggest that monocytes and monocyte-derived cells are rational therapeutic targets in CLL.

Identification of targetable mutations and pathway dysregulation through massively parallel sequencing and functional assays provides new approaches to disease management. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we report the case of a 23-year-old male who was diagnosed with a mediastinal germ cell tumor and subsequent acute myeloid leukemia. A shared clonal origin was demonstrated through identification of identical NRAS and TP53 somatic mutations in both malignancies. The patient's leukemia was refractory to standard therapies with short interval relapse. Functional assays demonstrated the patient's blasts to be sensitive to the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor trametinib, correlating with the activating NRAS mutation. The patient experienced a sustained partial remission while on trametinib therapy but ultimately suffered relapse of the germ cell tumor. The leukemic clone remained stable and sensitive to trametinib at that time.

We conducted a prospective phase II clinical trial with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (3 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1), all-trans retinoic acid (45 mg/m(2) orally on days 4-6 and 15 mg/m(2) orally on days 7-28), high-dose cytarabine (3 g/m(2)/12 h intravenously on days 1-3) and mitoxantrone (12 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 2-3) in 93 patients aged 18-60 years refractory to one cycle of induction therapy. Primary end point of the study was response to therapy; secondary end points included evaluation of toxicities, in particular, rate of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Complete remission or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery was achieved in 47 (51%) and partial remission in 10 (11%) patients resulting in an overall response rate of 61.5%; 33 (35.5%) patients had refractory disease and 3 patients (3%) died. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation was performed in 71 (76%) patients; 6 of the 71 (8.5%) patients developed moderate or severe sinusoidal obstruction syndrome after transplantation. Four-year overall survival rate was 32% (95% confidence interval 24%-43%). Patients responding to salvage therapy and undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (n=51) had a 4-year survival rate of 49% (95% confidence intervaI 37%-64%). Patients with fms-like tyrosine kinase internal tandem duplication positive acute myeloid leukemia had a poor outcome despite transplantation. In conclusion, the described regimen is an effective and tolerable salvage therapy for patients who are primary refractory to one cycle of conventional intensive induction therapy.

Adult MSC are finite and their clinical use is restricted by the need for long-term expansion protocols that can lead to genomic instability. Inhibition of Smad2/3 signaling in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) provides an infinite source of MSC that match the phenotype and functional properties of adult MSC. Here, we test the therapeutic potential of hPSC-MSC of embryonic origin (embryonic stem cell-derived mesenchymal stromal cells, hESC-MSC) in the experimental model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). METHODS: CIA was induced in DBA/1 mice by immunization with type II collagen (CII) in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA). Mice were treated with either a single dose (10(6) cells/mouse) of hESC-MSC on the day of immunization (prophylaxis) or with three doses of hESC-MSC every other day starting on the day of arthritis onset (therapy). Arthritis severity was evaluated daily for six weeks and ten days, respectively. Frequency of Treg (FoxP3(+)), Th1 (IFNgamma(+)) and Th17 (IL17(+)) CD4(+) T cells in inguinal lymph nodes (ILN) was quantified by flow cytometry. Serum levels of anti-CII antibodies were determined by ELISA. Detection of hESC-MSC and quantification of murine and human indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO1) expression was performed by quantitative real-time PCR. Statistical differences were analyzed by ANOVA and the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Administration of hESC-MSC to mice with established arthritis reduced disease severity compared to control-treated mice. Analysis of CD4 T cell populations in treated mice showed an increase in FoxP3(+) Treg and IFNgamma(+) Th1 cells but not in Th17 cells in the ILN.

Paradoxically, arsenic trioxide (ATO) presents also a powerful therapy used to treat refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and is intensively investigated for treatment of other cancer types. Noteworthy, cancer therapy is frequently hampered by drug resistance, which is also often associated with enhancement of tumor aggressiveness. In this study, we analyzed ATO-selected cancer cells (A2780ATO) for the mechanisms underlying their enhanced tumorigenicity and aggressiveness. These cells were characterized by enhanced proliferation and spheroid growth as well as increased tumorigenicity of xenografts in SCID mice. Noteworthy, subsequent studies revealed that overexpression of Met receptor was the underlying oncogenic driver of these effects, as A2780ATO cells were characterized by collateral sensitivity against Met inhibitors. This finding was also confirmed by array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) and whole genome gene expression arrays, which revealed that Met overexpression by chronic ATO exposure was based on the transcriptional regulation via activation of AP-1. Finally, it was shown that treatment with the Met inhibitor crizotinib was also effective against A2780ATO cell xenografts in vivo, indicating that targeting of Met presents a promising strategy for the treatment of Met-overexpressing tumors after either arsenic exposure or failure to ATO treatment.",,"['Kryeziu, Kushtrim', 'Pirker, Christine', 'Englinger, Bernhard', 'van Schoonhoven, Sushilla', 'Spitzwieser, Melanie', 'Mohr, Thomas', 'Korner, Wilfried', 'Weinmullner, Regina', 'Tav, Koray', 'Grillari, Johannes', 'Cichna-Markl, Margit', 'Berger, Walter', 'Heffeter, Petra']","['Kryeziu K', 'Pirker C', 'Englinger B', 'van Schoonhoven S', 'Spitzwieser M', 'Mohr T', 'Korner W', 'Weinmullner R', 'Tav K', 'Grillari J', 'Cichna-Markl M', 'Berger W', 'Heffeter P']","['Department of Medicine I, Institute of Cancer Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Research Platform ""Translational Cancer Therapy Research"", Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Institute of Cancer Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Institute of Cancer Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Institute of Cancer Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Analytical Chemistry, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Institute of Cancer Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Environmental Geosciences, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Christian Doppler Laboratory on Biotechnology of Skin Aging, Department of Biotechnology, University of Natural Resources and Applied Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Christian Doppler Laboratory on Biotechnology of Skin Aging, Department of Biotechnology, University of Natural Resources and Applied Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Christian Doppler Laboratory on Biotechnology of Skin Aging, Department of Biotechnology, University of Natural Resources and Applied Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Evercyte GmbH, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Analytical Chemistry, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Institute of Cancer Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Research Platform ""Translational Cancer Therapy Research"", Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Institute of Cancer Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Research Platform ""Translational Cancer Therapy Research"", Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '53AH36668S (Crizotinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (MET protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Crizotinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/methods']",2016/04/02 06:00,2017/12/12 06:00,['2016/04/02 06:00'],"['2016/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['8415 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.8415 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 May 10;7(19):27379-93. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.8415.,10.18632/oncotarget.8415 [doi],,,PMC5053657,"['Johannes Grillari is co-founder and CSO of Evercyte GmbH, the company, which', 'provided the data on the immortalized keratinocytes.

These discrepancies may be at least in part explained by the differences in disease categories, disease status at transplant, donor type and conditioning. The current retrospective EBMT registry study aimed to analyze the impact of CD3+ and CD34+ cells dose on the outcome of RIC allo-PBSCT in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in first complete remission, allografted from HLA-matched unrelated donors (10 of 10 match). We included 203 adults. In univariate analysis, patients transplanted with the highest CD3+ and CD34+ doses (above the third quartile cut-off point values, >347 x 10^6/kg and >8.25 x 10^6 /kg, respectively) had an increased incidence of grade III-IV acute (a) GVHD (20% vs. 6%, P = .003 and 18% vs. 7%, P = .02, respectively). There was no association between cellular composition of grafts and transplant-related mortality, AML relapse, incidence of chronic GVHD and survival. Neither engraftment itself nor the kinetics of engraftment were affected by the cell dose. In multivariate analysis, CD3+ and CD34+ doses were the only adverse predicting factors for grade III-IV aGVHD (HR = 3.6; 95%CI: 1.45-9.96, P = .006 and 2.65 (1.07-6.57), P = .04, respectively).

PRL-3 is a phosphatase induced by interleukin (IL)-6 and other growth factors in MM cells and promotes MM-cell migration.

In this study we found that forced expression of PRL-3 in the MM cell line INA-6 led to increased survival of cells that were depleted of IL-6. It also caused redistribution of cells in cell cycle, with an increased number of cells in G2M-phase. Furthermore, forced PRL-3 expression significantly increased phosphorylation of Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 both in the presence and the absence of IL-6. Knockdown of PRL-3 with shRNA reduced survival in MM cell line INA-6. A pharmacological inhibitor of PRL-3 reduced survival in the MM cell lines INA-6, ANBL-6, IH-1, OH-2 and RPMI8226. The inhibitor also reduced survival in 9 of 9 consecutive samples of purified primary myeloma cells. Treatment with the inhibitor down-regulated the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 and led to activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.

PET probes for dCK have been developed and are effective in mice but have suboptimal specificity and sensitivity in humans. To identify a more suitable probe for clinical dCK PET imaging, we compared the selectivity of two candidate compounds-[(18)F]Clofarabine; 2-chloro-2'-deoxy-2'-[(18)F]fluoro-9-beta-d-arabinofuranosyl-adenine ([(18)F]CFA) and 2'-deoxy-2'-[(18)F]fluoro-9-beta-d-arabinofuranosyl-guanine ([(18)F]F-AraG)-for dCK and deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK), a dCK-related mitochondrial enzyme. We demonstrate that, in the tracer concentration range used for PET imaging, [(18)F]CFA is primarily a substrate for dCK, with minimal cross-reactivity. In contrast, [(18)F]F-AraG is a better substrate for dGK than for dCK. [(18)F]CFA accumulation in leukemia cells correlated with dCK expression and was abrogated by treatment with a dCK inhibitor. Although [(18)F]CFA uptake was reduced by deoxycytidine (dC) competition, this inhibition required high dC concentrations present in murine, but not human, plasma. Expression of cytidine deaminase, a dC-catabolizing enzyme, in leukemia cells both in cell culture and in mice reduced the competition between dC and [(18)F]CFA, leading to increased dCK-dependent probe accumulation. First-in-human, to our knowledge, [(18)F]CFA PET/CT studies showed probe accumulation in tissues with high dCK expression: e.g., hematopoietic bone marrow and secondary lymphoid organs. The selectivity of [(18)F]CFA for dCK and its favorable biodistribution in humans justify further studies to validate [(18)F]CFA PET as a new cancer biomarker for treatment stratification and monitoring.",,"['Kim, Woosuk', 'Le, Thuc M', 'Wei, Liu', 'Poddar, Soumya', 'Bazzy, Jimmy', 'Wang, Xuemeng', 'Uong, Nhu T', 'Abt, Evan R', 'Capri, Joseph R', 'Austin, Wayne R', 'Van Valkenburgh, Juno S', 'Steele, Dalton', 'Gipson, Raymond M', 'Slavik, Roger', 'Cabebe, Anthony E', 'Taechariyakul, Thotsophon', 'Yaghoubi, Shahriar S', 'Lee, Jason T', 'Sadeghi, Saman', 'Lavie, Arnon', 'Faull, Kym F', 'Witte, Owen N', 'Donahue, Timothy R', 'Phelps, Michael E', 'Herschman, Harvey R', 'Herrmann, Ken', 'Czernin, Johannes', 'Radu, Caius G']","['Kim W', 'Le TM', 'Wei L', 'Poddar S', 'Bazzy J', 'Wang X', 'Uong NT', 'Abt ER', 'Capri JR', 'Austin WR', 'Van Valkenburgh JS', 'Steele D', 'Gipson RM', 'Slavik R', 'Cabebe AE', 'Taechariyakul T', 'Yaghoubi SS', 'Lee JT', 'Sadeghi S', 'Lavie A', 'Faull KF', 'Witte ON', 'Donahue TR', 'Phelps ME', 'Herschman HR', 'Herrmann K', 'Czernin J', 'Radu CG']","['Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095;

Autophagy has recently attracted increasing attention for its role in conferring resistance to various conventional anti-neoplastic regiments. In the present study, the authors showed that WAVE1, a member of WASP family verprolin-homologous proteins, is a critical regulator of chemoresistance during autophagy. It is positively correlated with clinical status in pediatric acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and leukemia cell lines. The knockdown of WAVE1 expression decreased autophagy was accompanied by an upregulation of autophagic marker microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-, a degradation of SQSTM1/sequestosome 1 (p62) and the formation of autophagosomes. Moreover, a suppression of WAVE1 expression increased the sensitivity of leukemia cells to chemotherapy and apoptosis, and depletion of WAVE1 expression promoted the translocation of Bcl-2 from mitochondria into the cytoplasm. In addition, a knockdown of PI3K- expression significantly inhibited WAVE1-mediated autophagy. Furthermore, suppression of WAVE1 expression blocked the interactions between Beclin1 and PI3K- and the disassociation of Beclin1-Bcl-2 during enhanced autophagy. The above results suggested that WAVE1 is a critical pro-autophagic protein capable of enhancing cell survival and regulating chemoresistance in leukemia cells potentially through the Beclin1/Bcl-2 and Beclin1/PI3K- complex-dependent pathways.",,"['Zhang, Zhaoxia', 'Wu, Benqing', 'Chai, Wenwen', 'Cao, Lizhi', 'Wang, Yangping', 'Yu, Yan', 'Yang, Liangchun']","['Zhang Z', 'Wu B', 'Chai W', 'Cao L', 'Wang Y', 'Yu Y', 'Yang L']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Shenzhen People's Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518020, P.R.

To further elucidate the role of NE in acute promyelocytic leukemia, the present study successfully constructed a lentiviral vector containing the NE gene (LV5NE), which was transfected into NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. The effects of NE overexpression in NB4 cells were detected using a Cell-Counting Kit8 assay, flow cytometry and western blot analysis. The results showed that NE significantly promoted the proliferation of NB4 cells, inhibited cell apoptosis and apoptotic signaling, and led the activation of Akt. In an additional experiment, a vector expressing small hairpin RNA targeting NE was constructed to assess the effects of NE knockdown in U937 cells. Western blot analysis revealed that apoptotic signaling was increased, while Akt activation was decreased following silencing of NE. The results of the present study may indicate that NE activates the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt signaling pathway in leukemia cells to inhibit apoptosis and enhance cell proliferation, and may therefore represent a molecular target for the treatment of promyelocytic leukemia.",,"['Yang, Rong', 'Zhong, Liang', 'Yang, Xiao-Qun', 'Jiang, Kai-Ling', 'Li, Liu', 'Song, Hao', 'Liu, Bei-Zhong']","['Yang R', 'Zhong L', 'Yang XQ', 'Jiang KL', 'Li L', 'Song H', 'Liu BZ']","['Central Laboratory of YongChuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, P.R.

Uterine decidualization supports embryo implantation and placentation as well as subsequent events, which together ensure a successful pregnancy. Accordingly, impaired decidualization results not only in implantation failure or early fetal miscarriage, but also may lead to potential adverse outcomes in all three pregnancy trimesters. Transcriptional reprogramming on a genome-wide scale underlies progesterone dependent decidualization of the human endometrial stromal cell (hESC). However, identification of the functionally essential signals encoded by these global transcriptional changes remains incomplete. Importantly, this knowledge-gap undercuts future efforts to improve diagnosis and treatment of implantation failure based on a dysfunctional endometrium. By integrating genome-wide datasets derived from decidualization of hESCs in culture, we reveal that the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) transcription factor is rapidly induced by progesterone and that this induction is indispensable for progesterone-dependent decidualization. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) identified at least ten progesterone response elements within the PLZF gene, indicating that PLZF may act as a direct target of PGR signaling. The spatiotemporal expression profile for PLZF in both the human and mouse endometrium offers further support for stromal PLZF as a mediator of the progesterone decidual signal. To identify functional targets of PLZF, integration of PLZF ChIP-Seq and RNA Pol II RNA-Seq datasets revealed that the early growth response 1 (EGR1) transcription factor is a PLZF target for which its level of expression must be reduced to enable progesterone dependent hESC decidualization. Apart from furnishing essential insights into the molecular mechanisms by which progesterone drives hESC decidualization, our findings provide a new conceptual framework that could lead to new avenues for diagnosis and/or treatment of adverse reproductive outcomes associated with a dysfunctional uterus.",,"['Kommagani, Ramakrishna', 'Szwarc, Maria M', 'Vasquez, Yasmin M', 'Peavey, Mary C', 'Mazur, Erik C', 'Gibbons, William E', 'Lanz, Rainer B', 'DeMayo, Francesco J', 'Lydon, John P']","['Kommagani R', 'Szwarc MM', 'Vasquez YM', 'Peavey MC', 'Mazur EC', 'Gibbons WE', 'Lanz RB', 'DeMayo FJ', 'Lydon JP']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Houston Fertility Specialists, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160401,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,"['0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Progestins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Decidua/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1/genetics', 'Endometrium/*cytology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Progestins/pharmacology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Receptors, Progesterone/physiology', 'Stromal Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology']",2016/04/02 06:00,2016/08/27 06:00,['2016/04/02 06:00'],"['2015/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1005937 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-15-02812 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Genet. 2016 Apr 1;12(4):e1005937. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005937. eCollection 2016 Apr.,10.1371/journal.pgen.1005937 [doi],,,PMC4817989,,,,,,"['K99 HD080742/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK079638/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD042311/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Secondary neoplasms (SNs) in childhood ALL have been widely reported. However, only one study has demonstrated SNs in adult ALL. Because of the poorer survival of adult ALL, the incidence might be underestimated. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence and risk factors of secondary solid organ neoplasms among adult and child ALL patients. METHODS: Newly diagnosed ALL patients between 1997 and 2011 were recruited from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database. Those who had antecedent or combined malignancies were excluded. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were analyzed to compare the risk of our cohort to general population in the same age, sex and calendar year. Risk factors for SN development were analyzed by Cox proportional hazards models. Effects of treatments were treated as time-dependent variables. RESULTS: The 15-year cumulative incidence of SN was 1.9% and 8.4% in 1,381 child and 2,154 adult ALL patients, respectively. The SIR was significantly increased in child ALL (SIR 6.06), but not in adult ALL (SIR 1.16). The SIRs of follow-up periods were 5.14, 2.24, .87 and .71 at >/= 10 years, 5-10 years, 1-5 years and 0-1, respectively. Overall, 15 SNs developed, and CNS tumors (SIR 11.56) were the most common type. Multivariate analysis showed that age >/= 20 years (hazard ratio [HR] 5.04), end-stage renal disease (HR 18.98) and cranial irradiation (HR 8.12) were independent risk factors for cancer development. CONCLUSIONS: When compared with the general population, child ALL shows a increased risk of developing SNs. CNS tumors are the most common type, and cranial irradiation is an independent risk factor. With longer follow-up, the risk of SNs increases. Hence, physicians need to pay more attention on the risk of developing SNs in long-term ALL survivors with risk factors.",,"['Teng, Chung-Jen', 'Huon, Leh-Kiong', 'Hu, Yu-Wen', 'Yeh, Chiu-Mei', 'Chien, Sheng-Hsuan', 'Chen, San-Chi', 'Liu, Chia-Jen']","['Teng CJ', 'Huon LK', 'Hu YW', 'Yeh CM', 'Chien SH', 'Chen SC', 'Liu CJ']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, Cathay General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, Fu Jen Catholic University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Cancer Center, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Family Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Public Health, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160401,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Risk Factors', 'Taiwan/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/02 06:00,2016/08/30 06:00,['2016/04/02 06:00'],"['2015/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0152909 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-35977 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Apr 1;11(4):e0152909. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0152909. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0152909 [doi],,,PMC4817987,,,,,,,,,,['PLoS One. 2016;11(8):e0162225.

The high expression and constitutive activation of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance protein-1 (MRP-1) have been reported to play a vital role in enhancing cell resistance to anticancer drugs in many tumors. The present study aimed to investigate the reversal of MDR by silencing homeobox A10 (HOXA10) in adriamycin (ADR)-resistant human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) K562/ADM cells by modulating the expression of P-gp and MRP-1. K562/ADM cells were stably transfected with HOXA10-targeted short hairpin RNA (shRNA). The results of reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis showed that the mRNA and protein expression of HOXA10 was markedly suppressed following transfection with a shRNA-containing vector. The sensitivity of the K562/ADM cells to ADR was enhanced by the silencing of HOXA10, due to the increased intracellular accumulation of ADR. The accumulation of ADR induced by the silencing of HOXA10 may be due to the downregulation of P-gp and MRP-1. Western blot analysis revealed that downregulating HOXA10 inhibited the protein expression of P-gp and MRP-1. Taken together, these results suggest that knockdown of HOXA10 combats resistance and that HOXA10 is a potential target for resistant human CML.",,"['Yi, Ying-Jie', 'Jia, Xiu-Hong', 'Wang, Jian-Yong', 'Li, You-Jie', 'Wang, Hong', 'Xie, Shu-Yang']","['Yi YJ', 'Jia XH', 'Wang JY', 'Li YJ', 'Wang H', 'Xie SY']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Hospital of Binzhou Medical University, Binzhou, Shandong 256603, P.R.

In the present study, a eukaryotic SET expression plasmid (pEGFPN1SET) was constructed and transiently transfected into 293T human embryonic kidney cells. Transfection led to expression of the SET oncoprotein at high levels, as indicated by polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. In addition, the relative mRNA and protein expression of protein phosphatase 2A in pEGFPN1SETtransfected 293T cells was downregulated compared with that in empty vectortransfected cells. Furthermore, overexpression of SET increased the percentage of 293T cells in S and G2/M phases compared with the control transfectants. An increase in Bcell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) and a decrease in Bcl2associated X (Bax) protein expression was observed in the pEGFPN1SETtransfected cells compared with that in the controls, and their susceptibility to As4S4induced apoptosis was decreased. The protein SET is involved in a number of cellular processes, including DNA replication, chromatin remodeling, gene transcription, differentiation, migration and cell cycle regulation.

Increasing evidence suggests that podoplanin may support the growth and metastasis of solid tumors; however, to the best of our knowledge no studies have determined whether or not podoplanin serves a supportive role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The effects of coculture with podoplanin+ cells on the cellular activities of the leukemic cells, such as apoptosis and cell proliferation, in addition to the expression of podoplanin in leukemic cells, were investigated. Due to the fact that genetic abnormalities are the primary cause of leukemogenesis, the overexpression of the fibromyalgialike tyrosine kinase3 gene in colony forming units was also examined following cell sorting. Podoplanin+ cells were found to play a protective role against apoptosis in leukemic cells and to promote cell proliferation. Tumorassociated antigens, including Wilms' tumor gene 1 and survivin, were increased when leukemic cells were cocultured with podoplanin+ cells.

Intriguingly, MAP30-induced cell death and apoptosis were partially rescued in combination with an autophagy activator rapamycin, and aggravated in combination with an autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 in HL-60 cells, suggesting that autophagy is a pro-survival signal and its inhibition contributes to the induction of apoptosis in MAP30induced cell death. Further mechanism analysis demonstrated that MAP30 enhanced p300, and C646, a selective inhibitor of p300, markedly promoted autophagy and partially rescued the MAP30-induced cell death in HL-60 cells and patient AML cells.

This protocol is using THP-1 cells, a human leukemia monocytic cell line that can be differentiated into macrophages. This allows studying the effects of the macrophage secretome on cancer cells (on e.g. growth, drug response or gene expression) in co-cultures without direct cell contact interactions. This is an important aspect as it removes the presence of any phagocytic aspect to changes in the cancer cell number and behaviour. The in vitro THP-1 monocyte differentiation into polarized macrophages was used to study the effects of both M1 and M2 type populations of macrophages on melanoma cells (Smith et al., 2014; Tsuchiya et al., 1980). M1 type macrophages are classically thought to be tumour suppressing as opposed to M2 type macrophages, which are thought to possess tissue repairing and tumour growth promoting activities.",,"['Smith, Michael P', 'Young, Helen', 'Hurlstone, Adam', 'Wellbrock, Claudia']","['Smith MP', 'Young H', 'Hurlstone A', 'Wellbrock C']","['Manchester Cancer Research Centre, Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Matrix Research, Faculty of Life Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Manchester Cancer Research Centre, Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Matrix Research, Faculty of Life Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Manchester Cancer Research Centre, Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Matrix Research, Faculty of Life Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Manchester Cancer Research Centre, Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Matrix Research, Faculty of Life Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Bio Protoc,Bio-protocol,101635102,,,,2016/04/02 06:00,2016/04/02 06:01,['2016/04/02 06:00'],"['2016/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.21769/bioprotoc.1638 [doi]'],ppublish,Bio Protoc. 2015 May 11;5(21). doi: 10.21769/bioprotoc.1638.,e1638 [pii],,,PMC4811304,,,,,,['A16416/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,['EMS67601'],,,,,,,,,

The goal of this study was to develop a nanoparticle system for delivery of ASO G3139, which targets mRNA of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. The synthesized nanoparticle Tf-LPN-G3139 contained a small molecular weight polyethylenimine and two cationic lipids as condensing agents, with transferrin on its surface for selective binding and enhanced cellular uptake. The optimized nitrogen to phosphate (N/P) ratio was 4 to achieve small particle size and high G3139 entrapment efficiency. The Tf-LPN-G3139 exhibited excellent colloidal stability during storage for at least 12 weeks and remained intact for 4 hours in nuclease-containing serum. The cellular uptake results showed extensive internalization of fluorescence-labelled G3139 in MV4-11 cells through Tf-LPN. Following transfection, Tf-LPN-G3139 at 1 microM ASO level induced 54% Bcl-2 downregulation and >20-fold apoptosis compared to no treatment. When evaluated in mice bearing human xenograft AML tumors, Tf-LPN-G3139 suppressed tumor growth by ~60% at the end of treatment period, accompanied by remarkable pharmacological effect of Bcl-2 inhibition in tumor. In conclusion, Tf-LPN-G3139 is a promising nanoparticle system for ASO G3139 delivery to AML and warrants further investigations.",,"['Yuan, Yiming', 'Zhang, Lijing', 'Cao, Hua', 'Yang, Yi', 'Zheng, Yu', 'Yang, Xiao-juan']","['Yuan Y', 'Zhang L', 'Cao H', 'Yang Y', 'Zheng Y', 'Yang XJ']","['Department of Geriatric Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160126,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Lipids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transferrin)', '9002-98-6 (Polyethyleneimine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lipids/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Mice', 'Nanoparticles/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*administration & dosage/genetics', 'Polyethyleneimine/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Transferrin/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2016/04/02 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/04/02 06:00'],"['2015/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2016/1287128 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2016;2016:1287128. doi: 10.1155/2016/1287128.

The human T-cell lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2 (HTLV 1/2) are retroviruses associated with different pathologies. HTLV-1 causes adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP); HTLV-2 is not clearly associated with a known clinical disease. Both viruses may be transmitted by whole blood transfusion, from mother to child predominantly through breastfeeding, and by sexual contact. Presently, none of the regional blood banks in Uganda perform routine pretransfusion screening for HTLV. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of anti-human T-cell lymphotropic virus types 1/2 (HTLV-1/2) antibodies among blood donors at Mbarara Regional Blood Bank in South Western Uganda. A cross-sectional study was conducted between June 2014 and September 2014. Methodology. Consecutive blood samples of 368 blood donors were screened for anti-HTLV-1/2 antibodies using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Samples reactive on a first HTLV-1/2 ELISA were further retested in duplicate using the same ELISA. Of the three hundred and sixty-eight blood donors (229 (62.2%) males and 139 (37.8%) females), only two male donors aged 20 and 21 years were HTLV-1/2 seropositive, representing a prevalence of 0.54%.

Alternative options such as unrelated umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation and haploidentical HSCT have been increasingly studied in the past few decades to overcome these obstacles. A human leukocyte antigen- (HLA-) haploidentical donor is a recipient's relative who shares an exact haplotype with the recipient but is mismatched for HLA genes on the unshared haplotype. These dissimilarities pose several challenges to the outcomes of the patient receiving such a type of HSCT, including higher rates of bidirectional alloreactivity and graft failure. In the past 5 years, however, several nonrandomized studies have shown promising results in terms of graft success and decreased rates of alloreactivity, in part due to newer grafting techniques and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis.

Altogether, these results identified the co-occurrence of mutations in CSF3R and CEBPA in a well-defined AML subset, which uniformly responds to JAK inhibitors and paves the way to personalized clinical trials for this disease.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Lavallee, Vincent-Philippe', 'Krosl, Jana', 'Lemieux, Sebastien', 'Boucher, Genevieve', 'Gendron, Patrick', 'Pabst, Caroline', 'Boivin, Isabel', 'Marinier, Anne', 'Guidos, Cynthia J', 'Meloche, Sylvain', 'Hebert, Josee', 'Sauvageau, Guy']","['Lavallee VP', 'Krosl J', 'Lemieux S', 'Boucher G', 'Gendron P', 'Pabst C', 'Boivin I', 'Marinier A', 'Guidos CJ', 'Meloche S', 'Hebert J', 'Sauvageau G']","['The Leucegene Project at Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada; Division of Hematology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada;', 'The Leucegene Project at Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada;', 'The Leucegene Project at Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada; Department of Computer Science and Operations Research, and.', 'The Leucegene Project at Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada;', 'The Leucegene Project at Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada;', 'The Leucegene Project at Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada;', 'The Leucegene Project at Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada;', 'The Leucegene Project at Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada; Department of Chemistry, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada;', 'Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada;', 'Department of Pharmacology, and Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada;', 'The Leucegene Project at Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada; Division of Hematology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada; Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada; and Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'The Leucegene Project at Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada; Division of Hematology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada; Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada; and Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160331,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (CSF3R protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Frequency', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Precision Medicine', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/02 06:00,2017/08/03 06:00,['2016/04/02 06:00'],"['2016/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34468-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-03-705053 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jun 16;127(24):3054-61. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-03-705053.

However, limited information is available regarding the spatial distribution and phenotypic characterization of major rabbit leukocyte populations in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues. Herein, we describe the spatial distribution and phenotypic characterization of leukocytes from gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) from 12-week-old New Zealand White rabbits. Our data indicate that rabbits have similar distribution of leukocyte subsets as humans, both in the GALT inductive and effector sites and in mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and peripheral blood. GALT inductive sites, including appendix, cecal tonsil, Peyer's patches, and ileocecal plaque, had variable B cell/T cell ratios (ranging from 4.0 to 0.8) with a predominance of CD4 T cells within the T cell population in all four tissues. Intraepithelial and lamina propria compartments contained mostly T cells, with CD4 T cells predominating in the lamina propria compartment and CD8 T cells predominating in the intraepithelial compartment. Mesenteric lymph node, peripheral blood, and splenic samples contained approximately equal percentages of B cells and T cells, with a high proportion of CD4 T cells compared with CD8 T cells. Collectively, our data indicate that New Zealand White rabbits are comparable with humans throughout their GALT and support future studies that use the rabbit model to study human gut-associated disease or infectious agents that gain entry by the oral route.","['(c) The Author 2016.

Infection in domestic cats leads to immune dysfunction via mechanisms similar to those caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and, as such, is a valuable natural animal model for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans. An association between FIV and an increased incidence of neoplasia has long been recognized, with frequencies of up to 20% in FIV-positive cats recorded in some studies. This is similar to the rate of neoplasia seen in HIV-positive individuals, and in both species neoplasia typically requires several years to arise. The most frequently reported type of neoplasia associated with FIV infection is lymphoma. Here we review the possible mechanisms involved in FIV lymphomagenesis, including the possible involvement of coinfections, notably those with gamma-herpesviruses.","['(c) The Author 2016.

The various stages of HTLV-I infection and leukemia development are studied by using several different animal models: (1) the rabbit (and mouse) model of persistent HTLV-I infection, (2) transgenic mice to model tumorigenesis by HTLV-I specific protein expression, (3) ATL cell transfers into immune-deficient mice, and (4) infection of humanized mice with HTLV-I. After infection, virus replicates without clinical disease in rabbits and to a lesser extent in mice. Transgenic expression of both the transactivator protein (Tax) and the HTLV-I bZIP factor (HBZ) protein have provided insight into factors important in leukemia/lymphoma development. To investigate factors relating to tumor spread and tissue invasion, a number of immune-deficient mice based on the severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) or non-obese diabetic/SCID background have been used. Inoculation of adult T cell leukemia cell (lines) leads to lymphoma with osteolytic bone lesions and to a lesser degree to leukemia development. These mice have been used extensively for the testing of anticancer drugs and virotherapy. A recent development is the use of so-called humanized mice, which, upon transfer of CD34(+)human umbilical cord stem cells, generate human lymphocytes. Infection with HTLV-I leads to leukemia/lymphoma development, thus providing an opportunity to investigate disease development with the aid of molecularly cloned viruses. However, further improvements of this mouse model, particularly in respect to the development of adaptive immune responses, are necessary.","['(c) The Author 2016.

METHODS: From April 2009 to September 2015, 103 consecutive hospitalized 60-plus-year-old AML patients were retrospectively analyzed. NPM1 positive FLT3-ITD negative accounted for 17 cases (16.7%). Sixty-five patients received MA regimen and thirty-eight patients received CAG regimen. MA group had higher WBC and FLT3-ITD positive mutations at diagnosis compared with CAG group (P=0.001, P=0.005; respectively). The median follow-up was 13 months for all patients and 17 months for the survivors. RESULTS: Six patient (5.8%) died in early phase. Complete remission (CR) rate after the first cycle of induction chemotherapy was 51.5% (50/97). Overall CR rate was 70.1% (68/97). CR rate after the first cycle of induction chemotherapy and overall CR rate were indiscriminate between MA and CAG regimen. The time to neutrophil count recovery, the time to platelet count recovery and the number of platelet transfusions were indiscriminate between MA and CAG regimen.

OS rate at 3 years was 32.2%. Median disease-free survival (DFS) was 28 months. DFS rate at 3 years was 43.7%. CIR, DFS and OS at 3 years were indiscriminate between MA and CAG regimen. Multivariate analysis showed that less than 70 years of age (P=0.001), achieved CR (P<0.001), and NPM1 (+) FLT3-ITD(-) mutation (P=0.044) were the independent factors for increasing OS. NPM1(+) FLT3-ITD(-) mutation was the independent factor for increasing DFS (P=0.042). Patients were classified by three prognosis factors: <70 ages, CR, and NPM1(+)FLT3-ITD(-) mutation. Patients with no poor prognosis factors were classified as low risk (n=13), with one factor as medium risk (n=52) and with two and more factors as high risk (n=31).

The successful use of doxorubicin has, however, been hampered by severe cardiotoxic side-effects. In order to prevent or reverse negative side-effects of doxorubicin, it is important to find early biomarkers of heart injury and drug-induced cardiotoxicity. The high stability under extreme conditions, presence in various body fluids, and tissue-specificity, makes microRNAs very suitable as clinical biomarkers. The present study aimed towards evaluating the early and late effects of doxorubicin on the microRNA expression in cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells. We report on several microRNAs, including miR-34a, miR-34b, miR-187, miR-199a, miR-199b, miR-146a, miR-15b, miR-130a, miR-214, and miR-424, that are differentially expressed upon, and after, treatment with doxorubicin.

Some studies indicated that the expression of Mcl-1 was upregulated in host cells during infection with the virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain, H37Rv. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of inhibiting Mcl-1 expression both in vivo and in vitro on apoptosis of host macrophages infected with M. tuberculosis using a small hairpin (sh)RNA. Mcl-1 expression was detected by the real time-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy were used to measure host macrophage apoptosis. We found elevated Mcl-1 levels in host macrophages infected with M. tuberculosis H37Rv. The expression of Mcl-1 was downregulated efficiently in H37Rv-infected host macrophages using shRNA. Knockdown of Mcl-1 enhanced the extent of apoptosis in H37Rv-infected host macrophages significantly. The increased apoptosis correlated with a decrease in M. tuberculosis colony forming units recovered from H37Rv-infected cells that were treated with Mcl-1-shRNA. Reducing Mcl-1 accumulation by shRNA also reduced accumulation of the anti-apoptotic gene, Bcl-2, and increased expression of the pro-apoptotic gene, Bax, in H37Rv-infected host macrophages. Our results showed that specific knockdown of Mcl-1 expression increased apoptosis of host macrophages significantly and decreased the intracellular survival of a virulent strain of M. tuberculosis.

This is of potential interest for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy, as NF-kappaB signaling is emerging as a key pathway, mediating drug resistance and leukemia-initiating cell survival in AML. Inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling has been found to be synergistic with chemotherapy. TRPM2 is overexpressed in AML compared with normal bone marrow, with the highest levels in the FAB M3-6 subtypes. To determine the effect of TRPM2 depletions in a defined genetic model, we established MLL-AF9-driven AML on a Trpm2(-/-) genetic background. Trpm2(-/-) MLL-AF9 leukemias displayed reduced NF-kappaB phosphorylation as well as nuclear translocation. In vivo, primary and secondary recipients of Trpm2(-/-) MLL-AF9 leukemias exhibit increased latency compared with recipients of wild-type leukemia cells. However, the difference in latency was small and was lost in tertiary transplants. The effect of loss of Trpm2 in a BCR-ABL/NUP98-HOXA9 fusion model was even smaller. Given reports that loss or inhibition of TRPM2 enhanced killing by DNA-damaging agents in neuroblastoma, breast cancer, and prostate cancer cell lines, we exposed Trpm2(-/-) and Trpm2(wt) primary MLL-AF9 leukemias to doxorubicin, cytarabine, and etoposide, but found no difference in IC50 values. The in vitro response to decitabine was also unaffected. In summary, Trpm2 does not seem to play a major role in myeloid leukemogenesis. Additionally, loss of Trpm2 does not augment the cytotoxicity of standard AML chemotherapeutic agents.","['Copyright (c) 2016 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Assessment of molecular response (MR) by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction is the most sensitive way to monitor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment efficacy. Besides major molecular response, which has emerged as a safe haven for survival since the initial studies of first-line imatinib treatment, two additional MR milestones have recently been defined: early molecular response and deep molecular response. The achievement of such MR milestones within defined time points during therapy is thought to draw the ideal trajectory toward optimal long-term outcome and, possibly, successful treatment discontinuation. Sensitive and reproducible MR measurement and proper interpretation of MR results are therefore critical to correctly inform therapeutic decisions. In patients who do not achieve an optimal response to TKI therapy, BCR-ABL1 mutation screening should also be performed, because it may deliver useful information for TKI choice. This review aims to help clinicians apply and translate the latest response definitions and clinical recommendations into practice. We provide a critical update on how these recommendations have incorporated MR levels in the clinical decision algorithms and how detection of BCR-ABL1 mutations should be interpreted. We also include a practical guide for pathologists and molecular biologists to best perform molecular testing and for hematologists and oncologists to best integrate it into routine practice. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Ever-more-potent therapeutic strategies have been developed for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in parallel with the evolution of therapeutic goals and the refinement of response definitions and monitoring schemes and procedures. Terminology and methodology continue to evolve rapidly, making it difficult for busy hematology/oncology professionals to keep abreast of the newest developments. Optimal CML patient management results from the timely and rational use of molecular testing, the critical assessment of the power and pitfalls of current technology, and the appropriate interpretation and contextualization of results.",['(c)AlphaMed Press.'],"['Soverini, Simona', 'De Benedittis, Caterina', 'Mancini, Manuela', 'Martinelli, Giovanni']","['Soverini S', 'De Benedittis C', 'Mancini M', 'Martinelli G']","['Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Hematology/Oncology ""L. e A.

However, the downstream effectors of miR-30 and its specific role in radiation-induced cell death are not well understood. In the present study, we evaluated effects of radiation on miR-30 expression and activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathway Bcl-2 family factors in in vivo mouse and in vitro human hematopoietic cells. CD2F1 mice and human CD34+ cells were exposed to different doses of gamma-radiation. In addition to survival studies, mouse blood, bone marrow (BM) and spleen cells and human CD34+ cells were collected at 4 h, and 1, 3 and 4 days after irradiation to determine apoptotic and stress response signals. Our results showed that mouse serum miR-30, DNA damage marker gamma-H2AX in BM, and Bim, Bax and Bak expression, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 and -7 activation in BM and/or spleen cells were upregulated in a radiation dose-dependent manner. Antiapoptotic factor Mcl-1 was significantly downregulated, whereas Bcl-2 was less changed or unaltered in the irradiated mouse cells and human CD34+ cells. Furthermore, a putative miR-30 binding site was found in the 3' UTR of Mcl-1 mRNA. miR-30 directly inhibits the expression of Mcl-1 through binding to its target sequence, which was demonstrated by a luciferase reporter assay, and the finding that Mcl-1 was uninhibited by irradiation in miR-30 knockdown CD34+ cells. Bcl-2 expression was not affected by miR-30.

A high-throughput phenotypic screen designed to identify modulators of promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear body (NB) formation revealed the CG gitoxigenin as a potent activator of PML. We demonstrate that multiple structurally distinct CGs activate the formation of PML NBs and induce PML protein SUMOylation in an NKA-dependent fashion. CG effects on PML occur at the post-transcriptional level, mechanistically distinct from previously described PML activators and are mediated through signaling events downstream of NKA. Curiously, genomic deletion of PML in human cancer cells failed to abrogate the cytotoxic effects of CGs and other apoptotic stimuli such as ceramide and arsenic trioxide that were previously shown to function through PML in mice.

Among genetic lesions that are recurrent in CLL, few clinically validated prognostic markers, such as TP53 mutations and 17p deletion, are available for the use in clinical practice to guide treatment decisions. Recently, several novel molecular markers have been identified in CLL. Though these mutations have not yet gained the qualification of predictive factors for treatment tailoring, they have shown to be promising to refine the prognostic stratification of patients. The introduction of targeted drugs is changing the genetics of CLL, and has disclosed the acquisition of previously unexpected drug resistant mutations in signalling pathway genes. Ultra-deep next generation sequencing has allowed to reach deep levels of resolution of the genetic portrait of CLL providing a precise definition of its subclonal genetic architecture. This approach has shown that small subclones harbouring drug resistant mutations anticipate the development of a chemorefractory phenotype.

In the resulting chimeric proteins, Nup98's N-terminal region is fused to the C-terminal region of about 30 different partners, including homeodomain (HD) transcription factors. While transcriptional targets of distinct Nup98 chimeras related to immortalization are relatively well described, little is known about other potential cellular effects of these fusion proteins. By comparing the sub-nuclear localization of a large number of Nup98 fusions with HD and non-HD partners throughout the cell cycle we found that while all Nup98 chimeras were nuclear during interphase, only Nup98-HD fusion proteins exhibited a characteristic speckled appearance. During mitosis, only Nup98-HD fusions were concentrated on chromosomes. Despite the difference in localization, all tested Nup98 chimera provoked morphological alterations in the nuclear envelope (NE), in particular affecting the nuclear lamina and the lamina-associated polypeptide 2alpha (LAP2alpha). Importantly, such aberrations were not only observed in transiently transfected HeLa cells but also in mouse bone marrow cells immortalized by Nup98 fusions and in cells derived from leukemia patients harboring Nup98 fusions.

METHODS: Down syndrome was identified from the Danish Cytogenetic Register. Cancer occurrence was identified by linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated based on observed and expected numbers from rates for all Danish residents. The cohort consisted of 3,530 persons with Down syndrome contributing 89,570 person-years at risk. RESULTS: Acute leukemia risk was highest from 1-4 years of age and remained elevated until age 30. The overall risk of solid tumors was decreased (SIR 0.45; 95% CI 0.34-0.59), especially in persons 50 years or older (SIR 0.27; 95% CI 0.16-0.43). We found a significantly lower risk of lung cancer (SIR 0.10; 95% CI 0.00-0.56), breast cancer (SIR 0.16; 95% CI 0.03-0.47), and cervical cancer (SIR 0.0; 95% CI 0.00-0.77). Testicular cancer was the only solid tumor with an increased SIR (2.9; 95% CI 1.6-4.8). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of all major groups of solid tumors was decreased, except testicular cancer. Altered screening strategies should be considered for persons with Down syndrome. This unusual pattern of cancer occurrence may help understanding carcinogenesis in the general population.Genet Med 18 11, 1151-1157.",,"['Hasle, Henrik', 'Friedman, Jan M', 'Olsen, Jorgen H', 'Rasmussen, Sonja A']","['Hasle H', 'Friedman JM', 'Olsen JH', 'Rasmussen SA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Centre, Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160331,United States,Genet Med,Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,9815831,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/complications/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Testicular Neoplasms/complications/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/complications/*epidemiology/genetics']",2016/11/01 06:00,2017/09/16 06:00,['2016/04/01 06:00'],"['2015/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/16 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['gim201623 [pii]', '10.1038/gim.2016.23 [doi]']",ppublish,Genet Med. 2016 Nov;18(11):1151-1157. doi: 10.1038/gim.2016.23.

A 0.9% rate of hepatic sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS) was noted in licensing trials. In 2001, FDA received reports of 14 GO-associated SOS cases from MD Anderson Cancer Center. A State of South Carolina/National Cancer Institute funded pharmacovigilance program and a manufacturer sponsored registry independently evaluated this concern. METHODS: The manufacturer's registry and the academic program focused on risk factors and incidence of GO-associated SOS in routine clinical practice and clinical trial settings, respectively. Comparisons were made of findings and dissemination efforts from the two studies. RESULTS: Retrospective analysis of clinical trials by the academic initiative identified 99 cases of SOS among 221 GO-treated stem cell patients and 649 patients who did not undergo HSCTs. SOS rates were 3% when GO was administered at doses </=6 mg/m(2) as monotherapy or with non-hepatotoxic agents; 28% when administered with 6-thioguanine, a hepatotoxic agent; 15% when administered as monotherapy at doses at a dose of 9 mg/m(2), and between 15% and 40% if a stem cell transplant (SCT) was performed within 3 months of GO administration. Death from SOS occurred in 33% of the cases. The manufacturer's registry prospectively evaluated 482 GO-treated patients who received a mean dose of 7.8 mg/m(2). Overall, 41% received concomitant chemotherapy, 18% had undergone prior SCT, 9.1% developed SOS, and death from SOS occurred in 60% of the SOS cases. Findings from each initiative were disseminated at national conferences and in peer-reviewed manuscripts beginning in 2003. CONCLUSION: Retrospective review of clinical trials, case series, and FDA reports and prospective registries can provide important information on safety signals initially identified in licensing trials.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result, this study was conducted with the aim to evaluate the impact of ciprofloxacin-prophylaxis on the use of broad-spectrum antibioctics and anti-mycotics. METHODS: A cohort of 139 consecutive patients with acute leukaemia treated with remission-inducing induction chemotherapy between 2004-2012 at the Department of Haematology in Uppsala University Hospital was analysed. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (38%) received broad-spectrum antibiotics at the initiation of chemotherapy and were not eligible for prophylaxis. Of the remaining patients, the initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics was delayed by 3 days in those receiving ciprofloxacin prophylaxis (n = 47) compared with those receiving no prophylaxis (n = 39). The median duration of systemic antibiotic treatment was 6 days shorter in patients receiving ciprofloxacin prophylaxis (12 vs 18 days; p = 0.0005) and the cumulative (total) median days on systemic antibiotic treatment was shortened by 8 days (15 vs 23 days, p = 0.0008).

METHODS: From January 2012 to February 2015, 42 cases of AML with FLT3-ITD mutation according to MICM (morphology, immunology, cytogenetics and molecular) diagnosis system in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Thirty-two cases were refractory to chemotherapy or relapsed, who were treated with sorafenib or combined with chemotherapy. Ten patients relapsed after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), who were retreated with sorafenib or combined with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) or chemotherapy. In the first group, 13 of 32 patients accepted allo-HSCT. RESULTS: The overall response rate of all 42 patients was 73.8%, including 4 (9.5%) complete molecular remission (CMR), 9 (21.4%) complete remission (CR), 8 (19%) complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), 10 (23.8%) partial remission (PR), and 11 (26.2%) none remission (NR). The response rate of sorafenib alone for 17 patients was 70.6%, and that of sorafenib plus chemotherapy was 66.7% (P=0.555). Thirteen patients who received allo-HSCT included 6 CMR/CR/CRi, 4 PR, and 3 NR before transplant. The 2-year overall survival (OS) rate and progress free survival (PFS) rate in all patients were 36.9% and 28.7%, and the corresponding median time were 18 months and 9 months respectively. The 2-year OS rate in 23 patients who received sorafenib combined with allo-HSCT was superior to that in 19 patients not receiving allo-HSCT (45.5% vs 23.9%, P=0.041), so was PFS rate (44.0% vs 9.7%, P=0.014). Twelve cases died of disease progression, four of infection, and one of chronic graft versus host disease after transplant.

PCGF2, a Polycomb group protein, has been suggested as an anti-SUMO E3 protein by inhibiting the sumoylation of UBE2I substrates, HSF2 and RANGAP1, via direct interaction. Thus, we hypothesized that PCGF2 might play a role in ATO-induced PML-RARA degradation by interacting with UBE2I. PCGF2 protein was down-regulated upon ATO treatment in human APL cell line, NB4. Knockdown of PCGF2 in NB4 cells, in the absence of ATO treatment, was sufficient to induce sumoylation-, ubiquitylation- and PML nuclear body-mediated degradation of PML-RARA protein. Moreover, overexpression of PCGF2 protected ATO-mediated degradation of ectopic and endogenous PML-RARA in 293T and NB4 cells, respectively. In 293T cells, UBE2I-mediated PML-RARA degradation was reduced upon PCGF2 co-expression. In addition, UBE2I-mediated sumoylation of PML-RARA was reduced upon PCGF2 co-expression and PCGF2-UBE2I interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Likewise, endogenous PCGF2-UBE2I interaction was detected by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays in NB4 cells.

This is influenced by the negative effects of the disease and the treatment of childhood cancer. Exercise training for adult cancer patients has frequently been reported to improve physical fitness. In recent years, literature on this subject has also become available for children and young adults with cancer, both during and after treatment. This is an update of the original review that was performed in 2011. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of a physical exercise training intervention on the physical fitness (i.e. aerobic capacity, muscle strength, or functional performance) of children with cancer within the first five years from their diagnosis (performed either during or after cancer treatment), compared to a control group of children with cancer who did not receive an exercise intervention.To determine whether physical exercise within the first five years of diagnosis has an effect on fatigue, anxiety, depression, self efficacy, and HRQoL and to determine whether there are any adverse effects of the intervention. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the electronic databases of Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PEDro; ongoing trial registries and conference proceedings on 6 September 2011 and 11 November 2014. In addition, we performed a handsearch of reference lists. SELECTION CRITERIA: The review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical controlled trials (CCTs) that compared the effects of physical exercise training with no training, in people who were within the first five years of their diagnosis of childhood cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently identified studies meeting the inclusion criteria, performed the data extraction, and assessed the risk of bias using standardized forms. Study quality was rated by the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. MAIN RESULTS: Apart from the five studies in the original review, this update included one additional RCT. In total, the analysis included 171 participants, all during treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).The duration of the training sessions ranged from 15 to 60 minutes per session. Both the type of intervention and intervention period varied in all the included studies. However, the control group always received usual care.All studies had methodological limitations, such as small numbers of participants, unclear randomization methods, and single-blind study designs in case of one RCT and all results were of moderate to very low quality (GRADE).Cardiorespiratory fitness was evaluated by the 9-minute run-walk test, timed up-and-down stairs test, the timed up-and-go time test, and the 20-m shuttle run test. Data of the 9-minute run-walk test and the timed up-and-down stairs test could be pooled. The combined 9-minute run-walk test results showed significant differences between the intervention and the control groups, in favour of the intervention group (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 1.35). Pooled data from the timed up-and-down stairs test showed no significant differences in cardiorespiratory fitness (SMD -0.54; 95% CI -1.77 to 0.70). However, there was considerable heterogeneity (I(2) = 84%) between the two studies on this outcome. The other two single-study outcomes, 20-m shuttle run test and the timed up-and-go test, also showed positive results for cardiorespiratory fitness in favour of the intervention group.Only one study assessed the effect of exercise on bone mineral density (total body), showing a statistically significant positive intervention effect (SMD 1.07; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.66). The pooled data on body mass index showed no statistically significant end-score difference between the intervention and control group (SMD 0.59; 95% CI -0.23 to 1.41).Three studies assessed flexibility. Two studies assessed ankle dorsiflexion. One study assessed active ankle dorsiflexion, while the other assessed passive ankle dorsiflexion. There were no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control group with the active ankle dorsiflexion test; however, in favour of the intervention group, they were found for passive ankle dorsiflexion (SMD 0.69; 95% CI 0.12 to 1.25). The third study assessed body flexibility using the sit-and-reach distance test, but identified no statistically significant difference between the intervention and control group.Three studies assessed muscle strength (knee, ankle, back and leg, and inspiratory muscle strength). Only the back and leg strength combination score showed statistically significant differences on the muscle strength end-score between the intervention and control group (SMD 1.41; 95% CI 0.71 to 2.11).Apart from one sub-scale of the cancer scale (Worries; P value = 0.03), none of the health-related quality of life scales showed a significant difference between both study groups on the end-score. For the other outcomes of fatigue, level of daily activity, and adverse events (all assessed in one study), there were no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control group.None of the included studies evaluated activity energy expenditure, time spent on exercise, anxiety and depression, or self efficacy as an outcome. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The effects of physical exercise training interventions for childhood cancer participants are not yet convincing. Possible reasons are the small numbers of participants and insufficient study designs, but it can also be that this type of intervention is not as effective as in adult cancer patients. However, the first results show some positive effects on physical fitness in the intervention group compared to the control group. There were positive intervention effects for body composition, flexibility, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, and health-related quality of life (cancer-related items). These were measured by some assessment methods, but not all. However, the quality of the evidence was low and these positive effects were not found for the other assessed outcomes, such as fatigue, level of daily activity, and adverse events. There is a need for more studies with comparable aims and interventions, using a higher number of participants that also include diagnoses other than ALL.",,"['Braam, Katja I', 'van der Torre, Patrick', 'Takken, Tim', 'Veening, Margreet A', 'van Dulmen-den Broeder, Eline', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L']","['Braam KI', 'van der Torre P', 'Takken T', 'Veening MA', 'van Dulmen-den Broeder E', 'Kaspers GJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, PO Box 7057, Room 6 D 120, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 1007 MB.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20160331,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Body Mass Index', 'Bone Density', 'Child', 'Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Exercise', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Muscle Strength/physiology', 'Muscle, Skeletal/physiology', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Physical Endurance/physiology', '*Physical Fitness', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Quality of Life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Range of Motion, Articular/physiology']",2016/04/01 06:00,2016/07/07 06:00,['2016/04/01 06:00'],"['2016/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD008796.pub3 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2016 Mar 31;3:CD008796. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD008796.pub3.,10.1002/14651858.CD008796.pub3 [doi],,,PMC6464400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2013;(4):CD008796.

The possibility of significantly reducing the complications resulting from graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) with the administration of post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-CY) has substantially improved the efficacy and applicability of T cell-replete h-BMT. However, higher frequency of disease recurrence remains a major challenge in h-BMT with PT-CY. There is a critical need to identify novel strategies to prevent GvHD while sparing the graft-versus-leukaemia (GvL) effect in h-BMT. To this end, we evaluated the impact of bendamustine (BEN), given post-transplant, on GvHD and GvL using clinically relevant murine h-BMT models. We provide results indicating that post-transplant bendamustine (PT-BEN) alleviates GvHD, significantly improving survival, while preserving engraftment and GvL effects. We further document that PT-BEN can mitigate GvHD even in the absence of Treg. Our results also indicate that PT-BEN is less myelosuppressive than PT-CY, significantly increasing the number and proportion of CD11b(+) Gr-1(hi) cells, while decreasing lymphoid cells. In vitro we observed that BEN enhances the suppressive function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) while impairing the proliferation of T- and B-cells. These results advocate for the consideration of PT-BEN as a new therapeutic platform for clinical implementation in h-BMT.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Stokes, Jessica', 'Hoffman, Emely A', 'Zeng, Yi', 'Larmonier, Nicolas', 'Katsanis, Emmanuel']","['Stokes J', 'Hoffman EA', 'Zeng Y', 'Larmonier N', 'Katsanis E']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona.', 'Department of Immunobiology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona.', 'Department of Immunobiology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160331,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*drug effects', 'Histocompatibility/immunology', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Mice', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2016/04/01 06:00,2017/05/06 06:00,['2016/04/01 06:00'],"['2015/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.14034 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2016 Jul;174(1):102-16. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14034.

BLV envelope glycoprotein (gp)51 was expressed in E. coli, and MAbs against recombinant BLV gp51 were generated for the development of an immunochromatographic assay to detect BLV antibodies in cattle. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were determined by comparing these results with those obtained from a standard enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A total of 160 bovine sera were used to evaluate the new immunochromatographic assay.

Although preliminary evidence suggests that B-cell receptor immunoglobulin stereotypy is relevant from a clinical viewpoint, this aspect has never been explored in a systematic manner or in a cohort of adequate size that would enable clinical conclusions to be drawn. METHODS: For this retrospective, multicentre study, we analysed 8593 patients with CLL for whom immunogenetic data were available. These patients were followed up in 15 academic institutions throughout Europe (in Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK) and the USA, and data were collected between June 1, 2012, and June 7, 2013. We retrospectively assessed the clinical implications of CLL B-cell receptor immunoglobulin stereotypy, with a particular focus on 14 major stereotyped subsets comprising cases expressing unmutated (U-CLL) or mutated (M-CLL) immunoglobulin heavy chain variable genes. The primary outcome of our analysis was time to first treatment, defined as the time between diagnosis and date of first treatment. FINDINGS: 2878 patients were assigned to a stereotyped subset, of which 1122 patients belonged to one of 14 major subsets. Stereotyped subsets showed significant differences in terms of age, sex, disease burden at diagnosis, CD38 expression, and cytogenetic aberrations of prognostic significance. Patients within a specific subset generally followed the same clinical course, whereas patients in different stereotyped subsets-despite having the same immunoglobulin heavy variable gene and displaying similar immunoglobulin mutational status-showed substantially different times to first treatment. By integrating B-cell receptor immunoglobulin stereotypy (for subsets 1, 2, and 4) into the well established Dohner cytogenetic prognostic model, we showed these, which collectively account for around 7% of all cases of CLL and represent both U-CLL and M-CLL, constituted separate clinical entities, ranging from very indolent (subset 4) to aggressive disease (subsets 1 and 2). INTERPRETATION: The molecular classification of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia based on B-cell receptor immunoglobulin stereotypy improves the Dohner hierarchical model and refines prognostication beyond immunoglobulin mutational status, with potential implications for clinical decision making, especially within prospective clinical trials.

Nonetheless, the aforementioned paradigm might not fully explain the clinical success of this agent in these diseases. Growing evidence indicates that the immune system has a major role both in determining the therapeutic efficacy of imatinib (and other targeted agents) and in restraining the emergence of escape mutations.

However, patients who do not achieve complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR) have poorer prognosis. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that early and deeper cytogenetic and molecular responses predict a better long-term outcome. This study aimed to analyse the relationship between early molecular response and clinical outcome in a real-life setting. METHODS: This retrospective study included all patients with CML, in chronic or accelerated phase, who were treated with imatinib at University of Malaya Medical Centre, Malaysia. RESULTS: A total of 70 patients were analysed. The median follow-up duration was 74 months, and the cumulative percentages of patients with CCyR and MMR were 80.0% and 65.7%, respectively. Overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) at ten years were 94.3% and 92.9%, respectively. Patients who achieved CCyR and MMR had significantly better OS and EFS than those who did not. At six months, patients who had a BCR-ABL level </= 10% had significantly better OS and EFS than those who had a BCR-ABL level > 10%. The target milestone of CCyR at 12 months and MMR at 18 months showed no survival advantage in our patients. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that imatinib is still useful as first-line therapy. However, vigilant monitoring of patients who have a BCR-ABL level > 10% at six months of treatment should be implemented so that prompt action can be taken to provide the best outcome for these patients.",['Copyright: (c) Singapore Medical Association'],"['Bee, Ping Chong', 'Sekaran, Veera', 'Ng, Richard Rui Jie', 'Kweh, Ting Yi', 'Gan, Gin Gin']","['Bee PC', 'Sekaran V', 'Ng RR', 'Kweh TY', 'Gan GG']","['Department of Medicine, University of Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20160331,Singapore,Singapore Med J,Singapore medical journal,0404516,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cytogenetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Malaysia', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Universities']",2016/04/01 06:00,2017/09/08 06:00,['2016/04/01 06:00'],"['2016/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['j58/3/150 [pii]', '10.11622/smedj.2016063 [doi]']",ppublish,Singapore Med J. 2017 Mar;58(3):150-154. doi: 10.11622/smedj.2016063.

The treatment of patients with CLL is indicated in patients with progressive stage A, stage B or stage C. The new drugs currently available include not only the new generation of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, type I (ofatumumab) or type II (obinutuzumab), Bcl-2 inhibitors (GDC-0199/ABT-199) and now the new small molecules available orally, including Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTK) and phosphor-inositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor. The role of the biologist in monitoring a patient treated for CLL is essential, the latter to make the diagnosis of CLL, the search for prognostic factors (Binet stage, lymphocyte doubling time, looking for a 17p deletion or TP53 mutations, study of mutational profile of heavy chain genes of immunoglobulins IGHV) and biological monitoring of the different treatments. We will study in this paper the results obtained with these drugs, insisting today more than ever on the need to set up a clinical and biological complementarity to allow optimal medical management of patients with CLL.

Depending on the absolute B cell count, one may distinguish low-count CLL-like MBL (<500 B cells/muL) which have no evidence of progression, no reduction in overall survival, no increase in infection risk and do not require any specific follow-up. Patients with clinical CLL-like MBL (>500 B cells/muL) have a 1% to 2% per year risk of progression to CLL requiring therapy, a higher risk of infectious complications and mortality implicating an annual follow-up by hematologist. MBL may also express other less common phenotypes and are named atypical MBL in case of CD5 antigen expression (Catovsky-Matutes score: 1-2) and non-CLL-like MBL for CD5 negative cases (Catovsky-Matutes score: 0-2). Their poorer prognosis implicates imaging studies, bone marrow biopsy and cytogenetic analysis in addition to physical examination in order to rule out non-hodgkinien lymphoma, and require a more frequent follow-up.

For instance, the homophilic molecule SLAMF6 (CD352) is in part involved in natural killer T cell development, but also modulates T follicular helper cell and germinal B cell interactions. Here we report that upon transplantation of a well-defined aggressive murine B220+CD5+ Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) cell clone, TCL1-192, into SCID mice one injection of a monoclonal antibody directed against SLAMF6 (alphaSlamf6) abrogates tumor progression in the spleen, bone marrow and blood. Similarly, progression of a murine B cell lymphoma, LMP2A/lambdaMyc, was also eliminated by alphaSlamf6. But, surprisingly, alphaSLAMF6 neither eliminated TCL1-192 nor LMP2A/lambdaMyc cells, which resided in the peritoneal cavity or omentum. This appeared to be dependent upon the tumor environment, which affected the frequency of sub-populations of the TCL1-192 clone or the inability of peritoneal macrophages to induce Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC). However, co-administering alphaSlamf6 with the Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor, ibrutinib, synergized to efficiently eliminate the tumor cells in the spleen, bone marrow, liver and the peritoneal cavity. Because an anti-human SLAMF6 mAb efficiently killed human CLL cells in vitro and in vivo, we propose that a combination of alphaSlamf6 with ibrutinib should be considered as a novel therapeutic approach for CLL and other B cell tumors.",,"['Yigit, Burcu', 'Halibozek, Peter J', 'Chen, Shih-Shih', ""O'Keeffe, Michael S"", 'Arnason, Jon', 'Avigan, David', 'Gattei, Valter', 'Bhan, Atul', 'Cen, Osman', 'Longnecker, Richard', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Wang, Ninghai', 'Engel, Pablo', 'Terhorst, Cox']","['Yigit B', 'Halibozek PJ', 'Chen SS', ""O'Keeffe MS"", 'Arnason J', 'Avigan D', 'Gattei V', 'Bhan A', 'Cen O', 'Longnecker R', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Wang N', 'Engel P', 'Terhorst C']","['Division of Immunology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Division of Immunology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Karches Center for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, USA.', 'Division of Immunology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano, Italy.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Karches Center for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, USA.', 'Division of Immunology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Immunology Unit, Department of Cell Biology, Immunology and Neurosciences, Medical School, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Division of Immunology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (SLAMF6 protein, human)', '0 (Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family)', '0 (Slamf6 protein, mouse)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2016/03/31 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2016/03/31 06:00'],"['2016/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['8378 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.8378 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 May 3;7(18):26346-60. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.8378.,10.18632/oncotarget.8378 [doi],,,PMC5041984,"['AUTHORSHIP AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST B.Y performed the experiments with the help', 'of NW, PJH, MSO; the manuscript was prepared by BY, PE and CT; DA and JA provided', 'the fresh CLL samples.

Benzoic acid- and hydroxamic acid-based STAT3 inhibitors SH-4-054 and SH-5-007, developed previously in our laboratory, demonstrated promising activity against these resistant CML cell lines. However, pharmacokinetic studies in murine models (CD-1 mice) revealed that both SH-4-054 and SH-5-007 are susceptible to glutathione conjugation at the para position of the pentafluorophenyl group via nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SN Ar). To determine whether the electrophilicity of the pentafluorophenyl sulfonamide could be tempered, an in-depth structure-activity relationship (SAR) study of the SH-4-054 scaffold was conducted. These studies revealed that AM-1-124, possessing a 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenylsulfonamide group, retained STAT3 protein affinity (Ki =15 mum), as well as selectivity over STAT1 (Ki >250 mum).

However, potential mispairing of introduced TCRalpha/beta-chains with endogenous beta/alpha-ones may evoke unpredictable autoimmune reactivities. A novel single chain (sc)TCR format relies on the fusion of the Valpha-Linker-Vbeta-fragment to the TCR Cbeta-domain and coexpression of the TCR Calpha-domain capable of recruiting the natural CD3-complex for full and hence, native T-cell signaling. Here, we tested whether such a gp100(280-288)- or p53(264-272) tumor antigen-specific scTCR is still prone to mispairing with TCRalpha. In a human Jurkat-76 T-cell line lacking endogenous TCRs, surface expression and function of a scTCR could be reconstituted by any cointroduced TCRalpha-chain indicating mispairing to take place on a molecular basis. In contrast, transduction into human TCRalpha/beta-positive T-cells revealed that mispairing is largely reduced. Competition experiments in Jurkat-76 confirmed the preference of dcTCR to selfpair and to spare scTCR. This also allowed for the generation of dc/scTCR-modified cytomegalovirus/tumor antigen-bispecific T-cells to augment T-cell activation in CMV-infected tumor patients. Residual mispairing was prevented by strenghtening the Valpha-Li-Vbeta-fragment through the design of a novel disulfide bond between a Valpha- and a linker-resident residue close to Vbeta. Multimer-stainings, and cytotoxicity-, IFNgamma-secretion-, and CFSE-proliferation-assays, the latter towards dendritic cells endogenously processing RNA-electroporated gp100 antigen proved the absence of hybrid scTCR/TCRalpha-formation without impairing avidity of scTCR/Calpha in T-cells. Moreover, a fragile cytomegalovirus pp65(495-503)-specific scTCR modified this way acquired enhanced cytotoxicity. Thus, optimized scTCR/Calpha inhibits residual TCR mispairing to accomplish safe adoptive immunotherapy for bulk endogenous TCRalpha/beta-positive T-cells.",,"['Knies, Diana', 'Klobuch, Sebastian', 'Xue, Shao-An', 'Birtel, Matthias', 'Echchannaoui, Hakim', 'Yildiz, Oezlem', 'Omokoko, Tana', 'Guillaume, Philippe', 'Romero, Pedro', 'Stauss, Hans', 'Sahin, Ugur', 'Herr, Wolfgang', 'Theobald, Matthias', 'Thomas, Simone', 'Voss, Ralf-Holger']","['Knies D', 'Klobuch S', 'Xue SA', 'Birtel M', 'Echchannaoui H', 'Yildiz O', 'Omokoko T', 'Guillaume P', 'Romero P', 'Stauss H', 'Sahin U', 'Herr W', 'Theobald M', 'Thomas S', 'Voss RH']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Pneumology, University Cancer Center (UCT), University Medical Center (UMC) of Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Municipal Clinic Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Pneumology, University Cancer Center (UCT), University Medical Center (UMC) of Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, Royal Free Hospital, London, United Kingdom.', 'TRON-Translational Oncology at the University Medical Center of Johannes Gutenberg University gGmbH, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Pneumology, University Cancer Center (UCT), University Medical Center (UMC) of Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Biopharmaceutical New Technologies (BioNTech) Corporation, Mainz, Germany.', 'Biopharmaceutical New Technologies (BioNTech) Corporation, Mainz, Germany.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (LICR), Lausanne Branch, Epalinges, Switzerland.', 'TCMetrix, Epalinges, Switzerland.', 'Translational Tumor Immunology Group, Ludwig Center for Cancer Research of the University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, Royal Free Hospital, London, United Kingdom.', 'TRON-Translational Oncology at the University Medical Center of Johannes Gutenberg University gGmbH, Mainz, Germany.', 'Biopharmaceutical New Technologies (BioNTech) Corporation, Mainz, Germany.', 'Research Center for Immunotherapy (FZI), University Medical Center of Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Pneumology, University Cancer Center (UCT), University Medical Center (UMC) of Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Center for Interventional Immunology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Pneumology, University Cancer Center (UCT), University Medical Center (UMC) of Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Pneumology, University Cancer Center (UCT), University Medical Center (UMC) of Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Center for Interventional Immunology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Pneumology, University Cancer Center (UCT), University Medical Center (UMC) of Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.', 'TRON-Translational Oncology at the University Medical Center of Johannes Gutenberg University gGmbH, Mainz, Germany.', 'Research Center for Immunotherapy (FZI), University Medical Center of Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'CD3 Complex/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Membrane', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2016/03/31 06:00,2018/01/25 06:00,['2016/03/31 06:00'],"['2015/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['8385 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.8385 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Apr 19;7(16):21199-221. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.8385.,10.18632/oncotarget.8385 [doi],,,PMC5008279,"['R.-H.

We developed this strategy for establishing mAb to reduce the risk of obtaining clonotypic mAb specific for single HL cell line.

In this prospective, longitudinal study, the prevalence and predictors of anxiety and depressive symptoms after the completion of treatment were examined. METHODS: Participants included 160 children aged 2 to 9 years with standard-risk ALL who were enrolled on Children's Oncology Group protocol AALL0331. Parents completed standardized rating scales of their children's emotional-behavioral functioning and measures of coping and family functioning at approximately 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months after diagnosis and again 3 months after the completion of chemotherapy. RESULTS: At 3 months off therapy, approximately 24% of survivors had at-risk/clinically elevated anxiety scores and 28% had elevated depression scores, which are significantly higher than the expected 15% in the general population (P = .028 and .001, respectively). Patients with elevated anxiety 1 month after diagnosis were at greater risk of off-therapy anxiety (odds ratio, 4.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-12.73 [P = .022]) and those with elevated depressive symptoms 6 months after diagnosis were at greater risk of off-therapy depression (odds ratio, 7.88; 95% confidence interval, 2.61-23.81 [P = .0002]). In adjusted longitudinal analyses, unhealthy family functioning (P = .008) and less reliance on social support coping (P = .009) were found to be associated with risk of emotional distress. Children from Spanish-speaking families (P = .05) also were found to be at a greater risk of distress. CONCLUSIONS: A significant percentage of children experience emotional distress during and after therapy for ALL. These data provide a compelling rationale for targeted early screening and psychosocial interventions to support family functioning and coping skills. Cancer 2016;122:1608-17.

We retrospectively analysed the incidence of IFI according to EORTC-MSG criteria in 121 consecutive AML/MDS patients receiving 948 azacitidine courses (median 5, range 1-43) between June 2007 and June 2015. Four cases of IFI (two possible, one probable aspergillosis and one proven candidemia) occurred in this series. The incidence rate of proven/probable IFI was 0.21% per treatment cycle and 1.6% per patient treated for the whole series, and 0.73% per treatment cycle and 4.1% per patient treated in those with severe neutropenia. Two patients died from IFI, leading to an IFI-attributable mortality rate of 1.65% per patient and 0.21% per treatment cycle. The numbers needed to treat with prophylaxis to prevent one case of IFI are 238 azacitidine cycles or 30 patients throughout their whole treatment course, and 137 azacitidine cycles or 24 patients among those with severe neutropenia.

However, the mechanism of Stat5 activation in mediating resistance to IM in bone marrow (BM) microenvironment has not been evaluated precisely. In this study, we reported HS-5-derived conditioned medium (CM) significantly enhanced IM resistance in K562 and KU812. Interestingly, upregulation of the proportion of CD34+ subpopulation was found in CML cells. Subsequently, the BCR/ABL-independent activation of Stat5 increased P-glycoprotein (P-gp) activity in CM-mediated protection of CML stem cells (LSCs) from IM. Further research revealed Stat5 activation increased the DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB though binding of p-Stat5 and p-RelA in nucleus. Moreover, highly acetylated RelA was required for Stat5-mediated RelA nuclear binding. The study further confirmed that Wogonin potentiated the inhibitory effects of IM on leukemia development by suppressing Stat5 pathway both in CM model and the K562 xenograft model. In summary, results clearly demonstrated BCR/ABL-independent Stat5 survival pathway could contribute to resistance of CML LSCs to IM in BM microenvironment and suggested that natural durgs effectively inhibiting Stat5 may be an attractive approach to overcome resistance to BCR/ABL kinase inhibitors.",,"['Xu, Xuefen', 'Zhang, Xiaobo', 'Liu, Yicheng', 'Yang, Lin', 'Huang, Shaoliang', 'Lu, Lu', 'Wang, Shuhao', 'Guo, Qinglong', 'Zhao, Li']","['Xu X', 'Zhang X', 'Liu Y', 'Yang L', 'Huang S', 'Lu L', 'Wang S', 'Guo Q', 'Zhao L']","[""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""Middle School of The City, Mei County, Baoji, Shaanxi 721000, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'POK93PO28W (wogonin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flavanones/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2016/03/31 06:00,2017/12/05 06:00,['2016/03/31 06:00'],"['2015/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [medline]']","['8332 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.8332 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Apr 26;7(17):24436-54. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.8332.,10.18632/oncotarget.8332 [doi],,,PMC5029713,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['BM microenvironment', 'CD34+ subpopulation', 'NF-kappaB', 'Stat5', 'Wogonin']",,,,,,,,,,,,

DIF-1 and 3 have also been reported to have tumor inhibiting properties; however, the mechanisms that underlie the effects of these compounds remain poorly defined. Herein, we show that DIF-3 rapidly triggers Ca2+ release and a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in the absence of cytochrome c and Smac release and without caspase activation. Consistently with these findings, we also detected no evidence of apoptosis in cells treated with DIF-3 but instead found that this compound induced autophagy. In addition, DIF-3 promoted mitochondrial fission in K562 and HeLa cells, as assessed by electron and confocal microscopy analysis. Importantly, DIF-3 mediated the phosphorylation and redistribution of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) from the cytoplasmic to the microsomal fraction of K562 cells. Pharmacological inhibition or siRNA silencing of DRP1 not only inhibited mitochondrial fission but also protected K562 cells from DIF-3-mediated cell death. Furthermore, DIF-3 potently inhibited the growth of imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant K562 cells. It also inhibited tumor formation in athymic mice engrafted with an imatinib-resistant CML cell line. Finally, DIF-3 exhibited a clear selectivity toward CD34+ leukemic cells from CML patients, compared with CD34- cells. In conclusion, we show that the potent anti-leukemic effect of DIF-3 is mediated through the induction of mitochondrial fission and caspase-independent cell death.

Although most children with ALL are cured, there is still a group of patients for which therapy fails owing to severe toxicities and drug resistance. Ginsenoside Rh2 (GRh2), a major bioactive component isolated from Panax ginseng, has been shown to have a therapeutic effect on some tumors. However, the molecular mechanisms of cell death induced by 20(S)-GRh2 in ALL cells remains unclear. In this study, we showed that 20(S)-GRh2 inhibited the cell growth and induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis and autophagy. But it has no cytotoxic effect on human normal blood cells. Furthermore, autophagy plays a protective role in 20(S)-GRh2-induced apoptosis in ALL cell lines and human primary ALL cells. We demonstrated that either genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy could be more effective in reducing viability and enhancing 20(S)-GRh2-induced toxicity than 20(S)-GRh2 treatment alone. In addition, inhibition of autophagy could aggravate mitochondrial ROS generation and mitochondrial damage, and then accelerate mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest that inhibition of autophagy can sensitize ALL cells towards 20(S)-GRh2. The appropriate inhibition of autophagy could provide a powerful strategy to increase the potency of 20(S)-GRh2 as a novel anticancer agent for ALL therapy.",,"['Xia, Ting', 'Wang, Jiancheng', 'Wang, Yingnan', 'Wang, Yuanyuan', 'Cai, Jianye', 'Wang, Min', 'Chen, Qidan', 'Song, Jia', 'Yu, Ziqi', 'Huang, Wei', 'Fang, Jianpei']","['Xia T', 'Wang J', 'Wang Y', 'Wang Y', 'Cai J', 'Wang M', 'Chen Q', 'Song J', 'Yu Z', 'Huang W', 'Fang J']","['Key Laboratory of Industrial Fermentation Microbiology, Ministry of Education, College of Biotechnology, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin, P.R.

The transcription of the beta-like globin genes requires erythroid specific activators such as GATA-1, NF-E2, TAL1 and KLF1. However, the roles of these activators have not fully elucidated in transcription of the human adult beta-globin gene. Here we employed hybrid MEL cells (MEL/ch11) where a human chromosome containing the beta-globin locus is present and the adult beta-globin gene is highly transcribed by induction. The roles of erythroid specific activators were analyzed by inhibiting the expression of NF-E2, TAL1 or KLF1 in MEL/ch11 cells. The loss of each activator decreased the transcription of human beta-globin gene, locus wide histone hyperacetylation and the binding of other erythroid specific activators including GATA-1, even though not affecting the expression of other activators. Notably, sensitivity to DNase I was reduced in the locus control region (LCR) hypersensitive sites (HSs) with the depletion of activators. These results indicate that NF-E2, TAL1 and KLF1, all activators play a primary role in HSs formation in the LCR. It might contribute to the transcription of human adult beta-globin gene by allowing the access of activators and cofactors. The roles of activators in the adult beta-globin locus appear to be different from the roles in the early fetal locus.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The enzymes that catalyze these marks are known as the protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), and they can generate asymmetric dimethyl arginine (type I arginine methyltransferases), symmetric dimethylarginine (type II arginine methyltransferases), or monomethyarginine (type III arginine methyltransferases). The PRMTs are capable of modifying diverse substrates, from histone components to specific nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. Additionally, the PRMTs can orchestrate chromatin remodeling by blocking the docking of other epigenetic modifying enzymes or by recruiting them to specific gene loci. In the hematopoietic system, PRMTs can regulate cell behavior, including the critical balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, in at least two critical ways, via (i) the covalent modification of transcription factors and (ii) the regulation of histone modifications at promoters critical to cell fate determination. Given these important functions, it is not surprising that these processes are altered in hematopoietic malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia, where they promote increased self-renewal and impair hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell differentiation.","['Copyright (c) 2016 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

For patients with relapsed disease after transplantation, intensive chemotherapy followed by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) or a second allo-SCT may result in a durable response in some patients. High-intensity chemotherapy and less aggressive therapy with hypomethylating agents (HAs) with and without DLI are often used for relapse after allo-SCT. Here we compared the treatment outcomes of intensive chemotherapy with that of HAs in relapsed AML and MDS after allo-SCT. Patients who had received a second SCT within 90 days of the relapse date were excluded. The primary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints were complete remission (CR) rate and progression-free survival (PFS). One hundred patients were included: 73 patients received chemotherapy and 27 patients received an HA. Fifty-six percent of patients in the chemotherapy group and 33% of patients in the HA group received at least 1 DLI after treatment. Treatment with chemotherapy resulted in a higher ORR (51% versus 19%, P = .004) and a higher CR rate (40% versus 7%, P = .002). The median OS (6 versus 3.9 months, P = .01) and PFS (4.9 versus 3.8 months, P = .02) were longer in the chemotherapy group. Similar benefit of chemotherapy over HAs was maintained in all treatment outcomes after controlling for the use of DLI. The use of chemotherapy followed by DLI offered the greatest benefit (ORR, 68%; CR, 59%, 1-year OS, 44%; and median OS, 9.8 months). In conclusion, in our hands, with limited numbers, the use of more conventional salvage chemotherapy, with DLI when possible, for the treatment of relapsed AML and MDS after allo-SCT is associated with better outcomes than nonchemotherapy (HA) options.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Most patients with BPDCN have skin lesions at diagnosis and subsequent or simultaneous involvement of the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and lymph nodes. Patients usually respond to initial chemotherapy but often relapse. Stem cell transplantation may improve survival. This neoplasm is derived from precursors of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and is characterized by the coexpression of the immunophenotypic markers CD4, CD56, CD123, blood dendritic cell antigen-2, blood dendritic cell antigen-4, CD2AP, and lineage(-). Atypical immunophenotype expression may be present, making diagnosis difficult. BPDCN is often associated with a complex karyotype, frequent deletions of tumor suppressor genes, and mutations affecting either the DNA methylation or chromatin remodeling pathways. A better understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of this neoplasm could open the way to new therapies targeting specific signaling pathways or involving epigenetics.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

To understand this variability and predict patients who would respond to carfilzomib, we investigated the mechanism by which carfilzomib induces CLL cell death. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using CLL patient samples and cell lines, complementary knockdown and knockout cells, and carfilzomib-resistant cell lines, we evaluated changes in intracellular networks to identify molecules responsible for carfilzomib's cytotoxic activity. Lysates from carfilzomib-treated cells were immunoblotted for molecules involved in ubiquitin, apoptotic, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathways and results correlated with carfilzomib cytotoxic activity. Coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down assays were performed to identify complex interactions among MCL-1, Noxa, and Bak. RESULTS: Carfilzomib triggered ER stress and activation of both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways through alteration of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Consequently, the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homology protein (CHOP) accumulated in response to carfilzomib, and CHOP depletion conferred protection against cytotoxicity. Carfilzomib also induced accumulation of MCL-1 and Noxa, whereby MCL-1 preferentially formed a complex with Noxa and consequently relieved MCL-1's protective effect on sequestering Bak. Accordingly, depletion of Noxa or both Bak and Bax conferred protection against carfilzomib-induced cell death. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, carfilzomib induced ER stress culminating in activation of intrinsic and extrinsic caspase pathways, and we identified the CHOP protein level as a biomarker that could predict sensitivity to carfilzomib in CLL.

In addition, neurological examination revealed weakness of the left shoulder abduction, the right hand, and the bilateral lower limbs. Atypical promyelocytes were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid, in spite of normal finding in the peripheral blood smear. Magnetic resonance imaging showed gadolinium-enhanced multiple intradural/extramedullary lesions in the whole spine. Nerve conduction studies of the right limbs revealed sensorimotor conduction abnormalities, conspicuously in the posterior tibial and sural nerves. As a result, she was diagnosed as having intrathecal relapse of APL, associated with multiple mononeuropathy. The neurological symptoms were completely disappeared by intrathecal chemotherapy and whole-spine radiotherapy, suggesting that the neuropathy was possibly caused by meningeal infiltration affecting multiple spinal nerve roots.

Mouse leukemia cells L1210 were used for testing of AcrDTUs as the new PSs. The irradiation (UV-A light (365 nm), 1.05 J/cm(2)) increased cytotoxicity of all derivatives against L1210 cells more than ten times. The highest photocytotoxicity was found for propyl-AcrDTU with IC50=0.48+/-0.03 muM after 48 h incubation. A generation of the superoxide radical anion upon UV-A irradiation of propyl-AcrDTU was confirmed by in situ photochemical EPR experiments. To explain a mechanism of photocytotoxic action of AcrDTUs, an intracellular distribution of propyl-AcrDTU has been studied. It was found that AcrDTU in non-irradiated cells was not present in their nucleus but in the lysosomes and partly in the mitochondria, and sequestration of propyl-AcrDTU was dependent on pH in lysosomes. After irradiation, the cell death was induced by oxidative damage of lysosomal and mitochondrial membranes. Concerning the cell cycle, flow cytometry after PDT with propyl-AcrDTU showed a significant increase of the cells in the subG0 phase. Observed signs of necrosis, apoptosis, and autophagy indicate that PDT/AcrDTU leads to multiple cell death types (caspase independent apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy).",['Copyright (c) 2016.

Grocott's methenamine silver stain of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples obtained via bronchoscopy remain the gold standard for diagnosis.

However, the biological relevance of these interactions in vivo has been hampered by the absence of adequate animal models. Reverse genetics using the bovine leukemia virus (BLV) genome highlighted important functional domains of the envelope protein involved in the viral life cycle. For example, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM) of the envelope transmembrane protein (TM) are essential determinants of infection. Although cell fusion directed by the aminoterminal end of TM is postulated to be essential, some proviruses expressing fusion-deficient envelope proteins unexpectedly replicate at wild-type levels. Surprisingly also, a conserved N-linked glycosylation site of the extracellular envelope protein (SU) inhibits cell-to-cell transmission suggesting that infectious potential has been limited during evolution.

The present study was to determine whether miR-106b-5p antagomir can protect against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and elucidate its underlying mechanisms. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was operated on male Sprague Dawley rats. MiR-106b-5p antagomir significantly decreased neurological deficit scores, infarct volumes, and neuronal injury. Furthermore, miR-106b-5p antagomir markedly reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content, restored superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, increased the expression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) and B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), and decreased the expression of Bax in the ischemic cortex. In PC12 cells, miR-106b-5p inhibitor increased the Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 expression, which provided protection against glutamate-induced apoptosis and oxidative damage, as evidenced by decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and enhanced SOD activity. Notably, luciferase reported assay proved Mcl-1 was the target gene of miR-106b-5p.

Resistant mantle cell lymphoma cells commonly overexpress and are dependent on the anti-apoptotic protein, Mcl-1, for survival. In this study, we use potent lipidoid nanoparticles to deliver siRNA to silence Mcl-1 expression. Studies were conducted using two different mantle cell lymphoma cell lines, a normal (JeKo-1) and an aggressive (MAVER-1) line, to assess the ability of lipidoid nanoparticles to be used broadly in the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma. Mcl-1 mRNA silencing and protein knockdown was observed as early as one day after treatment and the lipidoid nanoparticles achieved sustained silencing of Mcl-1 mRNA for at least four days in both JeKo-1 and MAVER-1 cells. Eighty percent silencing was achieved at three days post-transfection in JeKo-1 cells while 50% silencing was achieved in MAVER-1 cells, which are more resistant to transfection. Interestingly, silencing of Mcl-1 induced apoptosis in nearly 30% of both JeKo-1 and MAVER-1 cells three days post-transfection. Additionally, Mcl-1 silencing and the resultant apoptosis in mantle cell lymphoma cells were dose dependent.

Limited data exist regarding surgical interventions for pediatric ALL patients with ON. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multi-center cohort of children with newly diagnosed ALL was established with Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) data from 43 freestanding children's hospitals from 1999 to 2011. Patients with ON identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code were followed for up to 5 years after index ALL admission for the presence of ON-associated orthopedic surgical procedures. RESULTS: A cohort of 10,729 ALL patients was assembled, of which 242 (2.33%) were identified with an ICD-9 code for ON within 5 years of ALL diagnosis. Fifty-five patients (22.7%) with ON underwent orthopedic surgical intervention aimed at joint preservation (82%) or replacement (18%) with substantial practice variation by hospital in both the rate and type of surgical intervention. The majority of patients had surgical procedures while receiving maintenance therapy. None of the patients undergoing surgical intervention required intensive care unit-level care within 14 days of surgery, and there was no associated in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: No standard of care exists for treatment of ALL-associated ON.

Similarly, empirical antifungal therapy for persistent neutropenic fever has been shown to reduce IFI-related mortality. However, to date, there is little information with regard to the outcome of patients who receive both strategies. Here, we present our retrospective data on three cohorts of patients receiving empirical or targeted antifungal therapy after different antifungal prophylaxis regimens. All records from patients who received myelosuppressive induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in our centre from 2004-2010 were analysed. From 2004-2006, itraconazole was used as antifungal prophylaxis; for the first 6 months in 2007, local polyenes and from mid-2007 till 2010, posaconazole. Data of 315 courses of chemotherapy in 211 patients were analysed.

Patients frequently have comorbidities compromising the use of old and new systemic therapies. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report the prevalence of comorbidities in patients with CLL as present in the southern region of the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Comorbid conditions were present in 67% of the male and 63% of the female patients, and became more common with increasing age. Furthermore, we describe the beneficial local and abscopal effects of splenic irradiation in four patients with CLL who were not suitable for systemic chemoimmunotherapy because of severe comorbidities, or who were unwilling to undergo systemic therapy. CONCLUSION: Our results show that, although an old tool, splenic irradiation should not be forgotten as a potentially effective palliative treatment option in frail patients with symptomatic CLL.",,"['Aalbers, A M', 'Aarts, M J', 'Krol, A D G', 'Marijnen, C A M', 'Posthuma, E F M']","['Aalbers AM', 'Aarts MJ', 'Krol AD', 'Marijnen CA', 'Posthuma EF']","['Department of Haematology, Reinier de Graaf Group, Delft, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Neth J Med,The Netherlands journal of medicine,0356133,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Frail Elderly', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spleen/*radiation effects', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Treatment Outcome']",2016/03/30 06:00,2017/01/25 06:00,['2016/03/30 06:00'],"['2016/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/25 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Neth J Med. 2016 Mar;74(3):122-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia inhibitory factor improves the maturation of oocytes in the human and the mouse. However, feline LIF (fLIF) cloning and effects on oocytes during IVM have not been reported. Thus, we cloned complete cDNA of fLIF and examined its biological activity and effects on oocytes during IVM in the domestic cat. The aminoacid sequence of fLIF revealed a homology of 81% or 92% with that of mouse or human. The fLIF produced by pCold TF DNA in Escherichia coli was readily soluble and after purification showed bioactivity in maintaining the undifferentiated state of mouse embryonic stem cells and enhancing the proliferation of human erythrocyte leukemia cells. Furthermore, 10- and 100-ng/mL fLIF induced cumulus expansion with or without FSH and EGF (P < 0.05). The rate of metaphase II oocytes was also improved with 100-ng/mL fLIF (P < 0.05).

This autocrine purinergic feedback mechanism plays an essential role in the activation of T cells resulting in cell proliferation and clonal expansion. We recently reported that increases in mitochondrial ATP production drive this stimulation-induced purinergic signaling mechanism but that low-level mitochondrial ATP production fuels basal T cell functions required to maintain vigilance of unstimulated T cells. Here we studied whether defects in these purinergic signaling mechanisms are involved in the unwanted proliferation of leukemia T cells. We found that acute leukemia T cells (Jurkat) possess a larger number and more active mitochondria than their healthy counterparts. Jurkat cells have higher intracellular ATP concentrations and generat more extracellular ATP than unstimulated T cells from healthy donors. As a result, increased purinergic signaling through P2X1 and P2X7 receptors elevates baseline levels of cytosolic Ca(2+) in Jurkat cells. We found that pharmacological inhibition of this basal purinergic signaling mechanism decreases mitochondrial activity, Ca(2+) signaling, and cell proliferation. Similar results were seen in the leukemic cell lines THP-1, U-937, and HL-60. Combined treatment with inhibitors of P2X1 or P2X7 receptors and the chemotherapeutic agent 6-mercaptopurine completely blocked Jurkat cell proliferation. Our results demonstrate that increased mitochondrial metabolism promotes autocrine purinergic signaling and uncontrolled proliferation of leukemia cells. These findings suggest that deranged purinergic signaling can result in T cell malignancy and that therapeutic targeting aimed at purinergic signaling is a potential strategy to combat T cell leukemia.",,"['Ledderose, Carola', 'Woehrle, Tobias', 'Ledderose, Stephan', 'Strasser, Katharina', 'Seist, Richard', 'Bao, Yi', 'Zhang, Jingping', 'Junger, Wolfgang G']","['Ledderose C', 'Woehrle T', 'Ledderose S', 'Strasser K', 'Seist R', 'Bao Y', 'Zhang J', 'Junger WG']","['Department of Surgery, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, 330 Brookline Avenue, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, 330 Brookline Avenue, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, 330 Brookline Avenue, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, 330 Brookline Avenue, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, 330 Brookline Avenue, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, 330 Brookline Avenue, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, 330 Brookline Avenue, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, 330 Brookline Avenue, Boston, MA, 02215, USA. wjunger@bidmc.harvard.edu.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Traumatology, 1200, Vienna, Austria. wjunger@bidmc.harvard.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160328,Netherlands,Purinergic Signal,Purinergic signalling,101250499,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2X)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/physiology', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2X/*metabolism']",2016/03/30 06:00,2017/11/10 06:00,['2016/03/30 06:00'],"['2015/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11302-016-9510-y [doi]', '10.1007/s11302-016-9510-y [pii]']",ppublish,Purinergic Signal. 2016 Sep;12(3):439-51. doi: 10.1007/s11302-016-9510-y.

Both miR-29s down-regulate the anti-apoptotic protein myeloid cell leukaemia 1 (MCL-1) in acute myeloid leukaemia. Thus, to investigate the role of miR-29s in the transformation of MDS to overt leukaemia (OL), we analysed the relationship between miR-29 expression and MCL-1 expression. MiR-29b expression was down-regulated in refractory anaemia and OL bone marrow as compared to that in control bone marrow. MCL-1 expression level in OL was significantly higher than that in refractory anaemia with excess blasts and a negative correlation was observed between miR-29b and MCL-1 messenger RNA expression levels in OL samples. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the MCL-1 positive rate among MDS bone marrow CD34 positive cells significantly increased during transformation to OL. Additionally, MCL-1 positive cells were negative for cleaved caspase 3, which indicated that these cells avoided apoptosis. Reduced miR-29b expression in MDS bone marrow cells might trigger transformation to OL via overexpression of MCL-1 in blastic cells.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia.

We report an isolated dementia syndrome due to a meningeal relapse of acute promyelocytic leukaemia with favourable outcome after appropriate treatment. CASE REPORT: A 72-year-old woman, in remission of an acute promyelocytic leukaemia, presented a loss of autonomy for several months due to corticosubcortical dementia. Lumbar puncture showed blast cells indicating meningeal relapse of leukaemia. Intrathecal chemotherapy and arsenic trioxide obtained biological and molecular remission as well as restoration of normal cognitive functions. CONCLUSION: In patients with hematologic past history such as acute promyelocytic leukaemia, an isolated cognitive impairment should alert physicians to search for an isolated neuromeningeal relapse.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Societe nationale francaise de medecine interne (SNFMI).', 'Published by Elsevier SAS.

Most FA patients experience hematopoietic stem cell attrition and cytopenia during childhood, which along with intrinsic chromosomal instability, favor clonal evolution and the frequent emergence in their teens or young adulthood of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To early identify and further predict bone marrow (BM) clonal progression and enable timely treatment, the follow-up of FA patients includes regular BM morphological and cytogenetic examinations. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only curative treatment of FA patients with MDS or AML. Although questions remain concerning HSCT itself (including the need for pretransplant chemotherapy, the best conditioning regimen, and the optimal long-term follow-up of such patients especially regarding secondary malignancies), clonal evolution in the absence of significant BM dysplasia and blast cells can be difficult to address in FA patients, for whom the concept of preemptive HSCT is discussed.

Diagnostic biomarkers for cGVHD are needed for early diagnosis and may guide identification of prognostic markers. No cGVHD biomarker has yet been validated for use in clinical practice. We evaluated both previously known markers and performed discovery-based analysis for cGVHD biomarkers in a 2 independent test sets (total of 36 cases </=1 month from diagnosis and 31 time-matched controls with no cGVHD). On the basis of these results, 11 markers were selected and evaluated in 2 independent replication cohorts (total of 134 cGVHD cases and 154 controls). cGVHD cases and controls were evaluated for several clinical covariates, and their impact on biomarkers was identified by univariate analysis. The 2 replications sets were relatively disparate in the biomarkers they replicated. Only sBAFF and, most consistently, CXCL10 were identified as significant in both replication sets. Other markers identified as significant in only 1 replication set included intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), anti-LG3, aminopeptidase N, CXCL9, endothelin-1, and gelsolin. Multivariate analysis found that all covariates evaluated affected interpretation of the biomarkers. CXCL10 had an increased significance in combination with anti-LG3 and CXCL9, or inversely with CXCR3(+)CD56(bright) natural killer (NK) cells. There was significant heterogeneity of cGVHD biomarkers in a large comprehensive evaluation of cGVHD biomarkers impacted by several covariates. Only CXCL10 strongly correlated in both replication sets.

Oxidative stress mediated by excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes enhanced mitochondrial permeabilization and subsequent cell apoptosis and is considered as a plausible mechanism for drug-induced hepatotoxicity, a common toxicity of asparaginase in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Studies investigating the pharmacogenetics of asparaginase in ALL are limited and focused on asparaginase-induced allergic reaction common in pediatric patients. Here, we sought to determine a potential association between the variant rs4880 in SOD2 gene, a key mitochondrial enzyme that protects cells against ROS, and hepatotoxicity during asparaginase-based therapy in 224 patients enrolled on CALGB-10102, a treatment trial for adults with ALL. We report that the CC genotype of rs4880 is associated with increased hepatotoxicity following asparaginase-based treatment. Thus, rs4880 likely contributes to asparaginase-induced hepatotoxicity, and functional studies investigating this single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) are needed to develop therapeutic approaches that mitigate this toxicity.",,"['Alachkar, H', 'Fulton, N', 'Sanford, B', 'Malnassy, G', 'Mutonga, M', 'Larson, R A', 'Bloomfield, C D', 'Marcucci, G', 'Nakamura, Y', 'Stock, W']","['Alachkar H', 'Fulton N', 'Sanford B', 'Malnassy G', 'Mutonga M', 'Larson RA', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Marcucci G', 'Nakamura Y', 'Stock W']","['Department of Pharmacy, USC School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Alliance/CALGB Statistical Center, Duke Cancer Institute, Biostatistics, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160329,United States,Pharmacogenomics J,The pharmacogenomics journal,101083949,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (superoxide dismutase 2)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pharmacogenomic Testing', '*Pharmacogenomic Variants', 'Phenotype', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Superoxide Dismutase/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2016/03/30 06:00,2018/01/06 06:00,['2016/03/30 06:00'],"['2015/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/13 00:00 [revised]', '2016/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/03/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['tpj20167 [pii]', '10.1038/tpj.2016.7 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacogenomics J. 2017 Jun;17(3):274-279. doi: 10.1038/tpj.2016.7.

Here we have searched for new oncogenes in AYA-ALL by performing RNA-seq analysis of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative AYA-ALL specimens (n = 73) with the use of a next-generation sequencer. Interestingly, insertion of D4Z4 repeats containing the DUX4 gene into the IGH locus was frequently identified in B cell AYA-ALL, leading to a high level of expression of DUX4 protein with an aberrant C terminus. A transplantation assay in mice demonstrated that expression of DUX4-IGH in pro-B cells was capable of generating B cell leukemia in vivo. DUX4 fusions were preferentially detected in the AYA generation. Our data thus show that DUX4 can become an oncogenic driver as a result of somatic chromosomal rearrangements and that AYA-ALL may be a clinical entity distinct from ALL at other ages.",,"['Yasuda,

Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish CD colonization with diarrhea induced by a conditioning regimen from true Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients. We retrospectively analyzed 308 consecutive patients who underwent a CD toxin A/B enzyme immunoassay test for diarrhea within 100 d after HSCT from November 2007 to May 2014. Thirty patients (9.7%) had positive CD toxin results, and 11 of these had positive results in subsequent tests after an initial negative result. Allogeneic HSCT, total body irradiation, stem cell source, acute leukemia, and the duration of neutropenia were significantly correlated with positive CD toxin results. In a logistic regression model, allogeneic HSCT was identified as a significant risk factor (odds ratio 18.6, p < 0.01). In an analysis limited to within 30 d after the conditioning regimen, the duration of neutropenia was the sole risk factor (odds ratio 10.4, p < 0.01).

It is widely used in the flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCI) of B-cell and plasma cell malignancies. The analysis approach of FCI for the diagnosis and monitoring of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is totally based on the CD19-based primary gating strategy and it would be challenging to study B-ALL without CD19 expression. Since CD19 negative B-ALL are extremely rare, we report three cases of B-ALL with negative expression of CD19 and discussed its implication in the diagnosis, residual disease monitoring and future targeted therapy. METHODS: Peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) samples from three cases suspicious of acute leukemia were studied for morphology, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping and cytogenetics. FCI was performed using a comprehensive six to eight-color multiparametric assay. The cytogenetic studies for standard recurrent genetic translocations were performed by FISH & Karyotyping. RESULTS: The three cases studied were diagnosed as B-ALL based on the expression of CD10, CD20, CD22, CD34, and CD79a by leukemic blasts. CD19 was studied using two different clones (i.e. J3-119 & HIB-19) and found to be severely down regulated in all three cases. There were no significant differentiating features in morphology. Cytogenetic studies were negative for recurrent translocations. CONCLUSION: We report three cases of extremely rare CD19 negative B-ALL. Lack of awareness of negative CD19 expression in B-ALL can leads to incorrect immunophenotypic diagnosis and monitoring of B-ALL, especially in laboratories using limited markers.

Over the past 30 years, and especially within the last decade, the reach of CROs has extended to service all phases of drug trials in an increasingly global research environment. The presence of CROs is particularly noticeable in medical oncology because of the large number of investigational compounds developed to treat cancer that are currently undergoing testing in human subjects. Although limited data are available with which to objectively define the effects that CROs have had on the clinical trial process, with the expansion of these organizations, several reports have called into question whether ethical and professional standards in research conduct are at times secondary to economic considerations.

Although MEIS1 alone has only a moderate effect on cell proliferation in vitro, it is essential for the development of HOXA9-induced leukemia in vivo. Here, using murine models of leukemogenesis, we have shown that MEIS1 promotes leukemic cell homing and engraftment in bone marrow and enhances cell-cell interactions and cytokine-mediated cell migration. We analyzed global DNA binding of MEIS1 in leukemic cells as well as gene expression alterations in MEIS1-deficent cells and identified synaptotagmin-like 1 (Sytl1, also known as Slp1) as the MEIS1 target gene that cooperates with Hoxa9 in leukemogenesis. Replacement of SYTL1 in MEIS1-deficent cells restored both cell migration and engraftment. Further analysis revealed that SYTL1 promotes cell migration via activation of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis, as SYTL1 determines intracellular trafficking of CXCR4.

It usually occurs within the first 2 years after transplantation. The goal of the current retrospective study was to assess the follow-up of and characterize risk factors for outcome among patients who survived free of disease recurrence after this period. METHODS: The analysis included 3567 adults (median age, 45 years) with AML who underwent autografting during the first (86% of patients) or second (14% of patients) complete remission between 1990 and 2008. The stem cell source was the bone marrow in 32% of patients or the peripheral blood in 68% of patients. The median follow-up was 6.9 years. RESULTS: At 5 years and 10 years after transplantation, the probability of leukemia-free survival was 86% and 76%, respectively; the recurrence incidence was 11% and 16%, respectively; and the nonrecurrence mortality rate was 3% and 8%, respectively. The observed survival was decreased compared with the expected survival of the general European population. In a multivariate analysis, decreased probability of leukemia-free survival was demonstrated for patients who underwent peripheral blood autologous stem cell transplantation; had French-American-British subtypes M0, M6, or M7; and were of an older age. The same factors were found to be associated with an increased risk of disease recurrence. Nonrecurrence mortality was found to be affected by older age. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current analysis indicate that late recurrences remain a major concern after autologous stem cell transplantation among patients with AML, indicating the need for close monitoring of minimal residual disease and additional leukemic control measures after transplantation.

Plumbagin is a natural, plant derived compound, which exerts an anti-proliferative activity against many types of human cancer. Our experiments confirm that plumbagin induces a caspase-dependent apoptosis of MOLT-4 cells, with no significant cytotoxicity seen for normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Plumbagin also inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of p65, and the transcription of NF-kappaB target genes.

A method that meets these criteria and can be scaled up for patient monitoring is thus desirable. METHODS: Plasma specimens (1 mL) of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) were differentially centrifuged, ultrafiltered and fractionated by size exclusion chromatography in small disposable columns (mini-SEC). Exosomes were eluted in phosphate-buffered saline and were evaluated by qNano for particle size and counts, morphology by transmission electron microscopy, protein content, molecular profiles by western blots, and for ability to modify functions of immune cells. RESULTS: Exosomes eluting in fractions #3-5 had a diameter ranging from 50 to 200 nm by qNano, with the fraction #4 containing the bulk of clean, unaggregated exosomes. The exosome elution profiles remained constant for repeated runs of the same plasma. Larger plasma volumes could be fractionated running multiple mini-SEC columns in parallel. Particle concentrations per millilitre of plasma in #4 fractions of AML and HNSCC were comparable and were higher (p<0.003) than those in normal controls. Isolated AML exosomes co-incubated with normal human NK cells inhibited NKG2D expression levels (p<0.004), and HNSCC exosomes suppressed activation (p<0.01) and proliferation of activated T lymphocytes (p<0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Mini-SEC allows for simple and reproducible isolation from human plasma of exosomes retaining structural integrity and functional activity.

Dysregulation or aberrant activation of such cascades can lead to inappropriate cell survival and abnormal cell proliferation in leukemia. Successful treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the BCR-ABL fusion gene is a prime example of effectively inhibiting intracellular signaling cascades. However, even in these patients resistance can develop via emergence of mutations or feedback activation of other pathways that cause refractory disease. Constitutive activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway has been observed in different types of leukemia, including CML, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Abnormal mTOR activity may contribute to chemotherapy resistance, while it may also be effectively targeted via molecular means and/or development of specific pharmacological inhibitors.

While the pathophysiology of leukostasis is not fully understood, recent research has elucidated many novel pathways that may have therapeutic implications in the future. Respiratory and neurological compromise represents the classical clinical manifestations of leukostasis. If it is not diagnosed and treated rapidly, the one-week mortality rate is approximately 40%. Targeted induction chemotherapy is an important component of the successful treatment of leukostasis, although other modalities of cytoreduction are being used and investigated.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of VDR polymorphisms (rs2228570, rs1544410, rs7975232, and rs731236) in aplastic anemia (AA). METHODS: In this case-control study, the genotyping of VDR rs1544410 (c.1024 + 283G>A), rs7975232 (c.1025-49G>T), and rs731236 (c.1056T>C) polymorphisms was conducted using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-ligase detection reaction, while the genotyping of rs2228570 (c.2T>C) was detected by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: The frequencies of GG genotype and G allele of rs1544410 were significantly higher in patients with AA than in controls. Further analysis indicated that rs1544410 and rs7975232 polymorphisms were correlated with the risk to nonsevere AA, while rs2228570 was relevant to severe AA. Moreover, TT carriers of rs2228570 were closely associated with a poor response to treatment and a higher risk of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute leukemia transformation, while CT carriers more easily evolved to overt paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.

MF and PV are pathogenically related and share specific clinical features such as splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms. The MF phenotype is dominated by the effects of progressive bone marrow fibrosis resulting in shortened survival. In contrast, elevated thrombosis risk due to erythrocytosis is the primary clinical concern in PV. Ruxolitinib, an oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, is approved in the USA for the treatment of patients with intermediate- or high-risk MF and patients with PV who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea. For MF, results of two phase III studies demonstrated that ruxolitinib therapy reduced spleen volume and MF-related symptom burden, improved quality-of-life measures, and was associated with prolonged overall survival. Treatment benefits were generally sustained with continued therapy. Dose-dependent cytopenias were common but generally manageable with transfusions (for anemia), dose reduction, or treatment interruption. Optimal dosing management is critical to maintain long-term treatment benefit, because cessation of therapy resulted in rapid return of symptoms to baseline levels. Results of the phase III PV trial showed that ruxolitinib was significantly more effective than standard therapy in controlling hematocrit levels and improving splenomegaly and PV-related symptoms.

In contrast, env expression was significantly lower in CEF and MSB1 cells infected with exogenous avian leukosis virus J (ALVJ) at the early infection stage. Furthermore, env was found to be ubiquitously expressed in various chicken tissues, with high expression in certain tissues at 2 days of age and low levels in most tissues, including immune organs (thymus, spleen and bursa) as well as the brain and heart, at 35 days of age. Sequence analysis revealed miR-155 target sites in env transcripts, which was verified using a firefly luciferase reporter assay, and treatment with miR-155 agomir significantly decreased levels of env transcripts in MSB1 and CEF cells.

Although previous studies have indicated that the Pax5-conditional-knockout mouse exhibited dedifferentiation of mature B cell and the development of aggressive lymphomas, the changes of Pax5 gene expressions in pre-B cells have not been analyzed. To understand the functional importance of Pax5 gene in the proliferation and survival of pre-B cells, we established a Pax5-knockdown model using 70Z/3 pre-B cell line. Pax5 knockdown 70Z/3 cells (70Z/3-KD cells) showed down-regulations of pre-BCR compounds such as CD19, BLNK, Id2 and lambda5. The signaling via pre-BCRs was significantly diminished in the 70Z/3-KD cells, and this alteration was normalized by restored Pax5 gene expression. Loss of PAX5 reduced the growth rates in the 70Z/3-KD cells, compared to the mock cells. Meanwhile, the proliferation of pre-B cells was reduced by the knockdown of Pax5 gene. Moreover, further examinations showed that PAX5 was also activated in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) as a cell proliferation enhancer.

In this article, we report that MOV10 exhibits antiviral activity, independent of its helicase function, against a number of positive- and negative-strand RNA viruses by enhancing type I IFN induction. Using a number of genome-edited knockout human cells, we show that IFN regulatory factor 3-mediated IFN induction and downstream IFN signaling through IFN receptor was necessary to inhibit virus replication by MOV10. MOV10 enhanced IFN regulatory factor 3-mediated transcription of IFN. However, this IFN induction by MOV10 was unique and independent of the known retinoic acid-inducible gene I/mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein-mediated RNA-sensing pathway. Upon virus infection, MOV10 specifically required inhibitor of kappaB kinase epsilon, not TANK-binding kinase 1, for its antiviral activity. The important role of MOV10 in mediating antiviral signaling was further supported by the finding that viral proteases from picornavirus family specifically targeted MOV10 as a possible innate immune evasion mechanism. These results establish MOV10, an evolutionary conserved protein involved in RNA silencing, as an antiviral gene against RNA viruses that uses an retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptor-independent pathway to enhance IFN response.","['Copyright (c) 2016 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Cuevas, Rolando A', 'Ghosh, Arundhati', 'Wallerath, Christina', 'Hornung, Veit', 'Coyne, Carolyn B', 'Sarkar, Saumendra N']","['Cuevas RA', 'Ghosh A', 'Wallerath C', 'Hornung V', 'Coyne CB', 'Sarkar SN']","['Cancer Virology Program, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA 15213; Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15213; and.', 'Cancer Virology Program, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA 15213; Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15213; and.', 'Institute for Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Bonn, 53105 Bonn, Germany.', 'Institute for Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Bonn, 53105 Bonn, Germany.', 'Cancer Virology Program, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA 15213; Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15213; and.', 'Cancer Virology Program, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA 15213; Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15213; and saumen@pitt.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160325,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (IRF3 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-3)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (MAVS protein, human)', '0 (PLAAT4 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Mov10 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Cardiovirus Infections/*immunology', 'Encephalomyocarditis virus/*immunology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immune Evasion', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-3/metabolism', 'Interferon Type I/metabolism', 'RNA Helicases/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Rhabdoviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/*immunology']",2016/03/27 06:00,2017/08/09 06:00,['2016/03/27 06:00'],"['2015/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1501359 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1501359 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2016 May 1;196(9):3877-86. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1501359.

Co-occurring mutations in the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A and the FMS related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) are common in CN-AML and confer a poorer prognosis. We demonstrate that mice with Flt3-internal tandem duplication (Flt3(ITD)) and inducible deletion of Dnmt3a spontaneously develop a rapidly lethal, completely penetrant, and transplantable AML of normal karyotype. AML cells retain a single Dnmt3a floxed allele, revealing the oncogenic potential of Dnmt3a haploinsufficiency. FLT3(ITD)/DNMT3A-mutant primary human and murine AML exhibit a similar pattern of global DNA methylation associated with changes in the expression of nearby genes. In the murine model, rescuing Dnmt3a expression was accompanied by DNA remethylation and loss of clonogenic potential, suggesting that Dnmt3a-mutant oncogenic effects are reversible. Dissection of the cellular architecture of the AML model using single-cell assays, including single-cell RNA sequencing, identified clonogenic subpopulations that express genes sensitive to the methylation of nearby genomic loci and responsive to DNMT3A levels. Thus, Dnmt3a haploinsufficiency transforms Flt3(ITD) myeloproliferative disease by modulating methylation-sensitive gene expression within a clonogenic AML subpopulation. SIGNIFICANCE: DNMT3A haploinsufficiency results in reversible epigenetic alterations that transform FLT3(ITD)-mutant myeloproliferative neoplasm into AML. Cancer Discov; 6(5); 501-15.

Beyond single nucleotide resolution, sequencing data also contain information on changes in sequence coverage between samples and thus allow the detection of somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) representing gain or loss of genomic material in tumor cells arising from aneuploidy, amplifications, or deletions. To test the feasibility of CNA detection in sequencing data we analyzed the exomes of 25 paired leukemia/remission samples from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with well-defined chromosomal aberrations, detected by conventional chromosomal analysis and/or molecular cytogenetics assays. Thereby, we were able to confirm chromosomal aberrations including trisomies, monosomies, and partial chromosomal deletions in 20 out of 25 samples. Comparison of CNA detection using exome, custom gene panel, and SNP array analysis showed equivalent results in five patients with variable clone size. Gene panel analysis of AML samples without matched germline control samples resulted in confirmation of cytogenetic findings in 18 out of 22 cases. In all cases with discordant findings, small clone size (<33%) was limiting for CNA detection. We detected CNAs consistent with cytogenetics in 83% of AML samples including highly correlated clone size estimation (R = 0.85), while six out of 65 cytogenetically normal AML samples exhibited CNAs apparently missed by routine cytogenetics. Overall, our results show that high throughput targeted sequencing data can be reliably used to detect copy number changes in the dominant AML clone.

Of clinical relevance is the frequency with which quiescent leukemic cells, in this niche, survive treatment and contribute to relapse. This study suggests that marrow microenvironment regulation of BCL6 in ALL is one factor that may be involved in the transition between proliferative and quiescent states of ALL cells. Utilizing ALL cell lines, and primary patient tumor cells we observed that tumor cell BCL6 protein abundance is decreased in the presence of primary human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) and osteoblasts (HOB). Chemical inhibition, or shRNA knockdown, of BCL6 in ALL cells resulted in diminished ALL proliferation. As many chemotherapy regimens require tumor cell proliferation for optimal efficacy, we investigated the consequences of constitutive BCL6 expression in leukemic cells during co-culture with BMSC or HOB. Forced chronic expression of BCL6 during co-culture with BMSC or HOB sensitized the tumor to chemotherapy induced cell death. Combination treatment of caffeine, which increases BCL6 expression in ALL cells, with chemotherapy extended the event free survival of mice. These data suggest that BCL6 is one factor, modulated by microenvironment derived cues that may contribute to regulation of ALL therapeutic response.",,"['Slone, William L', 'Moses, Blake S', 'Hare, Ian', 'Evans, Rebecca', 'Piktel, Debbie', 'Gibson, Laura F']","['Slone WL', 'Moses BS', 'Hare I', 'Evans R', 'Piktel D', 'Gibson LF']","['Alexander B.

However, the association between IFN-gamma +874T/A polymorphism and leukemia risk remained controversial.We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement (PRISMA). Electronic database of Embase, Pubmed, and the Cochrane Library were searched for eligible articles published up to December 13, 2015. The association between genetic polymorphisms and leukemia risk was measured by odds ratios (ORs) and its corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).A total of 8 studies amounting to 420 patients and 767 control subjects were retrieved for this study. Although associations between IFN-gamma +874T/A polymorphism and overall leukemia risks were lacking, decreased chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) risk was detected in the allelic model (T vs A, OR=0.660, 95%CI = 0.483-0.902, P = 0.009, I = 0.0% and P = 0.863 for heterogeneity), the codominant model (TT vs AA, OR = 0.472, 95%CI = 0.247-0.902, P = 0.023, I = 0.0% and P = 0.994 for heterogeneity), and dominant model (TT + TA vs AA, OR = 0.457, 95%CI = 0.285-0.734, P = 0.001, I = 40.3% and P = 0.195 for heterogeneity) by using fixed-effect model separately. On the contrary, results indicated T carries have an increased chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) risk in dominant model (TT + TA vs AA, OR = 1.783, 95%CI = 1.236-2.573, P = 0.002, I = 19.0% and P = 0.295 for heterogeneity).This study suggests IFN-gamma +874T/A polymorphism are related to CML and CLL risk.

We evaluated the clinical impact of cell type and the usefulness of T-cell receptor (TCR) gene transcripts in distinguishing cell lineage. One hundred and eight cases of ENKTL were analyzed for TCR gene rearrangements using the BIOMED-2 protocol and for TCR gene expression using immunohistochemistry for TCR-betaF1 and TCR-cgammaM1, and RNA in situ hybridization for TCR gene transcripts. Prognostic factors were analyzed. Among the 108 cases, 44 were monoclonal for a TCR rearrangement (40%) while 64 (60%) were undefinable. The monoclonal cases expressed TCR-betaF1 in 14 out of 40 cases (35%) and TCR-cgammaM1 in 1 out of 44 cases (2%). The 64 undetermined cases expressed TCR-betaF1 in 15 cases (23%) and TCR-cgammaM1 in 1 (2%). Thirteen of 40 TCR-beta constant gene transcript-positive cases (33%) expressed TCR-betaF1 and one of nine TCR-gamma constant gene transcript-positive cases (11%) expressed TCR-cgammaM1. TCR gene transcripts were not useful in the distinction of cell lineages. TCR gene transcripts were positive in ENKTLs as well as in normal B cells and aggressive NK-cell leukemia. Based on gene rearrangements and immunohistochemistry for TCR, there were 60 T-cell type cases (56%), 32 NK-cell type cases (30%), and 16 cases with an undetermined cell type (14%). TCR protein was expressed in 30/60 T-ENKTLs (50%) in a variable fraction of tumor cells. There were no significant differences in clinical findings or overall patient survival between T- or NK-cell types of ENKTL, although those with a T-cell type tended to show a better prognosis for those with localized nasal lymphomas.

Up to now, 6 isoforms of ALDH1 have been reported. However, the expression patterns and the identity of ALDH1 isoenzymes contributing to ALDH1 activity, as well as the prognostic values of ALDH1 isoenzymes in cancers all remain to be elucidated. Here, we studied the expressions of ALDH1 transcripts in gastric cancer (GC) compared with the normal controls using the ONCOMINE database. Through the Kaplan-Meier plotter database, which contains updated gene expression data and survival information of 876 GC patients, we also investigated the prognostic values of ALDH1 isoenzymes in GC patients. It was found that when compared with normal tissues, ALDH1A1 mRNA expression was downregulated, whereas ALDH1A3 and ALDH1B1 were upregulated in GC patients. In survival analyses, high ALDH1A1 and ALDH1B1 expressions were associated with better overall survival (OS) in all GC patients. In addition, high transcription activity of ALDH1A1 predicted better OS in gastric intestinal type adenocarcinoma, but not in diffuse gastric adenocarcinoma.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of clinical features, molecular genetic characteristics, mutation distribution and prognosis of newly diagnosed Ph(+) ALL patients with ABL-KDMs from February 2010 to August 2014 were performed, and the efficacy of treatment regimen of allo-HSCT combined with different TKIs was compared. RESULTS: Of 88 Ph(+) ALL patients during maintenance treatment stage for ABL-KDMs monitoring, mutation was detected in 42 patients with median time of 8 months from diagnosis to mutation occurrence. The median age of mutation group was 40-year-old, older than that of non-mutation group (32.5-year-old) (P=0.023). The incidence of complex chromosome abnormality of mutation group was higher than that of non-mutation group (P=0.043), with alternations in chromosome 7, 5 and +Ph more frequently observed. There were 21 types of mutation at 18 locations detected, with T315I mutation ranking the top followed by E255K/V, Y253H/F and E459K. Mutation group featured no significant difference in complete remission (CR) rate in contrast to nonmutation group, but was remarkably lower in major molecular remission (MMR) rate than non-mutation group. The 2 year and 5 year overall survival rate of mutation group was 45.4% and 35.0% respectively, much shorter than that of non-mutation group (67.8% and 63.3%), (P=0.047). The median survival of patients with T315I and E255K/V was 19 and 10 months, significantly shorter than that of patients with other mutations. Among the 42 patients with mutations, 14 underwent allo-HSCT, and the median survival was 29 months, longer than that of patients received chemotherapy alone (17 months) (P=0.024). Fourteen allo-HSCT patients were given nilotinib or dasatinib at the time of mutation occurrence, and there was no significant difference in the overall survival in contrast to patients who continue to take imatinib. CONCLUSIONS: ABL kinase domain mutations are closely related to the older age and high genomic instability in the newly diagnosed Ph(+) ALL patients.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 64 patients with refractory/relapsed AML who received the HAA regimen as salvage chemotherapy. The complete remission (CR)rate was analyzed. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival (OS) and relapse free survival (RFS), and the differences were compared by Log-rank test. RESULTS: The overall CR rate was 70.1%, and 67.1% of the patients attained CR after the first induction course. The early death rate was 0. The median follow-up time was 61 (range:6-120) months. The estimated 3-year OS rate was 46.8% and the estimated 3-year RFS rate was 42.8%. The CR rates of patients with favorable/intermediate and unfavorable cytogenetics were 76.4% and 33.3%, respectively. The 3-year OS of favorable/intermediate and unfavorable group were 53.7% and 10.0%, respectively. The median survival time of unfavorable group was only 8 months. The side effects associated with the HAA regimen were tolerable, in which the most common toxicities were myelosuppression and infection.

METHODS: The CR rate, overall survival (OS) rate, relapse free survival (RFS) rate were retrospectively assayed in 143 de novo AML patients who received the HAD/HAI induction chemotherapy. The outcomes were compared among prognostic groups according to world health organization (WHO) classification, genetic prognosis and initial white blood cell (WBC) count. The role of consolidation chemotherapy consisting of middle-dosage Ara-C (MD-Ara-C) on long term survival was evaluated. RESULTS: Of 143 patients, 112 (78.3%) achieved CR after the first course of HAD/HAI induction treatment, and early death occurred in only one case. Notably, the CR rate of patients with an initial WBC count >/=100x10(9)/L was not significantly different from those with an initial WBC count<100x 10(9)/L (70.4% vs 80.2%, P=0.266). The CR rate for the patients with favorable, intermediate and unfavorable integrated genetics risk factors was 93.7%, 71.4% and 61.3%, respectively, the difference between groups was statistically significant (P=0.001). Patients with FLT3-ITD mutation obtained similar CR rate (70.6%) to that of patients with FLT3 wild type (79.3%, P=0.528).The estimated 5-year OS rate and 5-year RFS rate for all patients was 40.0% and 37.0%, respectively, with a median follow-up of 24 (range 1-104) months. The median survival time was 30 [95%CI (12, 48)] months. 5-year OS and 5-year RFS of the 96 patients who achieved CR after first course chemotherapy without undergoing allo-HSCT in complete remission was 47.0% and 38.0%, respectively. 5-year OS was significantly higher in MD-Ara-C consolidation group than in no MD-Ara-C consolidation group among CR patients without allo-HSCT (58.0%, 19.0%, respectively, P=0.004). In patients who obtained CR after first course and received MD-Ara-C consolidation without allo-HSCT, the 5-year OS of patients with hyperleukocytosis was not significantly lower than that of patients without hyperleukocytosis (55.5%, 58.8%, respectively,P=0.419). FLT3-ITD mutation patients showed similar 5-year OS to that of wild type FLT3 patients (51.4%, 60.2%, respectively, P=0.482). And furthermore, 5-year OS of favorable, intermediate and unfavorable integrated genetics groups were 59.1%, 62.5%, 51.9%, respectively (P=0.332) in this subgroup.

Most notably, cytosolic IDH1 is mutated in 70-90% of low-grade gliomas and upgraded glioblastomas, and mitochondrial IDH2 is mutated in ~20% of acute myeloid leukemia cases. Wild-type IDH catalyzes the interconversion of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG). Mutations in the enzyme lead to loss of wild-type enzymatic activity and a neomorphic activity that converts alpha-KG to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). In turn, 2-HG, which has been termed an ""oncometabolite,"" inhibits key alpha-KG-dependent enzymes, resulting in alterations of the cellular epigenetic profile and, subsequently, inhibition of differentiation and initiation of tumorigenesis. In addition, it is now clear that the IDH mutation also induces a broad metabolic reprograming that extends beyond 2-HG production, and this reprograming often differs from what has been previously reported in other cancer types. In this review, we will discuss in detail what is known to date about the metabolic reprograming of mutant IDH cells, and how this reprograming has been investigated using molecular metabolic imaging. We will describe how metabolic imaging has helped shed light on the basic biology of mutant IDH cells, and how this information can be leveraged to identify new therapeutic targets and to develop new clinically translatable imaging methods to detect and monitor mutant IDH tumors in vivo.",,"['Viswanath, Pavithra', 'Chaumeil, Myriam M', 'Ronen, Sabrina M']","['Viswanath P', 'Chaumeil MM', 'Ronen SM']","['Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, University of California San Francisco , San Francisco, CA , USA.', 'Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, University of California San Francisco , San Francisco, CA , USA.', 'Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, University of California San Francisco , San Francisco, CA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160314,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,2016/03/26 06:00,2016/03/26 06:01,['2016/03/26 06:00'],"['2015/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2016.00060 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2016 Mar 14;6:60. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2016.00060. eCollection 2016.,10.3389/fonc.2016.00060 [doi],,,PMC4789800,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['2-hydroxyglutarate', 'cancer', 'low-grade gliomas', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopy', 'metabolic reprograming', 'molecular imaging', 'mutant IDH1']","['R01 CA154915/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA172845/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA161545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas in other tumor entities the characteristics of tumor metabolism are successfully used for therapeutic approaches, such developments are very rare in brain tumors, notably in gliomas. One metabolic feature characteristic of gliomas, in particular diffuse astrocytomas and oligodendroglial tumors, is the variable content of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG), a metabolite that was discovered first in this tumor entity. D2HG is generated in large amounts due to various ""gain-of-function"" mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenases IDH1 and IDH2. Meanwhile, D2HG has been detected in several other tumor entities, including intrahepatic bile-duct cancer, chondrosarcoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. D2HG is barely detectable in healthy tissue (<0.1 mM), but its concentration increases up to 35 mM in malignant tumor tissues. Consequently, the ""oncometabolite"" D2HG has gained increasing interest in the field of tumor metabolism. To facilitate its quantitative measurement without loss of spatial resolution at a microscopical level, we have developed a novel bioluminescence assay for determining D2HG in sections of snap-frozen tissue. The assay was verified independently by photometric tests and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The novel technique allows the microscopically resolved determination of D2HG in a concentration range of 0-10 mumol/g tissue (wet weight). In combination with the already established bioluminescence imaging techniques for ATP, glucose, pyruvate, and lactate, the novel D2HG assay enables a comparative characterization of the metabolic profile of individual tumors in a further dimension.",,"['Voelxen, Nadine F', 'Walenta, Stefan', 'Proescholdt, Martin', 'Dettmer, Katja', 'Pusch, Stefan', 'Mueller-Klieser, Wolfgang']","['Voelxen NF', 'Walenta S', 'Proescholdt M', 'Dettmer K', 'Pusch S', 'Mueller-Klieser W']","['Institute of Pathophysiology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz , Mainz , Germany.', 'Institute of Pathophysiology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz , Mainz , Germany.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital Regensburg , Regensburg , Germany.', 'Institute of Functional Genomics, University of Regensburg , Regensburg , Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Unit Neuropathology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'Institute of Pathophysiology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz , Mainz , Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160307,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,2016/03/26 06:00,2016/03/26 06:01,['2016/03/26 06:00'],"['2015/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2016.00046 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2016 Mar 7;6:46. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2016.00046. eCollection 2016.,10.3389/fonc.2016.00046 [doi],,,PMC4779886,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['D-2 hydroxyglutarate', 'IDH mutations', 'bioluminescence imaging', 'glioblastoma', 'oncometabolite']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides resistance to TKIs, T315I also confers additional features to the leukemogenic potential of BCR/ABL, involving endogenous BCR. Therefore we studied the role of BCR on BCR/ABL mutants lacking functional domains indispensable for the oncogenic activity of BCR/ABL. We used the factor independent growth of murine myeloid progenitor 32D cells and the transformation of Rat-1 fibroblasts both mediated by BCR/ABL. Here we report that T315I restores the capacity to mediate factor-independent growth and transformation potential of loss-of-function mutants of BCR/ABL. Targeting endogenous Bcr abrogated the capacity of oligomerization deficient mutant of BCR/ABL-T315I to mediate factor independent growth of 32D cells and strongly reduced their transformation potential in Rat-1 cells, as well as led to the up-regulation of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.

Unfortunately, the desired anti-tumor or graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect is often accompanied with undesired side effects against healthy tissues known as graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). After HLA-matched alloSCT, GvL and GvHD are both mediated by donor-derived T-cells recognizing polymorphic peptides presented by HLA surface molecules on patient cells. These polymorphic peptides or minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA) are produced by genetic differences between patient and donor. Since polymorphic peptides may be useful targets to manipulate the balance between GvL and GvHD, the dominant repertoire of MiHA needs to be discovered. In this review, the diversity of autosomal MiHA characterized thus far as well as the various molecular mechanisms by which genetic variants create immune targets and the role of cryptic transcripts and proteins as antigen sources are described. The tissue distribution of MiHA as important factor in GvL and GvHD is considered as well as possibilities how hematopoietic MiHA can be used for immunotherapy to augment GvL after alloSCT. Although more MiHA are still needed for comprehensive understanding of the biology of GvL and GvHD and manipulation by immunotherapy, this review shows insight into the composition and kinetics of in vivo immune responses with respect to specificity, diversity, and frequency of specific T-cells and surface expression of HLA-peptide complexes and other (accessory) molecules on the target cell. A complex interplay between these factors and their environment ultimately determines the spectrum of clinical manifestations caused by immune responses after alloSCT.",,"['Griffioen, Marieke', 'van Bergen, Cornelis A M', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik']","['Griffioen M', 'van Bergen CA', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center , Leiden , Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center , Leiden , Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center , Leiden , Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160315,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,2016/03/26 06:00,2016/03/26 06:01,['2016/03/26 06:00'],"['2015/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2016.00100 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2016 Mar 15;7:100. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2016.00100. eCollection 2016.,10.3389/fimmu.2016.00100 [doi],,,PMC4791598,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['T-lymphocytes', 'allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'donor lymphocyte infusion', 'graft-versus-host disease', 'graft-versus-leukemia reactivity', 'hematological malignancy', 'immunotherapy', 'minor histocompatibility antigens']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease affects the differentiation of hematopoietic stem or precursor cells in the bone marrow and can be related to abnormal cytogenetic and/or specific mutational patterns. AML blasts can be sensitive to natural killer (NK) cell antitumor response. However, NK cells are frequently defective in AML patients leading to tumor escape. NK cell defects affect not only the expression of the activating NK receptors, including the natural cytotoxicity receptors, the NK group 2, member D, and the DNAX accessory molecule-1, but also cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma release. Such perturbations in NK cell physiology could be related to the adaptation of the AML to the immune pressure and more generally to patient's clinical features. Various mechanisms are potentially involved in the inhibition of NK-cell functions in AML, including defects in the normal lymphopoiesis, reduced expression of activating receptors through cell-to-cell contacts, and production of immunosuppressive soluble agents by leukemic blasts. Therefore, the continuous cross-talk between AML and NK cells participates to the leukemia immune escape and eventually to patient's relapse. Methods to restore or stimulate NK cells seem to be attractive strategies to treat patients once the complete remission is achieved. Moreover, our capacity in stimulating the NK cell functions could lead to the development of preemptive strategies to eliminate leukemia-initiating cells before the emergence of the disease in elderly individuals presenting preleukemic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells.",,"['Dulphy, Nicolas', 'Chretien, Anne-Sophie', 'Khaznadar, Zena', 'Fauriat, Cyril', 'Nanbakhsh, Arash', 'Caignard, Anne', 'Chouaib, Salem', 'Olive, Daniel', 'Toubert, Antoine']","['Dulphy N', 'Chretien AS', 'Khaznadar Z', 'Fauriat C', 'Nanbakhsh A', 'Caignard A', 'Chouaib S', 'Olive D', 'Toubert A']","[""UMRS-1160, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Paris, France; U 1160, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; Laboratoire d'Immunologie et Histocompatibilite, Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France."", 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Equipe Immunite et Cancer, INSERM, U1068, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Aix-Marseille Universite, UM 105, CNRS, UMR7258 , Marseille , France.', 'UMRS-1160, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Paris, France; U 1160, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Equipe Immunite et Cancer, INSERM, U1068, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Aix-Marseille Universite, UM 105, CNRS, UMR7258 , Marseille , France.', 'U 753, INSERM , Villejuif , France.', 'UMRS-1160, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Paris, France; U 1160, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'U 753, INSERM , Villejuif , France.', 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Equipe Immunite et Cancer, INSERM, U1068, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Aix-Marseille Universite, UM 105, CNRS, UMR7258 , Marseille , France.', ""UMRS-1160, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Paris, France; U 1160, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; Laboratoire d'Immunologie et Histocompatibilite, Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160309,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,2016/03/26 06:00,2016/03/26 06:01,['2016/03/26 06:00'],"['2015/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2016.00094 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2016 Mar 9;7:94. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2016.00094. eCollection 2016.,10.3389/fimmu.2016.00094 [doi],,,PMC4783386,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'aging and cancer', 'immune escape of cancer', 'immunoediting', 'natural killer cells', 'natural killer receptors']",,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 100 adult patients with de novo AML aged between 14 years and 80 years were enrolled in the current study and randomized into two arms for the initial induction: an IDA 12 mg/m(2) arm and an IDA 8 mg/m(2) arm. All patients received the same consolidation chemotherapy. The follow-up period was January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and morphology leukemia relapse (hematological and/or extramedullary) were recorded. RESULTS: The complete remission rates were 80% and 75% in the IDA 12 mg/m(2) and IDA 8 mg/m(2) arms, respectively, after initial induction. High-dose IDA (12 mg/m(2)) resulted in a higher complete remission rate after two courses of induction therapy (96.4% vs 76.5%) in the cytogenetic intermediate-risk group (P=0.026). There were no differences in the number of units of infused red blood cells, agranulocytosis time, or infection rates between the two arms. Patients in the IDA 12 mg/m(2) arm received more platelet transfusions (P=0.047). In the intention-to-treat analysis, after a median follow-up of 13 months, high-dose IDA (12 mg/m(2)) resulted in improved OS (median OS, 54.0 months vs 26.7 months, P=0.021) and DFS (median DFS, 54.0 months vs 18.3 months, P=0.031), particularly in the cytogenetic intermediate-risk group (median OS, 54.0 months vs 29.5 months, P=0.009; median DFS, 54.0 months vs 15.3 months, P=0.014). IDA 12 mg/m(2) significantly improved OS and DFS in the cytogenetic intermediate-risk group (P=0.009 and P=0.018). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a high dose of IDA (12 mg/m(2)) combined with cytarabine is a suitable and safe initial remission induction regimen that results in superior long-term survival of adult AML patients, particularly patients in the cytogenetic intermediate-risk group.",,"['Zhou, Li', 'Liu, Xin', 'Liu, Huilan', 'Zhu, Weibo', 'Cai, Xiaoyan', 'Song, Kaidi', 'Zheng, Changcheng', 'Tang, Baolin', 'Sun, Zimin']","['Zhou L', 'Liu X', 'Liu H', 'Zhu W', 'Cai X', 'Song K', 'Zheng C', 'Tang B', 'Sun Z']","[""Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160229,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,2016/03/26 06:00,2016/03/26 06:01,['2016/03/26 06:00'],"['2016/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S96176 [doi]', 'ott-9-985 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2016 Feb 29;9:985-91. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S96176. eCollection 2016.,10.2147/OTT.S96176 [doi],,,PMC4778788,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'disease-free survival', 'idarubicin', 'overall survival']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our study was to analyze bone marrow and peripheral blood samples of children with myelodysplastic syndrome or aplastic anemia to define prevalence of the GATA2 mutation and to assess whether mutations in GATA-2 transcription factor exhibit specific immunophenotypic features. The prevalence of a GATA2 mutation in a consecutively diagnosed cohort of children was 14% in advanced forms of myelodysplastic syndrome (refractory anemia with excess blasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation, and myelodysplasia-related acute myeloid leukemia), 17% in refractory cytopenia of childhood, and 0% in aplastic anemia. In GATA-2-deficient cases, we found the most profound B-cell lymphopenia, including its progenitors in blood and bone marrow, which correlated with significantly diminished intronRSS-Kde recombination excision circles in comparison to other myelodysplastic syndrome/aplastic anemia cases. The other typical features of GATA-2 deficiency (monocytopenia and natural killer cell lymphopenia) were less discriminative. In conclusion, we suggest screening for GATA2 mutations in pediatric myelodysplastic syndrome, preferentially in patients with impaired B-cell homeostasis in bone marrow and peripheral blood (low number of progenitors, intronRSS-Kde recombination excision circles and naive cells).",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Novakova, Michaela', 'Zaliova, Marketa', 'Sukova, Martina',

In this study, we detected relatively lower expression levels of miR-424&27a in TRAIL-resistant and semi-resistant AML cell lines as well as newly diagnosed patient samples. Overexpression of miR-424&27a, by targeting the 3'UTR of PLAG1, enhanced TRAIL sensitivity in AML cells. Correspondingly, knockdown of PLAG1 sensitized AML cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and proliferation inhibition. We further found that PLAG1 as a transcription factor could reinforce Bcl2 promoter activity, causing its upregulation at the mRNA level. Both downregulated PLAG1 and elevated expression of miR-424&27a led to Bcl2 downregulation and augmented cleavage of Caspase8, Caspase3 and PARP in the presence of TRAIL. Restoration of Bcl2 could eliminate their effects on AML TRAIL sensitization.

Resistance to intensive induction chemotherapy is the major cause of death in elderly AML; hence, novel treatment strategies are warranted. CD33-directed antibody-drug conjugates (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) have been shown to improve overall survival, validating CD33 as a target for antibody-based therapy of AML. Here, we report the in vitro efficacy of BI 836858, a fully human, Fc-engineered, anti-CD33 antibody using AML cell lines and primary AML blasts as targets. BI 836858-opsonized AML cells significantly induced both autologous and allogeneic natural killer (NK)-cell degranulation and NK-cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro treatment of AML blasts with decitabine (DAC) or 5-azacytidine, 2 hypomethylating agents that show efficacy in older patients, did not compromise BI 836858-induced NK-cell-mediated ADCC. Evaluation of BI 836858-mediated ADCC in serial marrow AML aspirates in patients who received a 10-day course of DAC (pre-DAC, days 4, 11, and 28 post-DAC) revealed significantly higher ADCC in samples at day 28 post-DAC when compared with pre-DAC treatment. Analysis of ligands to activating receptors (NKG2D) showed significantly increased NKG2D ligand [NKG2DL] expression in day 28 post-DAC samples compared with pre-DAC samples; when NKG2DL receptor was blocked using antibodies, BI 836858-mediated ADCC was significantly decreased, suggesting that DAC enhances AML blast susceptibility to BI 836858 by upregulating NKG2DL.

Recent trials demonstrate that some CML patients who have achieved stable deep molecular response can safely cease their therapy without relapsing (treatment free remission [TFR]). Furthermore, those who are unsuccessful in their cessation attempt can safely re-establish remission after restarting their TKI therapy. Based on the accumulated data on TFR, we propose that it is now time to change our approach for the many CML patients who have achieved a stable deep molecular response on long-term TKI therapy. Perhaps half of these patients could successfully achieve TFR if offered the opportunity. For many of these patients ongoing therapy is impairing quality of life and imposing a heavy financial burden while arguably achieving nothing. This recommendation is based on the evident safety of cessation attempts and TFR in the clinical trial setting. We acknowledge that there are potential risks associated with cessation attempts in wider clinical practice, but this should not deter us.

Establishing the diagnostic BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript is necessary in order to select appropriate primers and probes for such monitoring. A case is described in which quantitative polymerase chain reaction failed to detect the presence of BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript in a Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia patient. Further investigation demonstrated a novel in-frame BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript with a breakpoint in BCR exon 13 and insertion of a sequence of ABL1 intron 1, therefore enabling subsequent molecular monitoring. This case highlights the requirement for characterization of the BCR-ABL1 transcript type at chronic myeloid leukemia diagnosis. Issues concerning standardized methodological approaches and interpretation of transcript levels in such rare cases are discussed.","['Copyright (c) 2016 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.

How impaired retrotransposon silencing may lead to developmental phenotypes is currently unclear. Here, we show that loss of Setdb1 in pro-B cells completely abrogates B cell development. In pro-B cells, Setdb1 is dispensable for silencing of lineage-inappropriate developmental genes. Instead, we detect strong derepression of endogenous murine leukemia virus (MLV) copies. This activation coincides with an unusual change in chromatin structure, with only partial loss of H3K9me3 and unchanged DNA methylation, but strongly increased H3K4me3. Production of MLV proteins leads to activation of the unfolded protein response pathway and apoptosis.

The master regulator, HSP90 plays a pivotal role in the conformational stabilization, maturation and activity of its various labile oncogenic client proteins such as p53, ErbB2, Bcr-Abl, Akt, Her-2, Cdk4, Cdk6, Raf-1 and v-Src in altered cells. Hence, making a guaranteed attempt to inhibit such a master regulator for cancer therapy appears to be a potential approach for combinatorial inhibition of numerous oncogenic signaling pathways simultaneously. Considerable efforts are being under way to develop novel molecular targets and its inhibitors that may block key signaling pathways involved in the process of tumorigenesis and metastasis. In this regards, HSP90 has acquired immense interest as a potent anticancer drug-target due to its key functional link with multiple signaling pathways involved in the process of cell proliferation and cell survival. Notably, geldanamycin and its derivatives (17-AAG, 17-DMAG) have shown quite encouraging results in inhibiting HSP90 function in several cancers and currently almost 17 drug candidates known to be target HSP90 are being under clinical trials either as single agents or combinatorial therapy. Hence, this review is an attempt to get new insight into novel drug target therapy by focusing on recent advances made in understanding HSP90 chaperone structure-function relationships, identification of new HSP90 client proteins and, more importantly, on the advancements of HSP90 targeted therapy based on various existing and emerging classical inhibitors.",,"['Haque, Absarul', 'Alam, Qamre', 'Alam, Mohammad Zubair', 'Azhar, Esam I', 'Sait, Khalid Hussain Wali', 'Anfinan, Nisrin', 'Mushtaq, Gohar', 'Kamal, Mohammad Amjad', 'Rasool, Mahmood']","['Haque A', 'Alam Q', 'Alam MZ', 'Azhar EI', 'Sait KH', 'Anfinan N', 'Mushtaq G', 'Kamal MA', 'Rasool M']","['King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, P.

Using a model in which MVs derived from K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells transform normal hematopoietic transplants into leukemia-like cells, we defined the underlying mechanisms of this process through gene-expression studies and network analyses of transcription factors (TF) and miRNAs. We found that antitumor miRNAs were increased and several defense pathways were initiated during the early phases of oncogenic transformation. Later, oncomiRs and genes involved in cell cycle, DNA repair, and energy metabolism pathways were upregulated. Regulatory network analyses revealed that a number of TFs and miRNAs were responsible for the pathway dysregulation and the oncogenic transformation. In particular, we found that miR-146b-5p, which was highly expressed in MVs, coordinated the regulation of cancer-related genes to promote cell-transforming processes. Notably, treatment of recipient cells with MV derived from K562 cells expressing mimics of miR-146b-5p revealed that it accelerated the transformation process in large part by silencing the tumor-suppressor NUMB High levels of miR-146b-5p also enhanced reactive oxygen species levels and genome instability of recipient cells. Taken together, our finding showed how upregulation of oncogenic miRNAs in MVs promote hematopoetic cells to a leukemic state, as well as a demonstration for TF and miRNA coregulatory analysis in exploring the dysregulation of cancers and discovering key factors.

The expected VE rates in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are unknown. The present study examined the event rates and mortality among elderly patients with and without CML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry and Medicare claims data were used to identify patients aged >/= 66 years with an incident (index) diagnosis of CML from 2004 to 2009. A comparison cohort of patients without cancer was matched 1:1 to the CML cohort. All patients were followed up from 12 months before the index diagnosis through death or December 31, 2010. The overall survival and rates of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 1466 patients with CML (mean age, 78 years; average follow-up period, 25 months) were identified and matched 1:1 to a noncancer cohort (mean age, 78 years; follow-up period, 42 months). Compared with the noncancer patients, those with CML had greater mortality (63% vs. 23% died during the follow-up period; median survival, 23 vs. > 84 months) and greater rates of MI (33.0 vs. 11.9 per 1000 person-years), stroke (83.2 vs. 43.0), PE (6.6 vs. 2.6), and PAD (92.1 vs. 59.3; P < .01 for all). Of the 15% of CML patients with TKI claims, 97% had received imatinib. The event rates were not elevated for TKI-treated patients compared with the overall group of patients with CML. CONCLUSION: Elderly patients with CML had greater mortality and greater rates of MI, stroke, PE, and PAD than did noncancer patients. The event rates were not elevated among the TKI-treated (primary imatinib) patients, suggesting that the VE risk in these patients with CML was driven primarily by the underlying factors associated with CML.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

We aimed to understand racial variations in clinical and disease characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes in patients with CLL. We utilized the Mayo Clinic CLL database to perform an analysis of these characteristics and natural history of non-white (NW) compared to white (W) CLL patients. Differences by race in median overall survival (OS) and time-to-first-treatment (TTFT) were investigated. Of the 4215 CLL patients, 4114 (97.6%) were W and 101 (2.4%) were NW. NW patients were younger (median age at diagnosis 59.4 vs. 63.4; P = 0.003) and more likely to have an elevated LDH (28.0% vs. 16.2%; P = 0.02). No differences in prognostic parameters were noted. No major differences were observed in treatment selection. OS and TTFT were similar between both groups. In the largest analysis of NW-CLL patients in North America, and contrary to historical retrospective reports, W and NW patients appear to have comparable outcomes when treated similarly. These findings suggest previously noted outcome differences may be due to disparities in access to care and management rather than differences in disease biology. Am. J. Hematol. 91:677-680, 2016.

Promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) translocation generally occurs in APL patients and makes APL unique both for diagnosis and treatment. However, some conventional drugs like all-transretinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO), as the preferred ones for APL therapy, induce irreversible resistance and responsible for clinical failure of complete remission. Herein, we screened a library of novel chemical compounds with structural diversity and discovered a novel synthetic small compound, named LG-362B, specifically inhibited the proliferation of APL and induced apoptosis. Notably, the differentiation arrest was also relieved by LG-362B in cultured APL cells and APL mouse models. Moreover, LG-362B overcame the ATRA resistance on cellular differentiation and transplantable APL mice. These positive effects were driven by caspases-mediated degradation of PML-RARalpha when treated with LG-362B, making it specific to APL and reasonable for ATRA resistance relief. We propose that LG-362B would be a potential candidate agent for the treatment of the relapsed APL with ATRA resistance in the future.",,"['Wang, X', 'Lin, Q', 'Lv, F', 'Liu, N', 'Xu, Y', 'Liu, M', 'Chen, Y', 'Yi, Z']","['Wang X', 'Lin Q', 'Lv F', 'Liu N', 'Xu Y', 'Liu M', 'Chen Y', 'Yi Z']","['Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences of Chinese Academy of Sciences and SJTU-SM, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Medicine, Institute of Biosciences and Technology, Texas A&M University Health Science Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160308,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbolines)', '0 (LG-362B)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carbolines/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*drug effects', 'Small Molecule Libraries', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2016/03/26 06:00,2017/07/27 06:00,['2016/03/26 06:00'],"['2015/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/11 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201650 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.50 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Jul;30(7):1465-74. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.50.

Here, we show that CML BC is regulated by calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase IIgamma (CaMKIIgamma). Genetic deletion of CaMKIIgamma greatly inhibits disease progression via selectively impairing the self-renewal of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in mouse models, whereas overexpression of CaMKIIgamma has the opposite effects. In human CML, phosphorylated CaMKIIgamma abundance is significantly associated with BC. Moreover, CaMKIIgamma phosphorylates and reduces the nuclear cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1, a critical brake that maintains LSC quiescence. These findings suggest that CaMKIIgamma might be an important switch for the transition of CML BC and identify a unique mechanism by which CaMKIIgamma promotes the self-renewal of LSCs by deceasing nuclear p27Kip1 to wake up dormant LSCs. Therefore, CaMKIIgamma may provide a new therapeutic target to treat CML BC.",,"['Gu, Y', 'Zheng, W', 'Zhang, J', 'Gan, X', 'Ma, X', 'Meng, Z', 'Chen, T', 'Lu, X', 'Wu, Z', 'Huang, W', 'Xu, R']","['Gu Y', 'Zheng W', 'Zhang J', 'Gan X', 'Ma X', 'Meng Z', 'Chen T', 'Lu X', 'Wu Z', 'Huang W', 'Xu R']","['Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Intervention, China National Ministry of Education, Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Cancer Institute of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Molecular Oncology Program and Department of Diabetes Complications and Metabolism, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Intervention, China National Ministry of Education, Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Cancer Institute of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Cancer Institute of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Molecular Oncology Program and Department of Diabetes Complications and Metabolism, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Molecular Oncology Program and Department of Diabetes Complications and Metabolism, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Hangzhou, China.', 'Molecular Oncology Program and Department of Diabetes Complications and Metabolism, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Irell and Manella Graduate School of Biological Sciences, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Molecular Oncology Program and Department of Diabetes Complications and Metabolism, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Irell and Manella Graduate School of Biological Sciences, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Cancer Institute of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Intervention, China National Ministry of Education, Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Cancer Institute of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Intervention, China National Ministry of Education, Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Cancer Institute of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Molecular Oncology Program and Department of Diabetes Complications and Metabolism, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Irell and Manella Graduate School of Biological Sciences, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Intervention, China National Ministry of Education, Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Cancer Institute of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Molecular Oncology Program and Department of Diabetes Complications and Metabolism, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160308,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blast Crisis/*etiology/pathology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2/*physiology', 'Cell Self Renewal', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/metabolism', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Phosphorylation']",2016/03/26 06:00,2017/08/30 06:00,['2016/03/26 06:00'],"['2015/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/30 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201653 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.53 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Jun;30(6):1282-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.53.

However, the data on intracellular cholesterol levels in leukemia cells provide contradictory evidence. Various previous works indicate either increase, decrease or no difference in total cholesterol levels between leukemia cells and healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). METHODS: We studied the intracellular cholesterol levels in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cells and compared with that in PBMCs from the healthy subjects. RESULTS: We observed that the PBMCs from AML (n=7) and ALL (n=7) patients displayed significantly lower intracellular levels of total cholesterol in comparison to PBMCs from the healthy subjects (n=26). Consistent with the patient data the ALL (CCRF-CEM and MOLT-3) and AML (KG-1 and THP-1) cell lines also displayed significantly lower intracellular levels of total cholesterol. We confirmed this observation using multiple methodological approaches. Both ALL and AML cell lines also displayed significantly lower levels of free cholesterol and cholesteryl ester contents in comparison to normal hematopoietic cells. We observed that >90% of the total cholesterol in leukemia cells as well as in normal PBMCs was present in the form of cholesteryl esters. It was also observed that the lower levels of cholesterol in leukemia cells are not affected by exogenous cholesterol availability. CONCLUSIONS: Present study provides convincing evidence to prove that the cellular free cholesterol and cholesteryl ester content is significantly reduced in leukemia cells in comparison to normal hematopoietic cells in circulation. Moreover, it was shown that the lower levels of cholesterol in leukemia cells are not affected by exogenous cholesterol availability.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Alteration of CK2alpha expression and its activity is sufficient to induce dramatic changes in cell fate. It has been established that CK2alpha induces oncogenesis through modulation of both AKT and PML. CK2alpha has been found to be overexpressed in breast cancer. In contrary, statistical reports have shown low level of PML. However, the regulation of CK2alpha gene expression is not fully understood. In the current study, we found that CK2alpha and activated AKT positively correlate with ERalpha, whereas PML follows an inverse correlation in human breast cancer tissues. Modulation of ERalpha signalling leads to recruitment of activated ERalpha on the ERE sites of CK2alpha promoter, resulting in CK2alpha transactivation. Furthermore, the DMBA induced tumours in rat showed elevated level of active CK2alpha. Consequently it mediates enhancement of AKT activity and PML degradation, resulting in increased cellular proliferation, migration and metastasis. Syngeneic ERalpha overexpressing stable mouse 4T1 cells produce larger primary tumours and metastatic lung nodules in mice, corroborating our in vitro findings. Hence, our study provides a novel route of ERalpha dependent CK2alpha mediated oncogenesis that causes upregulation and consequent AKT activation along with degradation of tumour suppressor PML.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Our study was intended to investigate the expression status and the prognostic implication of miR-186 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR was carried out in 112 de novo AML patients and 28 controls. RESULTS: The level of miR-186 expression in AML was significantly down-regulated compared to normal controls (p < 0.001). Patients with low miR-186 expression presented significantly older age than those with high miR-186 expression (p = 0.004). MiR-186high patients had a significantly higher frequency of CEBPA mutation than miR-186low patients (20% and 4%, respectively, p = 0.022). In addition, miR-186low patients had a significantly lower complete remission (CR) rate (30% vs. 53%, respectively, p = 0.028) than miR-186high patients. Moreover, miR-186low patients showed significantly shorter overall survival (OS) time than miR-186high patients in both whole AML and non-M3 patients (p = 0.023 and 0.026, respectively).

Outcome was assessed on a basis of successful decannulation and complications related to tracheotomy. Indications for tracheotomy were elective in 55 (44.7 %) and emergent in 75 (55.3 %) patients. Most common underlying malignancy was leukemia/lymphoma in 38 (29.2 %) patients. There were seven (5.3 %) complications in emergency tracheotomies including bleeding in three, emphysema in two, and dislodgement and infection in one patient each. In the elective setting, three (2.3 %) complications were observed with dislodgement in one and stomal stenosis in two patients. Decannulation was successfully carried out in 23 (18 %) patients.

METHODS: ESCs were isolated from hysterectomy specimens of premenopausal women undergoing hysterectomy for benign reasons; decidualized in vitro and incubated in parallel with unfractionated heparin or tinzaparin; and stimulated with IL-1beta at days 0, 3, 6, and 9 during decidualization. IL-6, IL-11, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were analyzed using ELISAs and real-time RT-PCR. Cell viability was determined by a fluorometric assay. RESULTS: IL-1beta dose-dependently stimulated IL-6, IL-11, and LIF in distinct patterns in ESCs during decidualization. Unfractionated heparin as well as tinzaparin attenuated the IL-1beta-mediated induction of IL-6, IL-11, and LIF on protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. The relative effects of heparin and tinzaparin were getting more pronounced during the time course of decidualization. CONCLUSIONS: Unfractionated heparin and the low molecular weight heparin tinzaparin have modulating effects on IL-1beta-induced endometrial cytokines of the IL-6 family during decidualization.

In this study, we sought to identify cell-surface molecules associated with resistance of leukemia cells to cytotoxic T cell (CTL)-mediated cytolysis. To this end, we first established thousands of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that react with MLL/AF9 mouse leukemia cells. Only two of these mAbs, designated R54 and B2, bound preferentially to leukemia cells resistant to cytolysis by a tumor cell antigen-specific CTLs. The antigens recognized by these mAbs were identified by expression cloning as the same protein, CD43, although their binding patterns to subsets of hematopoietic cells differed significantly from each other and from a pre-existing pan-CD43 mAb, S11. The epitopes of R54 and B2, but not S11, were sialidase-sensitive and expressed at various levels on leukemia cells, suggesting that binding of R54 or B2 is associated with the glycosylation status of CD43. R54high leukemia cells, which are likely to express sialic acid-rich CD43, were highly resistant to CTL-mediated cytolysis. In addition, loss of CD43 in leukemia cells or neuraminidase treatment of leukemia cells sensitized leukemia cells to CTL-mediated cell lysis. These results suggest that sialic acid-rich CD43, which harbors multiple sialic acid residues that impart a net negative surface charge, protects leukemia cells from CTL-mediated cell lysis. Furthermore, R54high or B2high leukemia cells preferentially survived in vivo in the presence of adaptive immunity. Taken together, these results suggest that the glycosylation status of CD43 on leukemia is associated with sensitivity to CTL-mediated cytolysis in vitro and in vivo. Thus, regulation of CD43 glycosylation is a potential strategy for enhancing CTL-mediated immunotherapy.",,"['Hasegawa, Kana', 'Tanaka, Satomi', 'Fujiki, Fumihiro', 'Morimoto, Soyoko', 'Nakano,

PU.1 controls its own expression during myelopoiesis by binding to the distal URE enhancer, whose deletion leads to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We herein present evidence that GATA-1 binds to the PU.1 gene and inhibits its expression in human AML-erythroleukemias (EL). Furthermore, GATA-1 together with DNA methyl Transferase I (DNMT1) mediate repression of the PU.1 gene through the URE. Repression of the PU.1 gene involves both DNA methylation at the URE and its histone H3 lysine-K9 methylation and deacetylation as well as the H3K27 methylation at additional DNA elements and the promoter.

Differentiation-associated genes are downregulated without accompanying changes in methylation status of their promoter-associated CpG islands in DNMT3A mutant-transduced stem/progenitor cells, representing a DNA methylation-independent role of mutated DNMT3A. DNMT3A R882H also promotes monoblastic transformation in vitro in combination with HOXA9. Molecularly, the DNMT3A mutant interacts with polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), causing transcriptional silencing, revealing a DNA methylation-independent role of DNMT3A mutation. Suppression of PRC1 impairs aberrant HSC accumulation and monoblastic transformation.

The mechanism underneath such function, however, remains poorly defined. In the present study, we demonstrate that overexpression of SIRPalpha in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells results in apoptosis possibly via inhibiting the beta-catenin signaling pathway and upregulating Foxo3a. Pharmacological activation of beta-catenin signal pathway attenuates apoptosis caused by SIRPalpha. Interestingly, we also find that the pro-apoptotic effect of SIRPalpha plays an important role in arsenic trioxide (ATO)-induced apoptosis in APL cells. ATO treatment induces the SIRPalpha protein expression in APL cells and abrogation of SIRPalpha induction by lentivirus-mediated SIRPalpha shRNA significantly reduces the ATO-induced apoptosis. Mechanistic study further shows that induction of SIRPalpha protein in APL cells by ATO is mediated through suppression of c-Myc, resulting in reduction of three SIRPalpha-targeting microRNAs: miR-17, miR-20a and miR-106a. In summary, our results demonstrate that SIRPalpha inhibits tumor cell survival and significantly contributes to ATO-induced APL cell apoptosis.",,"['Pan, Chaoyun', 'Zhu, Dihan', 'Zhuo, Jianjiang', 'Li, Limin', 'Wang, Dong', 'Zhang, Chen-Yu', 'Liu, Yuan', 'Zen, Ke']","['Pan C', 'Zhu D', 'Zhuo J', 'Li L', 'Wang D', 'Zhang CY', 'Liu Y', 'Zen K']","['State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Nanjing Advanced Institute for Life Sciences, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, China.', 'Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for MicroRNA Biology and Biotechnology, 22 Hankou Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Nanjing Advanced Institute for Life Sciences, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, China.', 'Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for MicroRNA Biology and Biotechnology, 22 Hankou Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Nanjing Advanced Institute for Life Sciences, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, China.', 'Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for MicroRNA Biology and Biotechnology, 22 Hankou Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Nanjing Advanced Institute for Life Sciences, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, China.', 'Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for MicroRNA Biology and Biotechnology, 22 Hankou Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Nanjing Advanced Institute for Life Sciences, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, China.', 'Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for MicroRNA Biology and Biotechnology, 22 Hankou Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Nanjing Advanced Institute for Life Sciences, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, China.', 'Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for MicroRNA Biology and Biotechnology, 22 Hankou Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, China.', 'Department of Biology, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30303.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Nanjing Advanced Institute for Life Sciences, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, China.', 'Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for MicroRNA Biology and Biotechnology, 22 Hankou Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, China.', 'Department of Biology, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30303.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160324,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (SIRPA protein, human)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/*physiology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*physiology']",2016/03/25 06:00,2017/02/28 06:00,['2016/03/25 06:00'],"['2015/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['srep23710 [pii]', '10.1038/srep23710 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Mar 24;6:23710. doi: 10.1038/srep23710.,10.1038/srep23710 [doi],,,PMC4806322,,,,,,['R01 AI106839/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The EBV origin of plasmid replication (OriP) has been implicated as a critical control element for viral transcription, as well as viral DNA replication and episome maintenance. Here, we examine cellular factors that bind OriP and regulate histone modification, transcription regulation, and episome maintenance. We found that OriP is enriched for histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation in multiple cell types and latency types. Host cell factor 1 (HCF1), a component of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) histone methyltransferase complex, and transcription factor OCT2 (octamer-binding transcription factor 2) bound cooperatively with EBNA1 (Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1) at OriP. Depletion of OCT2 or HCF1 deregulated latency transcription and histone modifications at OriP, as well as the OriP-regulated latency type-dependent C promoter (Cp) and Q promoter (Qp). HCF1 depletion led to a loss of histone H3K4me3 (trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4) and H3 acetylation at Cp in type III latency and Qp in type I latency, as well as an increase in heterochromatic H3K9me3 at these sites. HCF1 depletion resulted in the loss of EBV episomes from Burkitt's lymphoma cells with type I latency and reactivation from lymphoblastoid cells (LCLs) with type III latency. These findings indicate that HCF1 and OCT2 function at OriP to regulate viral transcription, histone modifications, and episome maintenance. As HCF1 is best known for its function in herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) immediate early gene transcription, our findings suggest that EBV latency transcription shares unexpected features with HSV gene regulation. IMPORTANCE: EBV latency is associated with several human cancers. Viral latent cycle gene expression is regulated by the epigenetic control of the OriP enhancer region. Here, we show that cellular factors OCT2 and HCF1 bind OriP in association with EBNA1 to maintain elevated histone H3K4me3 and transcriptional enhancer function. HCF1 is known as a transcriptional coactivator of herpes simplex virus (HSV) immediate early (IE) transcription, suggesting that OriP enhancer shares aspects of HSV IE transcription control.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Dheekollu et al.'],"['Dheekollu, Jayaraju', 'Wiedmer, Andreas', 'Sentana-Lledo, Daniel', 'Cassel, Joel', 'Messick, Troy', 'Lieberman, Paul M']","['Dheekollu J', 'Wiedmer A', 'Sentana-Lledo D', 'Cassel J', 'Messick T', 'Lieberman PM']","['The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA Lieberman@wistar.org.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160512,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', '0 (HCFC1 protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Host Cell Factor C1)', '0 (Host Factor 1 Protein)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-2)', '0 (POU2F2 protein, human)', 'O5GA75RST7 (EBV-encoded nuclear antigen 1)']",IM,"['Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics/physiology', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Host Cell Factor C1/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Host Factor 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-2/genetics/*metabolism', '*Plasmids', 'Replication Origin', 'Virus Latency/*genetics']",2016/03/25 06:00,2017/04/30 06:00,['2016/03/25 06:00'],"['2016/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00239-16 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00239-16 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2016 May 12;90(11):5353-5367. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00239-16.

One such immunotherapy that has shown promise in the treatment of cancer is the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T lymphocytes. CARs are engineered receptors constructed from antigen recognition regions of antibodies fused to T-cell signaling and costimulatory domains that can be used to reprogram a patient's T cells to specifically target tumor cells. CAR T-cell therapy has demonstrated sustained complete responses for some patients with advanced leukemia, and a number of CAR therapies are being evaluated in clinical studies. CAR T-cell therapy-associated toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome, macrophage activation syndrome, and tumor lysis syndrome, have been observed and effectively managed in the clinic. In patients with significant clinical responses, sustained B-cell aplasia has also been observed and is a marker of CAR T-cell persistence that might provide long-term disease control. Education on CAR T-cell therapy efficacy and safety management is critical for clinicians and patients who are considering this novel type of treatment. In the present report, the current landscape of CAR T-cell therapy, the effective management of patients undergoing treatment, and which patients are the most suitable candidates for current trials are discussed. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The present report describes the current status of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T lymphocytes as an immunotherapy for patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. CAR T cells targeting CD19, a protein expressed on many B-cell malignancies, typically induce high complete response rates in patients with B-cell leukemia or lymphoma who have very limited therapeutic options. Recent clinical trial results of CD19 CAR T-cell therapies and the management of CAR T-cell-associated adverse events are discussed.

We here report peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) in a patient who had previously received only imatinib as tyrosine kinase inhibitor. CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 70-year-old man with no history of cardiovascular disease. He developed arterial hypertension 5 months after the initiation of ponatinib and PAOD 41 months later. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Peripheral arterial occlusive disease can occur several years after the initiation of ponatinib in patients who had previously received only imatinib. Long-term surveillance is required for preventing the complications of ponatinib-associated PAOD.,['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Tournaire, G', 'Despas, F', 'Huguet, F', 'Montastruc, J L', 'Bondon-Guitton, E']","['Tournaire G', 'Despas F', 'Huguet F', 'Montastruc JL', 'Bondon-Guitton E']","[""Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Centre Midi-Pyrenees de Pharmacovigilance, Pharmacoepidemiologie et Informations sur le Medicament, Pharmacopole Midi-Pyrenees, Faculte de Medecine de l'Universite de Toulouse, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Toulouse, France."", ""Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Faculte de Medecine de l'Universite de Toulouse, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Toulouse, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer, Toulouse, France."", ""Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Centre Midi-Pyrenees de Pharmacovigilance, Pharmacoepidemiologie et Informations sur le Medicament, Pharmacopole Midi-Pyrenees, Faculte de Medecine de l'Universite de Toulouse, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Toulouse, France."", ""Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Centre Midi-Pyrenees de Pharmacovigilance, Pharmacoepidemiologie et Informations sur le Medicament, Pharmacopole Midi-Pyrenees, Faculte de Medecine de l'Universite de Toulouse, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.""]",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20160323,England,J Clin Pharm Ther,Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,8704308,,,,2016/03/25 06:00,2016/03/25 06:00,['2016/03/25 06:00'],"['2016/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jcpt.12383 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharm Ther. 2016 Jun;41(3):360-361. doi: 10.1111/jcpt.12383.

Here we show that ELL functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and targets c-Myc for proteasomal degradation. In addition, we identify that UbcH8 serves as a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in this pathway. Cysteine 595 of ELL is an active site of the enzyme; its mutation to alanine (C595A) renders the protein unable to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of c-Myc. ELL-mediated c-Myc degradation inhibits c-Myc-dependent transcriptional activity and cell proliferation, and also suppresses c-Myc-dependent xenograft tumour growth. In contrast, the ELL(C595A) mutant not only loses the ability to inhibit cell proliferation and xenograft tumour growth, but also promotes tumour metastasis. Thus, our work reveals a previously unrecognized function for ELL as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for c-Myc and a potential tumour suppressor.",,"['Chen, Yu', 'Zhou, Chi', 'Ji, Wei', 'Mei, Zhichao', 'Hu, Bo', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Zhang, Dawei', 'Wang, Jing', 'Liu, Xing', 'Ouyang, Gang', 'Zhou, Jiangang', 'Xiao, Wuhan']","['Chen Y', 'Zhou C', 'Ji W', 'Mei Z', 'Hu B', 'Zhang W', 'Zhang D', 'Wang J', 'Liu X', 'Ouyang G', 'Zhou J', 'Xiao W']","['The Key Laboratory of Aquatic Biodiversity and Conservation, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 430072 Wuhan, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Aquatic Biodiversity and Conservation, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 430072 Wuhan, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Aquatic Biodiversity and Conservation, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 430072 Wuhan, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Aquatic Biodiversity and Conservation, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 430072 Wuhan, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Aquatic Biodiversity and Conservation, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 430072 Wuhan, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Aquatic Biodiversity and Conservation, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 430072 Wuhan, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Aquatic Biodiversity and Conservation, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 430072 Wuhan, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Aquatic Biodiversity and Conservation, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 430072 Wuhan, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Aquatic Biodiversity and Conservation, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 430072 Wuhan, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Aquatic Biodiversity and Conservation, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 430072 Wuhan, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Aquatic Biodiversity and Conservation, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 430072 Wuhan, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Aquatic Biodiversity and Conservation, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 430072 Wuhan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 430072 Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160324,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (ELL protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteolysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2016/03/25 06:00,2016/08/30 06:00,['2016/03/25 06:00'],"['2016/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms11057 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms11057 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2016 Mar 24;7:11057. doi: 10.1038/ncomms11057.,10.1038/ncomms11057 [doi],,,PMC4820845,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently inter-individual variations in this apoptosis pathway might be associated with imatinib response or resistance. METHODS: This study attempted to focus on eight genotypes in the apoptosis pathway including FAS (rs1800682, rs2229521, rs2234767 and rs2234978), FASLG (rs763110), CASP10 (rs13006529), and APAF1 (rs1439123, rs2288713) and analyzed their association with treatment outcomes including molecular response with 4.5 log reduction (MR4.5), following imatinib therapy in 187 Korean CML patients. RESULTS: The GG/GA genotype in FAS (rs2234767) showed a higher rate of MR4.5 than the AA genotype (at 5 years 59.7 vs 37.4 %, p = 0.013). Using a bootstrap procedure for internal validation we confirmed that FAS (rs2234767) correlates with MR4.5 (p = 0.050). Multivariate analysis confirmed that the FAS genotype (rs2234767) is an independent surrogate for MR4.5 (p = 0.019, HR 0.43, 95 % CI [0.22-0.87]). CONCLUSIONS: The Fas/FasL signaling pathway may represent the major pathway that mediates apoptosis in CML treated with imatinib. SNP markers in the apoptosis pathway including FAS genotype (rs2234767) can be potential surrogates for predicting deeper molecular response after imatinib therapy.",,"['Zheng, Qiaoli', 'Cao, Jiang', 'Hamad, Nada', 'Kim, Hyeoung-Joon', 'Moon, Joon Ho', 'Sohn, Sang Kyun', 'Jung, Chul Won', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H', 'Kim, Dennis Dong Hwan']","['Zheng Q', 'Cao J', 'Hamad N', 'Kim HJ', 'Moon JH', 'Sohn SK', 'Jung CW', 'Lipton JH', 'Kim DD']","['Department of Dermatology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Clinical Research Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 88 Jiefang Road, Hangzhou, 310009, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Clinical Research Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 88 Jiefang Road, Hangzhou, 310009, Zhejiang Province, China. caoj@zju.edu.cn.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University, Hwasun, South Korea.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea. leukemia1@skku.edu.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160324,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,['8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Child', 'Demography', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2016/03/25 06:00,2016/11/08 06:00,['2016/03/25 06:00'],"['2015/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12967-016-0837-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12967-016-0837-5 [pii]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2016 Mar 24;14:82. doi: 10.1186/s12967-016-0837-5.,10.1186/s12967-016-0837-5 [doi],,,PMC4806489,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis pathway', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Imatinib', 'Single nucleotide polymorphisms']",,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9542-5279'],,,,,,

We reviewed 21 consecutive patients with early stage duodenal FL treated with radiation therapy between January 2005 and December 2013 at the Cancer Institute Hospital, Tokyo. The characteristics of patients were: median age 62 years (range, 46-79 years), gender (male, 6; female, 15), clinical stage (I, 20; II1, 1), histological grade (I, 17; II, 4). All patients were treated with radiation therapy alone. The median radiation dose was 30.6 Gy (range, 30.6-39.6) in 17 fractions. The involved-site radiation therapy was delivered to the whole duodenum. The median follow-up time was 43.2 months (range 21.4-109.3). The 3-year overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS) and local control (LC) rates were 94.7%, 79.3% and 100%, respectively. There were four relapses documented outside the treated volumes: two in the gastrointestinal tract (jejunum, terminal ileum), one in an abdominal lymph node (mesenteric lymph node) and one in the bone marrow. None died of the disease; one death was due to acute myeloid leukemia. No toxicities greater than Grade 1 were observed during treatment and over the follow-up time. The 30.6 Gy of involved-site radiation therapy provided excellent local control with very low toxicities. Radiation therapy could be an effective and safe treatment option for patients with localized low grade FL arising from the duodenum.","['(c) The Author 2016.

Nonetheless, few data are available on the subsequent clinical monitoring and treatment of the patients, especially those with disease recurrence after CAR-T-19 cell infusion. Here, we analyzed three patients who survived after our phase I clinical trial and who were studied by means of biomarkers reflecting persistence of CAR-T-19 cells in vivo and predictive factors directing further treatment. One patient achieved 9-week sustained complete remission and subsequently received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Another patient who showed relapse after 20 weeks without detectable leukemia in the cerebrospinal fluid after CAR-T-19 cell treatment was able to achieve a morphological remission under the influence of stand-alone low-dose chemotherapeutic agents. The third patient gradually developed extensive extramedullary involvement in tissues with scarce immune- cell infiltration during a long period of hematopoietic remission after CAR-T-19 cell therapy. Long-term and discontinuous increases in serum cytokines (mainly interleukin 6 and C-reactive protein) were identified in two patients (Nos. 1 and 6) even though only a low copy number of CAR molecules could be detected in their peripheral blood. This finding was suggestive of persistent functional activity of CAR-T-19 cells. Combined analyses of laboratory biomarkers with their clinical manifestations before and after salvage treatment showed that the persistent immunosurveillance mediated by CAR-T-19 cells would inevitably potentiate the leukemia-killing effectiveness of subsequent chemotherapy in patients who showed relapse after CAR-T-19-induced remission.",,"['Zhang, Yajing', 'Zhang, Wenying', 'Dai, Hanren', 'Wang, Yao', 'Shi, Fengxia', 'Wang, Chunmeng', 'Guo, Yelei', 'Liu, Yang', 'Chen, Meixia', 'Feng, Kaichao', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Liu, Chuanjie', 'Yang, Qingming', 'Li, Suxia', 'Han, Weidong']","['Zhang Y', 'Zhang W', 'Dai H', 'Wang Y', 'Shi F', 'Wang C', 'Guo Y', 'Liu Y', 'Chen M', 'Feng K', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu C', 'Yang Q', 'Li S', 'Han W']","['Bio-therapeutic Department, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Bio-therapeutic Department, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Molecular & Immunological Department, Institute of Basic Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Molecular & Immunological Department, Institute of Basic Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Bio-therapeutic Department, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Bio-therapeutic Department, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Molecular & Immunological Department, Institute of Basic Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Geriatric Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Bio-therapeutic Department, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Bio-therapeutic Department, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Bio-therapeutic Department, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Molecular & Immunological Department, Institute of Basic Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Bio-therapeutic Department, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Geriatric Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China. lisuxia301@163.com.', 'Bio-therapeutic Department, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China. hanwdrsw69@yahoo.com.', 'Molecular & Immunological Department, Institute of Basic Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China. hanwdrsw69@yahoo.com.', 'State key laboratory of kidney disease, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China. hanwdrsw69@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160324,China,Sci China Life Sci,Science China.

METHODS: Three prospective agricultural cohort studies were included: US Agricultural Health Study (AHS), French Agriculture and Cancer Study (AGRICAN) and Cancer in the Norwegian Agricultural Population (CNAP). Self-reported pesticide use was collected in AHS. Crop-exposure matrices (CEMs) were developed for AGRICAN and CNAP. We explored the potential impact of these differences in exposure assessment by comparing a CEM approach estimating exposure in AHS with self-reported pesticide use. RESULTS: In AHS, 99% of participants were considered exposed to pesticides, 68% in AGRICAN and 63% in CNAP. For all cohorts combined (n=316 270), prevalence of exposure ranged from 19% to 59% for 14 chemical groups examined, and from 13% to 46% for 33 active ingredients. Exposures were highly correlated within AGRICAN and CNAP where CEMs were applied; they were less correlated in AHS. Poor agreement was found between self-reported pesticide use and assigned exposure in AHS using a CEM approach resembling the assessment for AGRICAN (kappa -0.00 to 0.33) and CNAP (kappa -0.01 to 0.14). CONCLUSIONS: We developed country-specific CEMs to assign occupational exposure to pesticides in cohorts lacking self-reported data on the use of specific pesticides. The different exposure assessment methods applied may overestimate or underestimate actual exposure prevalence, and additional work is needed to better estimate how far the exposure estimates deviate from reality.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

However, these studies may be biased by reverse causation, confounded by unmeasured environmental exposures and might miss time points for which prospective telomere measurement would best reveal a relationship between telomere length and NHL risk. We performed an analysis of genetically inferred telomere length and NHL risk in a study of 10 102 NHL cases of the four most common B-cell histologic types and 9562 controls using a genetic risk score (GRS) comprising nine telomere length-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms. This approach uses existing genotype data and estimates telomere length by weighing the number of telomere length-associated variant alleles an individual carries with the published change in kb of telomere length. The analysis of the telomere length GRS resulted in an association between longer telomere length and increased NHL risk [four B-cell histologic types combined; odds ratio (OR) = 1.49, 95% CI 1.22-1.82,P-value = 8.5 x 10(-5)]. Subtype-specific analyses indicated that chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) was the principal NHL subtype contributing to this association (OR = 2.60, 95% CI 1.93-3.51,P-value = 4.0 x 10(-10)). Significant interactions were observed across strata of sex for CLL/SLL and marginal zone lymphoma subtypes as well as age for the follicular lymphoma subtype. Our results indicate that a genetic background that favors longer telomere length may increase NHL risk, particularly risk of CLL/SLL, and are consistent with earlier studies relating longer telomere length with increased NHL risk.","['Published by Oxford University Press 2016.

Well-established, high-throughput yeast mutant screens identify only evolutionarily conserved processes. RNA interference can be applied in human cells but is limited by incomplete gene knockout and off-target effects. Human haploid cell screening is advantageous as it requires knockdown of only a single copy of each gene. A human haploid cell mutant library (KBM7-Mu), derived from a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patient, was recently developed and has been used to identify genes that modulate sensitivity to infectious agents and pharmaceutical drugs. Here, we sought to improve the KBM7-Mu screening process to enable efficient screening of environmental chemicals. We developed a semi-solid medium based screening approach that cultures individual mutant colonies from chemically resistant cells, faster (by 2-3 weeks) and with less labor than the original liquid medium-based approach. As proof of principle, we identified genetic mutants that confer resistance to the carcinogen formaldehyde (FA, 12 genes, 18 hits) and the CML chemotherapeutic agent imatinib (6 genes, 13 hits). Validation experiments conducted on KBM7 mutants lacking each of the 18 genes confirmed resistance of 6 FA mutants (CTC1, FCRLA, GOT1, LPR5, M1AP, and MAP2K5) and 1 imatinib-resistant mutant (LYRM9). Despite the improvements to the method, it remains technically challenging to limit false positive findings. Nonetheless, our findings demonstrate the broad applicability of this optimized haploid approach to screen toxic chemicals to identify novel susceptibility genes and gain insight into potential mechanisms of toxicity.","['(c) The Author 2016.

RBP2 knockdown induced apoptosis and attenuated leukemic cell viability. Our results demonstrated that BCL2 is a novel target of RBP2 and supported the notion of RBP2 being a regulator of BCL2 expression via directly binding to its promoter.

Nevertheless, the role of delta-T in preventing or treating hematologic malignancies has not been studied. In this study, we screened the efficacy of delta-T against six cell lines representing a wide spectrum of hematologic malignancies: Jurkat (acute T-cell leukemia), K-562 (chronic myeloid leukemia), KG-1 [acute myeloid leukemia (AML)], THP-1 (acute monocytic leukemia), TOM-1 (acute lymphoblastic leukemia), and UMCL01-101 (AIDS-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma). Interestingly, the AML cell line KG-1 was the only one to be significantly affected at concentrations of delta-T as low as 20 microM. The antileukemic activity of delta-T in AML was verified in a set of primary cells collected from patients newly diagnosed with AML. Apoptotic induction and cell cycle arrest explained the efficacy of delta-T against KG-1 cells.

The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical course of children and adolescents with LBL treated at a tertiary center. METHODS: this is a retrospective cohort study of 27 patients aged 16 years or less with LBL admitted between January 1981 and December 2013. Patients received intensive chemotherapy regimen derived from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy. Diagnosis was based on biopsy of tumor and/or cytological examination of pleural effusions. The overall survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: the median age at diagnosis was 11.6 years (interquartile range, 4.6-13.8). LBL had T cell origin in 16 patients (59%). The most common primary manifestation in T-cell LBL was mediastinum involvement in 9 patients (56%). Intra-abdominal tumor was the major site of involvement in patients with pB-LBL. Most patients had advanced disease (18 patients - 67%) at diagnosis. Twenty-four patients (89%) achieved complete clinical remission. After a median follow-up of 43 months (interquartile range, 6.4-95), 22 patients (81%) were alive in first complete remission. Five children (18.5%) died, three of them soon after admission and two after relapsing. The probability of survival at five years for 20 patients with de novo LBL was 78% (SD 9.4).

While there is concern that uncured PDMS oligomers may leach into culture medium and/or hydrophobic molecules may be absorbed into PDMS structures, there is no consensus on how or if PDMS influences cell behaviour. We observed that human umbilical cord blood (CB)-derived CD34(+) cells expanded in standard culture medium on PDMS exhibit reduced CD38 surface expression, relative to cells cultured on tissue culture polystyrene (TCP). All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induces CD38 expression, and we reasoned that this hydrophobic molecule might be absorbed by PDMS. Through a series of experiments we demonstrated that ATRA-mediated CD38 expression was attenuated when cultures were maintained on PDMS. Medium pre-incubated on PDMS for extended durations resulted in a time-dependant reduction of ATRA in the medium and increasingly attenuated CD38 expression. This indicated a time-dependent absorption of ATRA into the PDMS. To better understand how PDMS might generally influence cell behaviour, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to identify potential upstream regulators. This analysis was performed for differentially expressed genes in primary cells including CD34(+) haematopoietic progenitor cells, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), and keratinocytes, and cell lines including prostate cancer epithelial cells (LNCaP), breast cancer epithelial cells (MCF-7), and myeloid leukaemia cells (KG1a). IPA predicted that the most likely common upstream regulator of perturbed pathways was ATRA. We demonstrate here that ATRA is absorbed by PDMS in a time-dependent manner and results in the concomitant reduced expression of CD38 on the cell surface of CB-derived CD34(+) cells.",,"['Futrega, Kathryn', 'Yu, Jianshi', 'Jones, Jace W', 'Kane, Maureen A', 'Lott, William B', 'Atkinson, Kerry', 'Doran, Michael R']","['Futrega K', 'Yu J', 'Jones JW', 'Kane MA', 'Lott WB', 'Atkinson K', 'Doran MR']","['Stem Cell Therapies Laboratory, Queensland University of Technology at the Translational Research Institute, 37 Kent Street Brisbane, QLD 4102, Australia. k.futrega@qut.edu.au michael.doran@qut.edu.au.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.', 'Stem Cell Therapies Laboratory, Queensland University of Technology at the Translational Research Institute, 37 Kent Street Brisbane, QLD 4102, Australia. k.futrega@qut.edu.au michael.doran@qut.edu.au.', 'Stem Cell Therapies Laboratory, Queensland University of Technology at the Translational Research Institute, 37 Kent Street Brisbane, QLD 4102, Australia. k.futrega@qut.edu.au michael.doran@qut.edu.au.', 'Stem Cell Therapies Laboratory, Queensland University of Technology at the Translational Research Institute, 37 Kent Street Brisbane, QLD 4102, Australia. k.futrega@qut.edu.au michael.doran@qut.edu.au and Mater Medical Research - University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, 37 Kent Street Brisbane, QLD 4102, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Lab Chip,Lab on a chip,101128948,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Dimethylpolysiloxanes)', '0 (Polystyrenes)', '0 (Retinoids)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '63148-62-9 (baysilon)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*metabolism', '*Absorption, Physicochemical', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Culture Media/chemistry', 'Dimethylpolysiloxanes/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Polystyrenes/pharmacology', 'Retinoids/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transcriptome/*drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism/pharmacology']",2016/03/24 06:00,2016/12/31 06:00,['2016/03/24 06:00'],"['2016/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c6lc00269b [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Chip. 2016 Apr 21;16(8):1473-83. doi: 10.1039/c6lc00269b.,10.1039/c6lc00269b [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The introduction of chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) into T cells or NK cells could potentially overcome this resistance. Here, we extend our previous observations on the resistance of malignant lymphoblasts to NK-92 cells, a continuously growing NK cell line, showing that anti-CD19-CAR (alphaCD19-CAR) engineered NK-92 cells can regain significant cytotoxicity against CD19 positive leukaemic cell lines and primary leukaemia cells that are resistant to cytolytic activity of parental NK-92 cells. The 'first generation' CAR was generated from a scFv (CD19) antibody fragment, coupled to a flexible hinge region, the CD3zeta chain and a Myc-tag and cloned into a retrovirus backbone. No difference in cytotoxic activity of NK-92 and transduced alphaCD19-CAR NK-92 cells towards CD19 negative targets was found. However, alphaCD19-CAR NK-92 cells specifically and efficiently lysed CD19 expressing B-precursor leukaemia cell lines as well as lymphoblasts from leukaemia patients. Since NK-92 cells can be easily expanded to clinical grade numbers under current Good Manufactoring Practice (cGMP) conditions and its safety has been documented in several phase I clinical studies, treatment with CAR modified NK-92 should be considered a treatment option for patients with lymphoid malignancies.","['(c) 2016 The Authors.

Hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays a critical role in the maintenance and differentiation of cancer stem cells. Yet its role in AML remains controversial. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the role of GLI1, the transcriptional activator of Hh signaling, in AML progenitor cells and to explore the anti-AML effects of GLI small-molecule inhibitor GANT61. METHODS: The expression of GLI1 mRNA and protein were examined in AML progenitor cells and normal cells. The proliferation, colony formation, apoptosis and differentiation of AML progenitor cells were also analyzed in the presence of GANT61. RESULTS: Kasumi-1 and KG1a cells, containing more CD34+ cells, expressed higher level of GLI1 compared to U937 and NB4 cells with fewer CD34+ cells. Consistently, a positive correlation between the protein levels of GLI1 and CD34 was validated in the bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) of AML patients tested. GANT61 inhibited the proliferation and colony formation in AML cell lines. Importantly, GANT61 induced apoptosis in CD34+ enriched Kasumi-1 and KG1a cells, whereas it induced differentiation in U937 and NB4 cells. Furthermore, GANT61 enhanced the cytotoxicity of cytarabine (Ara-c) in primary CD34+ AML cells, indicating that inhibition of GLI1 could be a promising strategy to enhance chemosensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggested that Hh signaling was activated in AML progenitor cells. GLI1 acted as a potential target for AML therapy.","['(c) 2016 S.

Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) have immunomodulatory properties, including augmenting tumor antigen presentation that may enhance the graft-versus-leukemia effect. Moreover, inhibitory effects on T-cell activation and cytokine production may lead to a lower incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Our aim was to describe outcomes in patients treated with HMAs for relapse after HCT. METHODS: Subjects were retrospectively identified as patients with relapse or loss of donor chimerism after HCT for myeloid malignancies treated with HMAs at the University of Pittsburgh. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were identified, with a median age of 57 years and a median time to relapse of 98 days. Nine of 12 (75%) evaluable patients had a complete remission (CR). Grade I-IV acute GVHD involving the liver occurred in 6 patients. Cases of acute liver GVHD were diagnosed clinically based on the elevation of liver function tests. The median survival was 14.3 months from the time of relapse. CONCLUSION: HMAs for relapse after HCT can be effective in inducing a CR. This may be due to epigenetic changes and immunomodulatory effects that enhance the graft-versus-leukemia effect. There may be a risk of GVHD, and further exploration into pathophysiology and predisposing factors are warranted.","['(c) 2016 S.

Despite the large number of agents available to treat this disease, there remains no standard of care for either the frontline or relapsed/refractory settings. Although the rate of response to initial induction therapy is high, at least half of patients experience relapsed or refractory disease. Selection of salvage therapy may rely on investigational strategies in clinical trials. The goal of frontline or salvage therapy is to reduce the tumor burden so that patients can proceed to allogeneic stem cell transplant, the only treatment considered potentially curative for ALL. However, the different combination chemotherapy regimens are associated with unpredictable responses and can result in myelosuppression and other toxicities. The need for improved treatment alternatives, especially in the salvage setting, has been recently addressed with the introduction of several new therapies. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is a form of immunotherapy. T cells harvested from the patient are genetically engineered to express a receptor that targets a tumor-specific antigen on the tumor cell surface. Patients awaiting CAR T-cell therapy, like those awaiting stem cell transplant, often require a ""bridge"" treatment during the interim. A liposomal formulation of vincristine has been associated with durable responses in relapsed disease, but with less myelosuppression and neurotoxicity than standard vincristine.

We modeled acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in mice using various MLL fusion proteins (MLL-FPs) and observed significantly different survival outcomes. To better understand the differences between these leukemias, we examined the genome wide expression profiles of leukemic cells transformed with different MLL-FPs. RNA-sequencing and pathway analysis identified the c-Myc transcriptional program as one of the top distinguishing features. c-Myc protein levels were highly correlative with AML disease latency in mice. Functionally, overexpression of c-Myc resulted in a more aggressive proliferation rate in MLL-FP cell lines. While all MLL-FP transformed cells displayed sensitivity to BET inhibitors, high c-Myc expressing cells showed greater resistance to Brd4 inhibition. The Myc target Lin28B was also differentially expressed in MLL-FP cell lines in agreement with c-Myc expression. Examination of Lin28B miRNAs targets revealed that let-7g was significantly increased in leukemic cells associated with the longest disease latency and forced let-7g expression induced differentiation of leukemic blasts. Thus, differential regulation of the c-Myc/Lin28/let-7g program by different MLL-FPs is functionally related to disease latency and BET inhibitor resistance in MLL leukemias.",,"['Chen, Lili', 'Sun, Yuqing', 'Wang, Jingya', 'Jiang, Hui', 'Muntean, Andrew G']","['Chen L', 'Sun Y', 'Wang J', 'Jiang H', 'Muntean AG']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health,University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Lin-28 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism']",2016/03/24 06:00,2018/01/06 06:00,['2016/03/24 06:00'],"['2016/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['8199 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.8199 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 May 3;7(18):25208-23. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.8199.,10.18632/oncotarget.8199 [doi],,,PMC5041898,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['Lin28', 'MLL', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'c-Myc', 'let-7']",['R00 CA158136/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

In response, organisms have developed defense mechanisms to keep iron from pathogens. Very little of the body's iron store is available as free heme; rather nearly all body iron is complexed with heme or other proteins. The feline leukemia virus, subgroup C (FeLV-C) receptor, FLVCR, exports heme from cells. It was unknown whether FLVCR regulates heme-iron availability after infection, but given that other heme regulatory proteins are upregulated in macrophages in response to bacterial infection, we hypothesized that macrophages dynamically regulate FLVCR. We stimulated murine primary macrophages or macrophage cell lines with LPS and found that Flvcr is rapidly downregulated in a TLR4/MD2-dependent manner; TLR1/2 and TLR3 stimulation also decreased Flvcr expression. We identified several candidate TLR-activated transcription factors that can bind to the Flvcr promoter. Macrophages must balance the need to sequester iron from systemic circulating or intracellular pathogens with the macrophage requirement for heme and iron to produce reactive oxygen species.

We studied DNA chimerism in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients treated with HSCT. Methods. Chimerism analysis was performed on CD3+ cells, polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells, and cfDNA using 16 small tandem repeat loci. The resulting labeled PCR-products were size-fractionated and quantified. Results. Analyzing samples from 191 patients treated with HSCT for nonneoplastic hematologic disorders demonstrated that the cfDNA chimerism is comparable to that seen in PMN cells. Analyzing leukemia patients (N = 126) showed that, of 84 patients with 100% donor DNA in PMN, 16 (19%) had evidence of clinical relapse and >10% recipient DNA in the plasma. Additional 16 patients of the 84 (19%) showed >10% recipient DNA in plasma, but without evidence of relapse. Eight patients had mixed chimerism in granulocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma, but three of these patients had >10% recipient DNA in plasma compared to PMN cells and these three patients had clinical evidence of relapse. The remaining 34 patients showed 100% donor DNA in both PMN and lymphocytes, but cfDNA showed various levels of chimerism. Of these patients 14 (41%) showed laboratory or clinical evidence of relapse and all had >10% recipient DNA in cfDNA. Conclusion.

We identified Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive CD34(+)CD38(-) bone marrow cells (here denoted LSCs) and addressed their response-predictive value in patients with CML (n = 48) subjected to nilotinib in the ENEST1st trial (NCT01061177). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Two flow cytometry-based cell sorting methods were used with multiparameter-directed CD45- (MPFC) and BCR-ABL1 probe-linked (FISH) identification of Ph-positive cells, respectively. RESULTS: We observed a positive correlation between the proportion of LSCs at diagnosis and established prognostic markers (blast count, spleen size, Sokal score, and hemoglobin). Conversely, a high LSC burden predicted for an inferior molecular response at 3 (MPFC and FISH), 6 (MPFC), 9 (FISH), and 15 months (FISH). During nilotinib therapy, the proportion of LSCs decreased rapidly. At 3 months, a median of only 0.3% LSCs remained among CD34(+)CD38(-) cells, and in 33% of the patients the LSC clone was not detectable anymore (FISH). The response kinetics was similar in LSC fractions as it was in the progenitor and unseparated bone marrow cell fractions. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of LSCs at diagnosis, as analyzed by two independent methodologies, reflects the biology of the disease and appeared as a prognostic and response-predictive marker in patients with CML subjected to first-line nilotinib therapy.

Docking analysis confirmed our in vitro DNMT inhibition data and revealed binding of Iso-3 within the DNA binding site of DNMT1. Subsequent increased expression of tumor suppressor gene aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) could be correlated to decreased methylation of CpG sites within the essential Sp1 regulatory region of its promoter. Iso-3 induced growth arrest of cancer cells in G0/G1 concomitant with increased p21 and p27 expression and reduced cyclin E1, PCNA and c-myc levels. Reduced proliferation was accompanied by morphological changes typical of autophagy revealed by fluorescent and transmission electron microscopy and validated by LC3I-II conversion. Furthermore, Iso-3 strongly synergized with tumor-necrosis-factor related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) in RAJI [combination index (CI) = 0.22] and U-937 cells (CI = 0.21) and increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis via a mechanism involving reduction of survivin expression but not of Bcl-2 family proteins nor X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). Iso-3 treatment decreased FLIPL expression and triggered activation of endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress with increased GRP78 expression, eventually inducing TRAIL receptor death receptor (DR)5 surface expression.

We previously demonstrated that an inflammatory chemokine, CCL3, preferentially acts on normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and crucially contributes to the maintenance of leukemia initiating cells (LICs) in bone marrow (BM) during the initiation process of CML. However, the major cellular source of CCL3 in BM and the precise mechanism of CCL3-mediated maintenance of LICs remain to be investigated. To delineate the cellular process facilitating this CCL3-mediated crosstalk between normal and leukemic hematopoiesis, we precisely examined CCL3-expressing cells and their functions in both normal hematopoiesis and CML leukemogenesis. Herein, we demonstrate that basophils can constitutively express CCL3 to negatively regulate the normal hematopoietic process, especially hematopoietic reconstitution after BM transplantation. Moreover, CCL3-expressing basophil-like leukemia cells were found to accumulate in CML BM and supported the predominant expansion of LICs therein. These observations suggest that intra-BM basophil expansion can favor leukemia-tropic hematopoiesis in CML by providing CCL3, a potent inhibitor of normal hematopoiesis and that basophil-derived CCL3 may be a novel target molecule for the treatment of CML.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Baba, Tomohisa', 'Tanabe, Yamato', 'Yoshikawa, Soichiro', 'Yamanishi, Yoshinori', 'Morishita, Soji', 'Komatsu, Norio', 'Karasuyama, Hajime', 'Hirao, Atsushi', 'Mukaida, Naofumi']","['Baba T', 'Tanabe Y', 'Yoshikawa S', 'Yamanishi Y', 'Morishita S', 'Komatsu N', 'Karasuyama H', 'Hirao A', 'Mukaida N']","['Division of Molecular Bioregulation, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan;', 'Division of Molecular Bioregulation, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan;', 'Department of Immune Regulation, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Department of Immune Regulation, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Stem Cell Regulation and.', 'Department of Hematology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan; and.', 'Department of Immune Regulation, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Bioregulation, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160322,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCL3 protein, human)', '0 (Ccl3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/*metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Chemokine CCL3/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology']",2016/03/24 06:00,2017/06/24 06:00,['2016/03/24 06:00'],"['2015/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30138-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-10-673087 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 May 26;127(21):2607-17. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-10-673087.

Although ACAs are considered as a sign of disease progression and have been used as one of the criteria for accelerated phase, the differential prognostic impact of individual ACAs in CML is unknown, and a classification system to reflect such prognostic impact is lacking. In this study, we aimed to address these questions using a large cohort of CML patients treated in the era of TKIs. We focused on cases with single chromosomal changes at the time of ACA emergence and stratified the 6 most common ACAs into 2 groups: group 1 with a relatively good prognosis including trisomy 8, -Y, and an extra copy of Philadelphia chromosome; and group 2 with a relatively poor prognosis including i(17)(q10), -7/del7q, and 3q26.2 rearrangements. Patients in group 1 showed much better treatment response and survival than patients in group 2. When compared with cases with no ACAs, ACAs in group 2 conferred a worse survival irrelevant to the emergence phase and time. In contrast, ACAs in group 1 had no adverse impact on survival when they emerged from chronic phase or at the time of CML diagnosis.

The sporadic form occurs in non-endemic areas and typically involves the ileo-caecum and the bowel, whereas orbital and paranasal sinus involvement is rare. Here, we present an unusual case of sporadic BL in a Caucasian male child with rapidly progressive painful proptosis of the right eye. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an oval-shaped, extraconal mass in the supero-lateral part of the right orbit that deformed and dislocated the eyeball antero-inferiorly.

In the WHO classification there are >50 cytogenetic subgroups of AML, many showing highly specific chromosome translocations that lead to constitutive activation of individual kinases. In a rare stem cell leukemia/lymphoma syndrome, translocations involving 8p11 lead to constitutive activation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) kinase. This disorder shows myeloproliferative disease with almost invariable progresses to AML and conventional therapeutic strategies are largely unsuccessful. Because of the rare nature of this syndrome, models that faithfully recapitulate the human disease are needed to evaluate therapeutic strategies. The t(8;13)(p11;q12) chromosome translocation is most common rearrangement seen in this syndrome and creates a ZMYM2-FGFR1 chimeric kinase. To understand more about the molecular etiology of AML induced by this particular rearrangement, we have created a model human CD34+ cells transplanted into immunocompromized mice which develop myeloproliferative disease that progresses to AML with a long (>12 months) latency period. As in humans, these mice show hepatospenomegaly, hypercellular bone marrow and a CD45 + CD34 + CD13+ immunophenotype. Molecular studies demonstrate upregulation of genes such as KLF4 and FLT3 that promote stemness, and overexpression of MYC, which is associated with suppression of myeloid cell differentiation. This murine model, therefore, provides an opportunity to develop therapeutic strategies against the most common subtype within these FGFR1 driven neoplasms and study the molecular etiology in more depth.",['(c) 2016 UICC.'],"['Ren, Mingqiang', 'Qin, Haiyan', 'Wu, Qing', 'Savage, Natasha M', 'George, Tracy I', 'Cowell, John K']","['Ren M', 'Qin H', 'Wu Q', 'Savage NM', 'George TI', 'Cowell JK']","['Georgia Regents University Cancer Center, Augusta, GA.', 'Georgia Regents University Cancer Center, Augusta, GA.', 'Georgia Regents University Cancer Center, Augusta, GA.', 'Georgia Regents University Cancer Center, Augusta, GA.', 'GRU Department of Pathology, Augusta, GA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM.', 'Georgia Regents University Cancer Center, Augusta, GA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160504,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ZMYM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*immunology/metabolism/mortality', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2016/03/24 06:00,2017/04/30 06:00,['2016/03/24 06:00'],"['2015/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.30100 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2016 Aug 15;139(4):836-40. doi: 10.1002/ijc.30100.

Here we provide an overview of the function of normal and mutated IDH, discuss the role of IDH mutations in tumorigenesis and progression and review the key clinical considerations when treating IDH-mutated tumors based on emerging clinical data from mutant IDH1/2 inhibitor trials. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations confer neomorphic activity in the mutant protein, resulting in the conversion of alphaKG to the oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). The subsequent accumulation of 2-HG results in epigenetic dysregulation via inhibition of alphaKG-dependent histone and DNA demethylases, and a block in cellular differentiation. There is growing preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting that IDHmutations are involved in neoplasia. Furthermore, preclinical studies assessing small molecule inhibitors of mutant IDH1/2 enzymes have provided proof of concept that this approach decreases intracellular 2-HG levels, reverses epigenetic dysregulation and induces cellular differentiation. Phase I studies of mutant IDH inhibitors are currently ongoing in patients with IDH-mutant hematologic and solid tumors, with early data in hematologic tumors suggesting a manageable safety profile as well as clinical benefit, with a mechanism of action based on differentiation of malignant cells. Inhibition of mutant IDH shows promise as a treatment approach in hematologic malignancies, with further development ongoing in solid tumors and glioma. The mutant IDH inhibitors may have clinical utility both as single agents and in combination strategies that target additional oncogenic pathways.","['(c) The Author 2016.

To test the hypothesis that immune system development and function in neonates and infants are significantly influenced by diet, 2-day old piglets were fed soy or milk formula (n = 6/group/gender) until day 21 and compared to a sow-fed group (n = 6/gender). METHODS: Histomorphometric analyses of ileum, jejunum and Peyer's patches were carried out, to determine the inflammation status, mRNA and protein expression of pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory and growth-related chemokines and cytokines. RESULTS: In formula-fed animals, increases in ileum and jejunum villus height and crypt depth were observed in comparison to sow-fed animals (jejunum, p < 0.01 villus height, p < 0.04 crypt depth; ileum p < 0.001 villus height, p < 0.002 crypt depth). In formula-fed the lymphoid follicle size (p < 0.01) and germinal centers (p < 0.01) with in the Peyer's patch were significantly decreased in comparison to sow-fed, indicating less immune education. In ileum, formula diet induced significant up-regulation of AMCFII, IL-8, IL-15, VEGFA, LIF, FASL, CXCL11, CCL4, CCL25 and down-regulation of IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-27, IFNA4, CSF3, LOC100152038, and LOC100736831 at the transcript level. We have confirmed some of the mRNA data by measuring protein, and significant down-regulation of anti-inflammatory molecule IL-10 in comparison to sow-fed piglets was observed. To further determine the membrane protein expression in the ileum, VE-cadherin, occludin, and claudin-3, Western blot analyses were conducted. Sow fed piglets showed significantly more VE-Cadherin, which associated with levels of calcium, and putrescine measured. It is possible that differences in GI tract and immune development are related to shifts in the microbiome; notably, there were 5-fold higher amounts of Lactobacillaceae spp and 3 fold higher Clostridia spp in the sow fed group in comparison to milk formula-fed piglets, whereas in milk formula-fed pigs Enterobacteriaceae spp was 5-fold higher. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, formula diet alters GI morphology, microbial abundance, intestinal barrier protein VE-cadherin and anti-inflammatory molecule IL-10 expression.

A record of the registered patients is being maintained in the hospital-based registry and the results are posted on its official website on a regular basis. METHODS: This is an epidemiologic review of cancer patients 0-19 years of age, reporting cancers recorded at SKMCH & RC) Lahore, Pakistan, from January 1, 2011 - December 31, 2012, in patients aged less than or equal to 19-years, belonging to Lahore district. It includes: i) those who had come to the Hospital laboratory for diagnosis only; ii) those who were diagnosed and registered for treatment at the Hospital; and iii) those who were not accepted for registration (regardless of the centre of diagnosis), as per Hospital policy, and subsequently went to other centres for treatment. The results were summarized by sex, 5-year age-group (0-4, 5-9, 10-14, and 15-19), and the International Classification of Childhood Cancers' (ICCC) diagnostic group. The annual Age-Standardized Incidence Rates (ASIR) were computed through the Segi World Standard (1960), per 100,000 population. RESULTS: New cancer cases: 669. ASIRs for common malignancies: among males-leukaemia and myelo-proliferative/dysplastic disorders 2.1, lymphoma and reticuloendothelial neoplasms 1.8, CNS and miscellaneous intracranial/intraspinal tumours 1.1; among females-leukaemia and myelo-proliferative/dysplastic disorders 1.9, CNS and miscellaneous intracranial/intraspinal 0.8, and malignant bone tumours 0.6. CONCLUSION: The rates are low compared to the rates reported in the West. However, it has been estimated that over 80% of the paediatric cancer cases, diagnosed among Lahore residents, are being recorded by this institution alone. Accordingly, reviewing the statistics on a regular basis can be very important in evaluating trends in childhood cancers in Lahore and implementing cancer control programs in the region.",,"['Badar, Farhana', 'Mahmood, Shahid']","['Badar F', 'Mahmood S']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Pakistan,J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad,"Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad : JAMC",8910750,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cancer Care Facilities/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hospitals/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Pakistan/epidemiology', '*Registries', 'Young Adult']",2016/03/24 06:00,2016/04/27 06:00,['2016/03/24 06:00'],"['2016/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad. 2015 Oct-Dec;27(4):904-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the embryonic period, mesenchymal stem cells proliferate and differentiate to form muscle fibers. Postnatal muscle growth (hypertrophy) is characterized by the enlargement of existing muscle fiber size. Satellite cells (also known as adult myoblasts) are responsible for hypertrophy. The activity of satellite cells can be regulated by their extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM is composed of collagens, proteoglycans, non-collagenous glycoproteins, cytokines and growth factors. Proteoglycans contain a central core protein with covalently attached glycosaminoglycans (GAGs: chondroitin sulfate, keratan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and heparan sulfate) and N- or O-linked glycosylation chains. Membrane-associated proteoglycans attach to the cell membrane either through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor or transmembrane domain. The GAGs can bind proteins including cytokines and growth factors. Both cytokines and growth factors play important roles in regulating satellite cell growth and development. Cytokines are generally associated with immune cells. However, cytokines can also affect muscle cell development. For instance, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and leukemia inhibitory factor have been reported to affect the proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells and myoblasts. Growth factors are potent stimulators or inhibitors of satellite cell proliferation and differentiation. The proper function of some cytokines and growth factors requires an interaction with the cell membrane-associated proteoglycans to enhance the affinity to bind to their primary receptors to initiate downstream signal transduction. This chapter is focused on the interaction of membrane-associated proteoglycans with cytokines and growth factors, and their role in satellite cell growth and development.",,"['Song, Yan']",['Song Y'],"['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA. yan_song@dfci.harvard.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proteoglycans)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Extracellular Matrix/physiology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/physiology', 'Muscle Development', 'Proteoglycans/*physiology', 'Satellite Cells, Skeletal Muscle/*physiology']",2016/03/24 06:00,2016/09/07 06:00,['2016/03/23 06:00'],"['2016/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-3-319-27511-6_4 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2016;900:61-95. doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-27511-6_4.,10.1007/978-3-319-27511-6_4 [doi],,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cytokine', 'Growth factor', 'Proteoglycan', 'Satellite cell', 'Skeletal muscle']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The actions of cytokines are mediated by the unique and sometimes overlapping receptors to which the soluble ligands bind. Classified within the interleukin-6 family of cytokines are leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin-M (OSM), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). These cytokines all bind to the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and gp130, and in some cases an additional receptor subunit, leading to activation of downstream kinases and transcriptional activators. LIFR is expressed on a broad range of cell types and can generate pleiotropic effects. In the context of skeletal muscle physiology, these cytokines have been shown to exert effects on motor neurons, inflammatory and muscle cells. From isolated cells through to whole organisms, manipulations of LIFR signaling cytokines have a wide range of outcomes influencing muscle cell growth, myogenic differentiation, response to exercise, metabolism, neural innervation and recruitment of inflammatory cells to sites of muscle injury.

However, data regarding the treatment of these cutaneous manifestations are lacking, given the rarity of the concomitance of HCL and vasculitic syndromes. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 37-year-old man with paraneoplastic leukocytoclastic vasculitis complicating newly diagnosed HCL. The vasculitis completely resolved after the first 3 weekly administrations of cladribine, which is regarded as the gold-standard treatment for this disease. The underlying leukemia showed refractoriness to the same agent, thus requiring a second line of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical picture we have observed is of interest for the following reasons: i) it confirms an existing pathogenetic relationship between this lymphoproliferative disorder and its cutaneous manifestations, as suggested by the prompt resolution of the purpuric lesions upon cladribine administration; ii) it indicates that cladribine is an effective treatment for HCL-related paraneoplastic syndromes, including leukocytoclastic vasculitis; iii) the evolution and the outcomes of the paraneoplastic manifestations may be independent of those of the underlying leukemia, which showed less than a partial response to its initial treatment.",,"['Broccoli, Alessandro', 'Gandolfi, Letizia', 'Pellegrini, Cinzia', 'Agostinelli, Claudio', 'Argnani, Lisa', 'Zinzani, Pier Luigi']","['Broccoli A', 'Gandolfi L', 'Pellegrini C', 'Agostinelli C', 'Argnani L', 'Zinzani PL']","['Institute of Hematology L. and A.

It has been shown to participate in T cell adhesion and is widely expressed on a variety of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell types. AIM OF WORK: Detection of the expression pattern of CD99 on leukemic and normal T cells and assessing the possibility of its use as a tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of T-ALL cases. METHODOLOGY: We used flow cytometry technique to determine the expression level of CD99 in 62 newly diagnosed T-ALL patients. Patients were followed up for the presence of minimal residual disease on day 15 and day 42 post-therapy. 20 age and sex matched healthy controls were enrolled in our study. RESULTS: CD99 was expressed in all T-ALL patients, with a higher median expression level when compared to controls (58.5% versus 1.38%, p< 0.001). On day 42 post-therapy, 100% of follow up patients who had initial CD99 expression </= 50% had no minimal residual disease, while only 45.5% of those who had initial CD99 expression > 50% had no minimal residual disease (P= 0.03). There was no significant influence of CD99 expression on the 1-year overall survival probability (P= 0.82). CONCLUSION: CD99 could be used to complement current strategy relying on TdT for diagnosis and monitoring of minimal residual disease during the post-therapy follow up of T-ALL patients.

METHODS: The study involved 30 AML patients, 25 ALL patients, and 20 controls. Gene expression was analyzed using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). RESULTS: In both AML and ALL groups, beclin-1 and MAB1LC3B expressions were significantly down-regulated (p < 0.001), while HIF-1alpha (p < 0.01) and Bcl-2 (p < 0.001) expressions were significantly up-regulated compared to the control group. HIF-1alpha fold expression was significantly negatively correlated with beclin-1 (p < 0.01). Moreover, decreased beclin-1 gene expression and increased HIF-1alpha gene expression were both associated with poor survival, supporting their pivotal role in the development and progression of acute leukemia.

Arsenic trioxide (AsO3) is used for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia in combination with retinoids. As the latter are established treatment options in CTCL, we sought to evaluate the efficacy of AsO3 for mono- and combination therapy in vitro. Analyses for apoptosis, cell cycle inhibition, cytotoxicity and cell viability were made after incubation of CTCL cells with AsO3 alone or in combination with the retinoids all-trans-retinoic acid or bexarotene. While AsO3 induced apoptosis, retinoids did not at the time point of analysis. However, retinoids strongly reduced cell viability. Due to the efficient apoptosis induction, AsO3 might be a potentially suitable agent for CTCL treatment, although this effect was not increased by retinoids.","['(c) 2016 S.

Lipid response was modeled as the log ratio of the post-treatment lipid level to the pretreatment level. Linear mixed models (GOLDN, N=813 from 173 families) and linear regression models (ACCORD, N=781) adjusted for pretreatment lipid level, demographic variables, clinical covariates, and ancestry were used to evaluate the association of genetic markers with lipid response. Among Caucasians, the results were combined using inverse-variance weighted fixed-effects meta-analyses. The main findings from the meta-analyses were examined in other ethnic groups from the HyperTG study (N=267 Hispanics) and ACCORD (N=83 Hispanics, 138 African Americans). RESULTS: A known lipid locus harboring the pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 4 (PBX4) gene on chromosome 19 is important for LDL cholesterol response to fenofibrate (smallest P=1.5x10). The main results replicated with nominal statistical significance in Hispanics from ACCORD (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Future research should evaluate the usefulness of this locus to refine clinical strategies for lipid-lowering treatments.",,"['Irvin, Marguerite R', 'Rotroff, Daniel M', 'Aslibekyan, Stella', 'Zhi, Degui', 'Hidalgo, Bertha', 'Motsinger-Reif, Alison', 'Marvel, Skylar', 'Srinivasasainagendra, Vinodh', 'Claas, Steven A', 'Buse, John B', 'Straka, Robert J', 'Ordovas, Jose M', 'Borecki, Ingrid B', 'Guo, Xiuqing', 'Chen, Ida Y D', 'Rotter, Jerome I', 'Wagner, Michael J', 'Arnett, Donna K']","['Irvin MR', 'Rotroff DM', 'Aslibekyan S', 'Zhi D', 'Hidalgo B', 'Motsinger-Reif A', 'Marvel S', 'Srinivasasainagendra V', 'Claas SA', 'Buse JB', 'Straka RJ', 'Ordovas JM', 'Borecki IB', 'Guo X', 'Chen IY', 'Rotter JI', 'Wagner MJ', 'Arnett DK']","['Departments of aEpidemiology bBiostatistics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama cDepartment of Statistics, North Carolina State University, Raleigh dUAB Biostatistics, Diabetes Center for Research, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine eUAB Epidemiology, Center for Pharmacogenomics and Individualized Therapy, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina fDepartment of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota gNCState Biostatistics, Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts hDepartment of Genetics, Division of Statistical Genomics, Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, Missouri iLaboratory of Statistical and Mathematical Genetics jLaboratory for Biochemistry, Molecular Phenotyping, and Microarray kInstitute for Translational Genomics and Population Sciences, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Pharmacogenet Genomics,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,101231005,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Hypolipidemic Agents)', '0 (Lipids)', 'U202363UOS (Fenofibrate)']",IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Fenofibrate/*therapeutic use', 'Genetic Markers', '*Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Hypertriglyceridemia/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Hypolipidemic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Lipid Metabolism/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Lipids/*blood', 'Male', 'Meta-Analysis as Topic', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Whites']",2016/03/24 06:00,2017/03/17 06:00,['2016/03/23 06:00'],"['2016/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/FPC.0000000000000219 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacogenet Genomics. 2016 Jul;26(7):324-33. doi: 10.1097/FPC.0000000000000219.,10.1097/FPC.0000000000000219 [doi],,,PMC4986826,,,,,,"['UL1 TR001111/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'N01HC95184/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL110380/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL076771/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'Y01 HC001010/HC/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL091357/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'Y01 HC009035/HC/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000124/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR002489/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK063491/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'N01HC95181/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01HC95179/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01HC95182/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01HC95180/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01HC95178/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01HC95183/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,['NIHMS763125'],,,,,,,,,

To date, several Hsp90 inhibitors have entered into clinical trials, but none has been approved for cancer therapy yet. Thus, exploring new Hsp90 inhibitors with novel mechanisms of action is urgent. In the present study, we show that Y-632, a novel pyrimidine derivative, inhibited Hsp90 in a different way from the conventional Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin. Y-632 induced degradation of diverse Hsp90 client proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, as geldanamycin did; however, it neither directly bound to Hsp90 nor inhibited Hsp90 ATPase activity. Y-632 inhibited Hsp90 function mainly through inducing intracellular thiol oxidation, which led to disruption of the Hsp90-Hsp70/Hsp90 organizing protein complex and further induced cell adhesion inhibition, G0 /G1 cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Moreover, Y-632 efficiently overcame imatinib resistance mediated by Bcr-Abl point mutations both in vitro and in vivo. We believe that Y-632, acting as a novel small-molecule inhibitor of the Hsp90-Hsp70/Hsp90 organizing protein complex, has great potential to be a promising Hsp90 inhibitor for cancer therapy, such as for imatinib-resistant leukemia.","['(c) 2016 The Authors.

We have focused here on interleukin 4 (IL-4), a cytokine that protects normal and malignant B cells from apoptosis and increases surface immunoglobulin M (sIgM) expression on murine splenic B cells. First, we have demonstrated that IL-4 treatment increased sIgM expression in vitro on peripheral blood B cells obtained from healthy individuals. In CLL, IL-4 target genes are overexpressed in cells purified from the lymph nodes of patients compared with cells derived from matched blood and bone marrow samples. As for normal B cells, IL-4 increased sIgM expression on CLL cells in vitro, especially in samples expressing unmutated V-genes. IL-4-induced sIgM expression was associated with increased receptor signalling activity, measured by anti-IgM-induced calcium mobilization, and with increased expression of CD79B messenger RNA and protein, and the ""mature"" glycoform of sIgM. Importantly, the ability of the BCR-associated kinase inhibitors idelalisib and ibrutinib, approved for treatment of CLL and other B-cell malignancies, to inhibit anti-IgM-induced signalling was reduced following IL-4 pretreatment in samples from the majority of patients. In contrast to stimulatory effects on sIgM, IL-4 decreased CXCR4 and CXCR5 expression; therefore, CLL cells, particularly within the progressive unmutated V-gene subset, may harness the ability of IL-4 to promote BCR signalling and B-cell retention within lymph nodes. Effects of IL-4 were mediated via JAK3/STAT6 and we propose a potential role for JAK inhibitors in combination with BCR kinase inhibitors for the treatment of CLL.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Aguilar-Hernandez, Maria M', 'Blunt, Matthew D', 'Dobson, Rachel', 'Yeomans, Alison', 'Thirdborough, Stephen', 'Larrayoz, Marta', 'Smith, Lindsay D', 'Linley, Adam', 'Strefford, Jonathan C', 'Davies, Andrew', 'Johnson, Peter M W', 'Savelyeva, Natalia', 'Cragg, Mark S', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Packham, Graham', 'Stevenson, Freda K', 'Steele, Andrew J']","['Aguilar-Hernandez MM', 'Blunt MD', 'Dobson R', 'Yeomans A', 'Thirdborough S', 'Larrayoz M', 'Smith LD', 'Linley A', 'Strefford JC', 'Davies A', 'Johnson PM', 'Savelyeva N', 'Cragg MS', 'Forconi F', 'Packham G', 'Stevenson FK', 'Steele AJ']","['Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Medical Oncology, University Hospital Southampton National Health Service Trust, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom; Medical Oncology, University Hospital Southampton National Health Service Trust, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Antibody and Vaccine Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom; and.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom; Haematology Department, University Hospital Southampton National Health Service Trust, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160321,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (IL4 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT6 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT6 protein, human)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Interactions', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'STAT6 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2016/03/24 06:00,2017/08/03 06:00,['2016/03/23 06:00'],"['2015/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34464-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-11-682906 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jun 16;127(24):3015-25. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-11-682906.

We evaluated associations between lifestyle and hormonal deficits with risk of low BMD and frailty among survivors of ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants included 862 survivors of ALL (median age, 31.3 years [range, 18.4 to 59.7 years]) enrolled in the St Jude Lifetime Cohort study. Bone density was measured using quantitative computed tomography of L1 through L2 vertebrae; low BMD was defined as an age- and sex-standardized z score < -1. The presence of frailty or prefrailty was defined as having at least two of the following: low muscle mass, self-reported exhaustion, low energy expenditure, slow walking speed, and weakness. Hormonal deficiencies were determined according to medical history, medications, and laboratory findings (insulin-like growth factor 1, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone levels). Logistic regression was used to examine associations between lifestyle (smoking, alcohol consumption, and activity levels) and deficiencies in growth hormone (GHD) and/or sex steroids with low BMD and frailty. RESULTS: Thirty percent of survivors met criteria for low BMD, and 18.6% for frailty/prefrailty. After adjusting for body mass index, low BMD was associated with GHD (odds ratio [OR], 1.59; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.13) and current smoking (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.85) among men; and GHD (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.26 to 3.78) and moderate alcohol consumption (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.14 to 3.83) among women. After adjusting for current age, the odds of frailty/prefrailty were increased among men with GHD (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.56 to 5.67) and those who smoked (OR, 3.26; 95% CI, 1.65 to 6.43); there were no significant associations among women. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that survivors of ALL should receive counseling regarding lifestyle and undergo screening for hormonal deficits to minimize the risk of low BMD and frailty.",['(c) 2016 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Wilson, Carmen L', 'Chemaitilly, Wassim', 'Jones, Kendra E', 'Kaste, Sue C', 'Srivastava, Deo Kumar', 'Ojha, Rohit P', 'Yasui, Yutaka', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Ness, Kirsten K']","['Wilson CL', 'Chemaitilly W', 'Jones KE', 'Kaste SC', 'Srivastava DK', 'Ojha RP', 'Yasui Y', 'Pui CH', 'Robison LL', 'Hudson MM', 'Ness KK']","[""Carmen L.

Here we demonstrate analyses of IVLBCL biology using four xenograft mouse models established from primary IVLBCL samples. In all four models, the main characteristic of IVLBCL tumor cell proliferation within vessels was retained. Time-lapse engraftment analyses revealed that the tumor cells initially engrafted and proliferated in the sinusoids and vessels in the liver and then engrafted and proliferated in multiple organs. Intriguingly, serial passage of tumor cells from the adrenal gland of a transplanted mouse developed from primary patient bone marrow cells into a second mouse showed that the tumor cells mainly distributed into the adrenal gland in the second mouse, implying the existence of clonal selection and/or evolution at engraftment of a specific organ. Gene expression profiling analyses demonstrated that the gene set associated with cell migration was enriched for normal peripheral blood B cells, indicating that inhibition of cell migration might be involved in IVLBCL pathogenesis.

We analysed 25 patients with ES secondary to CLL, which were identified from a large series of consecutive patients with CLL, diagnosed and followed up in two institutions. They represented 2.9 % of the whole series. Thirteen patients presented with concurrent ITP and AIHA (simultaneous ES), while others developed the two AIC sequentially. Occurrence of ES was associated with unfavourable biological prognostic factors like ZAP-70 expression, unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene status, 17-p13 deletion and TP53 gene mutations. Of note, the majority of patients with ES (66 %) had stereotyped B cell receptor configuration. Most patients had short-lasting remissions and required second-line treatments to control the autoimmune manifestations of ES. Patients with ES were associated with inferior survival compared to patients not developing AIC, especially when ES developed early in the course of CLL, although the reduced survival was not confirmed by multivariate analysis.

We found that the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression levels of EZH2 in AML patients were both significantly higher than in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients. Furthermore, a positive correlation between EZH2 mRNA expression and percentage of peripheral blood blasts wa s found in AML patients (r = 0.404, p = 0.009). The migratory capacities of Kasumi-1 and HL-60, which both show a high level of EZH2 expression, were markedly higher than those of U937 and KG-1alpha. In contrast, silencing of EZH2 resulted in reduction in proliferation and migration ability and an increase in apoptosis. The latter observation was accompanied by reduced expression of associated proteins p-ERK, p-cmyc, and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and an increase in epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin).

Much has been learned about UCB transplant (UCBT) since the first human UCBT was performed back in 1988. Cord blood banks have been established worldwide for the collection, cryopreservation, and distribution of UCB for HSCT. Today, a global network of cord blood banks and transplant centers has been established with a large common inventory of more than 650,000 UCB units available, allowing for more than 40,000 UCBT worldwide in children and adults with severe hematological diseases. Several studies have been published on UCBT, assessing risk factors such as cell dose and HLA mismatch.

New strategies are ongoing to facilitate engraftment and reduce transplant-related mortality. In this issue, we review the current results of UCBT in adults with hematological malignancies and the clinical studies comparing UCBT with other transplant strategies.

Exploitation of HLA mismatching in order to reduce relapse is hampered by necessary interventions aimed at controlling GvHD on the one hand, and by the possibility of immune escape through selective loss of mismatched HLA in relapsing leukemia on the other. Retrospective studies reporting the impact of HLA mismatches on post-transplant relapse need to be interpreted with caution, due to many confounding factors, including disease and use of T-cell depletion, and to be constantly updated to the rapidly changing clinical protocols. Current evidence suggests similar relapse rates for 8/8, 7/8 HLA-matched unrelated, T-cell-replete haploidentical and umbilical cord blood transplantation; however, investigations of locus-specific effects are still scarce in the latter two settings. In unrelated transplantation, a specific role for mismatches at HLA-C and HLA-DPB1, and therein of permissive mismatches defined on the basis of T-cell alloreactivity and/or expression levels, in reducing relapse has been demonstrated in independent studies.

Whether PML has an impact on the replication of HIV-1 has not been fully addressed, but recent studies point to its possible involvement in the restriction of HIV-1 in human cells and in the maintenance of transcriptional latency in human cell lines in which HIV-1 is constitutively repressed. We investigated further the restriction of HIV-1 and a related lentivirus, SIVmac, by PML in murine cells and in a lymphocytic human cell line. In particular, we studied the relevance of PML to IFN-I-mediated inhibition and the role of individual human isoforms. RESULTS: We demonstrate that both human PML (hPML) and murine PML (mPML) inhibit the early post-entry stages of the replication of HIV-1 and a related lentivirus, SIVmac. In addition, HIV-1 was transcriptionally silenced by mPML and by hPML isoforms I, II, IV and VI in MEFs. This PML-mediated transcriptional repression was attenuated in presence of the histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA. In contrast, depletion of PML had no effect on HIV-1 gene expression in a human T cell line. PML was found to contribute to the inhibition of HIV-1 by IFN-I. Specifically, IFN-alpha and IFN-beta treatments of MEFs enhanced the PML-dependent inhibition of HIV-1 early replication stages. CONCLUSIONS: We show that PML can inhibit HIV-1 and other lentiviruses as part of the IFN-I-mediated response. The restriction takes place at two distinct steps, i.e. reverse transcription and transcription, and in an isoform-specific, cellular context-specific fashion. Our results support a model in which PML activates innate immune antilentiviral effectors. These data are relevant to the development of latency reversal-inducing pharmacological agents, since PML was previously proposed as a pharmacological target for such inhibitors. This study also has implications for the development of murine models of HIV-1.",,"['Masroori, Nasser', 'Merindol, Natacha', 'Berthoux, Lionel']","['Masroori N', 'Merindol N', 'Berthoux L']","['Laboratory of Retrovirology, Department of Medical Biology and BioMed Research Group, Universite du Quebec a Trois-Rivieres, Trois-Rivieres, QC, Canada.', 'Laboratory of Retrovirology, Department of Medical Biology and BioMed Research Group, Universite du Quebec a Trois-Rivieres, Trois-Rivieres, QC, Canada.', 'Laboratory of Retrovirology, Department of Medical Biology and BioMed Research Group, Universite du Quebec a Trois-Rivieres, Trois-Rivieres, QC, Canada. berthoux@uqtr.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160322,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'HIV-1/*immunology/physiology', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/*immunology/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', '*Virus Replication']",2016/03/24 06:00,2016/10/13 06:00,['2016/03/23 06:00'],"['2016/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-016-0253-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-016-0253-1 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2016 Mar 22;13:19. doi: 10.1186/s12977-016-0253-1.,10.1186/s12977-016-0253-1 [doi],,,PMC4802722,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['HIV-1', 'Innate immunity', 'Interferon', 'Latency', 'Lentivirus', 'PML', 'Restriction factor']",['MOP-102712/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7776-5058'],,,,,,

Here, we examine the survival for patients diagnosed with CLL in Germany in 1997-2011. METHODS: Data were extracted from 12 cancer registries in Germany and compared to the data from the USA. Period analysis was used to estimate 5- and 10-year relative survival (RS). RESULTS: Five- and 10-year RS estimates in 2009-2011 of 80.2 and 59.5%, respectively, in Germany and 82.4 and 64.7%, respectively, in the USA were observed. Overall, 5-year RS increased significantly in Germany and the difference compared to the survival in the USA which slightly decreased between 2003-2005 and 2009-2011. However, age-specific analyses showed persistently higher survival for all ages except for 15-44 in the USA. In general, survival decreased with age, but the age-related disparity was small for patients younger than 75. In both countries, 5-year RS was >80% for patients less than 75 years of age but <70% for those age 75+. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 5-year survival for patients with CLL is good, but 10-year survival is significantly lower, and survival was much lower for those age 75+. Major differences in survival between countries were not observed.

We applied the Varian RapidArc software to calculate and optimize the dose distribution. Emphasis was placed on applying a homogenous dose to the PTV and on reducing the dose to the lungs. METHODS: From July 2013 to July 2014 seven patients with leukaemia were planned and treated with a VMAT-based TBI-technique with photon energy of 6 MV. The overall planning target volume (PTV), comprising the whole body, had to be split into 8 segments with a subsequent multi-isocentric planning. In a first step a dose optimization of each single segment was performed. In a second step all these elements were calculated in one overall dose-plan, considering particular constraints and weighting factors, to achieve the final total body dose distribution. The quality assurance comprised the verification of the irradiation plans via ArcCheck (Sun Nuclear), followed by in vivo dosimetry via dosimeters (MOSFETs) on the patient. RESULTS: The time requirements for treatment planning were high: contouring took 5-6 h, optimization and dose calculation 25-30 h and quality assurance 6-8 h. The couch-time per fraction was 2 h on day one, decreasing to around 1.5 h for the following fractions, including patient information, time for arc positioning, patient positioning verification, mounting of the MOSFETs and irradiation. The mean lung dose was decreased to at least 80 % of the planned total body dose and in the central parts to 50 %. In two cases we additionally pursued a dose reduction of 30 to 50 % in a pre-irradiated brain and in renal insufficiency. All high dose areas were outside the lungs and other OARs. The planned dose was in line with the measured dose via MOSFETs: in the axilla the mean difference between calculated and measured dose was 3.6 % (range 1.1-6.8 %), and for the wrist/hip-inguinal region it was 4.3 % (range 1.1-8.1 %). CONCLUSION: TBI with VMAT provides the benefit of satisfactory dose distribution within the PTV, while selectively reducing the dose to the lungs and, if necessary, in other organs.

TJs [claudin5 (CLDN5), occludin (OCLN) and ZO-1] concentrations were measured in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained from 45 leukaemia patients. Serum ZO-1 was significantly higher (p < 0.05), but CSF ZO-1 levels were not significantly higher in the CNS leukaemia (CNSL) compared to the non-CNSL. The CNSL patients also had a lower CLDN5/ZO1 ratio in both serum and CSF than in non-CNSL patients (p < 0.05). The TJ index was negatively associated with WBCCSF , ALBCSF and BBB values in leukaemia patients. Among all of the parameters studied, CLDN5CSF had the highest specificity in discriminating between CNSL and non-CNSL patients. Therefore, analysing serum and CSF levels of CLDN5, OCLN and the CLDN5/ZO1 ratio is valuable in evaluating the potential of leukaemia CNS metastasis.

To address the mechanism of FLT3 inhibitor resistance, we generated two resistant AML cell lines by sustained treatment with the FLT3 inhibitor sorafenib. Parental cell lines carry the FLT3-ITD (tandem duplication) mutation and are highly responsive to FLT3 inhibitors, whereas resistant cell lines display resistance to multiple FLT3 inhibitors. Sanger sequencing and protein mass-spectrometry did not identify any acquired mutations in FLT3 in the resistant cells. Moreover, sorafenib treatment effectively blocked FLT3 activation in resistant cells, whereas it was unable to block colony formation or cell survival, suggesting that the resistant cells are no longer FLT3 dependent. Gene expression analysis of sensitive and resistant cell lines, as well as of blasts from patients with sorafenib-resistant AML, suggested an enrichment of the PI3K/mTOR pathway in the resistant phenotype, which was further supported by next-generation sequencing and phospho-specific-antibody array analysis. Furthermore, a selective PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, gedatolisib, efficiently blocked proliferation, colony and tumor formation, and induced apoptosis in resistant cell lines. Gedatolisib significantly extended survival of mice in a sorafenib-resistant AML patient-derived xenograft model. Taken together, our data suggest that aberrant activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway in FLT3-ITD-dependent AML results in resistance to drugs targeting FLT3.",,"['Lindblad, O', 'Cordero, E', 'Puissant, A', 'Macaulay, L', 'Ramos, A', 'Kabir, N N', 'Sun, J', 'Vallon-Christersson, J', 'Haraldsson, K', 'Hemann, M T', 'Borg, A', 'Levander, F', 'Stegmaier, K', 'Pietras, K', 'Ronnstrand, L', 'Kazi, J U']","['Lindblad O', 'Cordero E', 'Puissant A', 'Macaulay L', 'Ramos A', 'Kabir NN', 'Sun J', 'Vallon-Christersson J', 'Haraldsson K', 'Hemann MT', 'Borg A', 'Levander F', 'Stegmaier K', 'Pietras K', 'Ronnstrand L', 'Kazi JU']","['Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology and Vascular Disorders, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Laboratory of Computational Biochemistry, KN Biomedical Research Institute, Barisal, Bangladesh.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology and Pathology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology and Pathology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Oncology and Pathology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Bioinformatics Infrastructure for Life Sciences (BILS), Department of Immunotechnology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Laboratory of Computational Biochemistry, KN Biomedical Research Institute, Barisal, Bangladesh.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160321,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Triazines)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '96265TNH2R (gedatolisib)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Morpholines/*administration & dosage', 'Mutation', 'Niacinamide/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*administration & dosage', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sorafenib', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Triazines/*administration & dosage', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2016/03/22 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/03/22 06:00'],"['2015/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/12 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['onc201641 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2016.41 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2016 Sep 29;35(39):5119-31. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.41.

We report the first kindred with infant ALL in non-twin siblings. The siblings were diagnosed with MLL-rearranged (MLL-R) ALL 26 months apart. The second affected sibling had an unaffected dichorionic monozygous co-twin. Both had fatal outcomes. PROCEDURES: Translocations were characterized by karyotype, FISH, multiplex FISH, and MLL breakpoint cluster region (bcr) Southern blot analysis. Breakpoint junctions and fusion transcripts were cloned by PCR. TP53 mutation and NADPH quinone oxidorecuctase 1 (NQO1) C609T analyses were performed, and pedigree history and parental occupations were ascertained. The likelihood of chance occurrence of infant ALL in non-twin siblings was computed based on a binomial distribution. Zygosity was determined by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. RESULTS: The translocations were not related or vertically transmitted. The complex karyotype of the proband's ALL had chromosome 2, 3, 4, and 11 abnormalities causing a 5'-MLL-AFF1-3' fusion and a non-productive rearrangement of 3'MLL with a chromosome 3q intergenic region. The affected twin's ALL exhibited a simple t(4;11). The complex karyotype of the proband's ALL suggested a genotoxic insult, but no exposure was identified. There was no germline TP53 mutation. The NQO1 C609T risk allele was absent. The likelihood of infant ALL occurring in non-twin siblings by chance alone is one in 1.198 x 10(9) families. CONCLUSIONS: Whether because of a deleterious transplacental exposure, novel predisposition syndrome, or exceedingly rare chance occurrence, MLL-R infant ALL can occur in non-twin siblings. The discordant occurrence of infant ALL in the monozygous twins was likely because they were dichorionic.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Urtishak, Karen A', 'Robinson, Blaine W', 'Rappaport, Eric F', 'Sarezky, Margaret D', 'Biegel, Jaclyn A', 'Nichols, Kim E', 'Wilmoth, Donna M', 'Wang, Li-San', 'Stern, Julie W', 'Felix, Carolyn A']","['Urtishak KA', 'Robinson BW', 'Rappaport EF', 'Sarezky MD', 'Biegel JA', 'Nichols KE', 'Wilmoth DM', 'Wang LS', 'Stern JW', 'Felix CA']","[""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Nucleic Acids & Protein Core Facility, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Human Genetics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Twin Study']",20160321,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Chromosomes, Human/*genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', '*Siblings', '*Translocation, Genetic', '*Twins, Dizygotic']",2016/03/22 06:00,2017/03/18 06:00,['2016/03/22 06:00'],"['2015/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/29 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25957 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Jul;63(7):1175-80. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25957.

Damage to the heart and liver often occurs even when the dose is lower than the therapeutic dose. Based on the results of cell experiments in vitro in this study, we investigated the synergistic activity of carnosic acid (CA) combined with ATO in the SCID mouse model of human promyelocytic leukaemia in vivo. A NB4/SCID mouse model was established in this study. The NB4/SCID mice were randomly divided into three treatment groups (CA alone, ATO alone and CA combined with ATO) and a control group based on factorial design. The evaluation indicators of the curative effect of the drugs included expressions of cleaved caspase-3, PTEN, p27 gene mRNA and proteins by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. The survival time was compared between the four groups. The results indicated that verification of the NB4/SCID mouse model was confirmed by histopathological examination. Compared with mice treated by CA or ATO alone, the mice in the combination of CA and ATO group had a higher rate of apoptosis, which was linked with expressions of cleaved caspase-3, PTEN, p27 gene mRNA and proteins. Also, the mice with the longest survival time were those treated with the combination of CA and ATO. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that CA and ATO in combination have strong synergistic antileukaemic effects on cell activity.","['(c) 2016 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former Nordic', 'Pharmacological Society).']","['Hao, Li', 'Ran, Wang', 'Xiang-Xin, Li', 'Lu-Qun, Wang', 'Xiao-Ning, Yu']","['Hao L', 'Ran W', 'Xiang-Xin L', 'Lu-Qun W', 'Xiao-Ning Y']","['Department of Hematology in Tumor Prevention and Treatment Center, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology in Tumor Prevention and Treatment Center, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology in Tumor Prevention and Treatment Center, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology in Tumor Prevention and Treatment Center, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology in Tumor Prevention and Treatment Center, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160506,England,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol,Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology,101208422,"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'LI791SXT24 (salvin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Abietanes/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism']",2016/03/22 06:00,2017/03/10 06:00,['2016/03/22 06:00'],"['2015/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bcpt.12580 [doi]'],ppublish,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol. 2016 Sep;119(3):259-66. doi: 10.1111/bcpt.12580.

High-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (MS) (high resolution) in combination with off-line radioactivity detection was used for metabolite identification. In total, six metabolites of omacetaxine were detected. The reactions represented were mepesuccinate ester hydrolysis, methyl ester hydrolysis, pyrocatechol conversion from the 1,3-dioxole ring. Unchanged omacetaxine was the most prominent omacetaxine-related compound in plasma. In urine, unchanged omacetaxine was also dominant, together with 4'-DMHHT. In feces very little unchanged omacetaxine was found and the pyrocatechol metabolite of omacetaxine, M534 and 4'-desmethyl homoharringtonine (4'-DMHHT) was the most abundant metabolites.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A nationwide prospective cohort of 90,957 radiologic technologists, who responded to a 1994-1998 survey that collected information on whether they had ever worked with fluoroscopically guided interventional procedures, was followed through completion of a subsequent cohort survey during 2003-2005 (for cancer incidence) or December 31, 2008 (for cancer mortality). Sex-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were calculated by use of Cox proportional hazards models for incidence and mortality from all cancers other than nonmelanoma skin cancer and for specific cancer outcomes in participants who reported ever performing fluoroscopically guided interventional procedures compared with technologists who never performed these procedures. RESULTS: The analysis showed an approximately twofold increased risk of brain cancer mortality (HR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.48-4.40) and modest elevations in incidence of melanoma (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.61) and in breast cancer incidence (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.02-1.32) but not mortality (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.69-1.66) among technologists who performed fluoroscopically guided interventional procedures compared with those who never performed these procedures. Although there was a small suggestive increase in incidence of all cancers combined, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.00-1.17), mortality from all cancers combined, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers, was not elevated (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.88-1.14). We similarly observed no elevated risk of cancers of the thyroid, skin other than melanoma, prostate, lung, or colon and rectum or of leukemia that was not chronic lymphocytic leukemia among workers who performed fluoroscopically guided interventional procedures. CONCLUSION: We observed elevated risks of brain cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma among technologists who performed fluoroscopically guided interventional procedures. Although exposure to low-dose radiation is one possible explanation for these increased risks, these results may also be due to chance or unmeasured confounding by nonradiation risk factors. Our results must be confirmed in other studies, preferably with individual radiation dose data.",,"['Rajaraman, Preetha', 'Doody, Michele M', 'Yu, Chu Ling', 'Preston, Dale L', 'Miller, Jeremy S', 'Sigurdson, Alice J', 'Freedman, D Michal', 'Alexander, Bruce H', 'Little, Mark P', 'Miller, Donald L', 'Linet, Martha S']","['Rajaraman P', 'Doody MM', 'Yu CL', 'Preston DL', 'Miller JS', 'Sigurdson AJ', 'Freedman DM', 'Alexander BH', 'Little MP', 'Miller DL', 'Linet MS']","['1 Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, U.

It induces apoptosis in CLL cells in vitro and was introduced into clinical trials in CLL as an intravenous infusion in 1997, which proved disappointing. Since the drug avidly binds to plasma proteins, higher serum concentrations were required for clinical antileukemia activity than those suggested by in vitro studies. Subsequent studies utilizing bolus plus infusional doses revealed significant activity against CLL, even in patients with unfavorable characteristics. However, significant toxicity including high rates of major tumor lysis syndrome, cytokine release syndrome and secretory diarrhea were also observed. AREAS COVERED: The chemistry, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and metabolism of alvocidib are briefly discussed and phase I-II studies in CLL are discussed in detail. To date, no phase III studies in CLL have been reported. EXPERT OPINION: A number of much less toxic drugs with similar efficacy against CLL both with and without unfavorable cytogenetics have come to market. Furthermore, enthusiasm for the development of alvocidib as a single agent for the treatment of CLL has waned, primarily due to its toxicity.",,"['Wiernik, Peter H']",['Wiernik PH'],"['a Cancer Research Foundation of New York , Bronx , NY , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160407,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Flavonoids/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Piperidines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2016/03/22 06:00,2017/03/11 06:00,['2016/03/22 06:00'],"['2016/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2016.1169273 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2016 Jun;25(6):729-34. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2016.1169273.

METHODS: The incidence of lymphocytosis and its association with response, survival, and side effects were assessed in patients from 3 large clinical trials. Overall, 1402 dasatinib-treated patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase (CML-CP), CML-CP refractory/intolerant to imatinib, or with CML in accelerated or myeloid-blast phase were analyzed. RESULTS: Lymphocytosis developed in 32% to 35% of patients and persisted for >12 months. This was not observed in the patients who received treatment with imatinib. Dasatinib-treated patients in all stages of CML who developed lymphocytosis were more likely to achieve a complete cytogenetic response, and patients who had CML-CP with lymphocytosis were more likely to achieve major and deep molecular responses. Progression-free and overall survival rates were significantly longer in patients with CML-CP who were refractory to or intolerant of imatinib and had lymphocytosis. Pleural effusions developed more commonly in patients with lymphocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, lymphocytosis occurred and persisted in many dasatinib-treated patients in all phases of CML. Its presence was associated with higher response rates, significantly longer response durations, and increased overall survival, suggesting an immunomodulatory effect. Prospective studies are warranted to characterize the functional activity of these cells and to assess whether an immunologic effect against CML is detectable. Cancer 2016;122:1398-1407.

The study included 50 cases of hematological malignancies which were followed for one month after initial therapy along with 30 controls. All of them were subjected to immunostaining by anti-VEGF and factor VIII antibodies on bone marrow biopsy along with the measurement of serum VEGF levels. Significantly higher pretreatment VEGF scores, serum VEGF levels, and MVD were observed in cases as compared to controls (p < 0.05). The highest VEGF score and serum VEGF were observed in chronic myeloid leukemia and maximum MVD in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Significant decrease in serum VEGF levels after treatment was observed in all hematological malignancies except for AML.

Subcutaneous Sweet's syndrome, or Sweet's panniculitis, is an uncommon variant of the classic syndrome, with hypodermal neutrophilic infiltration. The association of Sweet's syndrome with various malignancies has been reported. The most common underlying hematological malignancies are of myeloid origin; however, there have been several reports of the classic Sweet's syndrome in patients with a lymphoproliferative disorder, although the association of subcutaneous Sweet's syndrome with lymphoproliferative disorders has not been well-documented thus far. Herein, we present the case of a 48-year-old man with a 2-year history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia who developed fever and skin rashes, without any evidence of a relapse. The clinical and pathological investigation resulted in the diagnosis of subcutaneous Sweet's syndrome. The patient exhibited no significant response to conventional therapeutic measures; however, following two subsequent doses of rituximab, his general condition and skin rash improved. The follow-up skin biopsy demonstrated dermal neutrophilic infiltrations in conjunction with prior mixed lobular and septal panniculitis, suggesting evolution of subcutaneous Sweet's syndrome to its classic form. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first reports of rituximab as a novel biological treatment for Sweet's syndrome.

Cerrena unicolor is a novel fungal source of highly active extracellular laccase (ex-LAC) that is currently used in industry. However, to the best of our knowledge, no reports regarding its anti-leukemic activity have been published thus far. In the present study, it was hypothesized that C. unicolor ex-LAC may possess cytotoxic activity against leukemic cell lines and CLL primary cells. C. unicolor ex-LAC was separated using anion exchange chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose-Sepharose and Sephadex G-50 columns. The cytotoxic effects of ex-LAC upon 24- and 48-h treatment on HL-60, Jurkat, RPMI 8226 and K562 cell lines, as well as CLL primary cells of nine patients with CLL, were evaluated using 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) assay. Annexin V/propidium iodide staining of Jurkat cells treated with ex-LAC was used to investigate apoptosis via flow cytometry. Ex-LAC induced changes in Jurkat and RPMI 8226 cells, as visualized by fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The XTT assay revealed high cytotoxic rates following treatment with various concentrations of ex-LAC on all the cell lines and CLL primary cells analyzed, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration ranging from 0.4 to 1.1 microg/ml. Fluorescence microscopy and SEM observations additionally revealed apoptotic changes in Jurkat and RPMI 8226 cells treated with ex-LAC, compared with control cells. These results were in agreement with the apoptosis analysis of Jurkat cells on flow cytometry. In conclusion, C. unicolor ex-LAC was able to significantly induce cell apoptosis, and may represent a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of various hematological neoplasms.",,"['Matuszewska, Anna', 'Karp, Marta', 'Jaszek, Magdalena', 'Janusz, Grzegorz', 'Osinska-Jaroszuk, Monika', 'Sulej, Justyna', 'Stefaniuk, Dawid', 'Tomczak, Waldemar', 'Giannopoulos, Krzysztof']","['Matuszewska A', 'Karp M', 'Jaszek M', 'Janusz G', 'Osinska-Jaroszuk M', 'Sulej J', 'Stefaniuk D', 'Tomczak W', 'Giannopoulos K']","['Department of Biochemistry, Maria Curie-Sklodowska University, Lublin 20-033, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hemato-Oncology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin 20-093, Poland; Postgraduate School of Molecular Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw 02-091, Poland.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Maria Curie-Sklodowska University, Lublin 20-033, Poland.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Maria Curie-Sklodowska University, Lublin 20-033, Poland.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Maria Curie-Sklodowska University, Lublin 20-033, Poland.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Maria Curie-Sklodowska University, Lublin 20-033, Poland.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Maria Curie-Sklodowska University, Lublin 20-033, Poland.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin 20-081, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hemato-Oncology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin 20-093, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160209,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,,2016/03/22 06:00,2016/03/22 06:01,['2016/03/22 06:00'],"['2015/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2016.4220 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-4220 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2016 Mar;11(3):2009-2018. doi: 10.3892/ol.2016.4220.

Because transcription of the BLV is quickly blocked after infection, detecting integrated provirus at host genome is an important method of identifying whether an animal is infected. The aim of the present study was to develop a novel direct blood-based PCR system to detect the BLV provirus with high specificity and at low cost. The assay was based on the BLV-CoCoMo degenerate primers, which amplify all known BLV strains. Cattle blood samples (n = 182) were collected from the same BLV-positive farm and subjected to BLV-CoCoMo-direct-PCR to detect the BLV provirus. The proviral load was then estimated. This novel PCR method showed 100 % specificity. The BLV-CoCoMo-direct-PCR can be used in a variety of laboratory situations because it does not require expensive equipment/reagents, DNA purification, or a second round of PCR. Therefore, the method is extremely cost-effective and the risk of a false-positive result due to DNA contamination is very low.",,"['Takeshima, Shin-Nosuke', 'Watanuki, Sonoko', 'Ishizaki, Hiroshi', 'Matoba, Kazuhiro', 'Aida, Yoko']","['Takeshima SN', 'Watanuki S', 'Ishizaki H', 'Matoba K', 'Aida Y']","['Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan.', 'NARO Institute of Livestock and Grassland Sciences, 768 Senbonmatsu, Nasushiobara, Tochigi, 329-2793, Japan.', 'NARO Institute of Livestock and Grassland Sciences, 768 Senbonmatsu, Nasushiobara, Tochigi, 329-2793, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan. aida@riken.jp.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",20160321,Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Cattle', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/blood/genetics', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*blood/diagnosis/*virology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Proviruses/*genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2016/03/22 06:00,2017/01/31 06:00,['2016/03/22 06:00'],"['2015/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00705-016-2806-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00705-016-2806-y [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Virol. 2016 Jun;161(6):1539-46. doi: 10.1007/s00705-016-2806-y.

From a retinoic acid (RA)-sensitive acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line, we derived an RA-resistant clone characterized by a block in transcription initiation, despite maintaining wild-type PML/RARA expression. We uncovered an aberrant interaction among PML/RARA, nucleophosmin (NPM), and topoisomerase II beta (TOP2B). Surprisingly, RA stimulation in these cells results in enhanced chromatin association of the nucleosome remodeler BRG1. Inhibition of NPM or TOP2B abrogated BRG1 recruitment. Furthermore, NPM inhibition and targeting BRG1 restored differentiation when combined with RA. Here, we demonstrate a role for NPM and BRG1 in obstructing RA differentiation and implicate chromatin remodeling in mediating therapeutic resistance in malignancies.

METHODS: We conducted a nationwide survey to investigate the impact of HTLV-1 status on living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) in Japan. We analyzed the cases of 82 HTLV-1-positive recipients and six HTLV-1-negative-before-LDLT recipients who received a hepatic graft from HTLV-1-positive donors. RESULTS: Adult T-cell leukemia developed in five recipients who ultimately died. Of these five, two received grafts from HTLV-1-positive donors and three from HTLV-1-negative donors. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year ATL development rates were 4.5%, 6.5%, and 9.2%, respectively. Fulminant hepatic failure as a pre-transplant diagnosis was identified as an independent risk factor for ATL development (P = 0.001). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates for HTLV-1-positive recipients who received grafts from HTLV-1-negative donors were 79.9%, 66.1%, and 66.1%, and from HTLV-1-positive donors were 83.3%, 83.3%, and 60.8%, respectively. The 1-year survival rate for HTLV-1-negative recipients who received grafts from HTLV-1-positive donors was 33.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Fulminant hepatic failure is an independent risk factor for ATL development in HTLV-1-positive recipients.

Elevated TRIB2 leads to the degradation of C/EBPalpha p42, leaving p30 intact in AML. Whether this relationship is a cooperative event in AML transformation is not known and the molecular mechanism involved remains elusive. Using mouse genetics, our data reveal that in the complete absence of C/EBPalpha, TRIB2 was unable to induce AML. Only in the presence of C/EBPalpha p42 and p30, were TRIB2 and p30 able to cooperate to decrease the latency of disease. We demonstrate that the molecular mechanism involved in the degradation of C/EBPalpha p42 requires site-specific direct interaction between TRIB2 and C/EBPalpha p42 for the K48-specific ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of C/EBPalpha p42. This interaction and ubiquitination is dependent on a critical C terminal lysine residue on C/EBPalpha. We show effective targeting of this pathway pharmacologically using proteasome inhibitors in TRIB2-positive AML cells. Together, our data show that excess p30 cooperated with TRIB2 only in the presence of p42 to accelerate AML, and the direct interaction and degradation of C/EBPalpha p42 is required for TRIB2-mediated AML.",,"[""O'Connor, C"", 'Lohan, F', 'Campos, J', 'Ohlsson, E', 'Salome, M', 'Forde, C', 'Artschwager, R', 'Liskamp, R M', 'Cahill, M R', 'Kiely, P A', 'Porse, B', 'Keeshan, K']","[""O'Connor C"", 'Lohan F', 'Campos J', 'Ohlsson E', 'Salome M', 'Forde C', 'Artschwager R', 'Liskamp RM', 'Cahill MR', 'Kiely PA', 'Porse B', 'Keeshan K']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", 'The Finsen Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Center (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Danish Stem Cell Centre (DanStem) Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", 'University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.', 'School of Chemistry, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'School of Chemistry, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Cork University Hospital, Cork, Ireland.', 'Department of Life Sciences, Materials and Surface Science Institute and Stokes Institute, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland.', 'The Finsen Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Center (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Danish Stem Cell Centre (DanStem) Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160321,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (TRIB2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Protein Isoforms/biosynthesis/*genetics']",2016/03/22 06:00,2017/08/31 06:00,['2016/03/22 06:00'],"['2015/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/06 00:00 [revised]', '2016/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/31 06:00 [medline]', '2016/03/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc201666 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2016.66 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2016 Oct 6;35(40):5272-5281. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.66.

However, it is unclear whether intrinsic epigenetic events can drive reprogramming to naive pluripotency or if distinct chromatin states are instead simply a reflection of discrete pluripotent states. Here, we show that blocking histone H3K4 methyltransferase MLL1 activity with the small-molecule inhibitor MM-401 reprograms mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) to naive pluripotency. This reversion is highly efficient and synchronized, with more than 50% of treated EpiSCs exhibiting features of naive embryonic stem cells (ESCs) within 3 days. Reverted ESCs reactivate the silenced X chromosome and contribute to embryos following blastocyst injection, generating germline-competent chimeras. Importantly, blocking MLL1 leads to global redistribution of H3K4me1 at enhancers and represses lineage determinant factors and EpiSC markers, which indirectly regulate ESC transcription circuitry. These findings show that discrete perturbation of H3K4 methylation is sufficient to drive reprogramming to naive pluripotency.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Currently there are conflicting reports in the literature with regard to whether glioblastoma (GBM) brain cancer cell migration and invasion is rigidity-sensitive. In order to address this question we have compared the rigidity-response of primary patient-derived GBM lines. Cells were plated on polyacrylamide gels of defined rigidity that reflect the diversity of the brain tissue mechanical environment, and cell morphology and migration were analysed by time-lapse microscopy. Invasiveness was assessed in multicellular spheroids embedded in 3D matrigel cultures. Our data reveal a range of rigidity-dependent responses between the patient-derived cell lines, from reduced migration on the most compliant tissue stiffness to those that are insensitive to substrate rigidity and are equally migratory irrespective of the underlying substrate stiffness. Notably, the rigidity-insensitive GBM cells show the greatest invasive capacity in soft 3D matrigel cultures.

Previous characterization revealed that MCL1 is expressed exclusively in the Leydig cells in the mouse testis, yet what it does in these cells remains unknown. We therefore analyzed testosterone biosynthesis in isolated primary Leydig cells and the MA-10 cell line, in which MCL1 was knocked down using an siRNA strategy. The mRNA abundance of the steroidogenic genes Star, Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, Hsd3b1, Srd5a, and the luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor Lhcgr were significantly reduced following MCL1 knockdown. Of the two enzymes required for testosterone biosynthesis, STAR and P450 SCC (encoded by Cyp11a1) enzyme abundance was also reduced following Mcl1 siRNA treatment, possibly leading to the reduced production of sex steroid precursors, and testosterone in these knockdown cells. Despite its classification as an anti-apoptosis protein, Mcl1 siRNA treatment did not affect cell survival. Collectively, our findings indicate that MCL1 plays a pivotal role in Leydig-cell steroidogenesis, and might provide novel insights into metabolic regulation in this cell. Mol. Reprod.

We report the outcome of SCT in 22 patients with T315I(+) CML, most (n = 16) from haploidentical family donors (HID-SCT). At the time the mutation was detected, 8 patients were in the chronic phase (CP), 7 in the accelerated phase (AP), and 7 in the blast phase (BP). At the time of SCT 7 were in the CP, 8 in the AP or returning to the CP post-AP (AP/AP-CPn), and 7 in the BP or returning to CP post-BP (BP/BP-CPn). The cumulative incidence of grades III to IV acute graft-versus-host disease was 9.1%. Chronic graft-versus-host disease was observed in 60.0% of patients, including 25.0% who suffered from severe disease. Four patients died of transplant-related complications at a median interval from SCT of 16.3 months. The estimated 2-year leukemia-free survival rate was 80.0%, 72.9%, and 0% in CP, AP/AP-CPn and BP/BP-CPn groups at the time of SCT, respectively. After a median follow-up of 17.3 months from SCT, 14 patients are alive, including 13 in complete molecular response and 1 with an extramedullary relapse. In conclusion, HID-SCT is a potentially curative treatment for T315I + CML patients. For patients in CP/AP, immediate SCT might result in promising survival. The outcome of patients in BP with T315I(+) mutation remains very poor.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: A number of 4389 images from 105 patients were selected by pathologists, based on morphologic visual appearance, from patients whose diagnosis was confirmed by all the remaining complementary tests. Besides geometry, new color and texture features were extracted using six alternative color spaces to obtain rich information to characterize the cell groups. The recognition system was designed using support vector machines trained with the whole image set. RESULTS: In the experimental tests, individual sets of images from 21 new patients were analyzed by the trained recognition system and compared with the true diagnosis. An overall recognition accuracy of 97.67% was achieved when the cell screening was performed into three groups: normal lymphocytes, abnormal lymphoid cells, and reactive lymphocytes. The accuracy of the whole experimental study was 91.23% when considering the further discrimination of the abnormal lymphoid cells into the specific five groups. CONCLUSION: The excellent automatic screening of the three groups of normal, reactive, and abnormal lymphocytes is useful as it discriminates between malignancy and not malignancy. The discrimination of the five groups of abnormal lymphoid cells is encouraging toward the idea that the system could be an automated image-based screening method to identify blood involvement by a variety of B lymphomas.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Alferez, S', 'Merino, A', 'Bigorra, L', 'Rodellar, J']","['Alferez S', 'Merino A', 'Bigorra L', 'Rodellar J']","['Matematica Aplicada III, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hemotherapy-Hemostasis, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Matematica Aplicada III, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hemotherapy-Hemostasis, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Matematica Aplicada III, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Biomarkers', 'Humans', 'Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Immunophenotyping/instrumentation/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/*diagnosis', 'Optical Imaging/instrumentation/methods', 'Phenotype']",2016/03/21 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/03/21 06:00'],"['2015/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12473 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2016 Apr;38(2):209-19. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12473.,10.1111/ijlh.12473 [doi],,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Abnormal lymphoid cells', 'automatic cell classification', 'blood cells', 'digital image processing', 'morphologic analysis', 'peripheral blood']",,,,,,,,,,,,

It is an important source of tetracyclic dipyrano coumarins (Soulatrolide) and Mammea type coumarins. Soulatrolide is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and displays activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Meanwhile, Mammea A/BA and A/BB, pure or as a mixture, are highly active against several human leukemia cell lines, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania amazonensis. Nevertheless, there are few studies evaluating their safety profile. In the present work we performed toxicogenomic and toxicological analysis for both type of compounds. Soulatrolide, and the Mammea A/BA + A/BB mixture (2.1) were slightly toxic accordingly to Lorke assay classification (DL50 > 3000 mg/kg). After a short-term administration (100 mg/kg/daily, orally, 1 week) liver toxicogenomic analysis revealed 46 up and 72 downregulated genes for Mammea coumarins, and 665 up and 1077 downregulated genes for Soulatrolide. Gene enrichment analysis identified transcripts involved in drug metabolism for both compounds. In addition, network analysis through protein-protein interactions, tissue evaluation by TUNEL assay, and histological examination revealed no tissue damage on liver, kidney and spleen after treatments.

Though the poor outcome of PPCL has been slightly improved by novel treatments during the last 10 years, due to the limited number of available studies in this uncommon disease, optimal therapy remains a classic unmet clinical need. Anyway, in the real-life practice, induction with a bortezomib-based three-drug combination, including dexamethasone and, possibly, lenalidomide, or, alternatively, thalidomide, cyclophosphamide, or doxorubicin, is a reasonable first-line option. This approach may be particularly advisable for patients with adverse cytogenetics, hyperleucocytosis, and rapidly progressive disease, in whom a fast response is required, or for those with suboptimal renal function, where, however, lenalidomide should be used with caution until renal activity is restored. In younger subjects, leukemia/lymphoma-like more intensive regimens, including hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone or continue-infusion cisplatin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide, may be also combined with bortezomib +/- thalidomide. Treatment must be started immediately after a diagnosis of PPCL is made to avoid the risk of irreversible disease complications and, in such a context, the prevention of tumor lysis syndrome is mandatory. In patients eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (AuSCT), other alkylating agents, in particular melphalan, should be initially avoided in order to allow adequate collections of CD34+ peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). A combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone may be a valuable alternative option to manage older or unfit patients or those with slower disease evolution or with signs of neuropathy, contraindicating the use of bortezomib. Patients not suitable for transplant procedures should continue the treatment, if a response occurs and if tolerated, considering the possibility of a prolonged maintenance therapy. AuSCT should be pursued in all eligible patients less than 65 years old who achieve a significant response after a short course of induction treatment. PBSC collection should reach a threshold of at least 5 x 10(6) CD34+ PBSC/kg using cyclophosphamide plus G-CSF and adding the mobilizing agent plerixafor, if necessary. High-dose melphalan (HDM) (200 or 140 mg/m(2), according to age and renal function) remains the preferable conditioning regimen. A second AuSCT should be always considered, even in patients achieving complete response (CR) after the first AuSCT, as the short progression-free survival (PFS) generally seen in PPCL suggests the persistence of a relevant burden of residual disease; this provides a strong rationale for the use of post-transplantation therapies in PPCL to improve depth of response, to maintain remission, and, possibly, to increase survival, though consolidation and/or maintenance strategies with novel agents, whose efficacy has been well demonstrated in MM, have not been still extensively evaluated in PPCL. The search of a suitable donor should start as soon as possible and an allogeneic stem cell transplant (AlloSCT) with a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen discussed with younger patients responsive to induction therapy and with poor prognostic parameters at diagnosis. A sequence of AuSCT followed by reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) or non-myeloablative (NMA) AlloSCT may be considered in selected cases. Salvage therapies for relapsed/refractory disease, especially using new drugs not employed at diagnosis, are sometimes effective in the short term, but a rapid relapse is still generally the rule; AlloSCT in relapsed and eligible patients with sensitive disease after salvage treatments is, therefore, recommended.",,"['Musto, Pellegrino', 'Simeon, Vittorio', 'Todoerti, Katia', 'Neri, Antonino']","['Musto P', 'Simeon V', 'Todoerti K', 'Neri A']","['Scientific Direction, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, PZ, Italy. p.musto@tin.it.', 'Laboratory of Pre-clinical and Translational Research, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, PZ, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Pre-clinical and Translational Research, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, PZ, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milano, Hematology, Fondazione IRCCS Ca Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,,IM,"['Combined Modality Therapy', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*diagnosis/etiology/*therapy']",2016/03/21 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/03/21 06:00'],"['2016/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11864-016-0392-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s11864-016-0392-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2016 Apr;17(4):19. doi: 10.1007/s11864-016-0392-6.,10.1007/s11864-016-0392-6 [doi],,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic transplantation', 'Autologous transplantation', 'Bortezomib', 'IMIDs', 'Lenalidomide', 'Multiple myeloma', 'Plasma cell leukemia', 'Proteasome inhibitors', 'Thalidomide']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate whether HAA is an ideal induction regimen for t(8;21)AML, we retrospectively analyzed the data of 140 patients from the last 8 years in our center. When achieving complete remission (CR), the post-remission treatment was administered as a minimal residual disease-directed risk-stratification treatment protocol. The RUNX1/RUNX1T1 transcript level was assessed by RT-qPCR. The last follow-up was conducted in October 2015. In total, thirty patients received an HAA regimen as the induction treatment. The CR rate after one cycle of the HAA regimen was 93.3% (28/30). One patient achieved partial remission, and one had no response. No patients died during induction treatment. The median fold decrease of the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 transcript level was 200 (1-358000), and 16.7% (5/30) patients achieved >3 log decrease after one cycle of the HAA regimen. The estimated 4-year disease-free survival and overall survival were 89.9% and 90.8%, respectively.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Through a search of EMBASE, PUBMED, Web of Science, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, we identified cohort studies that evaluated the association between off-hour admission and mortality risk for disease. In a random effects meta-analysis of 140 identified articles (251 cohorts), off-hour admission was strongly associated with increased mortality for aortic aneurysm (odds ratio, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.30-1.77), breast cancer (1.50, 1.21-1.86), leukemia (1.45, 1.17-1.79), respiratory neoplasm (1.32, 1.20-1.26), pancreatic cancer (1.32, 1.12-1.56), malignant neoplasm of genitourinary organs (1.27, 1.08-1.49), colorectal cancer (1.26, 1.07-1.49), pulmonary embolism (1.20, 1.13-1.28), arrhythmia and cardiac arrest (1.19, 1.09-1.29), and lymphoma (1.19, 1.06-1.34). Weaker (odds ratio <1.19) but statistically significant association was noted for renal failure, traumatic brain injury, heart failure, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding, myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and bloodstream infections. No association was found for hip fracture, pneumonia, intestinal obstruction, aspiration pneumonia, peptic ulcer, trauma, diverticulitis, and neonatal mortality. Overall, off-hour admission was associated with increased mortality for 28 diseases combined (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.10-1.13). CONCLUSIONS: Off-hour admission is associated with increased mortality risk, and the associations varied substantially for different diseases. Specialists, nurses, as well as hospital administrators and health policymakers can take these findings into consideration to improve the quality and continuity of medical services.","['(c) 2016 The Authors.

The current dose-reporting is based on effective dose, which ignores body size and does not reflect the strong dependence of risk on the age at exposure. Risk estimations should better be done through individual organ dose assessments, which need careful exposure characterisation as well as anatomical description of the individual patient. In nuclear medicine, reference biokinetic models should also be replaced with models describing individual physiological states and biokinetics. There is a need to adjust population-based cancer risk estimates to the possible risk of leukaemia and solid tumours for the individual depending on age and gender.

METHODS : Parents of children (aged: 3-12 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 20) and medical providers (n = 6) participated in semi-structured interviews about child sleep during cancer treatment. They also rated SDPC model component importance on a 0-4 scale and selected the most relevant sleep-related intervention targets. RESULTS : Qualitatively, parents and providers endorsed that changes in the child's psychosocial, environmental, and biological processes affect sleep. Stakeholders rated most model components (parent: 32 of 40; provider: 39 of 41) as important (>2) to child sleep. Parents were most interested in interventions targeting difficulty falling asleep and providers selected irregular sleep habits/scheduling, though groups did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS : Stakeholders supported SDPC content validity. The model will inform subsequent measure and intervention development focusing on biological and behavioral factors most salient to sleep disturbances in pediatric cancer.","['(c) The Author 2016.

Results confirmed the early findings with no significant differences in all measured endpoints (overall survival at 25 years: 42.7 %, 32.0-52.4 % vs 52.9 %, 43.2-62.6 %; p = 0.355, log rank test). Additional splenic irradiation failed to reduce relapse incidence. It did not increase non-relapse mortality nor the risk of late secondary malignancies.

The anticancer effects of MLN4924 have been attributed to impaired neddylation of Cullin proteins. Here, we show that treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells with MLN4924 potently suppressed the neddylation of Cullins and the oncogenic growth of T-ALL cells in-vitro. Moreover, MLN4924 induced disease regression in an in vivo xenograft model. MLN4924 also induced cell cycle arrest at G2 phase and apoptosis in T-ALL cells. However, inhibition of the neddylation of Cullins alone could not explain the effects of MLN4924 in T-ALL cells. Gene expression profiling indicated ribosome function, steroid biosynthesis, and hematopoietic cell lineage pathways were affected by MLN4924 treatment. MLN4924 also induced nucleolar disruption, suggesting nucleolar stress signaling might contribute to the anticancer effects of MLN4924 in T-ALL cells. In addition, MLN4924 treatment reduced 14-3-3xi\delta protein levels in T-ALL cells.

These AEs can impair quality of life and lead to reduced treatment adherence, which is associated with poor clinical outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the phase II ENRICH (Exploring Nilotinib to Reduce Imatinib Related Chronic Adverse Events) study (N = 52), the effect of switching patients with imatinib-related chronic low-grade nonhematologic AEs from imatinib to nilotinib was evaluated. RESULTS: Three months after switching to nilotinib, 84.6% of the patients had overall improvement in imatinib-related AEs (primary endpoint). Of 210 imatinib-related AEs identified at baseline, 62.9% had resolved within 3 months of switching to nilotinib. Of evaluable patients, most had improvements in overall quality of life after switching to nilotinib. At screening, 65.4% of evaluable patients had a major molecular response (BCR-ABL1 </= 0.1% on the International Scale). After switching to nilotinib, the rate of the major molecular response was 76.1% at 3 months and 87.8% at 12 months. Treatment-emergent AEs reported with nilotinib were typically grade 1 or 2; however, some patients developed more serious AEs, and 8 patients discontinued nilotinib because of new or worsening AEs. CONCLUSION: Overall, results from the ENRICH study demonstrated that switching to nilotinib can mitigate imatinib-related chronic low-grade nonhematologic AEs in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase, in conjunction with acceptable safety and achievement of molecular responses.

A common diagnostic approach involves focusing on a three gene panel (CEPBA, FLT3, and NPM1). However, a complete representation of prognostic and predictive factors in AML necessitates an expanded series of genes, due to the dynamic interactions present between concurrent mutations. Hence, the current study aims to describe the benefits of an expanded risk profile in an unselected cohort of AML cases. METHODS: The genomes of 11 randomly selected patients with AML were sequenced using next generation sequencing. A narrow three gene panel and broader 50 gene panel were contrasted. RESULTS: The expanded gene panel detected one additional pathogenic mutation in five patients and two pathogenic mutations in two patients, resulting in a change in their risk profile. Only 5/11 (45%) of AML patients demonstrated a pathogenic mutation on the 3 gene profile, however all patients had at least one detectable pathogenic mutation on the broader gene panel. The detection of a concurrent mutation by the expanded gene panel reversed the favorable risk profile for three patients. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of concurrent mutations enables rejection or validation of prognoses associated with NPM1 or CEBPA mutations. DNMT3a and TP53 mutations in AML have a pertinent prognostic and therapeutic value for patients and their addition enhances the current three gene panel. In our small study, the three gene panel changed the prognosis for three patients (3/11, 27%) with the detection of commonly occurring AML mutations.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

However glutaminase activity is the cause of various side effects when used as a drug against acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Therefore, there is a need of a novel L-asparaginase (L-ASNase) with low or no glutaminase activity. Such a property has been observed with L-ASNase from B. licheniformis (BliA). The enzyme being glutaminase free in nature paved the way for its improvement to achieve properties similar to or near to the commercially available L-ASNases. Rational enzyme engineering approach resulted in four mutants: G238N, E232A, D103V and Q112H. Among these the mutant enzyme, D103V, had a specific activity of 597.7IU/mg, which is higher than native (rBliA) (407.65IU/mg). Moreover, when the optimum temperature and in vitro half life were studied and compared with native BliA, D103V mutant BliA was better, showing tolerance to higher temperatures and a 3 fold higher half life. Kinetic studies revealed that the mutant D103V L-ASNase has increased substrate affinity, with Km value of 0.42mM and Vmax of 2778.9mumolmin(-1).",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In 2011, the Rwanda Ministry of Health (RMOH) established Butaro Cancer Center of Excellence (BCCOE) to expand cancer services nationally. In hopes of informing cancer care delivery in similar settings, we describe program-level experience implementing BCCOE, patient characteristics, and challenges encountered. METHODS: Butaro Cancer Center of Excellence was founded on diverse partnerships that emphasize capacity building. Services available include pathology-based diagnosis, basic imaging, chemotherapy, surgery, referral for radiotherapy, palliative care and socioeconomic access supports. Retrospective review of electronic medical records (EMR) of patients enrolled between July 1, 2012 and June 30, 2014 was conducted, supplemented by manual review of paper charts and programmatic records. RESULTS: In the program's first 2 years, 2326 patients presented for cancer-related care. Of these, 70.5% were female, 4.3% children, and 74.3% on public health insurance. In the first year, 66.3% (n = 1144) were diagnosed with cancer. Leading adult diagnoses were breast, cervical, and skin cancer. Among children, nephroblastoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and Hodgkin lymphoma were predominant. As of June 30, 2013, 95 cancer patients had died. Challenges encountered include documentation gaps and staff shortages. CONCLUSION: Butaro Cancer Center of Excellence demonstrates that complex cancer care can be delivered in the most resource-constrained settings, accessible to vulnerable patients. Key attributes that have made BCCOE possible are: meaningful North-south partnerships, innovative task- and infrastructure-shifting, RMOH leadership, and an equity-driven agenda. Going forward, we will apply our experiences and lessons learned to further strengthen BCCOE, and employ the developed EMR system as a valuable platform to assess long-term clinical outcomes and improve care.",,"['Tapela, Neo M', 'Mpunga, Tharcisse', 'Hedt-Gauthier, Bethany', 'Moore, Molly', 'Mpanumusingo, Egide', 'Xu, Mary Jue', 'Nzayisenga, Ignace', 'Hategekimana, Vedaste', 'Umuhizi, Denis Gilbert', 'Pace, Lydia E', 'Bigirimana, Jean Bosco', 'Wang, JingJing', 'Driscoll, Caitlin', 'Uwizeye, Frank R', 'Drobac, Peter C', 'Ngoga, Gedeon', 'Shyirambere, Cyprien', 'Muhayimana, Clemence', 'Lehmann, Leslie', 'Shulman, Lawrence N']","['Tapela NM', 'Mpunga T', 'Hedt-Gauthier B', 'Moore M', 'Mpanumusingo E', 'Xu MJ', 'Nzayisenga I', 'Hategekimana V', 'Umuhizi DG', 'Pace LE', 'Bigirimana JB', 'Wang J', 'Driscoll C', 'Uwizeye FR', 'Drobac PC', 'Ngoga G', 'Shyirambere C', 'Muhayimana C', 'Lehmann L', 'Shulman LN']","['Botswana Ministry of Health, Gaborone, Botswana. ntapela@gmail.com.', ""Dana-Farber/Brigham & Women's Cancer Center, Boston, USA. ntapela@gmail.com."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA. ntapela@gmail.com.', ""Division of Global Health Equity, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, USA. ntapela@gmail.com."", 'Rwanda Ministry of Health, Kigali, Rwanda.', 'Partners In Health/Inshuti Mu Buzima, Kigali, Rwanda.', ""Dana-Farber/Brigham & Women's Cancer Center, Boston, USA."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA.', 'University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, USA.', 'Rwanda Ministry of Health, Kigali, Rwanda.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA.', 'Partners In Health/Inshuti Mu Buzima, Kigali, Rwanda.', 'Rwanda Ministry of Health, Kigali, Rwanda.', 'Rwanda Ministry of Health, Kigali, Rwanda.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA.', 'Partners In Health/Inshuti Mu Buzima, Kigali, Rwanda.', 'Partners In Health/Inshuti Mu Buzima, Kigali, Rwanda.', 'Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA.', 'Partners In Health/Inshuti Mu Buzima, Kigali, Rwanda.', 'Partners In Health/Inshuti Mu Buzima, Kigali, Rwanda.', ""Dana-Farber/Brigham & Women's Cancer Center, Boston, USA."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA.', 'Partners In Health/Inshuti Mu Buzima, Kigali, Rwanda.', 'Partners In Health/Inshuti Mu Buzima, Kigali, Rwanda.', 'Rwanda Ministry of Health, Kigali, Rwanda.', 'Partners In Health/Inshuti Mu Buzima, Kigali, Rwanda.', ""Dana-Farber/Brigham & Women's Cancer Center, Boston, USA."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA.', ""Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, USA."", 'Partners In Health/Inshuti Mu Buzima, Kigali, Rwanda.', ""Dana-Farber/Brigham & Women's Cancer Center, Boston, USA."", 'Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160318,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Delivery of Health Care', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/pathology/therapy', '*Patient Acceptance of Health Care', 'Rural Population', 'Rwanda', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",2016/03/20 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/03/20 06:00'],"['2015/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-016-2256-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-016-2256-7 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2016 Mar 18;16:237. doi: 10.1186/s12885-016-2256-7.,10.1186/s12885-016-2256-7 [doi],,,PMC4797361,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Capacity building', 'Implementation', 'Resource-limited setting', 'Rwanda', 'Task-shifting', 'Twinning']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Acanthopanax senticosus, a naturally occurring herb used in traditional Chinese medicine, has been found to be a multipotent bioflavonoid with great potential in the prevention and treatment of malignant diseases. However, the mechanism underlying the action of A. senticosus in epigenetic regulation is poorly understood. In the study described here, we focused on the efficacy of A. senticosus in inducing apoptosis of leukemia cells and a possible mechanism. By evaluating the inhibition ratio and morphologic changes, we found that A. senticosus can inhibit growth and induce apoptosis of human leukemia HL-60 and HL60/ADM cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, A. senticosus induced Fas ligand (FasL) expression and blocked the cell cycle in S phase. In addition, A. senticosus exhibited a potential for inhibition of histone deacetylase (HADC), which contributes to histone acetylation. It possibly resulted in the promotion of the expression of FasL. It is suggested that A. senticosus could be recognized as a new HDAC inhibitor which was able to reactivate aberrantly silenced genes.

Although the response rate to induction therapy is high, survival rate 5-year after diagnosis is still low, highlighting the necessity of new novel agents. To identify agents with the capability to abolish the self-renewal capacity of AML blasts, an in silico screening was performed to search for small molecules that induce terminal differentiation. Emetine, a hit compound, was validated for its anti-leukemic effect in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Emetine, a second-line anti-protozoa drug, differentially reduced cell viability and clonogenic capacity of AML primary patient samples, sparing healthy blood cells. Emetine treatment markedly reduced AML burden in bone marrow of xenotransplanted mice and decreased self-renewal capacity of the remaining engrafted AML cells. Emetine also synergized with commonly used chemotherapeutic agents such as ara-C. At a molecular level, emetine treatment was followed by a reduction in HIF-1alpha protein levels. This study validated the anti-leukemiceffect of emetine in AML cell lines, a group of diverse AML primary samples, and in a human AML-transplanted murine model, sparing healthy blood cells.

However, there are very limited available data on population-based, subtype-specific incidence rates of LMs in the East Asian population, particularly in Chinese. Using data from the Hong Kong (HK) Cancer Registry and United States (U.S.) SEER Program, we calculated and compared age-adjusted incidence rates of LM subtypes in HK to those in Whites and Asians living in the U.S. Overall and sex-specific rates were calculated for the period 2001-2010. The incidence of most subtypes was low in the HK population, with rates <1 case per 100,000 for all subtypes except for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (3.26/100,000) and plasma cell neoplasms (1.99/100,000). Age-adjusted incidence rates of all evaluated B-cell subtypes were significantly higher in U.S. Whites compared to HK, with standardized rate ratios (SRRs) ranging from 1.6 (Burkitt lymphoma) to 9.1 (chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma). Rates in U.S. Asians were generally intermediate to those in U.S. Whites and HK. Conversely, rates of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma were significantly lower in both U.S. Whites (SRR=0.2) and U.S. Asians (SRR=0.5) compared to HK.

We conducted a hazard assessment using available scientific evidence published before March 2015, with inclusion of new research findings from the Advanced Research on Interaction Mechanisms of electroMagnetic exposures with Organisms for Risk Assessment (ARIMMORA) project. The IARC Monograph evaluation scheme was applied to hazard identification. In ARIMMORA for the first time, a transgenic mouse model was used to mimic the most common childhood leukemia: new pathogenic mechanisms were indicated, but more data are needed to draw definitive conclusions. Although experiments in different animal strains showed exposure-related decreases of CD8+ T-cells, a role in carcinogenesis must be further established. No direct damage of DNA by exposure was observed. Overall in the literature, there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals, with only weak supporting evidence from mechanistic studies. New exposure data from ARIMMORA confirmed that if the association is nevertheless causal, up to 2% of childhood leukemias in Europe, as previously estimated, may be attributable to ELF-MF. In summary, ARIMMORA concludes that the relationship between ELF-MF and childhood leukemia remains consistent with possible carcinogenicity in humans.

So we provide relevant information regarding the clinical impact of this methodology in monitoring the response to treatment. METHODS: HGs in 279 consecutive ALL patients at a time frame of postconsolidation treatment were recorded by flow cytometric minimal residual disease techniques according to the European BIOMED-1 standard. Patients divided by risk stratification, clinical phases and cytogenesis test were judged. RESULTS: Total HGs correlated inversely with age but not with >2 years, significant difference existed between </=2 years and >2 years. HGs in low-risk patients were much higher than that in intermediate- and high-risk patients (P < 0.01), significant difference (P < 0.05) was also found for HGs quantitation between patients experiencing hematological complete remission and relapse. Total HGs and Pro-B+immature B HGs in patients with TEL-AML1 were much higher than those with BCR-ABL and MLL-AF4 (P < 0.01). HGs > 1% of TNCs had significantly prolonged event-free survival (EFS) (P < 0.01); Multivariate analysis indicated HGs was independently associated with the longer EFS. CONCLUSION: The strong independently prognostic impact indicated that the better HGs regeneration is a marker of better response to therapy.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Wang, Y', 'Peng, L', 'Dai, Q', 'Ye, L', 'Chen, L', 'Chen, Q', 'Lai, C', 'Jiang, Y', 'Zhang, G']","['Wang Y', 'Peng L', 'Dai Q', 'Ye L', 'Chen L', 'Chen Q', 'Lai C', 'Jiang Y', 'Zhang G']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20160316,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/blood/diagnosis/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/*diagnosis/therapy', '*Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors']",2016/03/19 06:00,2017/03/03 06:00,['2016/03/19 06:00'],"['2015/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12476 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2016 Jun;38(3):246-55. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12476.

However, the mechanisms of action and potential off-target effects are not fully understood. Gene expression profiling in TP53 mutant KMB3 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells showed that genes which protected cells from oxidative stress to be the most up-regulated. APR-246 exposure also induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and depleted glutathione in AML cells. The genes most up-regulated by APR-246, confirmed by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, were heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1, also termed HO-1), SLC7A11 and RIT1. Up-regulation of HMOX1, a key regulator of cellular response to ROS, was independent of TP53 mutational status. NFE2L2 (also termed Nrf2), a master regulator of HMOX1 expression, showed transcriptional up-regulation and nuclear translocation by APR-246. Down-regulation of NFE2L2 by siRNA in AML cells significantly increased the antitumoural effects of APR-246. The PI3K inhibitor wortmannin and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin inhibited APR-246-induced nuclear translocation of NFE2L2 and counteracted the protective cellular responses to APR-246, resulting in synergistic cell killing together with APR-246. In conclusion, ROS induction is important for antileukaemic activities of APR-246 and inhibiting the protective response of the Nrf-2/HMOX1 axis using PI3K inhibitors, enhances the antileukaemic effects.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Ali, Dina', 'Mohammad, Dara K', 'Mujahed, Huthayfa', 'Jonson-Videsater, Kerstin', 'Nore, Beston', 'Paul, Christer', 'Lehmann, Soren']","['Ali D', 'Mohammad DK', 'Mujahed H', 'Jonson-Videsater K', 'Nore B', 'Paul C', 'Lehmann S']","['Haematology Centre and Centre for Haematology and Regenerative Medicine (HERM), Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Research Centre, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Haematology Centre and Centre for Haematology and Regenerative Medicine (HERM), Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Research Centre, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Haematology Centre and Centre for Haematology and Regenerative Medicine (HERM), Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Haematology Centre and Centre for Haematology and Regenerative Medicine (HERM), Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160315,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinuclidines)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'Z41TGB4080 (eprenetapopt)']",IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects/genetics', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Quinuclidines/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2016/03/19 06:00,2017/05/06 06:00,['2016/03/19 06:00'],"['2015/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/20 00:00 [revised]', '2015/12/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.14036 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2016 Jul;174(1):117-26. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14036.

However, few reports have studied its role during hematopoiesis at the molecular level in an animal model. In this study, by microarray, qRT-PCR, whole-mount in situ hybridization and O-dianisidine staining detections, we revealed the increased expression of hemoglobin in copper-exposed embryos. Secondly, we found that copper-exposed embryos exhibited high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and genes in oxygen binding and oxygen transporting were up-regulated in the embryos. Finally, we found that ROS scavengers NAC, GSH, and DMTU not only inhibited in vivo ROS levels induced by copper, but also significantly decreased high expression of hemoglobin back to almost normal levels in copper exposed embryos, and also helped with copper elimination from the embryos. Our data first demonstrated that ROS mediated copper induced hemoglobin expression in vertebrates, partly revealing the underlying molecular mechanism of copper therapy for anemia. Moreover, we revealed that copper homeostasis was broken by its induced ROS and ROS helped with copper overloading in the body, which could be applied as a novel therapy target for copper-caused diseases.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated the predictive value of these factors on overall survival (OS) in 445 consecutive patients with MDS and chronic monomyelocytic leukaemia (CMML) enrolled in a multi-centre prospective national registry. Frailty, comorbidity, instrumental activities of daily living, disability, quality of life, fatigue and physical performance measures were evaluated at baseline and were added as covariates to conventional MDS-related factors as predictors of OS in Cox proportional hazards models. The median age was 73 years, and 79% had revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) risk scores of intermediate or lower. Frailty correlated only modestly with comorbidity. OS was significantly shorter for patients with higher frailty and comorbidity scores, any disability, impaired grip strength and timed chair stand tests. By multivariate analysis, the age-adjusted IPSS-R, frailty (Hazard ratio 2.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-4.2), P < 0.0001) and Charlson comorbidity score (Hazard ratio 1.8 (95% CI 1.1-2.8), P = 0.01) were independently prognostic of OS. Incorporation of frailty and comorbidity scores improved risk stratification of the IPSS-R by 30% and 5%, respectively.

However, DAC monotherapy is associated with relatively low rates of overall response and complete remission. Previous studies have shown promising results for combination treatment regimens including DAC. Homoharringtonine (HHT), an alkaloid from Chinese natural plants and Cephalotaxus, has demonstrated potential for leukemia treatment. Our studies have suggested that the combination of DAC and HHT has synergistic effects for inhibiting the viability of SKM-1 and Kg-1a cells. This combination leads to enhanced inhibition of colony formation and apoptosis induction compared with DAC alone in SKM-1 but not Kg-1a cells. Only high-dose DAC and HHT significantly up-regulate caspase-3 and caspase-9 and inhibit BCL-XL in the SKM-1 cell line. The combined effects of DAC plus HHT on apoptosis may not only depend on regulation of the apoptosis-related genes we examined but others as well. HHT had no demethylation effects, and HHT in combination with DAC had no enhanced effects on hypomethylation and DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B mRNA expression in SKM-1 cells. Overall, these results suggest that DAC used in combination with HHT may have clinical potential for MDS treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent technical advances in next-generation sequencing have shed light on genetic abnormalities in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells as the precursor to ALL pathogenesis. Based on these genetic abnormalities, ALL is now being reclassified into newly identified subtypes. Philadelphia chromosome-like B-lineage ALL is one of the new high-risk subtypes characterized by genetic alterations that activate various signaling pathways, including those involving cytokine receptors, tyrosine kinases, and epigenetic modifiers. Philadelphia chromosome-like ALL is essentially heterogeneous; however, deletion mutations in the IKZF1 gene encoding the transcription factor IKAROS underlie many cases as a key factor inducing aggressive phenotypes and poor treatment responses. Whole-genome sequencing studies of ALL patients and ethnically matched controls also identified inherited genetic variations in lymphoid neoplasm-related genes, which are likely to increase ALL susceptibility. These findings are directly relevant to clinical hematology, and further studies on this aspect could contribute to accurate diagnosis, effective monitoring of residual disease, and patient-oriented therapies.","['(c) 2016 The Authors.

Here, we report that SON, previously known as an RNA splicing factor, controls MLL complex-mediated transcriptional initiation. SON binds to DNA near transcription start sites, interacts with menin, and inhibits MLL complex assembly, resulting in decreased H3K4me3 and transcriptional repression. Importantly, alternatively spliced short isoforms of SON are markedly upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia. The short isoforms compete with full-length SON for chromatin occupancy but lack the menin-binding ability, thereby antagonizing full-length SON function in transcriptional repression while not impairing full-length SON-mediated RNA splicing. Furthermore, overexpression of a short isoform of SON enhances replating potential of hematopoietic progenitors.

However, the usual estimators for Markov models (e.g., Aalen-Johansen transition probabilities) may be systematically biased in non-Markovian situations. On the other hand, despite non-Markovian estimators for transition probabilities and related curves are available, including the Markov information in the construction of the estimators allows for variance reduction. Therefore, testing for the Markov condition is a relevant issue in practice. In this paper, we discuss several characterizations of the Markov condition, with special focus on its equivalence with the quasi-independence between left truncation and survival times in standard survival analysis. New methods for testing the Markovianity of an illness-death model are proposed and compared with existing ones by means of an intensive simulation study.

These patients have an increased risk of developing a second primary cancer (SPC); also, melanoma is frequently diagnosed among patients firstly diagnosed with an extracutaneous malignancy. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the risk of developing a SPC among 1537 melanoma patients, and the risk of second primary melanoma (SPM) in 52 354 extracutaneous cancer patients, who were treated at the European Institute of Oncology in Milan, Italy, during 2000-2010. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIR) by applying gender-, age-, year- and region-specific reference rates to the follow-up time accrued between the diagnosis of the first and the second primary malignancies. RESULTS: Seventy-six SPC were diagnosed during a median follow-up of 4 years, of which 49 (64%) during the first 2 years upon melanoma diagnosis. The SIR was increased for cancer of breast (4.10, 95% CI 2.79-6.03), thyroid (4.67, 95% CI 1.94-11.22), brain (6.13, 95% CI 2.30-16.33) and for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3.12, 95% CI 1.30-7.50). During a median follow-up of 4 years, 127 SPM were diagnosed: thick lesions were less frequent than for melanoma diagnosed as first cancer. The SIR was increased for cancer of breast (5.13, 95%CI 3.91-6.73), thyroid (16.2, 95%CI: 5.22-50.2), head and neck (5.62, 95%CI 1.41-22.50), soft tissue (8.68, 95%CI 2.17-34.70), cervix (12.5, 95% CI 3.14-50.20), kidney (3.19, 95%CI 1.52-6.68), prostate (4.36, 95%CI 2.63-7.24) and acute myeloid leukaemia (6.44, 95%CI 2.42-17.20). CONCLUSIONS: The most likely causes of these associations are the clustering of lifestyle risk factors in the same subgroups of population, mainly on a sociocultural basis and surveillance bias. This raises important questions about how to best follow cancer survivors by avoiding an inefficient use of resources and an excessive medicalization of these patients' lives.",['(c) 2016 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.'],"['Caini, S', 'Radice, D', 'Tosti, G', 'Spadola, G', 'Cocorocchio, E', 'Ferrucci, P F', 'Testori, A', 'Pennacchioli, E', 'Fargnoli, M C', 'Palli, D', 'Bazolli, B', 'Botteri, E', 'Gandini, S']","['Caini S', 'Radice D', 'Tosti G', 'Spadola G', 'Cocorocchio E', 'Ferrucci PF', 'Testori A', 'Pennacchioli E', 'Fargnoli MC', 'Palli D', 'Bazolli B', 'Botteri E', 'Gandini S']","['Unit of Cancer Risk Factors and Lifestyle Epidemiology, Institute for Cancer Research and Prevention, Florence, Italy.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Dermatoncological Surgery, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Dermatoncological Surgery, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Medical Oncology of Melanoma Unit, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Medical Oncology of Melanoma Unit, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Dermatoncological Surgery, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Melanoma and Muscle-Cutaneous Sarcomas, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', ""Department of Dermatology, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy."", 'Unit of Cancer Risk Factors and Lifestyle Epidemiology, Institute for Cancer Research and Prevention, Florence, Italy.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160318,England,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,9216037,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2016/03/19 06:00,2017/05/02 06:00,['2016/03/19 06:00'],"['2015/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/07 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jdv.13645 [doi]'],ppublish,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol. 2016 Sep;30(9):1491-6. doi: 10.1111/jdv.13645.

We investigated the potential efficacy of triptolide on murine leukemia by measuring the triptolide-induced cytotoxicity in murine leukemia WEHI-3 cells in vitro. Results indicated that triptolide induced cell morphological changes and induced cytotoxic effects through G0/G1 phase arrest, induction of apoptosis. Flow cytometric assays showed that triptolide increased the production of reactive oxygen species, Ca(2+) release and mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim ), and activations of caspase-8, -9, and -3. Triptolide increased protein levels of Fas, Fas-L, Bax, cytochrome c, caspase-9, Endo G, Apaf-1, PARP, caspase-3 but reduced levels of AIF, ATF6alpha, ATF6beta, and GRP78 in WEHI-3 cells. Triptolide stimulated autophagy based on an increase in acidic vacuoles, monodansylcadaverine staining for LC-3 expression and increased protein levels of ATG 5, ATG 7, and ATG 12. The in vitro data suggest that the cytotoxic effects of triptolide may involve cross-talk between cross-interaction of apoptosis and autophagy. Normal BALB/c mice were i.p. injected with WEHI-3 cells to generate leukemia and were oral treatment with triptolide at 0, 0.02, and 0.2 mg/kg for 3 weeks then animals were weighted and blood, liver, spleen samples were collected. Results indicated that triptolide did not significantly affect the weights of animal body, spleen and liver of leukemia mice, however, triptolide significant increased the cell populations of T cells (CD3), B cells (CD19), monocytes (CD11b), and macrophage (Mac-3). Furthermore, triptolide increased the phagocytosis of macrophage from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) but not effects from peritoneum. Triptolide promoted T and B cell proliferation at 0.02 and 0.2 mg/kg treatment when cells were pretreated with Con A and LPS stimulation, respectively; however, triptolide did not significant affect NK cell activities in vivo.

Deregulation of this regulatory network contributes to impaired lineage fidelity and leukemogenesis. We found that the hematopoietic master regulator RUNX1 controls the expression of certain microRNAs, of importance during erythroid/megakaryocytic differentiation. In particular, we show that the erythorid miR144/451 cluster is epigenetically repressed by RUNX1 during megakaryopoiesis. Furthermore, the leukemogenic RUNX1/ETO fusion protein transcriptionally represses the miR144/451 pre-microRNA. Thus RUNX1/ETO contributes to increased expression of miR451 target genes and interferes with normal gene expression during differentiation. Furthermore, we observed that inhibition of RUNX1/ETO in Kasumi1 cells and in RUNX1/ETO positive primary acute myeloid leukemia patient samples leads to up-regulation of miR144/451. RUNX1 thus emerges as a key regulator of a microRNA network, driving differentiation at the megakaryocytic/erythroid branching point.

Recent advances in molecular/genetic sequencing have suggested a common clonal origin between various hematolymphoid disorders and cases of secondary HS. Deriving conclusions from previously reported cases of HS arising secondarily to certain hematolymphoid disorders, here we have tried to provide insight into the mechanisms influencing this evolution. We also discuss a clinical case of a 72-year-old man with a diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), presenting subsequently with a heterogeneous liver mass positive with a diagnosis of HS. The liver mass showed a retained BCR-ABL1 translocation suggesting clonality between the CML and HS. As seen in our case and other reported cases of HS derived secondarily, the concurrent expression of immunoglobulin heavy (IGH)-/light-chain rearrangements or cytogenetic markers common to the primary malignancy suggests an evolutionary mechanism involving lineage switching that could potentially be influenced by genetic or epigenetic cues which may occur at the level of a progenitor or the malignant cell itself.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, these new drugs are expensive and impose considerable expense to patients and governments. Epidemiologic and economic evaluation studies provide good information for resource allocation and decision making. We estimated the incidence, prevalence and direct medical cost of CML in Iran. METHODS: We used the National Cancer Registry (NCR) data from 2006 to 2009 to estimate the incidence rate of CML (ICD-10 code C92.1). After adjustment for the underestimation of incidence rates, we used survival rates of CML and estimated the 5-year prevalence for these patients. In addition, we used clinical practice guideline, expert opinions and medical tariffs to estimate the direct medical costs through the prevalence approach. RESULTS: After an adjustment for the underestimation, the incidence rate of CML was 0.5 per 100 000 in the I.R. of Iran. The 5-year prevalence was about 2263 cases (2.98 per 100 000). The total direct medical cost of CML was $23 089 323 and the majority of the cost (97%) was related to drug costs. The total cost will increase considerably to $40 728 869 if all patients use the new drug nilotinib (800 mg/day) as a second-line treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The increased survival of CML patients and a possible increase in incidence of CML in Iran will most likely lead to a considerable rise in its prevalence and economic burden.","['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.']","['Daroudi, Rajabali', 'Mirzania, Mehrzad', 'Nikravanfard, Nazila', 'Sadighi, Sanambar', 'Sedighi, Zahra', 'Zendehdel, Kazem']","['Daroudi R', 'Mirzania M', 'Nikravanfard N', 'Sadighi S', 'Sedighi Z', 'Zendehdel K']","['Cancer Research Center, Cancer Institute of Iran, Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, I.R of Iran.', 'Department of Health Economics and Management, School of Public Health, TUMS, Tehran, I.R of Iran.', 'Hematology and Medical Oncology Group, Cancer Research Center, Cancer Institute, Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex, TUMS, Tehran, I.R of Iran.', 'Cancer Research Center, Cancer Institute of Iran, Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, I.R of Iran.', 'National Research Ethics Committee, Deputy of Research and Technology, Ministry of Health and Medical Education, Tehran, I.R of Iran.', 'Cancer Research Center, Cancer Institute of Iran, Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, I.R of Iran.', 'Cancer Research Center, Cancer Institute of Iran, Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, I.R of Iran.', 'Cancer Research Center, Cancer Institute of Iran, Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, I.R of Iran.', 'Cancer Models Research Center, Cancer Institute of Iran, TUMS, Tehran, I.R of Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160317,Australia,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,101241430,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*economics/epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/economics/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/administration & dosage/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate']",2016/03/19 06:00,2017/12/28 06:00,['2016/03/19 06:00'],"['2015/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/01 00:00 [revised]', '2016/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/28 06:00 [medline]', '2016/03/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ajco.12470 [doi]'],ppublish,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2017 Oct;13(5):e416-e422. doi: 10.1111/ajco.12470.

However, it could not yet been conclusively shown that allergic reaction of the recipient is elicited by the donor's cells. OBJECTIVES: In the case of a 46-year-old male patient who - for the first time in his life - had two episodes of oral allergic syndrome upon kiwi consumption after having received myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) from his kiwi-allergic sister, we aimed to clarify the origin of allergen reactive cells in the donor. We not only intended to demonstrate if allergy was transferred by HCT but also to present an experimental workup for the analysis of allergy transfer by HCT. METHODS: Allergic sensitization to kiwi in recipient and donor was proven by ImmunoCAP. Furthermore, origin of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was analyzed by chromosomal fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). To confirm allergic reaction and activation of hematopoietic cells by customized kiwi extract, we performed basophil activation test from whole blood as well as T cell proliferation assays from purified PBMCs of both recipient and donor. RESULTS: Basophil activation upon kiwi extract was demonstrated in both recipient and donor. Besides, we showed proliferation of CD4(+) T cells after incubation with kiwi extract. FISH analysis proved that hematopoietic cells of the male recipient completely originated from the female donor. CONCLUSION: Exemplified in this patient, we show for the first time that allergy transfer is mediated by the donor's cells. Moreover, our experimental approach using customized kiwi extract to prove contribution of kiwi-specific T and B cells in both kiwi-allergic recipient and donor could serve as a model approach for future studies.",['(c) 2016 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.'],"['Garzorz, N', 'Thomas, J', 'Eberlein, B', 'Haferlach, C', 'Ring, J', 'Biedermann, T', 'Schmidt-Weber, C', 'Eyerich, K', 'Seifert, F', 'Eyerich, S']","['Garzorz N', 'Thomas J', 'Eberlein B', 'Haferlach C', 'Ring J', 'Biedermann T', 'Schmidt-Weber C', 'Eyerich K', 'Seifert F', 'Eyerich S']","['Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'ZAUM - Center of Allergy and Environment, Member of the German Center for Lung Research (DZL), Technical University of Munich and Helmholtz Center Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'ZAUM - Center of Allergy and Environment, Member of the German Center for Lung Research (DZL), Technical University of Munich and Helmholtz Center Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'ZAUM - Center of Allergy and Environment, Member of the German Center for Lung Research (DZL), Technical University of Munich and Helmholtz Center Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20160316,England,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,9216037,,IM,"['Actinidia/*adverse effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', '*Food Hypersensitivity', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tissue Donors']",2016/03/19 06:00,2017/04/27 06:00,['2016/03/19 06:00'],"['2015/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jdv.13617 [doi]'],ppublish,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol. 2016 Jul;30(7):1136-9. doi: 10.1111/jdv.13617.

Utilizing a mouse model, null for Cyp1b1 and expressing human CYP1B1, we tested the hypothesis that hCYP1B1 is important for dibenzo[def,p]chrysene (DBC) transplacental carcinogenesis. Wild-type mCyp1b1, transgenic hCYP1B1 (mCyp1b1 null background), and mCyp1b1 null mice were assessed. Each litter had an equal number of siblings with Ahr(b-1/d) and Ahr(d/d) alleles. Pregnant mice were dosed (gavage) on gestation day 17 with 6.5 or 12 mg/kg of DBC or corn oil. At 10 months of age, mortality, general health, lymphoid disease and lung tumor incidence, and multiplicity were assessed. hCYP1B1 genotype did not impact lung tumor multiplicity, but tended to enhance incidence compared to Cyp1b1 wild-type mice (P = 0.07). As with Cyp1b1 in wild-type mice, constitutive hCYP1B1 protein is non-detectable in liver but was induced with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. Wild-type mice were 59% more likely to succumb to T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL). Unlike an earlier examination of the Ahr genotype in this model (Yu et al., Cancer Res, 2006;66:755-762), but in agreement with a more recent study (Shorey et al., Toxicol Appl Pharmacol, 2013;270:60-69), this genotype was not associated with lung tumor incidence, multiplicity, or mortality. Sex was not significant with respect to lung tumor incidence or mortality but males exhibited significantly greater multiplicity. Lung tumor incidence was greater in mCyp1b1 nulls compared to wild-type mice. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a humanized mouse model in transplacental carcinogenesis.

Trametinib, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1)/MEK2 inhibitor with activity against multiple myeloid cell lines at low nanomolar concentrations, was evaluated for safety and clinical activity in patients with relapsed/refractory leukemias. METHODS: This phase 1/2 study accrued patients with any relapsed/refractory leukemia in phase 1. In phase 2, this study accrued patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with NRAS or KRAS mutations (cohort 1); patients with AML, MDS, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) with a RAS wild-type mutation or an unknown mutation status (cohort 2); and patients with CMML with an NRAS or KRAS mutation (cohorts 3). RESULTS: The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea, rash, nausea, and increased alanine aminotransferase levels. The phase 2 recommended dose for Trametinib was 2 mg orally daily. The overall response rates were 20%, 3%, and 27% for cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and this indicated preferential activity among RAS-mutated myeloid malignancies. Repeated cycles of trametinib were well tolerated with manageable or reversible toxicities; these results were similar to those of other trametinib studies. CONCLUSIONS: The selective, single-agent activity of trametinib against RAS-mutated myeloid malignancies validates its therapeutic potential. Combination strategies based on a better understanding of the hierarchical role of mutations and signaling in myeloid malignancies are likely to improve the response rate and duration.

Body mass index z-score at diagnosis was also associated with overweight/obesity at follow-up.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) associated with this translocation is considered a distinct AML with a favorable prognosis. Due to the various incidences of the translocation, which is associated with geographic diversities, investigation of molecular epidemiology is important to increase the awareness of physicians and hematologists regarding the frequency this chromosomal aberration. METHODS: The patients were classified according to the French-American-British classification into eight groups: M0-M7. Determination of the prevalence of the AML1-ETO fusion gene was accomplished by TaqMan real-time PCR. Bone marrow samples from 113 patients with newly-diagnosed, untreated AML -M1, -M2, and -M4, and 20 healthy controls admitted to the Ghaem Hospital in Mashhad, Iran were studied. RESULTS: The AML1-ETO fusion gene was detected up 50% of the M2 subgroup and absent in the M1 and M4 subtypes and healthy controls. Comparison of the prevalence of the t(8;21) translocation with results of previous studies showed that it varies between countries. This result may be due to geographic or ethnic differences, or both. CONCLUSIONS: The relatively high prevalence of the t(8;21) translocation in Iran was similar to that found in other Asian countries. It was closely associated with female gender, relatively young age, and FAB-M2 subtype. Its distribution varied considerably with geographic area. Therefore, further studies are needed to provide epidemiological data important for the establishment of optimal therapeutic strategies applicable to patients of each region.",,"['Ghazaey Zidanloo, Saeedeh', 'Hosseinzaeh Colagar, Abasalt']","['Ghazaey Zidanloo S', 'Hosseinzaeh Colagar A']","['Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, Faculty of Basic Sciences, University of Mazandaran, Babolsar, CP: 47416-95447, Iran.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, Faculty of Basic Sciences, University of Mazandaran, Babolsar, CP: 47416-95447, Iran; Nano and Biotechnology Research Group, Faculty of Basic Sciences, University of Mazandaran, Babolsar, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Rep Biochem Mol Biol,Reports of biochemistry & molecular biology,101637937,,,,2014/10/01 00:00,2014/10/01 00:01,['2016/03/19 06:00'],"['2016/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rep Biochem Mol Biol. 2014 Oct;3(1):7-13.,,,,PMC4757083,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML1-ETO', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'M2', 'Prevalence', 't(8;21)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study serum samples from stable (n = 51) and progressive (n = 42) CLL patients and controls (n = 45) were used with aim to discover metabolic indicators of disease status. First an LC-MS based metabolic fingerprinting method was used to analyse selected samples in order to find a potential markers discriminating aggressive from indolent patients. Ten of these discovered markers were validated on the whole set of samples with an independent analytical technique. Linoleamide (p = 0.002) in addition to various acylcarnitines (p = 0.001-0.000001) showed to be significant markers of CLL in its aggressive form. Acetylcarnitine (p = 0.05) and hexannoylcarnitine (p = 0.005) were also distinguishable markers of indolent subjects. Forming a panel of selected acylcarnitines and fatty acid amides, it was possible to reach a potentially highly specific and sensitive diagnostic approach (AUC = 0.766).",,"['Piszcz, Jaroslaw', 'Armitage, Emily G', 'Ferrarini, Alessia', 'Ruperez, Francisco J', 'Kulczynska, Agnieszka', 'Bolkun, Lukasz', 'Kloczko, Janusz', 'Kretowski, Adam', 'Urbanowicz, Alina', 'Ciborowski, Michal', 'Barbas, Coral']","['Piszcz J', 'Armitage EG', 'Ferrarini A', 'Ruperez FJ', 'Kulczynska A', 'Bolkun L', 'Kloczko J', 'Kretowski A', 'Urbanowicz A', 'Ciborowski M', 'Barbas C']","['Department of Haematology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.', 'CEMBIO, Centre for Metabolomics and Bioanalysis, San Pablo CEU University, Madrid, Spain.', 'CEMBIO, Centre for Metabolomics and Bioanalysis, San Pablo CEU University, Madrid, Spain.', 'CEMBIO, Centre for Metabolomics and Bioanalysis, San Pablo CEU University, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Haematology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Haematology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Clinical Research Centre, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Clinical Oncology and Hematology Department, Provincial Hospital, Suwalki, Poland.', 'Clinical Research Centre, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.', 'CEMBIO, Centre for Metabolomics and Bioanalysis, San Pablo CEU University, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Linoleic Acids)', '0 (acylcarnitine)', '5340S2UXSP (linoleamide)', 'S7UI8SM58A (Carnitine)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Carnitine/analogs & derivatives/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood', 'Linoleic Acids/blood', 'Male', 'Metabolomics/*methods', 'Middle Aged']",2016/03/19 06:00,2017/12/05 06:00,['2016/03/19 06:00'],"['2015/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [medline]']","['8078 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.8078 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Apr 19;7(16):22324-38. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.8078.,10.18632/oncotarget.8078 [doi],,,PMC5008363,['Authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['acylcarnitines', 'biomarker', 'chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'disease staging', 'metabolomics']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The positive t(14; 18) and myc gene rearrangement in 106 cases of DLBCL were analyzed using interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) technique. The expression of myc and bcl-2 proteins was determined by immunohistochemistry. The relationship of positive t(14; 18) and myc gene rearrangement with clinical features, pathogenesis and prognosis for the patients was analyzed. SPSS 16.0 software was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Among the 106 cases, there were 27 (25.5%) cases with positive t(14; 18) and 13 (12.3%) cases with myc gene rearrangement, and 7 cases (6.6%) of DLBCL with concurrent t(14; 18)-positive and myc gene rearrangement. A relationship was observed between positive t(14; 18) and myc gene rearrangement (P=0.019). The follow-up data showed that the 7 DHL patients were in age of 52-84 years, the International Prognostic Index (IPI) scores were 3 in two cases, 4 in four cases and 5 in one case, and the ECOG scores were 3 in all the 7 cases. Four patients had bone marrow involvement and were combined with leukemia. The survival time ranged from 0.5 to 6 months, with a median survival of 4 months. The univariate analysis showed that B symptom, Ann Arbor stage, ECOG score, LDH level, IPI score, immunophenotype, bcl-2 protein expression, myc protein expression, and myc gene rearrangement were all associated with poor prognosis (P<0.05 for all). The multivariate analysis using a COX proportional hazard model confirmed that ECOG score, bcl-2 protein expression, myc protein expression, myc gene rearrangement, and immunophenotype were independent prognostic factors affecting survival (P<0.05 for all), among them, the myc gene rearrangement was the strongest prognostic factor (OR=4.337, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: ""Double-hit"" DLBCL is rare and can be mainly identified only by molecular detection. Perhaps positive t(14; 18) and myc gene rearrangement play concurrent role in its ""double-hit"" pathogenesis. DHL are highly invasive, and most of DHL patients have poor prognosis.

Inspired by the pathogenesis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), we hypothesized that the magnitude of decline in serum albumin from the day of conditioning initiation until its nadir in the first 2 weeks after hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT (DeltaAlb) predicts the risk for subsequent severe aGVHD. We reviewed the medical records of all 88 patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome who underwent highly mucotoxic myeloablative (busulfan/cyclophosphamide or cyclophosphamide/total body irradiation) allogeneic HCT from a matched related donor (MRD) or matched unrelated donor (MUD) at our institution between January 1, 2012 and January 1, 2015. Severe aGVHD was associated with MUD (47% versus 14% with MRD; P = .001) and DeltaAlb, which was significantly greater among patients who developed versus did not develop severe aGVHD (1.2 +/- .5 versus .8 +/- .4 g/dL, respectively; P < .001). In multivariate analysis DeltaAlb remained a significant predictor of severe aGVHD (odds ratio, 5.68; 95% CI, 1.65 to 19.64; P = .006; area under the ROC curve, .74; 95% CI, .63 to .86; P < .001). The best cutoff for DeltaAlb to predict severe aGVHD was .9, with a sensitivity, specificity, and overall classification accuracy of 77%, 66%, and 69%, respectively. The model was validated using the bootstrap technique, with no significant change in its performance. These results were not generalizable to a cohort of 30 patients who received less mucotoxic myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning. In conclusion, with mucotoxic myeloablative HCT, each .1-g/dL increase in DeltaAlb was associated with an approximately 23% increase in the odds of developing severe aGVHD. As an early biomarker of gut damage, DeltaAlb can be incorporated in composite risk models for aGVHD prediction, with hopes for ultimately allowing for individualized GVHD prophylaxis and potential intervention according to the predicted risk.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Three new drugs were recently approved for CLL therapy, and other agents are in late development. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we summarize data on promising new targeted drugs for CLL. The heterogeneous mechanisms of actions of these molecules are described, such as the inhibition of BCR signaling, direct targeting of CD20 molecules on the CLL cell surface, and BCL-2 inhibition. We present preclinical and clinical data from phase I to III studies in order to describe efficacy and side effect profile of these new drugs. Data are derived from peer-reviewed articles indexed in PubMed and from abstracts presented at major international meetings. EXPERT OPINION: Ibrutinib and idelalisib are challenging the role of chemo-immunotherapy in CLL therapy in the frontline and relapsed disease settings. High-risk CLL patients particularly benefit from these new agents. Venetoclax and obinutuzumab are other effective agents added to our therapeutic armamentarium.

We previously demonstrated the induction of ROS-mediated apoptosis by methanol extract of A. macrocephula in human leukemia cells. After purification and assessment of those active compounds from A. macrocephula ethanol extracts, in this study, we focused on the major active compound, atractylenolide I (ATL-I). Through MTT assay and morphology observation, we found cytotoxic effect of ATL-I in human K562 chronic myeloblastic leukemia (CML), U937 acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and Jurkat T lymphoma cells. In addition, ATL-I-induced apoptosis was demonstrated by sub G1 and fragmented chromosomal DNA detection using flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and agarose electrophoresis. Finally, we found ATL-I also induced caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation through the detection of procaspase-3, procaspase-9 and caspase-3 substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) by immunoblotting. Interestingly, we found that ATL-I induced not only apoptosis but also differentiation, as upregulation of CD14 and CD68 surface markers and increase of phagocytosis ability were discovered in ATL-I-treated K562 CML and U937 AML cells.

Consolidated knowledges are present only with the dose of 5 g/m(2) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: We collected data on 8 infants at the time of their first treatment with high-dose MTX, 8 g/m(2), to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile. All children had a dose adjustment with a weight-based prescription (1 m(2) = 30 kg). RESULTS: The median age was 4.5 months (range 0-9). The median weight was 5.63 kg (range 3.12-9.0). The median steady-state MTX concentration at the end of 6-hr infusion was 486 microM/L (range 227-790). The median systemic MTX clearance was 4.14 L/h/m(2) (range 1.98-9.35). The median MTX concentration after 24 h from the beginning of infusion was 3.29 microM/L (range 1.14-100.44). Three (37.5 %) patients had a delayed elimination of MTX (delayed early, delayed late, or total delayed: one for each). These altered elimination occurred principally in children weighing less than 4 kg (p: 0.0179). Moreover, a systemic MTX clearance at the end of infusion minor than 3 L/h/m(2) can predict a delayed elimination (p: 0.0179). Patients with altered elimination underwent rescue measures (leucovorin supplement and/or exchange transfusion). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that a higher dose of MTX for the treatment of aggressive brain tumors in early infants had an acceptable pharmacokinetic profile.

Functional studies revealed both growth suppression and proapoptotic activities for GLIPR1 in multiple cancer cell lines. GLIPR1's role in lung cancer has not been investigated. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is a protein arginine methyltransferase and forms a stoichiometric complex with the WD repeat domain 77 (WDR77) protein. Both PRMT5 and WDR77 are essential for growth of lung epithelial and cancer cells. But additional gene products that interact genetically or biochemichally with PRMT5 and WDR77 in the control of lung cancer cell growth are not characterized. METHODS: DNA microarray and immunostaining were used to detect GLIPR1 expression during lung development and lung tumorigenesis. GLIPR1 expression was also analyzed in the TCGA lung cancer cohort. The consequence of GLIPR1 on growth of lung cancer cells in the tissue culture and lung tumor xenografts in the nude mice was observed. RESULTS: We found that GLIPR1 expression is negatively associated with PRMT5/WDR77. GLIPR1 is absent in growing epithelial cells at the early stages of mouse lung development and highly expressed in the adult lung. Expression of GLIPR1 was down-regulated during lung tumorigenesis and its expression suppressed growth of lung cancer cells in the tissue culture and lung tumor xenografts in mice. GLIPR1 regulates lung cancer growth through the V-Erb-B avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3 (ErbB3). CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals a novel pathway that PRMT5/WDR77 regulates GLIPR1 expression to control lung cancer cell growth and GLIPR1 as a potential therapeutic agent for lung cancer.,,"['Sheng, Xiumei', 'Bowen, Nathan', 'Wang, Zhengxin']","['Sheng X', 'Bowen N', 'Wang Z']","['School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, 212013, China.', 'The Center for Cancer Research and Therapeutic Development, Department of Biological Sciences, Clark Atlanta University, 223 James P.

Although high CIP2A levels correlate with disease progression in CML, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In a screen of diagnostic chronic phase samples from patients with high and low CIP2A protein levels, high CIP2A levels correlate with an antiapoptotic phenotype, characterized by downregulation of proapoptotic BCL-2 family members, including BIM, PUMA and HRK, and upregulation of the antiapoptotic protein BCL-XL. These results suggest that the poor prognosis of patients with high CIP2A levels is due to an antiapoptotic phenotype. Disrupting this antiapoptotic phenotype by inhibition of BCL-XL via RNA interference or A-1331852, a novel, potent and BCL-XL-selective inhibitor, resulted in extensive apoptosis either alone or in combination with imatinib, dasatinib or nilotinib, both in cell lines and in primary CD34(+) cells from patients with high levels of CIP2A.

(Thymelaeaceae) has been reported a significant anti-leukemic activity. However, its functional mechanism has not been defined well. To study the biological mechanism of GD function, we have investigated whether GD affects CD44 expression, which has a role in the regulation of immune cell motilities, and identified the related signaling pathways. GD treatment induced the increase of CD44 expression in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, which was specific for immune cells. GD activated PKD1/NF-kappaB signaling to induce CD44 expression, and resulted in the increased migration of K562 cells. In invasion assay, cell migratory ability was induced by GD and the transfection with CD44-specific short hairpin RNA resulted in reduction of its cell migration. GD treated human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) were also shown the increased CD44 expression and migration. These data suggest that the induction of CD44 expression by GD treatment promotes immune cell transmigration resulting in the enhanced innate immunity.","['Copyright (c) 2016 European Federation of Immunological Societies.

Although classic chemoimmune therapy is still the gold standard of care for leukemic patients, effective therapy of CLL is yet to be achieved. The present study examines the influence of poly(propylene)imine (PPI) dendrimers with primary amino surface groups modified with maltotriose residues in approximately 90% (PPI-G4-DS-Mal-III) or 30% (PPI-G4-OS-Mal-III) of cases on CLL cells (MEC-1 cell line with del(17p)), and confirms that the main trigger in this interaction is the induction of the apoptotic mechanism. The efficacy of each dendrimer was compared using fludarabine (FA). Gene expression profiling (GEP) by microarray identified a group of genes in the BCR signaling pathway characterized by different levels of expression directly associated with the tested agent and type of interaction. Network analysis revealed the potential patterns involved in potential personalized therapy of CLL. The expression of most BCR genes decreased under the influence of dendrimers, which might translate into decreased maturation and proliferation of CLL lymphocytes. Moreover, PPI-G4-OS/DS-Mal-III dendrimers affected gene expression and CLL cells in a different way to FA.

Most cases of mixed-phenotype acute leukemia are de novo. However, therapy-related mixed-phenotype acute leukemia can occur, and are often associated with exposure to topoisomerase-II inhibitors and alkylating agents. There are no known treatment guidelines for therapy-related mixed-phenotype acute leukemia. We present a patient with T/myeloid mixed-phenotype acute leukemia secondary to rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone R-CHOP chemotherapy for primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The patient's leukemic cells express CD34, an immaturity marker, CD3, a T-cell marker, and myeloperoxidase, a myeloid marker, and her history of chemotherapy for previous lymphoma supports the diagnosis of therapy-related T/myeloid mixed phenotype acute leukemia. Clinicians should be aware that this entity could be associated with R-CHOP chemotherapy. Given the complexity in diagnosis, and lack of treatment guidelines, a further understanding of the pathological and genetic principles of therapy-related mixed-phenotype acute leukemia will assist in future efforts to treat and categorize these patients. Mixed phenotype acute leukemia is a rare entity that accounts for two to five percent of all acute leukemias. Therapy- related mixed phenotype acute leukemia is an exceedingly rare hematological neoplasm that accounts for less than one percent of acute leukemias. We describe a case of therapy-related T/myeloid mixed phenotype acute leukemia following rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone R-CHOP chemotherapy for primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma DLBCL. The patient is a 63-year-old female who presented with several cutaneous nodules diagnosed as primary cutaneous DLBCL. The patient received R-CHOP chemotherapy and achieved remission. She remained in remission for four years until she presented with dyspnea, night sweats, weakness, and diffuse lymphadenopathy. Her presentation was initially concerning for recurrent lymphoma; however, a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate and a lymph node biopsy revealed a distinct blast population consistent with T/myeloid mixed phenotype acute leukemia T/M-MPAL.

In these individuals, the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is compromised due to an increase in exposure to pro-inflammatory mediators, viral proteins, and virus released from infected cells. It has been shown that soluble CD40L (sCD40L) is released upon platelet activation and is an important mediator of the pathogenesis of HAND but the underlying mechanisms are unclear, emphasizing the need of an effective animal model. Here, we have utilized a novel animal model in which wild-type (WT) mice were infected with EcoHIV; a derivative of HIV-1 that contains a substitution of envelope protein gp120 with that of gp80 derived from murine leukemia virus-1 (MuLV-1). As early as two-weeks post-infection, EcoHIV led to increased permeability of the BBB associated with decreased expression of tight junction protein claudin-5, in CD40L and platelet activation-dependent manner. Treatment with an antiplatelet drug, eptifibatide, in EcoHIV-infected mice normalized BBB function, sCD40L release and platelet activity, thus implicating platelet activation and platelet-derived CD40L in virally induced BBB dysfunction. Our results also validate and underscore the importance of EcoHIV infection mouse model as a tool to explore therapeutic targets for HAND.",,"['Jones, Letitia D', 'Jackson, Joseph W', 'Maggirwar, Sanjay B']","['Jones LD', 'Jackson JW', 'Maggirwar SB']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, New York, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160317,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp120)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['AIDS Dementia Complex/physiopathology', 'Animals', 'Blood Platelets/*physiology/virology', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/*physiopathology', 'CD40 Ligand/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120/genetics', 'HIV Infections/*physiopathology', '*HIV-1/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Platelet Activation/physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Viral Load']",2016/03/18 06:00,2016/08/10 06:00,['2016/03/18 06:00'],"['2015/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0151702 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-55052 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Mar 17;11(3):e0151702. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0151702. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0151702 [doi],,,PMC4795798,,,,,,"['R01 NS054578/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI049815/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL128155/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS066801/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 NS086256/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', '4F31NS086256-03/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI078498/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Primary objective was to estimate the risk of leukaemia in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. METHODS: We followed 7243 women with a BRCA1 or a BRCA2 mutation for incident cases of leukaemia. We used the standardised incidence ratio (SIR) to estimate the relative risk of leukaemia, according to mutation and history of breast cancer. RESULTS: We identified five incident cases of leukaemia (two BRCA1, three BRCA2). All five women had a prior history of breast cancer and four had received chemotherapy. The mean time from breast cancer diagnosis to the development of leukaemia was 10.2 years (range 3-18 years). The SIR for BRCA1 carriers was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.11-2.19, P=0.61) and the SIR for BRCA2 carriers was 2.42 (95% CI: 0.61-6.58, P=0.17). The SIR was significantly higher than expected for women with a BRCA2 mutation and breast cancer (SIR=4.76, 95% CI:1.21-12.96, P=0.03), in particular for women who received chemotherapy (SIR=8.11, 2.06-22.07, P=0.007).

Despite the emerging recognition of Meis1's importance in the context of both normal and leukemic hematopoiesis, there is not yet a full understanding of Meis1's functions and the relevant pathways and genes mediating its functions. Recently, several conditional mouse models for Meis1 have been established. These models highlight a critical role for Meis1 in adult mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and implicate reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a mediator of Meis1 function in this compartment. There are, however, several reported differences between these studies in terms of downstream progenitor populations impacted and effectors of function. In this study, we describe further characterization of a conditional knockout model based on mice carrying a loxP-flanked exon 8 of Meis1 which we crossed onto the inducible Cre localization/expression strains, B6;129-Gt(ROSA)26Sor(tm1(Cre/ERT)Nat)/J or B6.Cg-Tg(Mx1-Cre)1Cgn/J. Findings obtained from these two inducible Meis1 knockout models confirm and extend previous reports of the essential role of Meis1 in adult HSC maintenance and expansion and provide new evidence that highlights key roles of Meis1 in both megakaryopoiesis and erythropoiesis. Gene expression analyses point to a number of candidate genes involved in Meis1's role in hematopoiesis.

The effects of PTX were examined in human leukemia cell lines and patients' chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells in relation to mitochondrial events, apoptosis, and perturbation of JNK activation using flow cytometry, siRNA, mitochondrial membrane potential determination, and western blotting. Exposure of cells to PTX at concentrations >/= 10 nM for 18 or 24 h resulted in a significant release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, cleavages of procaspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and JNK activation, leading to apoptosis. The pan-caspase inhibitor BOC-D-FMK blocked the PTX-induced apoptosis but had no effect on cytochrome c release, suggesting that cytochrome c had been released before caspase activation. Moreover, both pharmacological JNK inhibitors SP600125 and JNK siRNA dramatically blocked PTX-induced apoptosis, cytochrome c release, caspase 3, and PARP cleavage. These findings demonstrate that JNK activation plays a critical role in the induction of apoptosis mediated by PTX in human leukemia cell lines and CLL patient-derived primary cancer cells, and this event is upstream of cytochrome c release, caspase 3, and PARP cleavage.",,"['Peng, Z G', 'Liu, D C', 'Yao, Y B', 'Feng, X L', 'Huang, X', 'Tang, Y L', 'Yang, J', 'Wang, X X']","['Peng ZG', 'Liu DC', 'Yao YB', 'Feng XL', 'Huang X', 'Tang YL', 'Yang J', 'Wang XX']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.', 'Department of Surgery, Beijing Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Xuanwu District, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.', 'Department of Functional Genomics, National Human Genome Center of China, BDA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160311,Brazil,Genet Mol Res,Genetics and molecular research : GMR,101169387,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",2016/03/18 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/03/18 06:00'],"['2016/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['gmr3904 [pii]', '10.4238/gmr.15013904 [doi]']",epublish,Genet Mol Res. 2016 Mar 11;15(1):15013904. doi: 10.4238/gmr.15013904.,10.4238/gmr.15013904 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), HTLV-1 plasma RNA is sparse. The contribution of the ""mitotic"" spread of HTLV-1 compared with infectious spread of the virus to HTLV-1 viral burden in established infection is uncertain. Since extrachromosomal long terminal repeat (LTR) DNA circles are indicators of viral replication in HIV-1 carriers with undetectable plasma HIV RNA, we hypothesised that HTLV-1 LTR circles could indicate reverse transcriptase (RT) usage and infectious activity. 1LTR and 2LTR DNA circles were measured in HTLV-1 cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of asymptomatic carriers (ACs) and patients with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) or adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL). 1LTR DNA circles were detected in 14/20 patients at a mean of 1.38/100 PBMC but did not differentiate disease status nor correlate with HTLV-1 DNA copies. 2LTR DNA circles were detected in 30/31 patients and at higher concentrations in patients with HTLV-1-associated diseases, independent of HTLV-1 DNA load. In an incident case the 2LTR DNA circle concentration increased 2.1 fold at the onset of HAM/TSP compared to baseline. Detectable and fluctuating levels of HTLV-1 DNA circles in patients indicate viral RT usage and virus replication.

Our results demonstrate that cellular location of p18(INK4c) and p57(Kip2) seems to be implicated in the antiproliferative activity of Imatinib and Dasatinib in CML cells and also suggest that the permanence of quiescent stem cells after TKI treatment could be associated with a decrease in p18(INK4c) and p57(Kip2) nuclear location.

Inhibition of the mTOR pathway promotes cellular dormancy. Since cells from patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) can be phenotypically dormant (quiescent), we examined biomarkers of their mTOR pathway activity concurrently with Ki-67 and CD71 (indicators of cycling cells) by quantitative flow cytometry. Using antibodies to phosphorylated epitopes of mTOR (S2448) and its downstream targets ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6, S235/236) and 4E-BP1 (T36/45), we documented that these phosphorylations were negligible in lymphocytes, but evident in dormant as well as proliferating subsets of both mobilised normal stem cell harvest CD34+ cells and AML blasts. Although mTOR phosphorylation in AML blasts was lower than that of the normal CD34+ cells, p-4E-BP1 was 2.6-fold higher and p-rpS6 was 22-fold higher. Moreover, in contrast to 4E-BP1, rpS6 phosphorylation was higher in dormant than proliferating AML blasts, and was also higher in the immature CD34+CD38- blast subset. Data from the Cancer Genome Atlas show that rpS6 expression is associated with that of respiratory chain enzymes in AML.

Despite high cure rates, side effects and late consequences of the intensive treatments are common. Unquestionably, the identification of new therapeutic targets will lead to safer, more effective treatments. We identified TES promoter methylation and transcriptional silencing as a very common molecular abnormality in childhood ALL, irrespective of molecular subtype. The aims of the present study were to demonstrate that TES promoter methylation is aberrant, to determine the effects of TES re-expression in ALL, and to determine if those effects are mediated via TP53 activity. METHODS: Normal fetal and adult tissue DNA was isolated and TES promoter methylation determined by Sequenom MassARRAY. Quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot were used to confirm re-expression of TES in ALL cell lines after 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) exposure or transfection with TES expression plasmids. The effects of TES re-expression on ALL cells were investigated using standard cell proliferation, cell death and cell cycle assays. RESULTS: In this study, we confirm that the TES promoter is unmethylated in normal adult and fetal tissues. We report that decitabine treatment of ALL cell lines results in demethylation of the TES promoter and attendant expression of TES mRNA. Re-expression of TESTIN protein in ALL cells using expression plasmid transfection results in rapid cell death or cell cycle arrest independent of TP53 activity. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that TES is aberrantly methylated in ALL and that re-expression of TESTIN has anti-leukaemia effects which point to novel therapeutic opportunities for childhood ALL.",,"['Weeks, Robert J', 'Ludgate, Jackie L', 'LeMee, Gwenn', 'Morison, Ian M']","['Weeks RJ', 'Ludgate JL', 'LeMee G', 'Morison IM']","['Department of Pathology, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.', 'Department of Pathology, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.', 'Department of Pathology, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.', 'Department of Pathology, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160317,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (TES protein, human)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*genetics', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",2016/03/18 06:00,2016/08/04 06:00,['2016/03/18 06:00'],"['2015/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0151341 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-28544 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Mar 17;11(3):e0151341. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0151341. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0151341 [doi],,,PMC4795691,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results indicated hydrophobic interactions in the p2 pocket dominated affinity of the most favourable binding ligand (3bl: Ki = 31 nM). Compounds were up to 19-fold selective for Mcl-1 over Bcl-xL.

METHODS: Participants included 76 survivors assessed 5-14 years post-HSCT. Self-report and parent-proxy (i.e., N = 38) measures of fatigue, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), emotional and behavioral functioning, executive functioning, and quality of life (QOL) were completed. Health-related correlates were obtained from medical records. RESULTS: Survivors exhibited significant fatigue for self (M = 69.21 +/- 20.14) and parent-proxy (M = 72.15 +/- 20.79) report. EDS was endorsed for 20-33% of survivors, depending on the respondent. EDS was not significant for parent-proxy outcomes, but was associated with poorer self-reported QOL and internalizing problems (p < .0016). Fatigue was associated with poorer functioning across all domains (p's < .0016). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of pediatric HSCT survivors exhibit sleepiness and fatigue. Fatigue is associated with statistically and clinically greater functional difficulties, highlighting the importance of examining sleep and fatigue and considering interventions to improve alertness.","['(c) The Author 2016.

It is also expressed in a range of epithelial neoplasms but has not been assessed in haemopoietic malignancies. We have performed an immunohistochemical evaluation of TGFalpha in acute and chronic myeloid malignancies. METHODS: TGFalpha expression was semiquantitatively assessed in 69 normal bone marrow trephines and 157 cases of myeloid malignancy using an immunohistochemical approach. RESULTS: Blast cells of myeloid origin in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), myelodysplasia and accelerated and blast phases of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) were TGFalpha positive. In acute promyelocytic leukaemia the neoplastic cells had significantly weaker TGFalpha expression than seen in other forms of AML. The blast cells in CML-accelerated and blast phases were positive with similar expression to AML. CONCLUSIONS: TGFalpha is expressed in neoplastic myeloblasts and could, therefore, be used as blast cell biomarker in diagnostic haematopathology. In addition, TGFalpha immunohistochemistry may be of use in identifying a therapeutic target.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

There is a clear unmet medical need for MS, as current therapies reduce the relapse rate, but are unable to prevent the neurological deterioration. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a proinflammatory cytokine that can also positively modulate the immune response, by inducing the inhibition of myelin-reactive TH17 differentiation, and by promoting oligodendrocyte-mediated myelination. The aim of this project was to find central nervous system (CNS)-permeable and orally available small molecules that upregulate production of endogenous LIF. We describe here the development of a phenotypic assay and screening of 1.7 million compounds to identify LIF enhancers using U87 MG cells. Five chemically tractable series of compounds and a few singletons were selected for further progression. Some of them were also active in a different LIF-expressing cell line and in primary rat astrocytes. Although further studies would be required to deconvolute the targets involved in LIF induction and to confirm activity of hits in more disease-relevant assays, our results have demonstrated the potential of the phenotypic approach to identify specific and chemically tractable small molecules that trigger the production of LIF in relevant cell lines.",['(c) 2016 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.'],"['Vela, Laura', 'Caballero, Ivan', 'Fang, Leiping', 'Liu, Qin', 'Ramon, Fernando', 'Diez, Emilio', 'de Los Frailes, Maite']","['Vela L', 'Caballero I', 'Fang L', 'Liu Q', 'Ramon F', 'Diez E', 'de Los Frailes M']","['Centro de Investigacion Basica, GSK, Tres Cantos, Madrid, Spain Laura.2.vela@gsk.com.', 'Centro de Investigacion Basica, GSK, Tres Cantos, Madrid, Spain.', 'GSK (China) R&D Company Limited, Pudong, Shanghai, China.', 'GSK (China) R&D Company Limited, Pudong, Shanghai, China.', 'Centro de Investigacion Basica, GSK, Tres Cantos, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Basica, GSK, Tres Cantos, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Basica, GSK, Tres Cantos, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160316,United States,J Biomol Screen,Journal of biomolecular screening,9612112,"['0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Central Nervous System/drug effects', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*genetics', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Nerve Fibers, Myelinated/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oligodendroglia/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Small Molecule Libraries/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Th17 Cells/drug effects']",2016/03/18 06:00,2018/01/27 06:00,['2016/03/18 06:00'],"['2015/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1087057116638821 [pii]', '10.1177/1087057116638821 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biomol Screen. 2016 Jun;21(5):437-45. doi: 10.1177/1087057116638821.

Clinical outcomes in CML were revolutionized by development of Bcr-abl-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but CML is not cured by these agents. CML leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are relatively TKI insensitive and persist even in remission. LSC persistence results in relapse upon TKI discontinuation, or drug resistance or blast crisis (BC) during prolonged treatment. We hypothesize that increased expression of Fas-associated phosphatase 1 (Fap1) in CML contributes to LSC persistence and BC. As Fap1 substrates include Fas and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (Gsk3beta), increased Fap1 activity in CML is anticipated to induce Fas resistance and stabilization of beta-catenin protein. Resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis may contribute to CML LSC persistence, and beta-catenin activity increases during BC. In the current study, we directly tested the role of Fap1 in CML LSC persistence using in an in vivo murine model. In TKI-treated mice, we found that inhibiting Fap1, using a tripeptide or small molecule, prevented TKI resistance, BC and relapse after TKI discontinuation; all events observed with TKI alone. In addition, Fap1 inhibition increased Fas sensitivity and decreased beta-catenin activity in CD34(+) bone marrow cells from human subjects with CML. Therapeutic Fap1 inhibition may permit TKI discontinuation and delay in progression in CML.",,"['Huang, W', 'Luan, C-H', 'Hjort, E E', 'Bei, L', 'Mishra, R', 'Sakamoto, K M', 'Platanias, L C', 'Eklund, E A']","['Huang W', 'Luan CH', 'Hjort EE', 'Bei L', 'Mishra R', 'Sakamoto KM', 'Platanias LC', 'Eklund EA']","['Feinberg School of Medicine and Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Jesse Brown VA, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'High Throughput Analysis Laboratory, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.', 'Feinberg School of Medicine and Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Feinberg School of Medicine and Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Jesse Brown VA, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Center for Molecular Innovation and Drug Discovery, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Feinberg School of Medicine and Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Jesse Brown VA, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Feinberg School of Medicine and Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Jesse Brown VA, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160317,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN13 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 13)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blast Crisis/etiology/pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'PDZ Domains', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 13/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Recurrence', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",2016/03/18 06:00,2017/07/27 06:00,['2016/03/18 06:00'],"['2015/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/25 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201666 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.66 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Jul;30(7):1502-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.66.

Importantly, recent identification of aldehydes as endogenous genotoxins in Fanconi anemia has provided new insight into disease causation. Because of their bulky nature, DPCs pose severe threats to genome stability, but previous methods to measure formaldehyde-induced DPCs were incapable of discriminating between endogenous and exogenous sources of chemical. In this study, we developed methods that provide accurate and distinct measurements of both exogenous and endogenous DPCs in a structurally specific manner. We exposed experimental animals to stable isotope-labeled formaldehyde ([(13)CD2]-formaldehyde) by inhalation and performed ultrasensitive mass spectrometry to measure endogenous (unlabeled) and exogenous ((13)CD2-labeled) DPCs. We found that exogenous DPCs readily accumulated in nasal respiratory tissues but were absent in tissues distant to the site of contact. This observation, together with the finding that endogenous formaldehyde-induced DPCs were present in all tissues examined, suggests that endogenous DPCs may be responsible for increased risks of bone marrow toxicity and leukemia. Furthermore, the slow rate of DPC repair provided evidence for the persistence of DPCs. In conclusion, our method for measuring endogenous and exogenous DPCs presents a new perspective for the potential health risks inflicted by endogenous formaldehyde and may inform improved disease prevention and treatment strategies.

However, other subtypes of AML display resistance to ATRA-based treatment. In this study, we screened natural, plant-derived vibsane-type diterpenoids for their ability to induce differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells, discovering that vibsanin A potently induced differentiation of AML cell lines and primary blasts. The differentiation-inducing activity of vibsanin A was mediated through direct interaction with and activation of protein kinase C (PKC). Consistent with these findings, pharmacological blockade of PKC activity suppressed vibsanin A-induced differentiation. Mechanistically, vibsanin A-mediated activation of PKC led to induction of the ERK pathway and decreased c-Myc expression. In mouse xenograft models of AML, vibsanin A administration prolonged host survival and inhibited PKC-mediated inflammatory responses correlated with promotion of skin tumors in mice.

The IR tissue is arranged in cell cords around the posterior cardinal vein (PCV) and its tributaries and secretes corticosteroids. The chromaffin tissue is scattered singly or in nests of one or more cells around the epithelial lining of the PCV or blood capillaries within the IR tissue. They are ferric ferricyanide-positive. Leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF)-like reactivity was noticed in the lining of the epithelium of the IR cell cords and around the wall of the PCV and blood capillaries. No staining was observed in the hemopoietic cells. IL-1beta- and TNF-alpha-like immunoreactivity was seen in certain cells in the hemopoietic tissue but not in the IR region. Macrophages were identified with mammalian macrophage-specific MAC387 antibodies and are present in the hemopoietic mass but not in the IR tissue. Pigments accumulate in the hemopoietic mass as melano-macrophage centers (MMCs) and are PAS-, Schmorl's- and Perls'-positive. The pigments contain melanin (black), hemosiderin (blue) and lipofuscin/ceroid (oxidized lipid, yellowish tan), as evident from the Perls' reaction. The MMCs were TUNEL-positive as evident from FITC fluorescence, indicating their apoptotic nature. The MMCs showed significant seasonal variation with their density increasing to the peak in the postspawning phase. Melanins were characterized spectrophotometrically for the first time in fish anterior kidney. The predominant form is pheomelanin (PM), followed by eumelanin (EM) and alkali-soluble melanin (ASM). Melanins showed significant seasonal variations with the level low in the resting phase and increasing to the peak in the postspawning phase. Under in vitro conditions, lipopolysaccharide (10 microg/mL) treatment increased significantly the levels of PM and EM levels both at 16 and at 32 h and the ASM level at 32 h. On the other hand, the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (100 nM) decreased significantly the levels of EM, PM and ASM time-dependently. The results indicate that the anterior kidney is an important site of immune-endocrine interaction.",,"['Kumar, Ravi', 'Joy, K P', 'Singh, S M']","['Kumar R', 'Joy KP', 'Singh SM']","['Department of Zoology, Centre of Advanced Study, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, 221005, India.', 'Department of Zoology, Centre of Advanced Study, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, 221005, India. kpjoy@bhu.ac.in.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Cochin University of Science and Technology, Kochi, 682022, India. kpjoy@bhu.ac.in.', 'School of Biotechnology, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, 221005, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160316,Netherlands,Fish Physiol Biochem,Fish physiology and biochemistry,100955049,"['0 (Fish Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Melanins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Catfishes/anatomy & histology/*metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fish Proteins/metabolism', 'Head Kidney/anatomy & histology/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-1beta/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Melanins/*metabolism', 'Seasons', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2016/03/18 06:00,2017/03/04 06:00,['2016/03/18 06:00'],"['2015/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10695-016-0218-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s10695-016-0218-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Fish Physiol Biochem. 2016 Oct;42(5):1287-306. doi: 10.1007/s10695-016-0218-2.

MDR is often associated with the overexpression of drug efflux transporters of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein family. Timosaponin A-III (TAIII), a saponin isolated from the rhizome of Anemarrhena asphodeloides, has previously demonstrated the ability to suppress certain human tumor processes and the potential to be developed as an anticancer agent. Nevertheless, the ability of TAIII to reverse MDR has not yet been explored. In this study, the adriamycin (ADM) resistance reversal effect of TAIII in human CML K562/ADM cells and the underlying mechanism was investigated. The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay showed that TAIII had a reversal effect on the drug resistance of K562/ADM cells. Flow cytometry assay showed increased intracellular accumulation of ADM after cells were pretreated with TAIII, and the changes in the accumulation of rhodamine-123 (Rho-123) and 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) dye in K562/ADM cells were determined to be similar to the changes of intracellular accumulation of ADM. After pretreatment of cells with TAIII, the decreasing expression of P-gp and MRP1 mRNA was examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Western blotting showed TAIII inhibiting P-gp and MRP1 expression depended on the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by decreasing the activity of p-Akt. Moreover, wortmannin an inhibitor of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway has a strong inhibitory effect on the expression of p-Akt, P-gp and MRP1. Besides, the combined treatment with TAIII did not have an affect on wortmannin downregulation of p-Akt, P-gp and MRP1. Taken together, our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that TAIII induced MDR reversal through inhibition of P-gp and MRP1 expression and function with regained adriamycin sensitivity which might mainly correlate to the regulation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.",,"['Chen, Jie-Ru', 'Jia, Xiu-Hong', 'Wang, Hong', 'Yi, Ying-Jie', 'Wang, Jian-Yong', 'Li, You-Jie']","['Chen JR', 'Jia XH', 'Wang H', 'Yi YJ', 'Wang JY', 'Li YJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Hospital of Binzhou Medical University, Binzhou, Shandong 256603.

The purpose of this single-center, uncontrolled, observational study was to assess the frequency of MS in our survivors. The survivors of ALL </=15 years at diagnosis, who had completed therapy >/=2 years earlier, were enrolled. Anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), biochemistry (glucose, insulin, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein [HDL], thyroid function tests, C-reactive protein [CRP], magnesium), measurement of blood pressure, and Tanner staging were performed. MS was defined by International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the National Cholesterol Education Program Third Adult Treatment Panel guidelines (NCEP ATP III) criteria, modified by Cook et al.

Leukemia is the most common type of cancer in children, and despite the advances in therapeutic strategies, the survival rate in leukemia cases is very low. Overexpression of interleukin 2 receptor (IL2R) in hematological malignancies has been utilized to target leukemia. Here, we report an immunotoxin fusion construct of human IL2alpha and TRAIL for targeting leukemia. AIM: Our aim was to develop an immunotoxin to target CD25+ leukemic cells. METHODS: Recombinant fusion construct comprising human IL2alpha and TRAIL114-281 was cloned, expressed and purified. Surface expression levels of IL2alpha and TRAIL receptors (CD25 and DR5 respectively) were compared in four leukemic cell lines and patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Efficacy of immunotoxins was tested in cell lines and PBMCs by cell viability assay and compared with receptor expression. RESULTS: The efficacy of IL2-TRAIL was higher than TRAIL alone and showed an IC50 ranging from 0.2-0.8 muM in cell lines. IL2-TRAIL induced cell death in PBMCs from leukemic patients in vitro, which was proportional to CD25 expression. Out of 34 leukemic samples, 24 samples were susceptible to immunotoxin-mediated cytotoxicity. The efficacy of IL2-TRAIL (87.5 %) was significantly high compared to TRAIL protein (29 %) in both myeloid and lymphoid leukemic patient samples. IL2-TRAIL fusion protein was highly specific for CD25+ leukemia and showed 100 % efficacy in lymphocytic leukemia [acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia] that overexpressed CD25.",,"['Madhumathi, Jayaprakasam', 'Sridevi, Surapally', 'Verma, Rama Shanker']","['Madhumathi J', 'Sridevi S', 'Verma RS']","['Stem Cell and Molecular Biology Laboratory, Bhupat & Jyoti Mehta School of Biosciences Building, Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, 600036, TN, India.', 'Stem Cell and Molecular Biology Laboratory, Bhupat & Jyoti Mehta School of Biosciences Building, Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, 600036, TN, India.', 'Stem Cell and Molecular Biology Laboratory, Bhupat & Jyoti Mehta School of Biosciences Building, Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, 600036, TN, India. vermars@iitm.ac.in.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,France,Target Oncol,Targeted oncology,101270595,"['0 (IL2RA protein, human)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*genetics', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism']",2016/03/18 06:00,2017/10/31 06:00,['2016/03/18 06:00'],"['2016/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11523-016-0424-y [doi]', '10.1007/s11523-016-0424-y [pii]']",ppublish,Target Oncol. 2016 Aug;11(4):535-47. doi: 10.1007/s11523-016-0424-y.,10.1007/s11523-016-0424-y [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However relapse is the most common cause of treatment failure. Outcomes after relapse remain poor, with long-term survival in the order of 10 %. Treatment decisions made at the time of first complete remission are thus critical to ensuring long-term survival. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is effective at preventing relapse in many transplant recipients but is also associated with significant treatment related morbidity and mortality. Alternatively, ongoing systemic chemotherapy offers lower toxicity at the expense of increased relapse rates. Over the past decades, both the safety of transplant and the efficacy of non-transplant chemotherapy have improved. Emerging data show substantially improved outcomes for young adults treated with pediatric-inspired chemotherapy regimens that question the role of HCT in the upfront setting.

We herein aimed to investigate TET2 mutations and their impact on TET2 expression in a cohort of patients with myeloid neoplasms, including MDS and AML patients. FINDINGS: TET2 mutations were observed in 8 out of 19 patients (42 %) with myeloid neoplasms. The TET2 expression profile was similar between in wild type and in TET2 mutated patients.

DNA methylation is governed by the DNA methyltransferases mainly DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. DNMT1 methylates hemimethylated DNA ensuring accurate DNA methylation maintenance. DNMT1 is involved in the proper differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) through the interaction with effector molecules. DNMT1 is deregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) as early as the leukemic stem cell stage. Through the interaction with fundamental transcription factors, non-coding RNAs, fusion oncogenes and by modulating core members of signaling pathways, it can affect leukemic cells biology.

Patients with JMML have mutually exclusive genetic abnormalities in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor (GMR, CD116) signaling pathway. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is currently the only curative treatment option for JMML; however, disease recurrence is a major cause of treatment failure. We investigated adoptive immunotherapy using GMR-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) for JMML. METHODS: We constructed a novel CAR capable of binding to GMR via its ligand, GM-CSF, and generated piggyBac transposon-based GMR CAR-modified T cells from three healthy donors and two patients with JMML. We further evaluated the anti-proliferative potential of GMR CAR T cells on leukemic CD34(+) cells from six patients with JMML (two NRAS mutations, three PTPN11 mutations, and one monosomy 7), and normal CD34(+) cells. RESULTS: GMR CAR T cells from healthy donors suppressed the cytokine-dependent growth of MO7e cells, but not the growth of K562 and Daudi cells. Co-culture of healthy GMR CAR T cells with CD34(+) cells of five patients with JMML at effector to target ratios of 1:1 and 1:4 for 2 days significantly decreased total colony growth, regardless of genetic abnormality. Furthermore, GMR CAR T cells from a non-transplanted patient and a transplanted patient inhibited the proliferation of respective JMML CD34(+) cells at onset to a degree comparable to healthy GMR CAR T cells. Seven-day co-culture of GMR CAR T cells resulted in a marked suppression of JMML CD34(+) cell proliferation, particularly CD34(+)CD38(-) cell proliferation stimulated with stem cell factor and thrombopoietin on AGM-S3 cells. Meanwhile, GMR CAR T cells exerted no effects on normal CD34(+) cell colony growth.

The course and treatment of CLL is unique and characterised by repeated cycles of treatment, stable disease and relapse. Utilising a Self-Regulatory Model framework, we examined the relationship between patients' illness perceptions and cancer-specific stress, depressive symptoms and fatigue. Our aim was to test illness perceptions as predictors of these outcomes when variance due to disease and treatment variables was controlled. DESIGN: Data were collected on 147 patients with relapsed/refractory CLL as they entered a phase II clinical trial of an investigational medication at a university affiliated, National Cancer Institute designated comprehensive cancer center. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cancer-specific stress, depressive symptoms and fatigue interference. RESULT: . Hierarchical multiple regression was used. Consequences and emotional representation were related to all outcomes (ps < .01). Illness concern was related to cancer-specific stress (p < .01), and identity was related to fatigue interference (p < .01). All relationships were observed while controlling for number of previous CLL therapies received.

While TP53 missense mutations can also contribute gain-of-function activities that impact tumour progression, it remains unclear whether the deletion event, which frequently includes many genes, impacts tumorigenesis beyond TP53 loss alone. Here we show that somatic heterozygous deletion of mouse chromosome 11B3, a 4-megabase region syntenic to human 17p13.1, produces a greater effect on lymphoma and leukaemia development than Trp53 deletion. Mechanistically, the effect of 11B3 loss on tumorigenesis involves co-deleted genes such as Eif5a and Alox15b (also known as Alox8), the suppression of which cooperates with Trp53 loss to produce more aggressive disease. Our results imply that the selective advantage produced by human chromosome 17p deletion reflects the combined impact of TP53 loss and the reduced dosage of linked tumour suppressor genes.",,"['Liu, Yu', 'Chen, Chong', 'Xu, Zhengmin', 'Scuoppo, Claudio', 'Rillahan, Cory D', 'Gao, Jianjiong', 'Spitzer, Barbara', 'Bosbach, Benedikt', 'Kastenhuber, Edward R', 'Baslan, Timour', 'Ackermann, Sarah', 'Cheng, Lihua', 'Wang, Qingguo', 'Niu, Ting', 'Schultz, Nikolaus', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Mills, Alea A', 'Lowe, Scott W']","['Liu Y', 'Chen C', 'Xu Z', 'Scuoppo C', 'Rillahan CD', 'Gao J', 'Spitzer B', 'Bosbach B', 'Kastenhuber ER', 'Baslan T', 'Ackermann S', 'Cheng L', 'Wang Q', 'Niu T', 'Schultz N', 'Levine RL', 'Mills AA', 'Lowe SW']","['Department of Hematology and Department of Liver Surgery, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and National Collaborative Innovation Center, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Department of Liver Surgery, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and National Collaborative Innovation Center, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Department of Liver Surgery, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and National Collaborative Innovation Center, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Kravis Center for Molecular Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology & Pathogenesis Program and Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Department of Hematology & Research Laboratory of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Kravis Center for Molecular Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Department of Hematology & Research Laboratory of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Kravis Center for Molecular Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology & Pathogenesis Program and Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New York, New York 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160316,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Peptide Initiation Factors)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Mammalian/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Peptide Initiation Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion/*genetics', 'Synteny/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*deficiency']",2016/03/17 06:00,2016/04/28 06:00,['2016/03/17 06:00'],"['2015/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1038/nature17157 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 2016 Mar 24;531(7595):471-475. doi: 10.1038/nature17157.

We developed a new statistical test, the generalized integrated functional test (GIFT), that tests for regional differences in methylation based on the methylation percent at each CpG site within a genomic region. The GIFT uses estimated subject-specific profiles with smoothing methods, specifically wavelet smoothing, and calculates an ANOVA-like test to compare the average profile of groups. In this way, possibly correlated CpG sites within the regulatory region are compared all together. Simulations and analyses of data obtained from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia indicate that GIFT has good statistical properties and is able to identify promising genomic regions. Further, GIFT is likely to work with multiple different types of experiments since different smoothing methods can be used to estimate the profiles of data without noise.

Ibrutinib is overall well tolerated but long-term treatment is required until disease progression or intolerable toxic effects occur. Little is known regarding its cutaneous adverse effects. OBJECTIVE: To describe the hair and nail manifestations associated with the long-term use of ibrutinib for the treatment of CLL. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective study of 66 patients with CLL enrolled in a single-arm phase 2 clinical trial of ibrutinib for CLL between March 2014 and October 2015 at the National Institutes of Health. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome, nail and hair changes associated with ibrutinib therapy, was assessed by an 11-question survey. In addition, the severity of nail changes was determined from a 0 to 3 rating scale for both onychoschizia and onychorrhexis. RESULTS: Among 66 patients (43 men and 23 women with ages ranging from 55 to 85 years), 44 (67%) reported brittle fingernails at a median of 6.5 (95% CI, 6-12) months after starting ibrutinib therapy. Fifteen patients (23%) developed brittle toenails after a median of 9 (95% CI, 6-15) months of ibrutinib therapy. Textural hair changes were reported in 17 patients (26%), at a median of 9 (95% CI, 6-12) months of ibrutinib treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Hair and nail abnormalities are commonly associated with ibrutinib and appear several months after initiating therapy. Ibrutinib inhibits Bruton tyrosine kinase by covalently binding to cysteine 481. Whether ibrutinib affects the hair and nails by binding and altering cysteine-rich proteins of hair and nails or by means of another mechanism remains unknown.

We first isolated GCs by scraping from bovine preovulatory follicles and then tested several different media to define the ideal conditions to select granulosa-derived stem cells. Although expressing MSC-associated markers, none of the media tested proven to be efficient in selecting MSC-like cells that were able to differentiate into mesodermic or ectodermic lineages. We performed another experimental approach exposing cells to a chemical stress, such as lowering of pH, as a system to select a more plastic population. Following the treatment, granulosa-specific granulose markers [follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), follistatin (FST), and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR)] were lost in bovine GCs, whereas an increase in multi- (CD29, CD44, CD73) and pluripotent (Oct-4 and c-Myc) genes was noticed. The stress allowed up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta expression and the dedifferentiation of GCs, which was demonstrated by differentiation studies.

The genetic cause is unknown in the majority of cases, and less than 10% of patients have a family history of the disease. Most patients have normal numbers of B cells but lack plasma cells. METHODS: We used whole-exome sequencing and array-based comparative genomic hybridization to evaluate a subset of patients with CVID and low B-cell numbers. Mutant proteins were analyzed for DNA binding with the use of an electrophoretic mobility-shift assay (EMSA) and confocal microscopy. Flow cytometry was used to analyze peripheral-blood lymphocytes and bone marrow aspirates. RESULTS: Six different heterozygous mutations in IKZF1, the gene encoding the transcription factor IKAROS, were identified in 29 persons from six families. In two families, the mutation was a de novo event in the proband. All the mutations, four amino acid substitutions, an intragenic deletion, and a 4.7-Mb multigene deletion involved the DNA-binding domain of IKAROS. The proteins bearing missense mutations failed to bind target DNA sequences on EMSA and confocal microscopy; however, they did not inhibit the binding of wild-type IKAROS. Studies in family members showed progressive loss of B cells and serum immunoglobulins. Bone marrow aspirates in two patients had markedly decreased early B-cell precursors, but plasma cells were present. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia developed in 2 of the 29 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Heterozygous mutations in the transcription factor IKAROS caused an autosomal dominant form of CVID that is associated with a striking decrease in B-cell numbers.

Triplebody 33-3-19 binds specifically to both of these TAAs and activates T cells as immune effectors. Thereby it induces specific lysis of established myeloid (MOLM13, THP-1) and B-lymphoid cell lines (BV173, SEM, Raji, ARH77) as well as of primary patient cells. EC50 values range from 3 pM to 2.4 nM. In accordance with our hypothesis, 33-3-19 is able to induce preferential lysis of double- rather than single-positive leukemia cells in a target cell mixture: CD19/CD33 double-positive BV173 cells were eliminated to a significantly greater extent than CD19 single-positive SEM cells (36.6% vs. 20.9% in 3 hours, p = 0.0048) in the presence of both cell lines. In contrast, equivalent elimination efficiencies were observed for both cell lines, when control triplebody 19-3-19 or a mixture of the bispecific single chain variable fragments 19-3 and 33-3 were used.

While therapeutic antibodies show clinical activity in CLL patients, resistance inevitably develops resulting in treatment failure. Identifying mechanisms of antibody resistance and methods to reduce resistance would be valuable in managing CLL. Monocyte derived cells (MDCs), also known as nurse like cells (NLCs) in CLL [1], [2], are known to be crucial components of the CLL microenvironment network and following ""maturation"" in in vitro culture systems are able to provide support for the survival of the malignant B cells from CLL patients. In addition to their protective role, MDCs are key effector cells in mediating responses to therapeutic antibody therapies [3]. We have determined that macrophages from patients with early stable CLL are able to elicit superior cytotoxic response to therapeutic antibodies than macrophages derived from patients with progressive CLL. We have exploited this unique finding to gain insight into antibody resistance. Thus, we have profiled monocytes on day 0 and MDCs on day 7 from antibody sensitive and antibody resistant CLL patients (GEO accession number GEO: GSE71409). We show that there are no significant differences in transcriptomes from the monocytes or MDCs derived from sensitive or resistant patient samples.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia is characterized by t(15;17). This leads to the formation of PML/RARalpha which blocks the differentiation of blasts at the stage of promyelocytes.

We aimed to assess i) in how many patients who relapse on second-line 2GTKI therapy next generation sequencing (NGS) may track resistant mutations back to the sample collected at the time of imatinib resistance, before 2GTKI start (switchover sample) and ii) whether low level mutations identified by NGS always undergo clonal expansion. To this purpose, we used NGS to retrospectively analyze 60 imatinib-resistant patients (CML, n = 45; Ph+ ALL,n = 15) who had failed second-line 2GTKI therapy and had acquired BCR-ABL1 mutations (Group 1) and 25 imatinib-resistant patients (CML, n = 21; Ph+ ALL, n = 4) who had responded to second-line 2GTKI therapy, for comparison (Group 2). NGS uncovered that in 26 (43%) patients in Group 1, the 2GTKI-resistant mutations that triggered relapse were already detectable at low levels in the switchover sample (median mutation burden, 5%; range 1.1%-18.4%). Importantly, none of the low level mutations detected by NGS in switchover samples failed to expand whenever the patient received the 2GTKI to whom they were insensitive. In contrast, no low level mutation that was resistant to the 2GTKI the patients subsequently received was detected in the switchover samples from Group 2.

However, there is considerable clinical and biological heterogeneity within this group of diseases, and relapse incidence reaches up to 40%. Moreover, translocations involving CBFs are not sufficient to induce AML on its own and the full spectrum of mutations coexisting with CBF translocations has not been elucidated. To address these issues, we performed extensive mutational analysis by high-throughput sequencing in 215 patients with CBF-AML enrolled in the Phase 3 Trial of Systematic Versus Response-adapted Timed-Sequential Induction in Patients With Core Binding Factor Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Treating Patients with Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia with Interleukin-2 trials (age, 1-60 years). Mutations in genes activating tyrosine kinase signaling (including KIT, N/KRAS, and FLT3) were frequent in both subtypes of CBF-AML. In contrast, mutations in genes that regulate chromatin conformation or encode members of the cohesin complex were observed with high frequencies in t(8;21) AML (42% and 18%, respectively), whereas they were nearly absent in inv(16) AML. High KIT mutant allele ratios defined a group of t(8;21) AML patients with poor prognosis, whereas high N/KRAS mutant allele ratios were associated with the lack of KIT or FLT3 mutations and a favorable outcome. In addition, mutations in epigenetic modifying or cohesin genes were associated with a poor prognosis in patients with tyrosine kinase pathway mutations, suggesting synergic cooperation between these events. These data suggest that diverse cooperating mutations may influence CBF-AML pathophysiology as well as clinical behavior and point to potential unique pathogenesis of t(8;21) vs inv(16) AML.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Duployez, Nicolas', 'Marceau-Renaut, Alice', 'Boissel, Nicolas', 'Petit, Arnaud', 'Bucci, Maxime', 'Geffroy, Sandrine', 'Lapillonne, Helene', 'Renneville, Aline', 'Ragu, Christine', 'Figeac, Martin', 'Celli-Lebras, Karine', 'Lacombe, Catherine', 'Micol, Jean-Baptiste', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Cornillet, Pascale', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Leverger, Guy', 'Jourdan, Eric', 'Preudhomme, Claude']","['Duployez N', 'Marceau-Renaut A', 'Boissel N', 'Petit A', 'Bucci M', 'Geffroy S', 'Lapillonne H', 'Renneville A', 'Ragu C', 'Figeac M', 'Celli-Lebras K', 'Lacombe C', 'Micol JB', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Cornillet P', 'Ifrah N', 'Dombret H', 'Leverger G', 'Jourdan E', 'Preudhomme C']","['Biology and Pathology Center, Laboratory of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Lille, Lille, France;

Meta-analysis of 18 trials that compared purine analogs, alkylators, alemtuzumab and ibrutinib to chlorambucil demonstrated no OS benefit for therapy without chlorambucil over chlorambucil (pooled HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91-1.08; 4133 patients). PFS was longer with purine analogs compared with chlorambucil with an increased risk of infection. The risk of secondary malignancies was not increased with chlorambucil.

The impact of conditioning intensity in haplo-SCT is unknown. METHODS: We performed a retrospective registry-based study comparing outcomes after T-replete haplo-SCT for patients with acute myeloid (AML) or lymphoid leukemia (ALL) after RIC (n = 271) and MAC (n = 425). Regimens were classified as MAC or RIC based on published criteria. RESULTS: A combination of post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) with one calcineurin inhibitor and mycophenolate mofetil (PT-Cy-based regimen) for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was used in 66 (25%) patients in RIC and 125 (32%) in MAC groups. Patients of RIC group were older and had been transplanted more recently and more frequently for AML with active disease at transplant. Percentage of engraftment (90 vs. 92%; p = 0.58) and day 100 grade II to IV acute GVHD (24 vs. 29%, p = 0.23) were not different between RIC and MAC groups. Multivariable analyses, run separately in AML and ALL, showed a trend toward higher relapse incidence with RIC in comparison to MAC in AML (hazard ratio (HR) 1.34, p = 0.09), and no difference in both AML and ALL in terms of non-relapse mortality (NRM) chronic GVHD and leukemia-free survival. There was no impact of conditioning regimen intensity in overall survival (OS) in AML (HR = 0.97, p = 0.79) but a trend for worse OS with RIC in ALL (HR = 1.44, p = 0.10). The main factor impacting outcomes was disease status at transplantation (HR >/= 1.4, p </= 0.01). GVHD prophylaxis with PT-Cy-based regimen was independently associated with reduced NRM (HR 0.63, p = 0.02) without impact on relapse incidence (HR 0.99, p = 0.94). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that T-replete haplo-SCT with both RIC and MAC, in particular associated with PT-Cy, are valid options in first line treatment of high risk AML or ALL.",,"['Rubio, Marie T', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Piemontese, Simona', 'Polge, Emmanuelle', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea', 'Arcese, William', 'Koc, Yener', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'Gulbas, Zafer', 'Wu, Depei', 'Santarone, Stella', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Afanasyev, Boris', 'Schmid, Christoph', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Rubio MT', 'Savani BN', 'Labopin M', 'Piemontese S', 'Polge E', 'Ciceri F', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Arcese W', 'Koc Y', 'Beelen D', 'Gulbas Z', 'Wu D', 'Santarone S', 'Tischer J', 'Afanasyev B', 'Schmid C', 'Giebel S', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']","[""Service d'Hematologie et de Therapie cellulaire, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France. mt_rubio@hotmail.com."", 'INSERM UMR 938, Paris, France. mt_rubio@hotmail.com.', 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France. mt_rubio@hotmail.com.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of EBMT, Paris, France. mt_rubio@hotmail.com.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of EBMT, Paris, France.', 'Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', ""Service d'Hematologie et de Therapie cellulaire, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France."", 'INSERM UMR 938, Paris, France.', 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of EBMT, Paris, France.', 'EBMT Paris study office/CEREST-TC, Paris, France.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of EBMT, Paris, France.', 'Ospedale San Raffaele s.r.l., Ematologia, Milan, Italy.', ""Service d'Hematologie et de Therapie cellulaire, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France."", 'INSERM UMR 938, Paris, France.', 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of EBMT, Paris, France.', 'EBMT Paris study office/CEREST-TC, Paris, France.', 'Ospedale San Raffaele s.r.l., Ematologia, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Haematology II, Ospedale San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Rome Transplant Network, Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Medical Park Hospitals, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital, Essen, Germany.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Department, Anadolu Medical Center Hospital, Kocaeli, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Ospedale Civile BMT Center, Pescara, Italy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Hospital of Munich-Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'SPb State I.

Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) carries a poor prognosis and is specifically treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Interestingly, AID has been shown to be aberrantly expressed and functional in Ph+ ALL and is thought to contribute to genetic instability. We hypothesized that AID might be detectable in routinely processed bone marrow biopsies by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and assist in identifying Ph+ ALL. We found that AID was expressed in 26 (70%) of 37 cases of Ph+ ALL but only 1 (2.9%) of 38 cases of Ph- ALL cases. There was a significant difference in AID expression between these 2 ALL groups (P < .001, Fisher exact test). The expression of AID was confirmed by RT-PCR (reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) and correlated with IHC scoring. AID protein is expressed in a large proportion of Ph+ ALL cases at levels detectable by IHC in clinical samples and might be useful to rapidly identify cases likely to have a BCR/ABL1 fusion.",['Copyright (c) 2016.

Prior studies have suggested that single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with genes related to the immune system, and particularly the maternal inflammatory response, may be associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with spontaneous preterm birth <37 weeks within a cohort of African-American women. STUDY DESIGN: This is a secondary analysis of a randomized trial that evaluated periodontal disease and preterm birth. Women were enrolled between 6 and 20 weeks' gestation at 3 prenatal care clinics between 2004 and 2007. Maternal DNA samples were collected and analyzed using a custom 1536 single-nucleotide polymorphismgenotyping array designed to assess genes involved in inflammation. Women were included in this study if they self-identified as African American. We excluded women with a multiple gestation or an indicated preterm delivery. We performed allele- and genotype-based analyses to evaluate the association between spontaneous preterm birth and tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We used a logistic regression to adjust for prior preterm birth in our genotype-based analysis. In a subgroup analysis, we compared women who delivered at <34 weeks' gestation to women who delivered at term. Within the microarray, we identified ancestry informative markers and compared global ancestry estimates among women who delivered preterm with those who delivered at term. RESULTS: Of the 833 African-American women in the study with genotype data, 77 women (9.2%) had a spontaneous preterm birth, whereas 756 women delivered at term. In an allele-based analysis, 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms related to the genes for protein kinase C-alpha (PRKCA) were associated with increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth <37 weeks, whereas a single single-nucleotide polymorphism related to fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1) was associated with spontaneous preterm birth <34 weeks. A genotype-based analysis revealed similar associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms related to the PRKCA genes and spontaneous premature delivery. Additionally, single-nucleotide polymorphisms related to matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP2), and interleukin 16 (IL16) genes were associated with spontaneous preterm birth <37 weeks in genotype-based analysis. Genetic variants related to MMP2, matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor antisense RNA 1 (LIFR-AS1) genes were associated with higher rates of preterm birth <34 weeks. Ancestry estimates were similar between the women who had a spontaneous preterm birth and those who delivered at term. CONCLUSION: We identified tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms related to 7 genes that are critical to inflammation, extracellular remodeling, and cell signaling that were associated with spontaneous preterm birth in African-American women. Specifically, we found a strong association with the PRKCA gene. Genetic variation in these regions of the genome may be important in the pathogenesis of preterm birth. Our results should be considered in the design of future genomic studies in prematurity.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Inhibitors of PARP have shown activity in solid tumors with defects in homologous recombination (HR). This study was performed to assess MPN sensitivity to PARP inhibitors ex vivo EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: HR pathway integrity in circulating myeloid cells was evaluated by assessing the formation of RAD51 foci after treatment with ionizing radiation or PARP inhibitors. Sensitivity of MPN erythroid and myeloid progenitors to PARP inhibitors was evaluated using colony formation assays. RESULTS: Six of 14 MPN primary samples had reduced formation of RAD51 foci after exposure to ionizing radiation, suggesting impaired HR. This phenotype was not associated with a specific MPN subtype, JAK2 mutation status, or karyotype. MPN samples showed increased sensitivity to the PARP inhibitors veliparib and olaparib compared with normal myeloid progenitors. This hypersensitivity, which was most pronounced in samples deficient in DNA damage-induced RAD51 foci, was observed predominantly in samples from patients with diagnoses of chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or unspecified myelodysplastic/MPN overlap syndromes. CONCLUSIONS: Like other neoplasms with HR defects, MPNs exhibit PARP inhibitor hypersensitivity compared with normal marrow. These results suggest that further preclinical and possibly clinical study of PARP inhibitors in MPNs is warranted. Clin Cancer Res; 22(15); 3894-902.

Secondary cancers are not related to the primary tumor, and may develop months or years after cancer treatment: they are usually a result of the first cancer therapy. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may increase the risk of second cancers, such as skin tumors (basal or squamous cell carcinoma) or acute leukemia. METHODS: A patient with B-lymphoma and a patient with multiple myeloma, previously treated for breast cancer, are presented. RESULTS: We report the cases of 2 patients treated with adjuvant therapy for breast cancer who developed secondary bone marrow malignancies 15 years after primary treatment. CONCLUSIONS: By literature review, these 2 cases do not support the relationship between primary tumor treatment and secondary cancer, but strongly suggest the need for histologic samples when bone metastasis occurred after years from diagnosis of breast cancer.

METHODS: This was a retrospective case report. RESULTS: A 24-year-old man with T-cell ALL and 2-month history of papilledema presented to our department with reduction of visual acuity in the left eye. Visual acuity was 20/60 in the right eye and hand movements in the left eye. Fundus examination revealed grade 3 papilledema, bilateral peripapillary leukemic infiltration, and intraretinal hemorrhages. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging did not show any sign of cranial mass or optic nerve involvement. Pulse steroid therapy and oral acetazolamide was started. At day 18, visual acuity improved to 20/40 in the right eye and 20/60 in the left eye, while papilledema improved to grade 1 and hemorrhages regressed. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, there is no other report of peripapillary leukemic infiltration in the absence of retrobulbar optic nerve involvement. We suspect that papilledema might have facilitated peripapillary retinal infiltration due to altered vascular permeability.

The combination of different agents is particularly helpful in patients with multiple cancer diagnoses, while data on cross-toxicity are frequently missing, as for imatinib and cetuximab plus platinum drugs. METHODS: We present the case of a 76-year-old man with advanced laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Combined treatment with imatinib mesylate and cetuximab plus carboplatin was well-tolerated by the patient, who did not develop neutropenia. By an interdisciplinary approach with hematology specialists, the anticipated neutropenia was managed by the temporary interruption of imatinib treatment when the white blood cell (WBC) count nadir was expected to occur. RESULTS: Although treatment with imatinib, carboplatin, and cetuximab can be associated with hematologic toxicities, a combination regimen based on the concomitant administration of these 3 drugs and on the discontinuation of imatinib at the predicted nadir of WBC count was feasible and well-tolerated in a patient with concomitant CML and locally advanced laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.

E. longifolia, is one of the well-known folk medicines for aphrodisiac effects as well as intermittent fever (malaria) in Asia. Decoctions of E. longifolia leaves are used for washing itches, while its fruits are used in curing dysentery. Its bark is mostly used as a vermifuge, while the taproots are used to treat high blood pressure, and the root bark is used for the treatment of diarrhea and fever. Mostly, the roots extract of E. longifolia are used as folk medicine for sexual dysfunction, aging, malaria, cancer, diabetes, anxiety, aches, constipation, exercise recovery, fever, increased energy, increased strength, leukemia, osteoporosis, stress, syphilis and glandular swelling. The roots are also used as an aphrodisiac, antibiotic, appetite stimulant and health supplement. The plant is reported to be rich in various classes of bioactive compounds such as quassinoids, canthin-6-one alkaloids, beta-carboline alkaloids, triterpene tirucallane type, squalene derivatives and biphenyl neolignan, eurycolactone, laurycolactone, and eurycomalactone, and bioactive steroids. Among these phytoconstituents, quassinoids account for a major portion of the E. longifolia root phytochemicals. An acute toxicity study has found that the oral Lethal Dose 50 (LD50) of the alcoholic extract of E. longifolia in mice is between 1500-2000 mg/kg, while the oral LD50 of the aqueous extract form is more than 3000 mg/kg. Liver and renal function tests showed no adverse changes at normal daily dose and chronic use of E. longifolia. Based on established literature on health benefits of E. longifolia, it is important to focus attention on its more active constituents and the constituents' identification, determination, further development and most importantly, the standardization.

This is despite the routine use of prophylactic platelet transfusions to prevent bleeding once the platelet count falls below a certain threshold. Platelet transfusions are not without risk and adverse events may be life-threatening. A possible adjunct to prophylactic platelet transfusions is the use of antifibrinolytics, specifically the lysine analogues tranexamic acid (TXA) and epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA). This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2013. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and safety of antifibrinolytics (lysine analogues) in preventing bleeding in people with haematological disorders. SEARCH METHODS: We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1937), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1950) and ongoing trial databases to 07 March 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs involving participants with haematological disorders, who would routinely require prophylactic platelet transfusions to prevent bleeding. We only included trials involving the use of the lysine analogues TXA and EACA. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened all electronically-derived citations and abstracts of papers, identified by the review search strategy, for relevancy. Two review authors independently assessed the full text of all potentially relevant trials for eligibility, completed the data extraction and assessed the studies for risk of bias using The Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool. We requested missing data from one author but the data were no longer available. The outcomes are reported narratively: we performed no meta-analyses because of the heterogeneity of the available data. MAIN RESULTS: We identified three new studies in this update of the review. In total seven studies were eligible for inclusion, three were ongoing RCTs and four were completed studies. The four completed studies were included in the original review and the three ongoing studies were included in this update. We did not identify any RCTs that compared TXA with EACA.Of the four completed studies, one cross-over TXA study (eight participants) was excluded from the outcome analysis because it had very flawed study methodology. Data from the other three studies were all at unclear risk of bias due to lack of reporting of study methodology.Three studies (two TXA (12 to 56 participants), one EACA (18 participants) reported in four articles (published 1983 to 1995) were included in the narrative review. All three studies compared the drug with placebo. All three studies included adults with acute leukaemia receiving chemotherapy. One study (12 participants) only included participants with acute promyelocytic leukaemia. None of the studies included children. One of the three studies reported funding sources and this study was funded by a charity.We are uncertain whether antifibrinolytics reduce the risk of bleeding (three studies; 86 participants; very low-quality evidence). Only one study reported the number of bleeding events per participant and there was no difference in the number of bleeding events seen during induction or consolidation chemotherapy between TXA and placebo (induction; 38 participants; mean difference (MD) 1.70 bleeding events, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.37 to 3.77: consolidation; 18 participants; MD -1.50 bleeding events, 95% CI -3.25 to 0.25; very low-quality evidence). The two other studies suggested bleeding was reduced in the antifibrinolytic study arm, but this was statistically significant in only one of these two studies.Two studies reported thromboembolism and no events occurred (68 participants, very low-quality evidence).All three studies reported a reduction in platelet transfusion usage (three studies, 86 participants; very low-quality evidence), but this was reported in different ways and no meta-analysis could be performed. No trials reported the number of platelet transfusions per participant. Only one study reported the number of platelet components per participant and there was a reduction in the number of platelet components per participant during consolidation chemotherapy but not during induction chemotherapy (consolidation; 18 participants; MD -5.60 platelet units, 95% CI -9.02 to -2.18: induction; 38 participants, MD -1.00 platelet units, 95% CI -9.11 to 7.11; very low-quality evidence).Only one study reported adverse events of TXA as an outcome measure and none occurred. One study stated side effects of EACA were minimal but no further information was provided (two studies, 74 participants, very low-quality evidence).None of the studies reported on the following pre-specified outcomes: overall mortality, adverse events of transfusion, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or quality of life (QoL). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the evidence available for the use of antifibrinolytics in haematology patients is very limited. The trials were too small to assess whether or not antifibrinolytics decrease bleeding. No trials reported the number of platelet transfusions per participant. The trials were too small to assess whether or not antifibrinolytics increased the risk of thromboembolic events or other adverse events. There are three ongoing RCTs (1276 participants) due to be completed in 2017 and 2020.",,"['Estcourt, Lise J', 'Desborough, Michael', 'Brunskill, Susan J', 'Doree, Carolyn', 'Hopewell, Sally', 'Murphy, Michael F', 'Stanworth, Simon J']","['Estcourt LJ', 'Desborough M', 'Brunskill SJ', 'Doree C', 'Hopewell S', 'Murphy MF', 'Stanworth SJ']","['Haematology/Transfusion Medicine, NHS Blood and Transplant, Level 2, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headington, Oxford, UK, OX3 9BQ.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20160315,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,"['0 (Antifibrinolytic Agents)', '6T84R30KC1 (Tranexamic Acid)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)', 'U6F3787206 (Aminocaproic Acid)']",IM,"['Aminocaproic Acid/*therapeutic use', 'Antifibrinolytic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion/statistics & numerical data', 'Hematologic Diseases/*complications/drug therapy', 'Hemorrhage/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Lysine/analogs & derivatives', 'Platelet Transfusion/adverse effects', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology/therapy', 'Thromboembolism', 'Tranexamic Acid/*therapeutic use']",2016/03/16 06:00,2016/07/07 06:00,['2016/03/16 06:00'],"['2016/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD009733.pub3 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2016 Mar 15;3:CD009733. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD009733.pub3.,10.1002/14651858.CD009733.pub3 [doi],,,PMC4838155,,,,,,"['13/89/09/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom', 'SRP/13/89/09/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom']",,['EMS67897'],,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2013;(7):CD009733.

Statistical analysis using Pearson's chi tests, independent samples t-test, and odds ratios were used to assess potential risk factors for thrombosis. Neither insertion site (subclavian vein or otherwise), left- vs. right-sided insertion, nor catheter type were significant risk factors for thrombosis. There were no thrombotic events reported at the superior vena cava (SVC)-right atrium junction and no significant differences in thrombotic risk with initial tip placement in the SVC-right atrium junction vs. the SVC, right atrium, or inferior vena cava.

A newly established signaling pathway-Hippo/Yes-associated protein (YAP) pathway plays a critical role in the proliferation and apoptosis processes. However, studies focusing on Hippo/YAP pathway and endometriosis are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to explore the function of the Hippo/YAP pathway in endometriosis. SETTING AND DESIGN: The expression of YAP was first investigated in endometrium of women with or without endometriosis. The role of YAP in cell proliferation and apoptosis is identified by transfection of endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) in vitro, subsequent Verteporfin treatments in eutopic ESCs in vitro, and endometriosis animal model of nude mice in vivo. RESULTS: Our results revealed that increased expression of YAP and decreased expression of p-YAP in ectopic and eutopic endometrium compared with normal endometrium. YAP knockdown in eutopic ESCs decreased cell proliferation and enhanced cell apoptosis companied with decreased expression of TEAD1, CTGF, and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia (BCL)-2; whereas overexpression of YAP resulted in increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis of normal ESCs with increased expression of TEAD1, CTGF, and BCL-2. By chromatin immunoprecipitation qPCR CTGF and BCL-2 were identified as directly downstream target genes of YAP-TEAD1 active complex. Eutopic ESCs treated with Verteporfin revealed decreased proliferation and enhanced apoptosis whereas in endometriosis animal models of nude mice treated with Verteporfin, the size of endometriotic lesions was significantly reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the Hippo/YAP-signaling pathway plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis and should present a novel therapeutic method against endometriosis.",,"['Song, Yong', 'Fu, Jing', 'Zhou, Min', 'Xiao, Li', 'Feng, Xue', 'Chen, Hengxi', 'Huang, Wei']","['Song Y', 'Fu J', 'Zhou M', 'Xiao L', 'Feng X', 'Chen H', 'Huang W']","[""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu Sichuan 610041, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu Sichuan 610041, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu Sichuan 610041, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu Sichuan 610041, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu Sichuan 610041, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu Sichuan 610041, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu Sichuan 610041, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160315,United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-yes)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (YES1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Endometriosis/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Endometrium/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hippo Signaling Pathway', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-yes/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'Young Adult']",2016/03/16 06:00,2017/06/09 06:00,['2016/03/16 06:00'],"['2016/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1210/jc.2016-1120 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2016 Apr;101(4):1552-61. doi: 10.1210/jc.2016-1120.

Therefore, drugs with mechanisms resistant or alternative to such metabolic changes have been desired for the treatment of resistant disease. We generated azacitidine-resistant cells derived from SKM-1 and MOLM-13 leukemia cell lines in vitro, analyzed the mechanisms, and examined the impact on the efficacy of other antimetabolic drugs. It appeared that the cell growth-inhibitory effect of azacitidine, expression levels of uridine-cytidine kinase 2, and the concentrations of azacitidine triphosphate were remarkably decreased in the resistant cells compared with those in parent cells. These results were consistent with previous observations that azacitidine resistance is derived from metabolic changes. Cross-resistance of greater than 10-fold (shift in IC50 value) was observed in azacitidine-resistant cells for decitabine and for cytarabine, but not for gemcitabine or the inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitors FF-10501 and mycophenolate mofetil (cross-resistance to 5-fluorouracil was cell line dependent). The IMPDH inhibitors maintained their cell growth-inhibitory activities in the azacitidine-resistant cell lines, in which the levels of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (which converts FF-10501 to its active form, FF-10501 ribosylmonophosphate [FF-10501RMP]), FF-10501RMP, and the target enzyme, IMPDH, were equivalent to those in the parent cell lines.

Although they constitute a smaller percentage of childhood illnesses in developing countries, compared with infectious diseases, the burden of cancer is still a tremendous problem on patients, families, the healthcare system, and the society. Data on the burden of childhood cancers across different regions is important, as there may be variations in incidences in different locations even within the same country. It will assist government agencies in better healthcare planning. METHODS: An eight year retrospective analysis of all cancers diagnosed in children below the age of 18 years at the study centre between January 2007 and December 2014 was carried out. Case folders of all children diagnosed with malignancies within the study period were retrieved and analyzed with respect to age, gender, morphological or histological type of cancer, treatment modality, and outcome. RESULTS: Eighty-four (84) children were diagnosed with various malignancies during the study period. Fourty-eight 48 (57.1%) were male and 36 (42.9%) were female giving a male to female ratio of 1.3:1. There were 27 cases (32.1%) of cancers recorded in children aged below 5 years and 35 cases (41.7%) were diagnosed in children between 5 to 10 years. Lymphomas were the most prevalent malignancies encountered accounting for 32 cases (38.1%). Burkitt's lymphoma constituted 22 (68.8%) of all lymphoma cases. The distribution of the four foremost malignancies recorded were as follows: Burkitt's lymphoma (22 cases; 26.2%), Nephroblastoma (12 cases; 14.3%), Rhabdomyosarcoma (6 cases; 7.1%) and 5 cases (6.0%) each Hodgkin's and non-hodgkin's lymphoma. Other malignancies included 4 cases (4.8%) each of acute leukaemia, neuroblastoma and retinoblastoma. There were three cases (3.6%) each of hepatoblastoma, and osteosarcoma among others. The cancer cure rate was very low 2.4%, losses to follow-up was 38.1% and 21.4% of patients died in the course of therapy either from advanced disease, complications of chemotherapy or late presentation. CONCLUSION: The distribution of the childhood malignancies in our environment shows similarity with reports from the same region and variation from other regions. The general outcome is very poor with a high percentage of discharge against medical advice and loss to follow up.",,"['Utuk, Eno-Obong Edet', 'Ikpeme, Enobong Emmanuel']","['Utuk EO', 'Ikpeme EE']","['Department of Paediatrics, University of Uyo Teaching Hospital, Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria.', 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Uyo Teaching Hospital, Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151202,Uganda,Pan Afr Med J,The Pan African medical journal,101517926,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Neoplasms/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', 'Nigeria/epidemiology', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2015/01/01 00:00,2017/02/28 06:00,['2016/03/16 06:00'],"['2015/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.11604/pamj.2015.22.325.6990 [doi]', 'PAMJ-22-325 [pii]']",epublish,Pan Afr Med J. 2015 Dec 2;22:325. doi: 10.11604/pamj.2015.22.325.6990. eCollection 2015.,10.11604/pamj.2015.22.325.6990 [doi],,,PMC4769810,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood', 'Nigeria', 'Uyo', 'cancers', 'outcome', 'spectrum']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Prospective clinical trials evaluating the impact on outcome of new drugs such as proteasome inhibitors or immunomodulating agents are limited since they are not able to reflect the clinical routine and available retrospective data are not detailed enough to directly evaluate the value of new drugs. To address these information gaps, we performed a retrospective real-life analysis. We retrospectively assessed 949 patients treated for multiple myeloma or plasma cell leukemia at three Italian cancer centers in the years 1979-2014. Clinical features at the time of diagnosis were consistent with what was observed in clinical routine. A total of 39% of patients underwent high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). The median overall survival (OS) of the whole group was 5.4 years and ranged from 3.4 years for patients who did not receive at least one of the new drugs compared to 5.9 years in the other patients (p<0.001). The improvement in OS due to administration of new drugs was also observed among different prognostic sub-groups such as age, Durie and Salmon stage, international staging system and renal impairment. Availability of new drugs significantly improved survival of patients who underwent ASCT and also those who did not. In conclusion, we provided evidence that the advent of the new drugs drastically improved the outcome of patients with MM, also in cases with poor risk at the time of diagnosis. ASCT is still of major importance in the treatment of this disease. Nevertheless, MM remains incurable and new therapeutic approaches are warranted.","['Copyright(c) 2016 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']","['Mian, Michael', 'Tinelli, Martina', 'DE March, Elena', 'Turri, Gloria', 'Meneghini, Vittorio', 'Pescosta, Norbert', 'Berno, Tamara', 'Marabese, Alessandra', 'Mondello, Patrizia', 'Patriarca, Francesca', 'Pizzolo, Giovanni', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Cortelazzo, Sergio', 'Zambello, Renato']","['Mian M', 'Tinelli M', 'DE March E', 'Turri G', 'Meneghini V', 'Pescosta N', 'Berno T', 'Marabese A', 'Mondello P', 'Patriarca F', 'Pizzolo G', 'Semenzato G', 'Cortelazzo S', 'Zambello R']","['Department of Hematology & Center of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Ospedale di Bolzano, Bolzano, Italy Department of Internal Medicine V (Haematology and Oncology), Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria m.mian@med-sci.eu.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology, University Hospital of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology, University Hospital of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology & Center of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Ospedale di Bolzano, Bolzano, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology & Center of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Ospedale di Bolzano, Bolzano, Italy.', 'Department of Human Pathology, University of Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology, University Hospital of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Unit of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Clinical Institute Humanitas-Gavazzeni, Bergamo, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Bortezomib/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thalidomide/*administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2016/03/16 06:00,2016/11/15 06:00,['2016/03/16 06:00'],"['2016/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/15 06:00 [medline]']",['36/3/1059 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2016 Mar;36(3):1059-65.,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Multiple myeloma', 'bortezomib', 'lenalidomide', 'thalidomide']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The risk of leukemia among the survivors increased remarkably in the early period after the bombings, especially among children. Increased risks of solid cancers have been evident since around 10 years after the bombings and are still present today. The LSS has clarified the dose-response relationships of radiation exposure and risk of various cancers, taking into account important risk modifiers such as sex, age at exposure, and attained age. Confounding by conventional risk factors including lifestyle differences is not considered substantial because people were non-selectively exposed to the atomic bomb radiation. Uncertainty in risk estimates at low-dose levels is thought to be derived from various sources, including different estimates of risk at background levels, uncertainty in dose estimates, residual confounding and interaction, strong risk factors, and exposure to residual radiation and/or medical radiation. The risk of cancer in subjects exposed IN UTERO : is similar to that in LSS subjects who were exposed in childhood. Regarding hereditary effects of radiation exposure, no increased risk of cancers associated with parental exposure to radiation have been observed in the F1 cohort to date. In addition to biological and pathogenetic interpretations of the present results, epidemiological investigations using advanced technology should be used to further analyze these cohorts.","['(c) The Author 2016.
