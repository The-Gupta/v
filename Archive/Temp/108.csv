Simple-refractory and complex autoimmunity indicate the need of treatment. Here, we review the epidemiology and the biological mechanisms that account for CLL-associated autoimmune disorders and discuss their prognostic relevance and the indication of treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Autoimmune disorders can complicate CLL at any stage and even occur in the preleukemic monoclonal B lymphocytosis. CLL cells can act as antigen-presenting cells, possibly inducing the formation of autoreactive T helper cells (through the production of B-cell activator factor and a proliferation-inducing ligand) and nonfunctional T regulatory cells (via CD27-CD70 interaction). Further, nonmalignant lymphocytes may stimulate via CD154-mediated mechanism both tumor growth and the development of autoimmunity, especially after fludarabine-based regimens of therapy. CLL cells tend to produce monoclonal polyreactive autoantibodies suggesting that autoantigen stimulation via B-cell receptor signaling may affect the natural history of CLL. Though the results of multivariate analysis do not allow to separate autoimmune disorders developing in CLL from conventional prognostic factors, the pathogenetic intertwining between autoimmunity and malignant transformation indicates the importance of defining whether the occurrence of autoimmunity in CLL might be considered an autonomous prognostic indicator that influences treatment decisions. SUMMARY: Simple-refractory and complex autoimmunity are independent indicators of therapy for CLL. Further, epidemiological and biological studies will help clarifying the prognostic and possibly also the pathogenetic significance of simple autoimmunity.","['Strati, Paolo', 'Caligaris-Cappio, Federico']","['Strati P', 'Caligaris-Cappio F']","['Department of Oncology, Scientific Institute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Autoimmune Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymphocytosis/immunology', 'Prognosis']",2011/06/18 06:00,2013/09/28 06:00,['2011/06/18 06:00'],"['2011/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCO.0b013e328348c683 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2011 Sep;23(5):455-60. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0b013e328348c683.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New agents and new directions.,510-7,,"Despite recent advances in the field, the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains challenging and difficult. Although chemotherapeutic agents induce remissions in a large number of patients, many of them eventually relapse and die. A major goal for the development of new approaches for the treatment of AML is to enhance the antileukemic effects of standard chemotherapeutics and to design effective combinations targeting non-overlapping cellular pathways. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway plays a critical role in survival and growth of malignant cells and its targeting has been the focus of extensive work and research efforts over the last two decades. It now appears possible that a major limitation of the first generation of mTOR inhibitors can be overcome by a new class of catalytic inhibitors of mTOR. There is emerging evidence that such compounds target both TORC1 and TORC2 and elicit much more potent responses against early leukemic precursors in vitro. In addition, recent studies have shown that combinations of such agents with cytarabine result in enhanced antileukemic responses in vitro, raising the prospect and potential of use of these agents in combination regimens for the treatment of AML.","['Altman, Jessica K', 'Sassano, Antonella', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Altman JK', 'Sassano A', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

Recently, the activation of the advanced glycation endproducts receptor (RAGE) has been shown to promote VSMC proliferation and resistance to apoptosis in VRD in a signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3-dependant manner. Interestingly, we previously described in both cancer and VRD that the sustainability of this proproliferative and antiapoptotic phenotype requires activation of the transcription factor NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells). In cancer, NFAT activation is dependent of the oncoprotein provirus integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus (Pim1), which is regulated by STAT3 and activated in VRD. Therefore, we hypothesized that RAGE/STAT3 activation in VSMC activates Pim1, promoting NFAT and thus VSMC proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. Methods/Results- In vitro, freshly isolated human carotid VSMCs exposed to RAGE activator Nepsilon-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) for 48 hours had (1) activated STAT3 (increased P-STAT3/STAT3 ratio and P-STAT3 nuclear translocation); (2) increased STAT3-dependent Pim1 expression resulting in NFATc1 activation; and (3) increased Pim1/NFAT-dependent VSMC proliferation (PCNA, Ki67) and resistance to mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis (TMRM, Annexin V, TUNEL). Similarly to RAGE inhibition (small interfering RNA [siRNA]), Pim1, STAT3 and NFATc1 inhibition (siRNA) reversed these abnormalities in human carotid VSMC. Moreover, carotid artery VSMCs isolated from Pim1 knockout mice were resistant to CML-induced VSMC proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. In vivo, RAGE inhibition decreases STAT3/Pim1/NFAT activation, reversing vascular remodeling in the rat carotid artery-injured model. CONCLUSIONS: RAGE activation accounts for many features of VRD including VSMC proliferation and resistance to apoptosis by the activation of STAT3/Pim1/NFAT axis. Molecules aimed to inhibit RAGE could be of a great therapeutic interest for the treatment of VRD.","['Meloche, Jolyane', 'Paulin, Roxane', 'Courboulin, Audrey', 'Lambert, Caroline', 'Barrier, Marjorie', 'Bonnet, Pierre', 'Bisserier, Malik', 'Roy, Melanie', 'Sussman, Mark A', 'Agharazii, Mohsen', 'Bonnet, Sebastien']","['Meloche J', 'Paulin R', 'Courboulin A', 'Lambert C', 'Barrier M', 'Bonnet P', 'Bisserier M', 'Roy M', 'Sussman MA', 'Agharazii M', 'Bonnet S']","['Department of Medicine, Universite Laval, Quebec City, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",9505803,"['0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '70YDX3Z2O7 (N(6)-carboxymethyllysine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Pim1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Pim1 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Lysine/analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/*pathology', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism']",2011/06/18 06:00,2011/10/14 06:00,['2011/06/18 06:00'],"['2011/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['ATVBAHA.111.230573 [pii]', '10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.230573 [doi]']",ppublish,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2011 Sep;31(9):2114-24. doi: 10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.230573.

In both instances, neoplastic mast cells (MCs) harbor D816V-mutated KIT, suggesting that additional oncogenic mechanisms are involved in malignant transformation. We here describe that Lyn and Btk are phosphorylated in a KIT-independent manner in neoplastic MCs in advanced SM and in the MC leukemia cell line HMC-1. Lyn and Btk activation was not only detected in KIT D816V-positive HMC-1.2 cells, but also in the KIT D816V-negative HMC-1.1 subclone. Moreover, KIT D816V did not induce Lyn/Btk activation in Ba/F3 cells, and deactivation of KIT D816V by midostaurin did not alter Lyn/Btk activation. siRNAs against Btk and Lyn were found to block survival in neoplastic MCs and to cooperate with midostaurin in producing growth inhibition. Growth inhibitory effects were also obtained with 2 targeted drugs, dasatinib which blocks KIT, Lyn, and Btk activation in MCs, and bosutinib, a drug that deactivates Lyn and Btk without blocking KIT activity. Together, KIT-independent signaling via Lyn/Btk contributes to growth of neoplastic MCs in advanced SM. Dasatinib and bosutinib disrupt Lyn/Btk-driven oncogenic signaling in neoplastic MC, which may have clinical implications and explain synergistic drug interactions.","['Gleixner, Karoline V', 'Mayerhofer, Matthias', 'Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine', 'Hormann, Gregor', 'Rix, Uwe', 'Bennett, Keiryn L', 'Hadzijusufovic, Emir', 'Meyer, Renata A', 'Pickl, Winfried F', 'Gotlib, Jason', 'Horny, Hans-Peter', 'Reiter, Andreas', 'Mitterbauer-Hohendanner, Gerlinde', 'Superti-Furga, Giulio', 'Valent, Peter']","['Gleixner KV', 'Mayerhofer M', 'Cerny-Reiterer S', 'Hormann G', 'Rix U', 'Bennett KL', 'Hadzijusufovic E', 'Meyer RA', 'Pickl WF', 'Gotlib J', 'Horny HP', 'Reiter A', 'Mitterbauer-Hohendanner G', 'Superti-Furga G', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mast Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nitriles/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Quinolines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'src-Family Kinases/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/06/18 06:00,2011/10/13 06:00,['2011/06/18 06:00'],"['2011/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)41103-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-06-289959 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Aug 18;118(7):1885-98. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-06-289959.

A recent investigation by the Southwest Oncology Group found that the only MK(+) patients alive and disease free > 6 years from diagnosis received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). To expand this observation, we retrospectively analyzed 432 patients treated with HCT at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 14% of whom were MK(+). The 4-year overall survival of patients after HCT was 25% for MK(+) AML and 56% for MK(-) AML (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.29, P < .0001). Among the MK(+) patients, complex karyotype was associated with a significantly worse outcome than patients with noncomplex karyotype (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.70, P = .03). Thus, although the prognosis of MK(+) patients remains worse than that for MK(-) patients in the transplantation setting, HCT appears to improve the overall outcome of MK(+) patients, especially patients without a complex karyotype. However, the 28% of MK(+) patients > 60 years had only a 6% 4-year survival rate after HCT, stressing the need for new approaches in these patients.","['Fang, Min', 'Storer, Barry', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Othus, Megan', 'Zhang, Lisa', 'Sandmaier, Brenda M', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R']","['Fang M', 'Storer B', 'Estey E', 'Othus M', 'Zhang L', 'Sandmaier BM', 'Appelbaum FR']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monosomy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2011/06/18 06:00,2011/10/19 06:00,['2011/06/18 06:00'],"['2011/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40779-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-02-339721 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Aug 11;118(6):1490-4. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-02-339721.

Phosphorylation of STAT1 was more robust and persistent than that of STAT3, which may promote apoptosis. C2-2b-2b efficiently depleted lymphoma and myeloma cells from whole human blood but also exhibited some toxicity to B cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells. C2-2b-2b showed superior efficacy compared with nontargeting mAb-IFNalpha, peginterferonalfa-2a, or a combination of hL243 and IFNalpha, using human lymphoma and myeloma xenografts. These results suggest that C2-2b-2b should be useful in the treatment of various hematopoietic malignancies.","['Rossi, Edmund A', 'Rossi, Diane L', 'Cardillo, Thomas M', 'Stein, Rhona', 'Goldenberg, David M', 'Chang, Chien-Hsing']","['Rossi EA', 'Rossi DL', 'Cardillo TM', 'Stein R', 'Goldenberg DM', 'Chang CH']","['IBC Pharmaceuticals Inc, Morris Plains, NJ 07950, USA. erossi@immunomedics.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Recombinant Proteins']",2011/06/18 06:00,2011/10/13 06:00,['2011/06/18 06:00'],"['2011/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)41102-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-03-343145 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Aug 18;118(7):1877-84. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-03-343145.

Sig1R is present in brain, liver, and heart and is overexpressed in cancer cells. Studies using exogenous sigma ligands have shown that Sig1R interacts with a variety of ion channels, but its intrinsic function and mechanism of action remain unclear. The human ether-a-gogo related gene (hERG) encodes a cardiac channel that is also abnormally expressed in many primary human cancers, potentiating tumor progression through the modulation of extracellular matrix adhesive interactions. We show herein that sigma ligands inhibit hERG current density and cell adhesion to fibronectin in K562 myeloid leukemia cells. Heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes demonstrates that Sig1R potentiates hERG current by stimulating channel subunit biosynthesis. Silencing Sig1R in leukemic K562 cells depresses hERG current density and cell adhesion to fibronectin by reducing hERG membrane expression. In K562 cells, Sig1R silencing does not modify hERG mRNA contents but reduces hERG mature form densities. In HEK cells expressing hERG and Sig1R, both proteins co-immunoprecipitate, demonstrating a physical association. Finally, Sig1R expression enhances both channel protein maturation and stability. Altogether, these results demonstrate for the first time that Sig1R controls ion channel expression through the regulation of subunit trafficking activity.","['Crottes, David', 'Martial, Sonia', 'Rapetti-Mauss, Raphael', 'Pisani, Didier F', 'Loriol, Celine', 'Pellissier, Bernard', 'Martin, Patrick', 'Chevet, Eric', 'Borgese, Franck', 'Soriani, Olivier']","['Crottes D', 'Martial S', 'Rapetti-Mauss R', 'Pisani DF', 'Loriol C', 'Pellissier B', 'Martin P', 'Chevet E', 'Borgese F', 'Soriani O']","['CNRS, UMR 6543, Nice 06108 Cedex 2, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ERG1 Potassium Channel)', '0 (Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (KCNH2 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, sigma)', '0 (sigma-1 receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion/genetics', 'ERG1 Potassium Channel', 'Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', 'Fibronectins/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Ion Transport', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Stability', 'Receptors, sigma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Xenopus laevis']",2011/06/18 06:00,2012/05/12 06:00,['2011/06/18 06:00'],"['2011/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)57512-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.226738 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Aug 12;286(32):27947-58. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.226738.

BIC/miR-155 is induced by distinct signaling pathways, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. We have identified two conserved potential interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF)-binding/interferon-stimulated response element motifs in the Bic gene promoter. Two oncogenic IRFs, IRF4 and -7, in addition to some other members of the family, bind to and significantly transactivate the Bic promoter. Correspondingly, the endogenous levels of IRF4 and -7 are correlated with that of the BIC transcript in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed cells. However, RNA interference studies have shown that depletion of IRF4, rather than of IRF7, dramatically decreases the endogenous level of BIC by up to 70% in EBV- or human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV1)-transformed cell lines and results in apoptosis and reduction of proliferation rates that are restored by transient expression of miR-155. Moreover, the endogenous levels of the miR-155 target, SHIP1, are consistently elevated in EBV- and HTLV1-transformed cell lines stably expressing shIRF4. In contrast, transient expression of IRF4 decreases the SHIP1 level in EBV-negative B cells. Furthermore, the level of IRF4 mRNA is significantly correlated with that of BIC in adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATLL) tumors. These results show that IRF4 plays an important role in the regulation of BIC in the context of EBV and HTLV1 infection. Our findings have identified Bic as the first miRNA-encoding gene for IRFs and provide evidence for a novel molecular mechanism underlying the IRF/BIC pathway in viral oncogenesis.","['Wang, Ling', 'Toomey, Ngoc L', 'Diaz, Luis A', 'Walker, Gail', 'Ramos, Juan C', 'Barber, Glen N', 'Ning, Shunbin']","['Wang L', 'Toomey NL', 'Diaz LA', 'Walker G', 'Ramos JC', 'Barber GN', 'Ning S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Viral Oncology Program, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL 33136, USA. sning@med.miami.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-7)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-4)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.56 (Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (INPP5D protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/virology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-7/genetics/metabolism', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Male', '*MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Response Elements', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction']",2011/06/18 06:00,2011/10/05 06:00,['2011/06/18 06:00'],"['2011/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00570-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00570-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2011 Aug;85(16):8328-37. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00570-11.

Its benefits in multiple myeloma (MM) remain unclear. Here we report the inhibitory effects of cladribine on MM cell lines (U266, RPMI8226, MM1.S), and its therapeutic potential in combination with a specific inhibitor of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). METHODS: MTS-based proliferation assays were used to determine cell viability in response to cladribine. Cell cycle progression was examined by flow cytometry analysis. Cells undergoing apoptosis were evaluated with Annexin V staining and a specific ELISA to quantitatively measure cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments. Western blot analyses were performed to determine the protein expression levels and activation. RESULTS: Cladribine inhibited cell proliferation of MM cells in a dose-dependent manner, although the three MM cell lines exhibited a remarkably different responsiveness to cladribine. The IC50 of cladribine for U266, RPMI8226, or MM1.S cells was approximately 2.43, 0.75, or 0.18 mumol/L, respectively. Treatment with cladribine resulted in a significant G1 arrest in U266 and RPMI8226 cells, but only a minor increase in the G1 phase for MM1.S cells. Apoptosis assays with Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining indicated that cladribine induced apoptosis of U266 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained with an apoptotic-ELISA showing that cladribine dramatically promoted MM1.S and RPMA8226 cells undergoing apoptosis. On the molecular level, cladribine induced PARP cleavage and activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3. Meanwhile, treatment with cladribine led to a remarkable reduction of the phosphorylated STAT3 (P-STAT3), but had little effect on STAT3 protein levels. The combinations of cladribine and a specific STAT3 inhibitor as compared to either agent alone significantly induced apoptosis in all three MM cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Cladribine exhibited inhibitory effects on MM cells in vitro. MM1.S is the only cell line showing significant response to the clinically achievable concentrations of cladribine-induced apoptosis and inactivation of STAT3. Our data suggest that MM patients with the features of MM1.S cells may particularly benefit from cladribine monotherapy, whereas cladribine in combination with STAT3 inhibitor exerts a broader therapeutic potential against MM.","['Ma, Jian', 'Wang, Shuiliang', 'Zhao, Ming', 'Deng, Xin-Sheng', 'Lee, Choon-Kee', 'Yu, Xiao-Dan', 'Liu, Bolin']","['Ma J', 'Wang S', 'Zhao M', 'Deng XS', 'Lee CK', 'Yu XD', 'Liu B']","['International Medical Centre of PLA General Hospital, Beijing, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Aminosalicylic Acids)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (NSC 74859)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Aminosalicylic Acids/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis']",2011/06/18 06:00,2011/11/01 06:00,['2011/06/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-11-255 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-11-255 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2011 Jun 16;11:255. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-11-255.,20110616,PMC3141773,,,,['(c) 2011 Ma et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over-expression of the ABC drug transporter proteins P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) is a major obstacle for chemotherapy in many tumour types with Pgp conferring particularly poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Barasertib-hQPA is a highly selective inhibitor of aurora-B kinase that has shown tumouricidal activity against a range tumour cell lines including those of leukaemic AML origin. METHODS: Effect of barasertib-hQPA on the pHH3 biomarker and cell viability was measured in a panel of leukaemic cell lines and 37 primary AML samples by flow cytometry. Pgp status was determined by flow cytometry and BCRP status by flow cytometry and real-time PCR. RESULTS: In this study we report the creation of the cell line OCI-AML3DNR, which over-expresses Pgp but not BCRP or multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), through prolonged treatment of OCI-AML3 cells with daunorubicin. We demonstrate that Pgp (OCI-AML3DNR and KG-1a) and BCRP (OCI-AML6.2) expressing AML cell lines are less sensitive to barasertib-hQPA induced pHH3 inhibition and subsequent loss of viability compared to transporter negative cell lines. We also show that barasertib-hQPA resistance in these cell lines can be reversed using known Pgp and BCRP inhibitors. We report that barasertib-hQPA is not an inhibitor of Pgp or BCRP, but by using 14[C]-barasertib-hQPA that it is effluxed by these transporters. Using phosphoHistone H3 (pHH3) as a biomarker of barasertib-hQPA responsiveness in primary AML blasts we determined that Pgp and BCRP positive primary samples were less sensitive to barasertib-hQPA induced pHH3 inhibition (p = <0.001) than samples without these transporters. However, we demonstrate that IC50 inhibition of pHH3 by barasertib-hQPA was achieved in 94.6% of these samples after 1 hour drug treatment, in contrast to the resistance of the cell lines. CONCLUSION: We conclude that Pgp and BCRP status and pHH3 down-regulation in patients treated with barasertib should be monitored in order to establish whether transporter-mediated efflux is sufficient to adversely impact on the efficacy of the agent.","['Grundy, Martin', 'Seedhouse, Claire', 'Russell, Nigel H', 'Pallis, Monica']","['Grundy M', 'Seedhouse C', 'Russell NH', 'Pallis M']","['Department of Academic Haematology, The University of Nottingham, Clinical Sciences Building, Hucknall Road, Nottingham, NG5 1PB, UK. martin.grundy@nottingham.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0', '(2-((3-((4-((5-(2-((3-fluorophenyl)amino)-2-oxoethyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)amino)quina', 'zolin-7-yl)oxy)propyl)(ethyl)amino)ethyl dihydrogen phosphate)', '0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Organophosphates)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '29P8LWS24N (AZD 1152-HQPA)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase B)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*analysis', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*analysis/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Aurora Kinase B', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/enzymology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Organophosphates/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Quinazolines/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology']",2011/06/18 06:00,2011/11/01 06:00,['2011/06/18 06:00'],"['2011/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-11-254 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-11-254 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2011 Jun 16;11:254. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-11-254.,20110616,PMC3146447,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methotrexate, methotrexate-d3, 7-hydroxymethotrexate and 7-hydroxymethotrexate-d3 were monitored by selected reaction monitoring using the transitions m/z 455.2-->308.2, 458.2-->311.2, 471.2-->324.2 and 474.2-->327.2 for methotrexate, methotrexate-d3, 7-hydroxymethotrexate and 7-hydroxymethotrexate-d3, respectively. RESULTS: The LLOQ was 1 nmol/l for methotrexate and 7-hydroxymethotrexate while the limit of detection was 0.3 nmol/l for both analytes. The new developed method was cross-validated by a fluorescence polarization immunoassay and tested for its clinical feasibility by measuring plasma samples from patients suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Plasma methotrexate concentrations ranged between 66.0 and 954 nmol/l and observed 7-hydroxymethotrexate/methotrexate ratios ranged between 0.1 and 32.4, respectively.

METHODS: Forty-three patients with LBL were retrospectively analysed, of which 30 were T-LBL, and 13 B-LBL. RESULTS: (1) Most patients were young men with a median age of 21, and 63.0% of the T-LBL patients had mediastinal masses. (2) Treatment outcome could be assessed in 37 cases, of which the response rate (RR) was 81.1% and complete remission (CR) rate was 67.6%. The RR and CR rates in patients treated with regimens for ALL (ALL-like group) and those treated with regimens for NHL (NHL-like group) were 94.4%, 68.4% and 83.3%, 52.6%, respectively. (3) The estimated median overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) group were significant longer than those of ALL-like group (P=0.018, P=0.025) and NHL-like group (P=0.016, P=0.011). The OS at 5 years in NHL-like group, ALL-like group and HSCT group were (14.4+/-9.4)%, (20.2+/-12.7)% and (79.5+/-13.1 )%, respectively. CONCLUSION: (1) LBL is more common in young men, with less involvement of peripheral blood. Compared with B-LBL, T-LBL often has a mediastinal mass and serious cavity effusion. (2) Intensive treatment regimens for ALL should be used in LBL. HSCT at CR1 can improve outcome obviously.","['Lu, Bin', 'Li, Qian', 'Zou, De-Hui', 'Zhao, Yao-Zhong', 'Qi, Jun-Yuan', 'Xu, Yan', 'Qui, Lu-Gui']","['Lu B', 'Li Q', 'Zou DH', 'Zhao YZ', 'Qi JY', 'Xu Y', 'Qui LG']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Tianjin, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/07/01 00:00,2009/07/01 00:01,['2011/06/17 06:00'],"['2011/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Jul;30(7):446-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aim of our study was to evaluate promyelocytic leukemia gene expression value as prognostic factor and as a factor predicting response to alkylating agents/antracycline-based first line therapy. One hundred eleven patients affected by locally advanced and metastatic soft tissue sarcoma were selected. PML expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis in pathological samples and in the corresponding normal tissue from each case. PML immunohistochemical results were correlated with prognosis and with radiological response to alkylating agents/antracycline-based first line therapy. PML expression was significantly reduced in synovial sarcomas (P < 0.0001), in myofibroblastic sarcomas (P < 0.0001), angiosarcomas (P < 0.0001), in leiomyosarcomas (P = 0.003), in mixoid liposarcomas (P < 0.0001), and in dedifferentiated liposarcomas (P < 0.0001). No significant difference was found for pleomorphic sarcoma [31.8 (95% CI: 16.7-41.0); P = 0.21]. and pleomorphic liposarcomas (P = 0.51).

Previous work in our laboratory has shown that blocking the RA-dependent increase in pre-beta cell leukemia transcription factors (PBX) mRNA and protein levels in P19 cells prevents endodermal and neuronal differentiation. Dosage-sensitive sex reversal, adrenal hypoplasia critical region, on chromosome X, gene 1 (DAX-1) and steroidogenic factor (SF-1) were found by microarray analysis to be regulated by PBX in P19 cells. To determine the roles of DAX-1 and SF-1 during RA-dependent differentiation, P19 cells that inducibly express either FLAG-DAX-1 or FLAG-SF-1 were prepared. Unexpectedly, overexpression of DAX-1 had no effect on the RA-induced differentiation of P19 cells to either endodermal or neuronal cells. However, SF-1 overexpression prevented the RA-dependent loss of OCT-4, DAX-1 and the increase in COUP-TFI, COUP-TFII, and ETS-1 mRNA levels during the commitment stages of both endodermal and neuronal differentiation. Surprisingly, continued expression of SF-1 for 7 days caused the RA-independent loss of OCT-4 protein and RA-dependent loss of SSEA-1 expression. Despite the loss of well-characterized pluripotency markers, these cells did not terminally differentiate into either endodermal or neuronal cells. Instead, the cells gained the expression of many steroidogenic enzymes with a pattern consistent with adrenal cells. Finally, we found evidence for a feedback loop in which PBX reduces SF-1 mRNA levels while continued SF-1 expression blocks the RA-dependent increase in PBX levels. Taken together, these data demonstrate that SF-1 plays a dynamic role during the differentiation of P19 cells and potentially during early embryogenesis.","['Teets, Bryan W', 'Soprano, Kenneth J', 'Soprano, Dianne Robert']","['Teets BW', 'Soprano KJ', 'Soprano DR']","['Department of Biochemistry, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (DAX-1 Orphan Nuclear Receptor)', '0 (Nr0b1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Steroidogenic Factor 1)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DAX-1 Orphan Nuclear Receptor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Development/drug effects/physiology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Endoderm/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Mice', 'Neurons/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Steroidogenic Factor 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2011/06/17 06:00,2012/03/06 06:00,['2011/06/17 06:00'],"['2011/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.22866 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2012 Apr;227(4):1501-11. doi: 10.1002/jcp.22866.,,PMC3175297,"['R01 DK070650/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK070650-05/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK070650/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS299760'],,"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of any pharmacological intervention for treating DIC in acute or chronic leukemia. SEARCH STRATEGY: The search strategy included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 12), MEDLINE (1950 to 28 October 2010), EMBASE (1980 to 10 October 2010), LILACS (1982 to 19 August 2010) and African Index Medicus (1993 to 19 August 2010). There was no language restriction. We sought additional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Registry Platform and by using the reference lists of primary studies found. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs assessing the effectiveness of interventions for treating disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in patients with acute and chronic leukemia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. MAIN RESULTS: Four RCTs (126 participants) met the inclusion criteria. These trials evaluated the human activated protein C, recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin, tranexamic acid and dermatan sulphate. Included RCTs reported data on mortality and bleeding. The included RCTs were classified as: 1) including patients with or without leukemia, and 2) only including patients with leukemia. However, data were not reported for the leukemia subgroup. We were not able to pool results from studies due to the inconsistency in the measurement and reporting of mortality and bleeding data. The included studies were at high risk of bias. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found four RCTs which reported mortality and bleeding data. It is not possible to determine whether human activated protein C, recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin, tranexamic acid and dermatan sulphate are effective or harmful for patients presenting with DIC related to acute or chronic leukemia. The effects of these interventions need to be tested in sufficiently powered RCTs. Outcome measures should include in-hospital mortality from any cause, overall mortality, incidence of resolution of respiratory failure, renal failure, shock and safety. The definition of bleeding should be standardized in these patients.","['Marti-Carvajal, Arturo J', 'Simancas, Daniel', 'Cardona, Andres Felipe']","['Marti-Carvajal AJ', 'Simancas D', 'Cardona AF']","['Universidad de Carabobo and Iberoamerican Cochrane Network, Valencia, Edo.

Malignant T cells need high levels of nutrients to maintain their proliferation rate. Borrelidin, a small molecule nitrile-containing macrolide, is an inhibitor of bacterial and eukaryal threonyl-tRNA synthetase. Borrelidin-mediated inhibition of aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis, leads to an induction in the levels of uncharged tRNA, nutritional stress and ultimately inhibition of protein synthesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether borrelidin treatment inhibits the proliferation of malignant ALL cell lines, Jurkat and CEM cells, and study the mechanism by which this drug acts. Our results show that borrelidin was able to potently inhibit the proliferation of ALL cell lines with a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 50 ng/ml. Borrelidin showed a greater inhibitory effect on ALL cell lines compared to primary fibroblasts. Flow cytometry and western blot analysis indicated that borrelidin was able to increase the level of apoptosis and cause G(1) arrest in ALL cell lines. Activation of the general control nonderepressible-2 (GCN2) kinase stress responsive pathway and induction of CHOP protein was significantly higher in ALL cell lines treated with borrelidin. These findings collectively suggest for the first time that borrelidin targets ALL cell lines by inducing apoptosis and mediating G(1) arrest and that borrelidin treatment in ALL cell lines is correlated with activation of the GCN2 kinase pathway.","['Habibi, Darya', 'Ogloff, Nadya', 'Jalili, Reza B', 'Yost, Arla', 'Weng, Andrew P', 'Ghahary, Aziz', 'Ong, Christopher J']","['Habibi D', 'Ogloff N', 'Jalili RB', 'Yost A', 'Weng AP', 'Ghahary A', 'Ong CJ']","['Vancouver Prostate Centre, Department of Surgery, University of British Columbia, Rm 241, 2660 Oak Street, Vancouver, BC V6H 3Z6, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fatty Alcohols)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', '7184-60-3 (borrelidin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (EIF2AK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 6.1.1.3 (Threonine-tRNA Ligase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fatty Alcohols/pharmacology', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Macrolides/pharmacology', 'Nitriles/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Small Molecule Libraries/*pharmacology', 'Threonine-tRNA Ligase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor CHOP']",2011/06/17 06:00,2012/10/30 06:00,['2011/06/17 06:00'],"['2011/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-011-9700-y [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2012 Aug;30(4):1361-70. doi: 10.1007/s10637-011-9700-y.

In this study, we analyzed the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 10 AML patients (subtypes M1 to M5) and six normal controls by miRNA microarray and identified several differentially expressed miRNAs. Among them miR-29a and miR-142-3p were selectively encountered in Northern blot analysis and their significantly decreased expression in AML was further confirmed. Quantitative real-time PCR in 52 primarily diagnosed AML patients and 100 normal controls not only verified the expression properties of these 2 miRNAs, but also established that the expression level of miR-142-3p and miR-29a in PBMCs could be used as novel diagnostic markers. A better diagnostic outcome was achieved by combining miR-29a and miR-142-3p with about 90% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.97.

We studied relative telomere lengths (RTLs) for individual chromosomes using the quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization technique in a cohort of 32 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and 32 normal samples. We found that telomeres at some specific chromosome arms remain well maintained or even lengthened in a high frequency (27/32) of leukemia cases. In particular, 10 chromosome arms, 4q, 5p, 7q, 11p, 13p, 13q, 14p, 15p, 18p, and Xp, with long telomeres were consistently identified in different samples, and six of them (4q, 5p, 13p, 13q, 14p, and Xp) with relatively long telomeres were also observed in normal samples, but they appeared in lower occurrence rate and shorter RTL than in CML samples. Our results strongly indicate the presence of a special leukemia cell population, or a clone, originated from a common progenitor that is characterized with chromosome arm-specific long telomeres.

Here, we showed that STAT3 was overexpressed and highly activated in adriamycin-resistant K562/A02 cells compared with its parental K562 cells. Blockade of activation of STAT3 by STAT3 decoy oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) promoted the accumulation and increased their sensitivity to adriamycin by down-regulating transcription of mdr1 and expression of P-gp, which were further confirmed by using STAT3-specific inhibitor JSI-124. Inhibition of STAT3 could also decrease mdr1 promoter mediated luciferase expression by using mdr1 promoter luciferase reporter construct. Otherwise, activation of STAT3 by STAT3C improved mdr1 transcription and P-gp expression.

In our study, we applied the same approach to 859 samples from three Singapore populations and seven HapMap III populations. Approximately 50% of the 1291 autosomal CNPs were found to be polymorphic only in populations of non-African ancestry. Pairwise comparisons among the 10 populations showed substantial differences in the CNPs frequencies. Additionally, 698 CNPs showed significant differences with false discovery rate (FDR)<0.01 among the 10 populations and these loci overlap with known disease-associated or pharmacogenetic-related genes such as CFHR3 and CFHR1 (age related macular degeneration), GSTTI (metabolism of various carcinogenic compounds and cancers) and UGT2B17 (prostate cancer and graft-versus-host disease). The correlations between CNPs and genome-wide association studies-SNPs were investigated and several loci, which were previously unreported, that may potentially be implicated in complex diseases and traits were found; for example, childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, age-related macular degeneration, breast cancer, response to antipsychotic treatment, rheumatoid arthritis and type-1 diabetes.

This phase is followed after 4-6 years by rapid progression, an accelerated phase, and consequently a fatal acute leukemia a blast crisis. The hallmark abnormality of CML is the Philadelphia chromosome that generates a BCR-ABL fusion gene, resulting in the expression of a leukemia-specific oncoprotein, Bcr-Abl. Bcr-Abl is a potent tyrosine kinase and plays a central role in CML pathogenesis. Recently, the treatment of CML has been revolutionized by the introduction of imatinib mesylate(IM). With daily IM treatment, more than 80% of chronic-phase CML patients achieve a complete cytogenetic response. Nevertheless, a small percentage of CML patients are primarily refractory or acquire secondary resistance against IM. Nilotinib is a highly selective Abl kinase inhibitor that possesses greater potency and selectivity for Abl kinase than IM. In addition to being more potent than IM against wild-type BCR-ABL, nilotinib is significantly active against many IM-resistant BCR-ABL mutants. In preclinical studies, nilotinib has produced hematologic and cytogenetic responses in CML patients, with either IM resistance or IM intolerance. As second-line treatment, both nilotinib and dasatinib may be used in case of suboptimal response or failure, which is defined in the efficacy criteria of the European Leukemia Net Consensus. The choice of second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be made after the mutation analyses of the kinase domain. It is recommended that nilotinib or dasatinib whichever was shown to be active against the specific mutation, should be chosen for treatment. For patients with no mutations or patients with IM intolerance, it is recommended that either second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor be chosen, based on the patient's disease history.","['Yamauchi, Takahiro', 'Ueda, Takanori']","['Yamauchi T', 'Ueda T']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Fukui Hospital.']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

HTLV-1 replication is positively regulated by Tax and Rex and negatively regulated by the p30 and HBZ proteins. In the present study, we demonstrate that HTLV-1 encodes another negative regulator of virus expression, the p13 protein. Expressed separately, p13 localizes to the mitochondria, whereas in the presence of Tax, part of it is ubiquitinated, stabilized, and rerouted to the nuclear speckles. The p13 protein directly binds Tax, decreases Tax binding to the CBP/p300 transcriptional coactivator, and, by reducing Tax transcriptional activity, suppresses viral expression. Because Tax stabilizes its own repressor, these findings suggest that HTLV-1 has evolved a complex mechanism to control its own replication. Further, these results highlight the importance of studying the function of the HTLV-1 viral proteins, not only in isolation, but also in the context of full viral replication.","['Andresen, Vibeke', 'Pise-Masison, Cynthia A', 'Sinha-Datta, Uma', 'Bellon, Marcia', 'Valeri, Valerio', 'Washington Parks, Robyn', 'Cecchinato, Valentina', 'Fukumoto, Risaku', 'Nicot, Christophe', 'Franchini, Genoveffa']","['Andresen V', 'Pise-Masison CA', 'Sinha-Datta U', 'Bellon M', 'Valeri V', 'Washington Parks R', 'Cecchinato V', 'Fukumoto R', 'Nicot C', 'Franchini G']","['Animal Models & Retroviral Vaccines Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (rof protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Virus Replication/genetics/*physiology', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2011/06/17 06:00,2011/10/19 06:00,['2011/06/17 06:00'],"['2011/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40786-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-06-293340 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Aug 11;118(6):1549-59. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-06-293340.

METHODS: A prospective study during 2006-2009 was performed at haematology ward in Kuopio University Hospital. A patient was eligible for the study if having neutropenic fever after intensive therapy for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (n = 32) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (n = 35). Blood cultures were taken, and maximal PTX3 and C-reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated during d0 to d3 from the beginning of fever onset. RESULTS: The level of PTX3 was associated with both the underlying malignancy and the presence of complications, with highest level in NHL patients with complicated course of febrile neutropenia and lowest in AML patients with non-complicated course. The cut-off level of PTX3 to predict complications was ten-fold in patients with NHL (115 mug/L) in comparison with patients with AML (11.5 mug/L). In combined analysis based on separate cut-offs, PTX3 predicted complications of febrile neutropenia with sensitivity of 0.86, specificity of 0.83, positive predictive value of 0.57 and negative predictive value of 0.96. CONCLUSIONS: PTX3 was superior to CRP in predicting complicated course of febrile neutropenia, but only when the effect of the underlying malignancy had been taken into account.","['Juutilainen, Auni', 'Vanska, Matti', 'Pulkki, Kari', 'Hamalainen, Sari', 'Nousiainen, Tapio', 'Jantunen, Esa', 'Koivula, Irma']","['Juutilainen A', 'Vanska M', 'Pulkki K', 'Hamalainen S', 'Nousiainen T', 'Jantunen E', 'Koivula I']","['Institute of Clinical Medicine/Internal Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio Department of Medicine, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland. auni.juutilainen@kuh.fi']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Serum Amyloid P-Component)', '148591-49-5 (PTX3 protein)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'C-Reactive Protein/*physiology', 'Female', 'Fever/complications/microbiology/*pathology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/classification/complications/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/complications/*pathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Serum Amyloid P-Component/*physiology', 'Young Adult']",2011/06/17 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/17 06:00'],"['2011/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01666.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2011 Nov;87(5):441-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01666.x.

Leukemia is a cancer of the hematological system and can be divided into a diversity of unique malignancies based on the onset of the disease as well as the specific cell lineages involved. Cancer stem cells, including recently identified leukemia stem cells (LSCs), are hypothesized to be responsible for cancer development, relapse, and resistance to treatment, and new therapeutics targeting these cellular populations are urgently needed. Nontoxic and nonaggregating calcium phosphosilicate nanoparticles (CPSNPs) encapsulating the near-infrared fluoroprobe indocyanine green (ICG) were recently developed for diagnostic imaging and drug delivery as well as for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of solid tumors. Prior studies revealed that specific targeting of CPSNPs allowed for enhanced accumulation within breast cancer tumors, via CD71 targeting, or pancreatic cancer tumors, via gastrin receptor targeting. In the present study, ICG-loaded CPSNPs were evaluated as photosensitizers for PDT of leukemia. Using a novel bioconjugation approach to specifically target CD117 or CD96, surface features enhanced on leukemia stem cells, in vitro ICG-CPSNP PDT of a murine leukemia cell line and human leukemia samples were dramatically improved. Furthermore, the in vivo efficacy of PDT was dramatically enhanced in a murine leukemia model by utilizing CD117-targeted ICG-CPSNPs, resulting in 29% disease-free survival. Altogether, this study demonstrates that leukemia-targeted ICG-loaded CPSNPs offer the promise to effectively treat relapsing and multidrug-resistant leukemia and to improve the life of leukemia patients.","['Barth, Brian M', 'I Altinoglu, Erhan', 'Shanmugavelandy, Sriram S', 'Kaiser, James M', 'Crespo-Gonzalez, Daniza', 'DiVittore, Nicole A', 'McGovern, Christopher', 'Goff, Trevor M', 'Keasey, Nicole R', 'Adair, James H', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr', 'Claxton, David F', 'Kester, Mark']","['Barth BM', 'I Altinoglu E', 'Shanmugavelandy SS', 'Kaiser JM', 'Crespo-Gonzalez D', 'DiVittore NA', 'McGovern C', 'Goff TM', 'Keasey NR', 'Adair JH', 'Loughran TP Jr', 'Claxton DF', 'Kester M']","['Department of Pharmacology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033, USA. bmb14@psu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,ACS Nano,ACS nano,101313589,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Calcium Phosphates)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Silicates)', '0 (silica-calcium phosphate nanocomposite)', '17778-80-2 (Singlet Oxygen)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'IX6J1063HV (Indocyanine Green)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Calcium Phosphates/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Progression', 'Endocytosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Indocyanine Green/*chemistry', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Photochemotherapy/*methods', 'Photosensitizing Agents/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Silicates/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Singlet Oxygen/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",2011/06/17 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/17 06:00'],"['2011/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/nn2005766 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Nano. 2011 Jul 26;5(7):5325-37. doi: 10.1021/nn2005766.

The correlation between presence of the FLT3/ITD mutation and the subtype of disease according to FAB classification, white blood cell count, incidence of early relapse (<12 months) and overall survival was studied. RESULTS: Among 103 patients for whom molecular analyses had been done, FLT3/ITD mutation was present in 46 (44.7%) cases; the highest frequency was seen in the M0 subtype (63.6%), and the lowest in the M1 subtype (16.7%). There were no statistically significant differences in the FLT3/ITD presence for the 3 groups of patients having different leucocyte counts. The FLT3/ITD mutation was associated with a higher incidence of early relapse compared with no mutation cases (78.7 vs. 21.4%; p < 0.001), and with a shorter survival time (<40 vs. >60 months; p < 0.001).

RESULTS: In 100 patients (73.5%) the b3a2 and in 34 (25%) the b2a2 forms of BCR-ABL were detected. One (0.75%) patient was BCR-ABL negative, but in lymphoblastic transformation he expressed the e1a2 [corrected] transcript of BCR-ABL. One (0.75%) patient displayed both b2a2 and b3a2 forms of BCR-ABL.

Calcium is actively accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum by Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium transport ATPases (SERCA enzymes). SERCA-dependent calcium transport is the only calcium uptake mechanism in this organelle, and therefore the regulation of SERCA function by the cell constitutes a key mechanism to adjust calcium homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum depending on the cell type and its state of differentiation. The direct pharmacological modulation of SERCA activity affects cell differentiation and survival. SERCA expression levels can undergo significant changes during cell differentiation or tumorigenesis, leading to modified endoplasmic reticulum calcium storage. In several cell types such as cells of hematopoietic origin or various epithelial cells, two SERCA genes (SERCA2 and SERCA3) are simultaneously expressed. Expression levels of SERCA3, a lower calcium affinity calcium pump are highly variable. In several cell systems SERCA3 expression is selectively induced during differentiation, whereas during tumorigenesis and blastic transformation SERCA3 expression is decreased. These observations point at the existence of a cross-talk, via the regulation of SERCA3 levels, between endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis and the control of cell differentiation, and show that endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis itself can undergo remodeling during differentiation.

(Lauraceae) on basophil-mediated allergic reactions and interleukin (IL)-5-mediated B cell growth. The effects of costunolide on beta-hexosaminidase (a key parameter of degranulation) release and IL-4 expression in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells were determined by measuring beta-hexosaminidase activity and by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, respectively. The effects of costunolide on Y16 pro-B cell viability and growth were determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Costunolide was found significantly to inhibit beta-hexosaminidase activity (p < 0.01) and IL-4 transcription in RBL-2H3 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Its 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50 ) was 34 microM, while that of the positive control, ketotifen, was 24 microM (IL-4 mRNA transcription). Moreover, costunolide dose-dependently suppressed pro-B cell growth in IL-5-stimulated Y16 cells. These results provide evidence that costunolide stabilizes mast cells by inhibiting IgE-mediated degranulation and inhibits IL-5-stimulated B cell growth.","['Kim, Tae Joon', 'Nam, Kung-Woo', 'Kim, Bora', 'Lee, Sung-Jin', 'Oh, Ki-Bong', 'Kim, Kyeong Ho', 'Mar, Woongchon', 'Shin, Jongheon']","['Kim TJ', 'Nam KW', 'Kim B', 'Lee SJ', 'Oh KB', 'Kim KH', 'Mar W', 'Shin J']","['Natural Products Research Institute, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 151-742, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Phytother Res,Phytotherapy research : PTR,8904486,"['0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '4IK578SA7Z (costunolide)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Degranulation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Immunoglobulin E', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Interleukin-4/metabolism', 'Interleukin-5', 'Laurus/*chemistry', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*drug effects', 'Rats', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/metabolism']",2011/06/16 06:00,2015/02/12 06:00,['2011/06/16 06:00'],"['2010/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ptr.3553 [doi]'],ppublish,Phytother Res. 2011 Sep;25(9):1392-7. doi: 10.1002/ptr.3553.

However, a proportion of patients have been shown to be resistant to this mobilization regimen. To identify the factors that impair stem cell mobilization and collection with plerixafor, we reviewed the data for 197 patients who had undergone mobilization with plerixafor and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor in Central Europe. Predictors of mobilization failure were evaluated using logistic regression analysis. Among the 197 patients mobilized, the target of >/=2.0 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg was collected from 133 (67.5%). Our analysis revealed that previous treatment with lenalidomide, bortezomib, melphalan, radiotherapy, or autologous stem cell transplantation and regimen of plerixafor use in combination with chemotherapy had no significant effect on the efficiency of collection. In contrast, an age >/=65 years (odds ratio 0.331, 95% CI: 0.112-0.977, P < 0.05), a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (odds ratio 0.277, 95% CI: 0.124-0.622, P < 0.01), and treatment with >/= four chemotherapy regimens (odds ratio 0.366, 95% CI: 0.167-0.799, P < 0.05) were associated significantly with failed mobilization. The rate of successful mobilizations was decreased in patients treated with purine analogues (odds ratio 0.323, 95% CI: 0.096-1.094, P = 0.07) but increased in female patients (odds ratio 1.961, CI: 0.943-4.080, P = 0.07).

Despite its largely unknown origin and behaviour, HCL is one of the few example of dramatic success in the treatment of a malignancy. The recent steps forward to understanding the biology of HCL from immunogenetic and genomic studies have recently provided new insight into diagnosis and prognosis. Several data from immunoglobulin gene (IG) analysis have provided hints regarding the cell of origin and the ongoing selective interactions of the tumour BCR with environmental stimuli. It has also recently emerged that an unmutated status of the HCL IG can be associated with failure to respond to cladribine, genetic abnormalities indicative of poor outcome and aggressive disease. These observations suggest a central role of the tumour B-cell receptor in defining the outcome of HCL and that that IG gene analysis may have biological and prognostic relevance. Hopefully, IG analysis will help tailor treatment strategies for the most aggressive cases.","['Forconi, Francesco']",['Forconi F'],"['Ematologia e Trapianti, Universita di Siena & AOUS, Siena, Italy. forconif@unisi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Immunogenetic Phenomena/*drug effects', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics', 'Rituximab']",2011/06/16 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/06/16 06:00'],"['2010/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.975 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2011 Jun;29(2):55-66. doi: 10.1002/hon.975.

It has been reported that the high MPO group (MPO-H), in which >50% of blasts are MPO activity positive, is associated with favorable karyotypes, while the low MPO group (</=50% of blasts are MPO activity positive, MPO-L) is associated with adverse karyotypes. The MPO-H group shows better survival even when restricted to patients belonging to the intermediate chromosomal risk group or those with a normal karyotype. It has recently been shown that genotypes defined by the mutational status of NPM1, FLT3, and CEBPA are associated with treatment outcome in patients with cytogenetically normal AML. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between MPO positivity and gene mutations found in normal karyotypes. Sixty AML patients with normal karyotypes were included in this study. Blast cell MPO positivity was assessed in bone marrow smears stained for MPO. Associated genetic lesions (the NPM1, FLT3-ITD, and CEBPA mutations) were studied using nucleotide sequencing. Thirty-two patients were in the MPO-L group, and 28 patients in the MPO-H group. FLT3-ITD was found in 11 patients (18.3%), NPM1 mutations were found in 19 patients (31.7%), and CEBPA mutations were found in 11 patients (18.3%). In patients with CEBPA mutations, the carrying two simultaneous mutations (CEBPA (double-mut)) was associated with high MPO expression, while the mutant NPM1 without FLT3-ITD genotype was not associated with MPO activity. Both higher MPO expression and the CEBPA (double-mut) genotype appeared to be associated with improved overall survival after intensive chemotherapy. Further studies are required to determine the importance of blast MPO activity as a prognostic factor, especially in CEBPA wild-type patients with a normal karyotype.","['Tominaga-Sato, Shinya', 'Tsushima, Hideki', 'Ando, Koji', 'Itonaga, Hidehiro', 'Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Imanishi, Daisuke', 'Iwanaga, Masako', 'Taguchi, Jun', 'Fukushima, Takuya', 'Yoshida, Shinichiro', 'Hata, Tomoko', 'Moriuchi, Yukiyoshi', 'Kuriyama, Kazutaka', 'Mano, Hiroyuki', 'Tomonaga, Masao', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi']","['Tominaga-Sato S', 'Tsushima H', 'Ando K', 'Itonaga H', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Imanishi D', 'Iwanaga M', 'Taguchi J', 'Fukushima T', 'Yoshida S', 'Hata T', 'Moriuchi Y', 'Kuriyama K', 'Mano H', 'Tomonaga M', 'Miyazaki Y']","['Department of Hematology and Molecular Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan. tsushima@nagasaki-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Nagasaki National Medical Center, Ohmura, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Molecular Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Molecular Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Molecular Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Nagasaki National Medical Center, Ohmura, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Sasebo City General Hospital, Sasebo, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'School of Health Sciences, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Nishihara, Japan.', 'Division of Functional Genomics, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red-Cross Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Hospital, Nagasaki, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Molecular Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*genetics/mortality', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Peroxidase/*genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2011/06/16 06:00,2012/02/03 06:00,['2011/06/16 06:00'],"['2011/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/23 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-011-0883-y [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-011-0883-y [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2011 Jul;94(1):81-89. doi: 10.1007/s12185-011-0883-y.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate, using MRI, the extent of liver iron overload in children with acute leukemia and receiving blood transfusions, and to examine the association between the degree of hepatic iron overload and clinical parameters including SF and the transfusion iron load (TIL). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 25 MRI measurements of the liver were performed in 15 children with acute leukemia (mean age 9.75 years) using gradient-echo sequences. Signal intensity ratios between the liver and the vertebral muscle (L/M ratio) were calculated and compared with SF-levels. TIL was estimated from the cumulative blood volume received, assuming an amount of 200 mg iron per transfused red blood cell unit. RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed good correlation between the L/M SI ratio and TIL (r = -0.67, P = 0.002, 95% confidence interval CI = -0.83 to -0.34) in patients with acute leukemia as well as between L/M SI ratio and SF (r = -0.76, P = 0.0003, 95% CI = -0.89 to -0.52). CONCLUSION: SF may reliably reflect liver iron stores as a routine marker in patients suffering from acute leukemia.","['Vag, Tibor', 'Kentouche, Karim', 'Krumbein, Ines', 'Reichenbach, Jurgen R', 'Lopatta, Eric', 'Renz, Diane M', 'Stenzel, Martin', 'Beck, James', 'Kaiser, Werner A', 'Mentzel, Hans-Joachim']","['Vag T', 'Kentouche K', 'Krumbein I', 'Reichenbach JR', 'Lopatta E', 'Renz DM', 'Stenzel M', 'Beck J', 'Kaiser WA', 'Mentzel HJ']","['Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena, Germany. tiborvag@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Pediatr Radiol,Pediatric radiology,0365332,['E1UOL152H7 (Iron)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iron/*analysis/blood', 'Iron Overload/blood/*pathology', 'Leukemia/blood/*pathology/therapy', 'Liver/*pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods', 'Male', 'Muscle, Skeletal/pathology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2011/06/16 06:00,2012/01/18 06:00,['2011/06/16 06:00'],"['2010/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/06 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00247-011-2122-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Radiol. 2011 Aug;41(8):980-4. doi: 10.1007/s00247-011-2122-3.

The aim of this study was to investigate the expression profile of Mcl-1 in cervical cancer and to assess its clinical significance. Immunohistochemistry was used in the detection of Mcl-1 expression as well as the proliferation index of Ki-67, both in cervical cancer and in corresponding normal tissue. Western blotting analysis was also used for the detection of Mcl-1. The data was correlated with clinicopathological features. Survival analysis was performed to assess prognostic significance. Mcl-1 was overexpressed in cervical cancer tissue when compared with corresponding normal tissue. High expression of Mcl-1 was significantly associated with histological grade (P = 0.039), tumor size (P = 0.024) and lymph node involvement (P = 0.002). Overexpression of Ki-67 was associated with lymph node involvement (P = 0.015) and disease stage (P = 0.012). Spearman rank correlation test demonstrated a positive correlation between Mcl-1 and Ki-67 (P < 0.05). Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, a comparison of survival curves of low versus high expressers of Mcl-1 and Ki-67 revealed a highly significant difference in human cervical cancer tissue (P < 0.05), which suggests that overexpression of Mcl-1 and Ki-67 is associated with a poorer prognosis. Our results suggest that Mcl-1 may play an important role in cervical cancer and that it may have potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target. Its evaluation with Ki-67 may provide reliable prognostic information on cervical cancer.","['Zhang, Ting', 'Zhao, Chun', 'Luo, Liang', 'Zhao, Hua', 'Cheng, Jing', 'Xu, Fei']","['Zhang T', 'Zhao C', 'Luo L', 'Zhao H', 'Cheng J', 'Xu F']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Wuxi Maternity and Child Health Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, 48 Huaishu-Xiang, Wuxi, 214002 Jiangsu, China. zhangting040715@163.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Ki-67 Antigen/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*metabolism/mortality/pathology']",2011/06/16 06:00,2013/06/15 06:00,['2011/06/16 06:00'],"['2011/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-011-0005-y [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2012 Sep;29(3):1985-91. doi: 10.1007/s12032-011-0005-y.

Its roles in cancer initiation and progression and in determining the response of tumor cells to anticancer therapy are complicated, and only limited investigation has been conducted on the potential significance of autophagy in the pathogenesis and therapeutic response of acute myeloid leukemia. Here we demonstrate that the inducible or transfected expression of the acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)-specific PML-RARalpha, but not PLZF-RARalpha or NPM-RARalpha, fusion protein upregulates constitutive autophagy activation in leukemic and nonleukemic cells, as evaluated by hallmarks for autophagy including transmission electron microscopy. The significant increase in autophagic activity is also found in the leukemic cells-infiltrated bone marrow and spleen from PML-RARalpha-transplanted leukemic mice. The autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine significantly abrogates the autophagic events upregulated by PML-RARalpha, while the autophagic flux assay reveals that the fusion protein induces autophagy by increasing the on-rate of autophagic sequestration. Furthermore, this modulation of autophagy by PML-RARalpha is possibly mediated by a decreased activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway. Finally, we also show that autophagy contributes to the anti-apoptotic function of the PML-RARalpha protein. Given the critical role of the PML-RARalpha oncoprotein in APL pathogenesis, this study suggests an important role of autophagy in the development and treatment of this disease.","['Huang, Ying', 'Hou, Jia-Kai', 'Chen, Ting-Ting', 'Zhao, Xu-Yun', 'Yan, Zhao-Wen', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Yang, Jie', 'Kogan, Scott C', 'Chen, Guo-Qiang']","['Huang Y', 'Hou JK', 'Chen TT', 'Zhao XY', 'Yan ZW', 'Zhang J', 'Yang J', 'Kogan SC', 'Chen GQ']","['Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,"['0 (MAP1LC3A protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5142-23-4 (3-methyladenine)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', '*Autophagy', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells']",2011/06/16 06:00,2012/03/31 06:00,['2011/06/16 06:00'],"['2011/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['16636 [pii]', '10.4161/auto.7.10.16636 [doi]']",ppublish,Autophagy. 2011 Oct;7(10):1132-44. doi: 10.4161/auto.7.10.16636.

ATL carries a bad prognosis because of intrinsic chemoresistance and severe immunosuppression. In acute ATL, Japanese trials demonstrated that although combinations of chemotherapy improved response rate, they failed to achieve a significant impact on survival. Patients with chronic and smoldering ATL have a better prognosis, but long-term survival is poor when these patients are managed with a watchful-waiting policy or with chemotherapy. Recently, a worldwide meta-analysis revealed that the combination of zidovudine and IFN-alpha is highly effective in the leukemic subtypes of ATL and should be considered as standard first-line therapy in that setting. This combination has changed the natural history of the disease through achievement of significantly improved long-term survival in patients with smoldering and chronic ATL as well as a subset of patients with acute ATL. ATL lymphoma patients still benefit from chemotherapy induction with concurrent or sequential antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine/IFN. To prevent relapse, clinical trials assessing consolidative targeted therapies such as arsenic/IFN combination or novel monoclonal antibodies are needed.

Therefore, deterioration of antitumor reactivity and serious autoimmune reactivity are major concerns. To address this problem, we have recently established a novel retroviral vector system encoding siRNAs for endogenous TCR genes (siTCR vector). In this study, to test the clinical application of siTCR gene therapy for human leukemia, we examined in detail the efficacy and safety of WT1-siTCR-transduced T cells. Compared with conventional WT1-TCR (WT1-coTCR) gene-transduced T cells, these cells showed significant enhancement of antileukemia reactivity resulting from stronger expression of the introduced WT1-specific TCR with inhibition of endogenous TCRs. Notably, WT1-siTCR gene-transduced T cells were remarkably expandable after repetitive stimulation with WT1 peptide in vitro, without any deterioration of antigen specificity. WT1-siTCR gene-transduced T cells from leukemia patients successfully lysed autologous leukemia cells, but not normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. In a mouse xenograft model, adoptively transferred WT1-siTCR gene-transduced T cells exerted distinct antileukemia efficacy but did not inhibit human hematopoiesis. Our results suggest that gene-immunotherapy for leukemia using this WT1-siTCR system holds considerable promise.","['Ochi, Toshiki', 'Fujiwara, Hiroshi', 'Okamoto, Sachiko', 'An, Jun', 'Nagai, Kozo', 'Shirakata, Toshiaki', 'Mineno, Junichi', 'Kuzushima, Kiyotaka', 'Shiku, Hiroshi', 'Yasukawa, Masaki']","['Ochi T', 'Fujiwara H', 'Okamoto S', 'An J', 'Nagai K', 'Shirakata T', 'Mineno J', 'Kuzushima K', 'Shiku H', 'Yasukawa M']","['Department of Bioregulatory Medicine, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Ehime University Proteo-Medicine Research Center, Ehime, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Female', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/deficiency/genetics', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'WT1 Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2011/06/16 06:00,2011/10/19 06:00,['2011/06/16 06:00'],"['2011/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40780-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-02-337089 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Aug 11;118(6):1495-503. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-02-337089.

DATA SOURCES: Literature was retrieved from PubMed (2000-January 2011), using the search terms chronic myeloid leukemia and tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Abstracts presented at the 2008-2010 annual meetings of the American Society of Hematology and the American Society of Clinical Oncology, reference citations from identified publications, as well as the manufacturers' full prescribing information for cited drugs, also were reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles evaluating the efficacy and safety of the TKIs imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib were evaluated. Focus was placed on publications supporting management of patients with CML in the chronic phase. Reports presenting clinical trial information of TKIs in development also were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: The discovery of targeted tyrosine kinase inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase dramatically changed the treatment of CML. Imatinib, the first TKI approved for treatment of patients with Philadelphia chromosome--positive CML, demonstrated significant superiority over the previous standard of care: interferon plus cytarabine. The newer, more potent TKIs, nilotinib and dasatinib, have demonstrated improved efficacy over imatinib as first-line therapy and provide an effective option for patients with resistance or intolerance to imatinib. CONCLUSIONS: To maximize efficacy of TKI therapy, close patient management, involving frequent monitoring of patient response, is essential. Given the importance of continuing TKI therapy, early recognition and management of adverse events are critical to optimizing outcomes in patients with CML. In addition to the safety profile and considerations of comorbidities, additional factors can affect therapeutic selection, including drug-drug and drug-food interactions. Research investigating new therapies, particularly for patients harboring the T315I mutation-which remains refractory to current TKIs-continues in the quest to improve outcomes in patients with CML.","['Wong, Siu-Fun', 'Mirshahidi, Hamid']","['Wong SF', 'Mirshahidi H']","['Department of Pharmacotherapy and Outcomes Science, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA. sfwong@llu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Monitoring/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2011/06/16 06:00,2011/10/08 06:00,['2011/06/16 06:00'],"['2011/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['aph.1P784 [pii]', '10.1345/aph.1P784 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2011 Jun;45(6):787-97. doi: 10.1345/aph.1P784.

Previously, we demonstrated that human neural progenitors could be maintained in a proliferative state with the addition of leukemia inhibitory factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. Here we demonstrate that 96 h after removal of basic fibroblast growth factor the neural progenitor cell culture was significantly altered and cell replication halted. Fourteen days after the removal of basic fibroblast growth factor, most cells expressed microtubule-associated protein 2 and TUJ1, markers characterizing a post-mitotic neuronal phenotype as well as neural developmental markers Cdh2 and Gbx2. Real-time PCR was performed to determine the ionotropic receptor subunit expression profile. Differentiated neural progenitors express subunits of glutamatergic, GABAergic, nicotinic, purinergic and transient receptor potential receptors. In addition, sodium and calcium channel subunits were also expressed. Functionally, virtually all the hNP cells tested under whole-cell voltage clamp exhibited delayed rectifier potassium channel currents and some differentiated cells exhibited tetrodotoxin-sensitive, voltage-dependent sodium channel current. Action potentials could also be elicited by currents injection under whole-cell current clamp in a minority of cells. These results indicate that removing basic fibroblast growth factor from the neural progenitor cell cultures leads to a post-mitotic state, and has the capability to produce excitable cells that can generate action potentials, a landmark characteristic of a neuronal phenotype. This is the first report of an efficient and simple means of generating human neuronal cells for ionotropic receptor assays and ultimately for electrically active human neural cell assays for drug discovery.","['Young, A', 'Machacek, D W', 'Dhara, S K', 'Macleish, P R', 'Benveniste, M', 'Dodla, M C', 'Sturkie, C D', 'Stice, S L']","['Young A', 'Machacek DW', 'Dhara SK', 'Macleish PR', 'Benveniste M', 'Dodla MC', 'Sturkie CD', 'Stice SL']","['Regenerative Bioscience Center, 425 River Road Room 450, Athens, GA 30602, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Ion Channels)']",IM,"['Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media/chemistry', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ion Channels/*metabolism', 'Neural Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2011/06/16 06:00,2012/01/19 06:00,['2011/06/16 06:00'],"['2011/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0306-4522(11)00457-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.neuroscience.2011.04.039 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 2011 Sep 29;192:793-805. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2011.04.039.

However the long-term life quality of patients is seriously affected by ANT-related cardiotoxicity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of two dimension echocardiography (2DE) and serum biochemical indicators in monitoring ANT-related cardiotoxicity. METHODS: Seventy children who received ANT chemotherapy (ANT dose: 124 +/- 73 mg/m2) and were followed up for 22 +/- 13 months were enrolled. 2DE with aspects of conventional indexes (left ventricular diameter and wall thickness, ejection fraction, E/A), myocardial performance index (MPI) and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) were performed. Serum levels of troponin (CTnI) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were measured. Thirty-seven healthy children served as the control group. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in conventional indexes of 2DE between the ANT and the control groups. The MPI of left and right ventricular in the ANT group increased significantly compared with that in the control group (0.237 +/- 0.06 vs 0.203 +/- 0.06, 0.171 +/- 0.05 vs 0.140 +/- 0.04 respectively; P<0.01). TDI showed the late diastolic peak velocity in the basal and middle sections of left ventricular, interventricular septum and right ventricular in the ANT group were significantly higher than the controls. There were significant differences in the ratio of early to late diastolic peak velocity of the middle section of left ventricular and the basal and middle sections of the interventricular septum between the two groups (P<0.05). The changes of MPI and TDI became more obvious with the increased dose of ANT. There were no significant differences in serum CtnI and BNP levels between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The heart function of patients who received ANT chemotherapy needs to be monitored for a long term. MPI and TDI can be used as early indexes for monitoring the heart function.","['Xu, Xin-Yi', 'Huang, Mei-Rong', 'Tang, Jing-Yan', 'Zhang, Yu-Qi', 'Wu, Yu-Rong', 'Zhou, Min']","['Xu XY', 'Huang MR', 'Tang JY', 'Zhang YQ', 'Wu YR', 'Zhou M']","[""Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200127, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Troponin I)', '0 (pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76))', '114471-18-0 (Natriuretic Peptide, Brain)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthracyclines/*toxicity', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/blood', 'Peptide Fragments/blood', 'Troponin I/blood']",2011/06/16 06:00,2011/07/29 06:00,['2011/06/16 06:00'],"['2011/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/29 06:00 [medline]']",['1008-8830(2011)06-0490-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2011 Jun;13(6):490-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These findings add to the growing amount of scepticism regarding XMRV.","['Maggi, F', 'Focosi, D', 'Lanini, L', 'Sbranti, S', 'Mazzetti, P', 'Macera, L', 'Davini, S', 'De Donno, M', 'Mariotti, M L', 'Antonelli, G', 'Scatena, F', 'Pistello, M']","['Maggi F', 'Focosi D', 'Lanini L', 'Sbranti S', 'Mazzetti P', 'Macera L', 'Davini S', 'De Donno M', 'Mariotti ML', 'Antonelli G', 'Scatena F', 'Pistello M']","['Virology Unit, Pisa University Hospital, Pisa, Italy. fabrizio.maggi63@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Microbiol Infect,Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,9516420,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Cells/*virology', 'Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic/*virology', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/*complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*virology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/*isolation & purification', 'Young Adult']",2011/06/16 06:00,2012/05/11 06:00,['2011/06/16 06:00'],"['2011/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1111/j.1469-0691.2011.03580.x [doi]', 'S1198-743X(14)61345-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Microbiol Infect. 2012 Feb;18(2):184-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1469-0691.2011.03580.x.

Here, we show that Oncostatin M (Osm) and its receptor, OsmRbeta, are both expressed in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and that in contradistinction to leukemia inhibitory factor and ciliary neutrophic factor, Osm directly inhibits the proliferation of adult NPCs as measured by a decreased level of neurosphere formation in vitro. Similarly, intraventricular infusion of Osm dramatically decreases the pool of NPCs in both the SVZ and the hippocampus. In keeping with the inhibitory action of Osm, we reveal that mice lacking OsmRbeta have substantially more NPCs in the SVZ, the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb, demonstrating that endogenous Osm signaling is important for NPC homeostasis. Finally, we show that Osm can also inhibit clonal growth of glioblastoma-derived neurospheres, further supporting the close link between NPCs and tumor stem cells.","['Beatus, Paul', 'Jhaveri, Dhanisha J', 'Walker, Tara L', 'Lucas, Peter G', 'Rietze, Rodney L', 'Cooper, Helen M', 'Morikawa, Yoshihiro', 'Bartlett, Perry F']","['Beatus P', 'Jhaveri DJ', 'Walker TL', 'Lucas PG', 'Rietze RL', 'Cooper HM', 'Morikawa Y', 'Bartlett PF']","['The Queensland Brain Institute, The University of Queensland, Brisbane QLD 4072, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dev Neurobiol,Developmental neurobiology,101300215,"['0 (Oncostatin M Receptor beta Subunit)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Adult Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Brain/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glioblastoma/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neural Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oncostatin M/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Oncostatin M Receptor beta Subunit/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/10/15 06:00,['2011/06/15 06:00'],"['2011/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/dneu.20871 [doi]'],ppublish,Dev Neurobiol. 2011 Jul;71(7):619-33. doi: 10.1002/dneu.20871.,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the examination method of choice for evaluating radiation-induced brain complications. The purpose of this report is to describe the spectrum of MRI abnormalities detected in a group of survivors of leukemia treated with cranial irradiation. PROCEDURES: In this cross-sectional, single center study, 56 patients (median age at follow-up 19 years) receiving CRT as cranial prophylaxis (CP) included in the leukemia protocol (total dose 1,800-2,400 cGy) and/or in the total body irradiation regimen (990-1,200 cGy) before hematopoietic stem cell transplant, were evaluated by MRI after a median interval of 11 years (range 2-27) following CRT. RESULTS: Fifty-nine MRI abnormalities (32 cavernomas, nine focal areas of gliosis, seven dystrophic mineralizations, five cerebral atrophies, four pituitary atrophies, one diffuse radiation leukoencephalopathy, and one meningioma) were found in 43 patients. The longest interval between CRT and MRI and oldest age at follow-up represented the two risk factors that were statistically associated with MRI lesions (P = 0.032 and 0.033, respectively). Cerebral cavernomas (CC) were the most frequent MRI abnormalities (57%). All patients with CC were asymptomatic at diagnosis and during follow-up, except one who had aspecific neurological manifestations and micro hemorrhages. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that total doses and modalities of fractionation dose of CRT were not significantly associated with MRI abnormalities. Moreover, in our experience none of the patients developed neurological symptoms related to MRI abnormalities, and furthermore, the CC remained substantially stable during follow-up.","['Faraci, Maura', 'Morana, Giovanni', 'Bagnasco, Francesca', 'Barra, Salvina', 'Polo, Paola', 'Hanau, Guia', 'Fioredda, Francesca', 'Caruso, Silvia', 'Rossi, Andrea', 'Spaziante, Renato', 'Haupt, Riccardo']","['Faraci M', 'Morana G', 'Bagnasco F', 'Barra S', 'Polo P', 'Hanau G', 'Fioredda F', 'Caruso S', 'Rossi A', 'Spaziante R', 'Haupt R']","[""Hematology-Oncology Department, G.

Children with ALL are immunosuppressed by both the disease and its therapy. Transfusion may contribute to the course of ALL through its transfusion-related immunomodulation (TRIM) effect. PROCEDURE: Blood transfusion history and response to therapy for 108 children <16 years of age at the time of ALL diagnosis was documented. Clinical files, electronic records, and blood bank registries were scrutinized. Overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in relation to blood product type and number of transfusions was determined. Hazard ratios (HR) for death and relapse were estimated through uni- and multivariate Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: One hundred eight ALL patients were included. Median age was 6 years (range: 0-15 years). Ninety-seven patients (89.8%) were transfused. Median number of transfused products was seven (range: 0-345). After multivariate analysis, transfusion of >5 packed red blood cells (PRBC) remained a significant predictor for death (P = 0.003) and relapse (P = 0.011). For platelets, maximal significance was observed when >30 platelet concentrates (PC) were transfused (P < 0.001). When both, PRBC and PC were considered, maximal significance for predicting death was observed with transfusion of >30 blood products (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The number of blood products transfused to children with ALL appears to be significantly associated with lower survival rates. This may reflect both the severity of the disease and the TRIM effect, which may decrease immune surveillance capacity and the probability of leukemic clone eradication.","['Jaime-Perez, Jose Carlos', 'Colunga-Pedraza, Perla R', 'Gomez-Almaguer, David']","['Jaime-Perez JC', 'Colunga-Pedraza PR', 'Gomez-Almaguer D']","['Internal Medicine Division, Department of Hematology, Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez University Hospital, School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico. carjaime@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blood Transfusion/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chimerism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', '*Immunomodulation', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukocyte Reduction Procedures', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transfusion Reaction']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2011/06/15 06:00'],"['2010/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22957 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Aug;57(2):217-23. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22957.

This central axonopathy may originate from the impairment of anterograde axoplasmic transport. Previous work showed tau hyperphosphorylation at T(181) in cerebrospinal fluid of HAM/TSP patients. Similar hyperphosphorylation occurs in SH-SY5Y cells incubated with supernatant from MT-2 cells (HTLV-I-infected lymphocytes secreting viral proteins, including Tax) that produce neurite shortening. Tau phosphorylation at T(181) is attributable to glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3-beta) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) activation. Here we investigate whether neurite retraction in the SH-SY5Y model associates with concurrent changes in other tau hyperphosphorylable residues. Threonine 181 turned out to be the only tau hyperphosphorylated residue. We also evaluate the role of GSK3-beta and CDK5 in this process by using specific kinase inhibitors (LiCl, TDZD-8, and roscovitine). Changes in both GSK3-beta active and inactive forms were followed by measuring the regulatory phosphorylable sites (S(9) and Y(216) , inactivating and activating phosphorylation, respectively) together with changes in beta-catenin protein levels. Our results showed that LiCl and TDZD-8 were unable to prevent MT-2 supernatant-mediated neurite retraction and also that neither Y(216) nor S(9) phosphorylations were changed in GSK3-beta. Thus, GSK3-beta seems not to play a role in T(181) hyperphosphorylation. On the other hand, the CDK5 involvement in tau phosphorylation was confirmed by both the increase in its enzymatic activity and the absence of MT-2 neurite retraction in the presence of roscovitine or CDK5 siRNA transfection.","['Maldonado, Horacio', 'Ramirez, Eugenio', 'Utreras, Elias', 'Pando, Maria E', 'Kettlun, Ana M', 'Chiong, Mario', 'Kulkarni, Ashok B', 'Collados, Lucia', 'Puente, Javier', 'Cartier, Luis', 'Valenzuela, Maria A']","['Maldonado H', 'Ramirez E', 'Utreras E', 'Pando ME', 'Kettlun AM', 'Chiong M', 'Kulkarni AB', 'Collados L', 'Puente J', 'Cartier L', 'Valenzuela MA']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas y Farmaceuticas, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,"['0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (tau Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Biological Factors/metabolism/physiology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Neurites/*drug effects/enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases/enzymology/pathology/*virology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/*virology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'tau Proteins/metabolism']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/15 06:00'],"['2010/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jnr.22678 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 2011 Sep;89(9):1489-98. doi: 10.1002/jnr.22678.

Studies of human genetic diseases and gene-targeted animal models have provided evidence that functional decline of telomeres and deregulation of cell cycle checkpoints contribute to the aging process of tissue stem cells. Telomere dysfunction can induce DNA damage response via key cell cycle checkpoints, leading to cellular senescence or apoptosis depending on the tissue type and developmental stage of a specific stem cell compartment. Telomerase mutation and telomere shortening have been observed in a variety of hematological disorders, such as dyskeratosis congenital, aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and leukemia, in which the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are a major target during the pathogenesis. Moreover, telomere dysfunction is able to induce both cell-intrinsic checkpoints and environmental factors limiting the self-renewal capacity and differentiation potential of HSCs. Crucial components in the cascade of DNA damage response, including ataxia telangiectasia mutated, CHK2, p53, p21 and p16/p19(ARF), play important roles in HSC maintenance and self-renewal in the scenarios of both sufficient telomere reserve and dysfunctional telomere. Therefore, a further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HSC aging may help identity new therapeutic targets for stem cell-based regenerative medicine.","['Ju, Zhenyu', 'Zhang, Junling', 'Gao, Yingdai', 'Cheng, Tao']","['Ju Z', 'Zhang J', 'Gao Y', 'Cheng T']","['School of Medicine, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China. zhenyuju@hotmail.com.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Molecular Nuclear Medicine, Institute of Radiation Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin, China. chengt@pumc.edu.cn.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. chengt@pumc.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*physiology', '*Cellular Senescence', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Regeneration', 'Telomere/*pathology']",2011/06/15 06:00,2012/02/03 06:00,['2011/06/15 06:00'],"['2011/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-011-0882-z [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-011-0882-z [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2011 Jul;94(1):33-43. doi: 10.1007/s12185-011-0882-z.

Using xenotransplantation of primary leukemia cells, we evaluated the phenotypic and genetic composition of de novo resistant very high risk precursor B-cell ALL, a subgroup defined by the persistence of minimal residual disease despite intensive chemotherapy. Analysis of copy number alterations (CNAs) showed that the xenografted leukemia, even when reconstituted from 100 cells, remained highly related to the diagnostic sample, with minor changes in CNAs, mostly deletions, emerging in most cases in the first passage into mice. At the single-cell level, the pattern of monoallelic and biallelic deletions of the CDKN2A locus revealed distinct leukemia subpopulations, which were reproducibly tracked in xenografts. In most very high risk ALL cases, the predominant diagnostic clones were reconstituted in xenografts, as shown by multiplex polymerase chain reaction analysis of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor loci. In other cases, the pattern in CNAs and immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor rearrangement was less concordant in xenografts, suggesting the outgrowth of subclones. These results unequivocally demonstrate the existence of clonally closely related but distinct subsets of leukemia initiating cells in ALL, which has important implications for drug development and preclinical disease modeling.","['Schmitz, Maike', 'Breithaupt, Petra', 'Scheidegger, Nastassja', 'Cario, Gunnar', 'Bonapace, Laura', 'Meissner, Barbara', 'Mirkowska, Paulina', 'Tchinda, Joelle', 'Niggli, Felix K', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Schrauder, Andre', 'Bornhauser, Beat C', 'Bourquin, Jean-Pierre']","['Schmitz M', 'Breithaupt P', 'Scheidegger N', 'Cario G', 'Bonapace L', 'Meissner B', 'Mirkowska P', 'Tchinda J', 'Niggli FK', 'Stanulla M', 'Schrappe M', 'Schrauder A', 'Bornhauser BC', 'Bourquin JP']","[""Division of Oncology and Children's Research Center, University Children's Hospital, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Clone Cells', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Phenotype', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/10/13 06:00,['2011/06/15 06:00'],"['2011/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)41100-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-11-320309 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Aug 18;118(7):1854-64. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-11-320309.

However, the role of SHP2 in adult hematopoiesis has not been addressed in previous studies. In addition, the role of SHP2 in human hematopoiesis has not been described. These questions are of considerable importance given the interest in development of SHP2 inhibitors for cancer treatment. We used shRNA-mediated inhibition of SHP2 expression to investigate the function of SHP2 in growth factor (GF) signaling in normal human CD34(+) cells. SHP2 knockdown resulted in markedly reduced proliferation and survival of cells cultured with GF, and reduced colony-forming cell growth. Cells expressing gain-of-function SHP2 mutations demonstrated increased dependency on SHP2 expression for survival compared with cells expressing wild-type SHP2. SHP2 knockdown was associated with significantly reduced myeloid and erythroid differentiation with retention of CD34(+) progenitors with enhanced proliferative capacity. Inhibition of SHP2 expression initially enhanced and later inhibited STAT5 phosphorylation and reduced expression of the antiapoptotic genes MCL1 and BCLXL. These results indicate an important role for SHP2 in STAT5 activation and GF-mediated proliferation, survival, and differentiation of human progenitor cells.","['Li, Liang', 'Modi, Hardik', 'McDonald, Tinisha', 'Rossi, John', 'Yee, Jiing-Kuan', 'Bhatia, Ravi']","['Li L', 'Modi H', 'McDonald T', 'Rossi J', 'Yee JK', 'Bhatia R']","['Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope Nationa, Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/deficiency/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/10/19 06:00,['2011/06/15 06:00'],"['2011/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40781-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-06-288910 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Aug 11;118(6):1504-15. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-06-288910.

Approximately 30% of T-ALL patients relapse, and evidence is emerging that relapse may result from a failure to eliminate leukemia-initiating cells (LICs). Thymic expression of the Tal1 and Lmo2 oncogenes in mice results in rapid development of T-ALL; and similar to T-ALL patients, more than half the leukemic mice develop spontaneous mutations in Notch1. Using this mouse model, we demonstrate that mouse T-ALLs are immunophenotypically and functionally heterogeneous with approximately 1 of 10,000 leukemic cells capable of initiating disease on transplantation. Our preleukemic studies reveal expansion of Notch-active double-negative thymic progenitors, and we find the leukemic DN3 population enriched in disease potential. To examine the role of Notch1 in LIC function, we measured LIC activity in leukemic mice treated with vehicle or with a gamma-secretase inhibitor. In 4 of 5 leukemias examined, Notch inhibition significantly reduced or eliminated LICs and extended survival. Remarkably, in 2 mice, gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment reduced LIC frequency below the limits of detection of this assay, and all transplanted mice failed to develop disease. These data support the continued development of Notch1 therapeutics as antileukemia agents.","['Tatarek, Jessica', 'Cullion, Kathleen', 'Ashworth, Todd', 'Gerstein, Rachel', 'Aster, Jon C', 'Kelliher, Michelle A']","['Tatarek J', 'Cullion K', 'Ashworth T', 'Gerstein R', 'Aster JC', 'Kelliher MA']","['Department of Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Male', 'Metalloproteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism/pathology']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/10/19 06:00,['2011/06/15 06:00'],"['2011/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40789-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-08-300343 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Aug 11;118(6):1579-90. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-08-300343.

Only a few studies to assess efficacy in children have been performed. We report on the results of the French prospective trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00845221) conducted in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed CML in CP. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 44 patients from age 10 months to 17 years with newly diagnosed CML in CP received daily imatinib 260 mg/m(2). Progression-free survival, responses, and tolerance were evaluated. RESULTS: With a median follow-up times of 31 months (range, 11 to 64 months), the estimated progression-free survival rate at 36 months was 98% (95% CI, 85% to 100%). A complete hematologic response was achieved in 98% of the patients. The rates of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR) were 61% and 31% at 12 months, respectively. During follow-up, CCyR and MMR were achieved in 36 children (77%) and 25 children (57%), respectively. Overall, 30% of the patients discontinued imatinib, mainly because of unsatisfactory response. The most common adverse events were neutropenia and musculoskeletal events. CONCLUSION: Imatinib is effective in children with CML in CP with response rates similar to rates reported in adults. The adverse effects are acceptable, but longer follow-up studies are required to fully assess the long-term impact.","['Millot, Frederic', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Guilhot, Joelle', 'Petit, Arnaud', 'Leblanc, Thierry', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Mazingue, Francoise', 'Lutz, Patrick', 'Verite, Cecile', 'Berthou, Christian', 'Galambrun, Claire', 'Bernard, Frederic', 'Yacouben, Karima', 'Bordigoni, Pierre', 'Edan, Christine', 'Reguerre, Yves', 'Couillault, Gerard', 'Mechinaud, Francoise', 'Cayuela, Jean-Michel', 'Guilhot, Francois']","['Millot F', 'Baruchel A', 'Guilhot J', 'Petit A', 'Leblanc T', 'Bertrand Y', 'Mazingue F', 'Lutz P', 'Verite C', 'Berthou C', 'Galambrun C', 'Bernard F', 'Yacouben K', 'Bordigoni P', 'Edan C', 'Reguerre Y', 'Couillault G', 'Mechinaud F', 'Cayuela JM', 'Guilhot F']","[""Centre d'Investigation Clinique 802, Institut National de la Santeet de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), University Hospital Poitiers, Poitiers, France. f.millot@chu-poitiers.fr""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase IV', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'France', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/09/21 06:00,['2011/06/15 06:00'],"['2011/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.32.7114 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.32.7114 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Jul 10;29(20):2827-32. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.32.7114.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 489 patients with AML were examined for mutations in DNMT3A by direct sequencing. The prognostic impact of DNMT3A mutations was evaluated in the context of other clinical prognostic markers and genetic risk factors (cytogenetic risk group; mutations in NPM1, FLT3, CEBPA, IDH1, IDH2, MLL1, NRAS, WT1, and WT1 SNPrs16754; expression levels of BAALC, ERG, EVI1, MLL5, MN1, and WT1). RESULTS: DNMT3A mutations were found in 87 (17.8%) of 489 patients with AML who were younger than 60 years of age. Patients with DNMT3A mutations were older, had higher WBC and platelet counts, more often had a normal karyotype and mutations in NPM1, FLT3, and IDH1 genes, and had higher MLL5 expression levels as compared with patients with wild-type DNMT3A. Mutations in DNMT3A independently predicted a shorter overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR], 1.59; 95% CI, 1.15 to 2.21; P = .005) by multivariate analysis, but were not associated with relapse-free survival (RFS) or complete remission (CR) rate when the entire patient cohort was considered. In cytogenetically normal (CN) AML, 27.2% harbored DNMT3A mutations that independently predicted shorter OS (HR = 2.46; 95% CI, 1.58 to 3.83; P < .001) and lower CR rate (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.84; P = .015), but not RFS (P = .32). Within patients with CN-AML, DNMT3A mutations had an unfavorable effect on OS, RFS, and CR rate in NPM1/FLT3-ITD high-risk but not in low-risk patients. CONCLUSION: DNMT3A mutations are frequent in younger patients with AML and are associated with an unfavorable prognosis.","['Thol, Felicitas', 'Damm, Frederik', 'Ludeking, Andrea', 'Winschel, Claudia', 'Wagner, Katharina', 'Morgan, Michael', 'Yun, Haiyang', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Fiedler, Walter', 'Kirchner, Hartmut', 'Heil, Gerhard', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Heuser, Michael']","['Thol F', 'Damm F', 'Ludeking A', 'Winschel C', 'Wagner K', 'Morgan M', 'Yun H', 'Gohring G', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Hoelzer D', 'Lubbert M', 'Kanz L', 'Fiedler W', 'Kirchner H', 'Heil G', 'Krauter J', 'Ganser A', 'Heuser M']","['Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/09/17 06:00,['2011/06/15 06:00'],"['2011/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.35.4894 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.35.4894 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Jul 20;29(21):2889-96. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.35.4894.

The full spectrum of genetic lesions that are present in the CLL genome, and therefore the number and identity of dysregulated cellular pathways, have not been identified. By combining next-generation sequencing and copy number analysis, we show here that the typical CLL coding genome contains <20 clonally represented gene alterations/case, including predominantly nonsilent mutations, and fewer copy number aberrations. These analyses led to the discovery of several genes not previously known to be altered in CLL. Although most of these genes were affected at low frequency in an expanded CLL screening cohort, mutational activation of NOTCH1, observed in 8.3% of CLL at diagnosis, was detected at significantly higher frequency during disease progression toward Richter transformation (31.0%), as well as in chemorefractory CLL (20.8%). Consistent with the association of NOTCH1 mutations with clinically aggressive forms of the disease, NOTCH1 activation at CLL diagnosis emerged as an independent predictor of poor survival. These results provide initial data on the complexity of the CLL coding genome and identify a dysregulated pathway of diagnostic and therapeutic relevance.","['Fabbri, Giulia', 'Rasi, Silvia', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Trifonov, Vladimir', 'Khiabanian, Hossein', 'Ma, Jing', 'Grunn, Adina', 'Fangazio, Marco', 'Capello, Daniela', 'Monti, Sara', 'Cresta, Stefania', 'Gargiulo, Ernesto', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Arcaini, Luca', 'Paulli, Marco', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Larocca, Luigi M', 'Marasca, Roberto', 'Gattei, Valter', 'Oscier, David', 'Bertoni, Francesco', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Foa, Robin', 'Pasqualucci, Laura', 'Rabadan, Raul', 'Dalla-Favera, Riccardo', 'Gaidano, Gianluca']","['Fabbri G', 'Rasi S', 'Rossi D', 'Trifonov V', 'Khiabanian H', 'Ma J', 'Grunn A', 'Fangazio M', 'Capello D', 'Monti S', 'Cresta S', 'Gargiulo E', 'Forconi F', 'Guarini A', 'Arcaini L', 'Paulli M', 'Laurenti L', 'Larocca LM', 'Marasca R', 'Gattei V', 'Oscier D', 'Bertoni F', 'Mullighan CG', 'Foa R', 'Pasqualucci L', 'Rabadan R', 'Dalla-Favera R', 'Gaidano G']","['Institute for Cancer Genetics and the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Treatment Failure']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/09/07 06:00,['2011/06/15 06:00'],"['2011/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20110921 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20110921 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2011 Jul 4;208(7):1389-401. doi: 10.1084/jem.20110921.

On the basis of studies in Drosophila it has been suggested that the separated subunits might also have distinct functions. In this study, we used a genetically engineered mouse line that lacked MLL(C) to show that the MLL(N)-MLL(C) holocomplex is responsible for MLL functions in various developmental processes. The stability of MLL(N) is dependent on its intramolecular interaction with MLL(C), which is mediated through the first and fourth plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers (PHD1 and PHD4) and the phenylalanine/tyrosine-rich (FYRN) domain of MLL(N). Free MLL(N) is destroyed by a mechanism that targets the FYRN domain, whereas free MLL(C) is exported to the cytoplasm and degraded by the proteasome. PHD1 is encoded by an alternatively spliced exon that is occasionally deleted in T-cell leukemia, and its absence produces an MLL mutant protein that is deficient for holocomplex formation. Therefore, this should be a loss-of-function mutant allele, suggesting that the known tumor suppression role of MLL may also apply to the T-cell lineage. Our data demonstrate that the dissociated MLL subunits are subjected to distinct degradation pathways and thus not likely to have separate functions unless the degradation mechanisms are inhibited.","['Yokoyama, Akihiko', 'Ficara, Francesca', 'Murphy, Mark J', 'Meisel, Christian', 'Naresh, Alpana', 'Kitabayashi, Issay', 'Cleary, Michael L']","['Yokoyama A', 'Ficara F', 'Murphy MJ', 'Meisel C', 'Naresh A', 'Kitabayashi I', 'Cleary ML']","['Division of Hematological Malignancy, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan. ayokoyam@ncc.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Phf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Subunits/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/12/20 06:00,['2011/06/15 06:00'],"['2011/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['124/13/2208 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.080523 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2011 Jul 1;124(Pt 13):2208-19. doi: 10.1242/jcs.080523.,,PMC3113671,"['R01 CA055029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA116606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA116606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although manipulation of glucose metabolism may provide a means to specifically eliminate cancer cells, mechanistic links between cell metabolism and apoptosis remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the role and metabolic regulation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1 in cell death upon inhibition of Akt-induced aerobic glycolysis. In the presence of adequate glucose, activated Akt prevented the loss of Mcl-1 expression and protected cells from growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis. Mcl-1 associated with and inhibited the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bim, contributing to cell survival. However, suppression of glucose metabolism led to induction of Bim, decreased expression of Mcl-1, and apoptosis. The proapoptotic Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/Bcl-w inhibitor, ABT-737, shows clinical promise, but Mcl-1 upregulation can promote resistance. Importantly, inhibition of glucose metabolism or mTORC1 overcame Mcl-1-mediated resistance in diffuse large B cell leukemic cells. Together these data show that Mcl-1 protein synthesis is tightly controlled by metabolism and that manipulation of glucose metabolism may provide a mechanism to suppress Mcl-1 expression and sensitize cancer cells to apoptosis.","['Coloff, Jonathan L', 'Macintyre, Andrew N', 'Nichols, Amanda G', 'Liu, Tingyu', 'Gallo, Catherine A', 'Plas, David R', 'Rathmell, Jeffrey C']","['Coloff JL', 'Macintyre AN', 'Nichols AG', 'Liu T', 'Gallo CA', 'Plas DR', 'Rathmell JC']","['Departments of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (EIF4EBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/physiology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Glucose/*metabolism', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Membrane Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Phosphoproteins/physiology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/physiology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/10/04 06:00,['2011/06/15 06:00'],"['2011/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-4531 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-4531 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Aug 1;71(15):5204-13. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-4531.

Along these lines, we have previously demonstrated that the micronutrient selenium increases macrophage production of arachidonic acid (AA)-derived anti-inflammatory 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)) and decreases the proinflammatory PGE(2). Here, we hypothesized that selenium modulated the metabolism of AA by a differential regulation of various prostaglandin (PG) synthases favoring the production of PGD(2) metabolites, Delta(12)-PGJ(2) and 15d-PGJ(2). A dose-dependent increase in the expression of hematopoietic-PGD(2) synthase (H-PGDS) by selenium and a corresponding increase in Delta(12)-PGJ(2) and 15d-PGJ(2) in RAW264.7 macrophages and primary bone marrow-derived macrophages was observed. Studies with organic non-bioavailable forms of selenium and the genetic manipulation of cellular selenium incorporation machinery indicated that selenoproteins were necessary for H-PGDS expression and 15d-PGJ(2) production. Treatment of selenium-deficient macrophages with rosiglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ligand, up-regulated H-PGDS. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated the presence of an active peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-response element in murine Hpgds promoter suggesting a positive feedback mechanism of H-PGDS expression. Alternatively, the expression of nuclear factor-kappaB-dependent thromboxane synthase and microsomal PGE(2) synthase was down-regulated by selenium. Using a Friend virus infection model of murine leukemia, the onset of leukemia was observed only in selenium-deficient and indomethacin-treated selenium-supplemented mice but not in the selenium-supplemented group or those treated with 15d-PGJ(2). These results suggest the importance of selenium in the shunting of AA metabolism toward the production of PGD(2) metabolites, which may have clinical implications.","['Gandhi, Ujjawal H', 'Kaushal, Naveen', 'Ravindra, Kodihalli C', 'Hegde, Shailaja', 'Nelson, Shakira M', 'Narayan, Vivek', 'Vunta, Hema', 'Paulson, Robert F', 'Prabhu, K Sandeep']","['Gandhi UH', 'Kaushal N', 'Ravindra KC', 'Hegde S', 'Nelson SM', 'Narayan V', 'Vunta H', 'Paulson RF', 'Prabhu KS']","['Graduate Program in Molecular Toxicology, Center for Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Lipocalins)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Selenoproteins)', 'EC 5.3.- (Intramolecular Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 5.3.99.2 (prostaglandin R2 D-isomerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'DNA Primers', 'Intramolecular Oxidoreductases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lipocalins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/*enzymology', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'PPAR gamma/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Selenoproteins/*physiology', 'Up-Regulation/*physiology']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/10/11 06:00,['2011/06/15 06:00'],"['2011/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)50352-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.260547 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Aug 5;286(31):27471-82. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.260547.

It is expressed ubiquitously and plays critical roles in growth factor mediated processes, primarily by promoting the activation of the RAS/ERK signaling pathway. Genetic and biochemical studies have identified SHP2 as the first bona fide oncoprotein in the PTP superfamily, and a promising target for anti-cancer and anti-leukemia therapy. Here, we report a structure-based approach to identify SHP2 inhibitors with a novel scaffold. Through sequential virtual screenings and in vitro inhibition assays, a reversible competitive SHP2 inhibitor (C21) was identified. C21 is structurally distinct from all known SHP2 inhibitors. Combining molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy calculation, a most likely binding mode of C21 with SHP2 is proposed, and further validated by site-directed mutagenesis and structure-activity relationship studies. This binding mode is consistent with the observed potency and specificity of C21, and reveals the molecular determinants for further optimization based on the new scaffold.","['Yu, Zhi-Hong', 'Chen, Lan', 'Wu, Li', 'Liu, Sijiu', 'Wang, Lina', 'Zhang, Zhong-Yin']","['Yu ZH', 'Chen L', 'Wu L', 'Liu S', 'Wang L', 'Zhang ZY']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Indiana University School of Medicine, 635 Barnhill Drive, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,9107377,"['0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Benzenesulfonates/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Small Molecule Libraries/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thermodynamics', 'src Homology Domains']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/10/26 06:00,['2011/06/15 06:00'],"['2011/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0960-894X(11)00707-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.05.078 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem Lett. 2011 Jul 15;21(14):4238-42. doi: 10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.05.078.

The Ehrlichia/anaplasma (EA) are an obscure group of obligate parasitic intracellular pathogens that excrete intracellularly a substance called host transcriptional protein, which can alter transcription in cell division. Infection with EA may lead to changes in transcription in proliferating cells, such as those in the marrow, and alter the biology of the products such as T and B cells. Normally 60% of B cells produced in the marrow may be self reactive, but are eliminated before release from the marrow. Changes in transcription could allow self reactive cells to escape into the peripheral circulation and injure normal tissue, creating the dysfunctions which characterize the different immune system diseases and give them their separate identities. A number of studies previously published, and new information presented here, suggest that EA infections may be an underlying, undiagnosed cause for these and other immune system diseases. This hypothesis, long overlooked, has never been subjected to adequate, rigorous study sufficient to prove or disprove its truth. If so, patients may be treated with antibiotics, and marrow transplant manipulations already used in treatment of diseases such as lupus and leukemia may become more effective.","['Kallick, Charles A']",['Kallick CA'],"['Rush University Medical Center, Department of Medicine, 1825 W, Harrison, Chicago, IL 60612, United States.

We have recently demonstrated that canertinib displays anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in human myeloid leukemia cells devoid of ErbB-receptors. The mechanism mediating these effects are however unknown. In this study, we show that canertinib is able to act as a multi-kinase inhibitor by inhibition of several intracellular kinases involved in T-cell signaling such as Akt, Erk1/2 and Zap-70, and reduced Lck protein expression in the human T-cell leukemia cell line Jurkat. Treatment with canertinib at a concentration of 2 muM caused accumulation of Jurkat cells in the G(1) cell cycle phase and increased doses induced apoptosis in a time-dependent manner. Apoptotic signs of treated cells were detected by Annexin V staining and cleavage of PARP, caspase-3, -8, -9, -10 and Bid. A subset of the pro-apoptotic signals mediated by canertinib could be significantly reduced by specific caspase inhibitors. Taken together, these results demonstrate the dual ability of canertinib to downregulate important signaling pathways and to activate caspase-mediated intrinsic apoptosis pathway in human T-cell leukemia cells.","['Trinks, Cecilia', 'Severinsson, Emelie A', 'Holmlund, Birgitta', 'Green, Anna', 'Green, Henrik', 'Jonsson, Jan-Ingvar', 'Hallbeck, Anna-Lotta', 'Walz, Thomas M']","['Trinks C', 'Severinsson EA', 'Holmlund B', 'Green A', 'Green H', 'Jonsson JI', 'Hallbeck AL', 'Walz TM']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.

More importantly, it has shown that stromal cell-derived factor-1a (SDF-1a) significantly increases hERG1 K(+) tail current and a specific hERG1 K(+) channels inhibitor significantly blocks SDF-1a-induced migration of leukemic cells. In this study, we investigated a possible regulatory effect of hERG1 K(+) channels upon SDF-1a-mediated cell proliferation as a mean to uncover new molecular events involved in bone marrow microenvironment and leukemogenesis. RT-PCR showed that SDF-1a enhanced hERG1 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Cell proliferation assay illustrated that SDF-1a promoted cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas this effect was impaired by E-4031. In addition, E-4031 inhibited SDF-1a-stimulated leukemic cell proliferation by inducing G(0)/G(1) arrest. Interestingly, E-4031 promoted SDF-1a-induced apoptosis in HL-60 and leukemic blasts, which markedly impaired the protection effect of SDF-1a in AML. Moreover, SDF-1a increased the expression of Wnt/beta-catenin target genes, including beta-catenin, cyclin-D1, and c-myc; however, this manner was abolished by blockage with the hERG1 K(+) channels. Taken together, our results provide evidence of a novel mechanism involved in the proliferative effects of SDF-1a and highlight hERG1 K(+) channels as a therapeutic target for leukemia treatment and prevention.","['Zheng, Fang', 'Li, Huiyu', 'Du, Wen', 'Huang, Shiang']","['Zheng F', 'Li H', 'Du W', 'Huang S']","['Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels)', '0 (KCNH1 protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '113558-89-7 (E 4031)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*pharmacology', 'Cyclin D1/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels/*genetics/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'beta Catenin/genetics']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/10/05 06:00,['2011/06/15 06:00'],"['2011/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453311X12940641878000 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2011 May;16(3):177-84. doi: 10.1179/102453311X12940641878000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median age of the patients was 30 years. Isolates were collected mostly from bloodstreams (45%) and skin lesions (31.5%). The median time for microbiologic documentation was 8 days (range 0-35 days) from onset of neutropenia. At least 11 patients (16.6%) had recurrent (>/=2) infections.

These disorders generally arise de novo, but may also occur years after exposure to mutagenic chemotherapy. Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities are detected in about 30-50% de novo cases, whereas more than 80% of therapy-related forms harbour such markers. Although in the Western countries, MDS cases are mainly reported in the elderly population and rarely in the paediatric age group; this disease is increasingly seen in young adults in India. Cytogenetic study plays an important role in the diagnosis and is useful for prediction of individual prognosis using the international prognostic scoring system. Specific chromosomal abnormalities, such as -5/5q-, -7/7q-, and complex abnormalities, play an important role in the development of new therapeutic options and clinical management of MDS.

Admissions per hospital and transplantation procedures were obtained. Cox regression models were used to determine risk factors associated with the 12-week overall mortality. With 424 case-patients included, the median incidence/hospital was 0.271/10(3) admissions (range 0.072-0.910) without significant alteration of incidence and seasonality over time. Among the 393 adults (62% men, 56 years (16-84 years)), 15% had proven IA, 78% haematological conditions, and 92.9% had lung involvement. Acute leukaemia (34.6%) and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (21.4%) were major host factors, together with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (21.6%), which emerged as a new high-risk group. The other risk host factors consisted of solid organ transplantation (8.7%), solid tumours (4.3%), systemic inflammatory diseases (4.6%) and chronic respiratory diseases (2.3%). Serum galactomannan tests were more often positive (>/=69%) for acute leukaemia and allogeneic stem cell transplantation than for the others (<42%; p <10(-3)). When positive (n = 245), cultures mainly yielded Aspergillus fumigatus (79.7%). First-line antifungal therapy consisted of voriconazole, caspofungin, lipid formulations of amphotericin, or any combination therapy (52%, 14%, 8% and 19.9%, respectively). Twelve-week overall mortality was 44.8% (95% CI, 39.8-50.0); it was 41% when first-line therapy included voriconazole and 60% otherwise (p <0.001). Independent factors for 12-week mortality were older age, positivity for both culture and galactomannan and central nervous system or pleural involvement, while any strategy containing voriconazole was protective.","['Lortholary, O', 'Gangneux, J-P', 'Sitbon, K', 'Lebeau, B', 'de Monbrison, F', 'Le Strat, Y', 'Coignard, B', 'Dromer, F', 'Bretagne, S']","['Lortholary O', 'Gangneux JP', 'Sitbon K', 'Lebeau B', 'de Monbrison F', 'Le Strat Y', 'Coignard B', 'Dromer F', 'Bretagne S']","['Institut Pasteur, Centre National de Reference Mycologie et Antifongiques, Unite de Mycologie Moleculaire, Paris CNRS URA3012, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Microbiol Infect,Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,9516420,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Mannans)', '11078-30-1 (galactomannan)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillus/classification/isolation & purification', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/methods', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Galactose/analogs & derivatives', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Incidence', 'Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology/*microbiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Mannans/blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Seasons', 'Young Adult']",2011/06/15 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/06/15 06:00'],"['2011/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1111/j.1469-0691.2011.03548.x [doi]', 'S1198-743X(14)61937-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Microbiol Infect. 2011 Dec;17(12):1882-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1469-0691.2011.03548.x.

One explanation for this phenomenon is the interaction between the cell surface receptors CXCR4 and CXCL12. Through CXCL12/CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis, leukemia cells migrate to microscopic niches within the bone marrow, which leads to increased proliferation and survival. Several studies have suggested that increased CXCR4 expression may portend a poor prognosis in various types of leukemia, possibly due to increased protection of leukemia cells by bone marrow stroma. A potential therapeutic strategy to overcome this stromal-mediated survival advantage is to target CXCR4. Inhibition of CXCR4 may allow leukemia cells to be released from bone marrow niches that confer resistance to chemotherapy and negate the survival benefit imparted by bone marrow stroma.","['Sison, Edward Allan R', 'Brown, Patrick']","['Sison EA', 'Brown P']","['Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Peptides/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/10/12 06:00,['2011/06/15 06:00'],"['2011/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/ehm.11.30 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2011 Jun;4(3):271-83. doi: 10.1586/ehm.11.30.,,PMC3131221,"['K23CA111728/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA060441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA060441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA111728/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA111728-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS304445'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This retrospective study is to review 24 cases of NE in a single Chinese tertiary center, to elucidate clinical feature, treatments and outcome for this dangerous gastrointestinal complication of neutropenia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of pediatric patients who were diagnosed with neutropenic enterocolitis from 2000 to 2009 were reviewed. RESULTS: Of 24 cases, the ratio of male to female was 2:1, the mean age was 7.2 years. There were eight cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia, eight cases of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, four cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, one case of severe aplastic anemia, one case of neuroblastoma and two cases of simple neutropenia without underlying cause. The hematologic malignancy was significantly associated with the occurrence of NE (OR = 19.4). Seventeen cases developed NE during anticancer chemotherapy (chemo group), four cases presented with leukemia and one case presented with aplastic anemia before the initiation of chemotherapy and their presenting event leading to diagnosis. Two cases simply presented with NE without definitive reasons (no chemo group). All the patients had the typical clinical presentation, six cases had disseminated peritonitis, toxic shock, and assisted ventilations were necessary in three of these six cases. CT or ultrasound demonstrated bowel wall thickness, paucity of air in the cecum and/or right colon, pneumatosis or pneumoperitoneum. There was no difference in the nadir neutrophil count in patients, who received chemotherapy versus those who did not (P = 0.001), but the recovering time from NE in chemo group (9.3 +/- 1.9) was shorter than non-chemo group (10.7 +/- 5.3, P = 0.034). Sixteen (88.8%) cases have been successfully managed medically, using aggressive hemodynamic support, bowel rest, and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with surgical intervention reversed only for the more severe six cases (25%). Two cases died. CONCLUSION: NE is a life-threatening gastrointestinal complication of neutropenia. Physicians might remain vigilant and consider NE in any neutropenic patient rather than only in oncologic patients. It has typical clinical presentation and CT can provide clear delineation for diagnosis. Early recognition and progressed management have reduced mortality. Most children with NE may be treated without surgery with favorable outcome.","['Li, Kai', 'Zheng, Shan', 'Dong, Kuiran', 'Gao, Yijin', 'Wang, Hongsheng', 'Liu, Gongbao', 'Gao, Jiechun', 'Xiao, Xianmin']","['Li K', 'Zheng S', 'Dong K', 'Gao Y', 'Wang H', 'Liu G', 'Gao J', 'Xiao X']","[""Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Pediatr Surg Int,Pediatric surgery international,8609169,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Digestive System Surgical Procedures/*methods', '*Early Diagnosis', 'Enterocolitis, Neutropenic/*diagnosis/epidemiology/surgery', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Intestines/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/*complications/epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Surgicenters', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Ultrasonography']",2011/06/15 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/06/14 06:00'],"['2011/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00383-011-2938-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Surg Int. 2011 Nov;27(11):1191-5. doi: 10.1007/s00383-011-2938-9.

Combined enzastaurin/suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid treatment synergistically induced apoptosis in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and T-cell lymphoma cell lines, and primary lymphoma/leukemia samples. Similarly, combined treatment of B-cell-like lymphoma cells with enzastaurin and two different HDAC inhibitors, valproic acid and (2E,4E)-6-(4-chlorophenylsulfanyl)-2,4-hexadienoic acid hydroxyamide synergistically induced apoptosis, suggesting the synergy is generalizable to other HDAC inhibitors.

Comparison of the expression profiles of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related genes in U266 multiple myeloma cells after treatment with Phx-3 and the ER stress inducers tunicamycin (TNM) and thapsigargin (TPG) indicated that although TNM and TPG potently induced pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP (GADD153) within 8 h of treatment, Phx-3 induced almost no CHOP within 48 h of treatment in U266 cells. However, murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells and other cancer cell lines (e.g. A549 lung cancer cells and HL-60 acute leukemia cells) exhibited up-regulation of CHOP after treatment with Phx-3. The potency of CHOP induction in response to Phx-3 appeared to be partially correlated with the cytotoxic sensitivity of Phx-3 among various cell lines tested. MEF cells derived from CHOP knockout mice were more resistant to Phx-3 than wild-type MEF cells. Since Phx-3 has been shown to induce activation of NF-kappaB, a transcription factor functioning as a repressor of CHOP, we further treated U266 cells with a combination of Phx-3 and NF-kappaB inhibitors (e.g. BAY11-7082 or parthenolide). This enhanced cytotoxicity along with up-modulation of CHOP in U266 cells. These data suggest that ER stress-mediated CHOP induction by Phx-3 is involved in the cytotoxic effect. Regulation of CHOP expression appears to be a potent therapeutic target for cancer treatment.","['Moriya, Shota', 'Miyazawa, Keisuke', 'Kawaguchi, Tomohiro', 'Che, Xiao-Fang', 'Tomoda, Akio']","['Moriya S', 'Miyazawa K', 'Kawaguchi T', 'Che XF', 'Tomoda A']","['Department of Biochemistry, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (3-(4-methylphenylsulfonyl)-2-propenenitrile)', '0 (Ddit3 protein, mouse)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Oxazines)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Sulfones)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', '1916-59-2 (3-aminophenoxazone)', '2RDB26I5ZB (parthenolide)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Oxazines/*pharmacology', 'Sesquiterpenes/pharmacology', 'Sulfones/pharmacology', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2011/06/15 06:00,2012/01/14 06:00,['2011/06/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2011.1072 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2011 Oct;39(4):981-8. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2011.1072.

Recent studies have shown evidence of cross-lineage transdifferentiation of B cells in follicular lymphoma to histiocytic and dendritic cell sarcomas. In this study, we report the morphologic, molecular and cytogenetic analysis of seven cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) associated with histiocytic and dendritic cell sarcomas. All seven patients were elderly males (median age 71 years). The B-cell neoplasms preceded the development of the histiocytic and dendritic cell sarcomas in six of seven patients, and one patient had both tumors diagnosed at the same time. The tumors included four interdigitating dendritic cell sarcomas: one Langerhans cell sarcoma, one histiocytic sarcoma and one immature neoplasm with evidence of histiocytic origin. Laser-capture microdissection and PCR analysis showed identical clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements in the two phenotypically distinct components in all cases. There was a preferential usage of IGHV4-39 by the V-D-J gene rearrangement. By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, two cases showed deletion 17p in both components, whereas four cases had normal cytogenetic findings by FISH in the CLL/SLL cells, but acquired cytogenetic abnormalities in the corresponding histiocytic and dendritic tumors. Chromosome 17p abnormalities were the most common cytogenetic abnormality detected in the sarcomas, seen in five of six cases studied. Compared with the CLL/SLL cells, the histiocytic/dendritic cells were largely negative for PAX5, but showed strong expression of PU.1 and variable and weak expression of CEBPbeta. Our study provides evidence for transdifferentiation of CLL/SLL B cells to tumors of dendritic and less often histiocytic lineage, and suggests that secondary genetic events may play a role in this phenomenon.","['Shao, Haipeng', 'Xi, Liqiang', 'Raffeld, Mark', 'Feldman, Andrew L', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Knudson, Ryan', 'Rodriguez-Canales, Jaime', 'Hanson, Jeffrey', 'Pittaluga, Stefania', 'Jaffe, Elaine S']","['Shao H', 'Xi L', 'Raffeld M', 'Feldman AL', 'Ketterling RP', 'Knudson R', 'Rodriguez-Canales J', 'Hanson J', 'Pittaluga S', 'Jaffe ES']","['Hematopathology Section, Laboratory of Pathology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (CEBPB protein, human)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/analysis', '*Cell Transdifferentiation', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', '*Dendritic Cell Sarcoma, Interdigitating/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', '*Histiocytic Sarcoma/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', '*Langerhans Cell Sarcoma/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Laser Capture Microdissection', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Maryland', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Trans-Activators/analysis', 'V(D)J Recombination']",2011/06/15 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/06/14 06:00'],"['2011/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol2011102 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2011.102 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2011 Nov;24(11):1421-32. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2011.102.

Intracellular signals activate immuno-responsive cells to produce cytokines that modulate the immune response. Schisandra chinensis has been used traditionally to treat general fatigue, neurasthenia, and spontaneous sweating. In the present study, the effect of constituents of S. chinensis on cytokine release by human monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1) was tested using microparticle-based flow cytometric analysis. Two major lignans, schizandrin (Sch) and gomisin A (Gom A), were identified and shown to induce interleukin (IL)-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta (MIP-1beta), and granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) release by THP-1 cells. By reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or quantitative real-time PCR, there was a dose-dependent increase of IL-8, MIP-1beta and GM-CSF mRNA levels. Thus, Sch and Gom A from S. chinensis enhance cytokine release by THP-1 cells and this effect occurs through mRNA upregulation. Upregulation of MIP-1beta and GM-CSF in particular may have clinical applications. Therefore, S. chinensis may be therapeutically beneficial by promoting humoral and cell-mediated immune responses.","['Lin, Rong-Dih', 'Mao, Yi-Wen', 'Leu, Sy-Jye', 'Huang, Ching-Yi', 'Lee, Mei-Hsien']","['Lin RD', 'Mao YW', 'Leu SJ', 'Huang CY', 'Lee MH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Ho-Ping Branch, Taipei City Hospital, Taipei 100, Taiwan. lmh@tmu.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokines/genetics/metabolism', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/immunology', 'Models, Biological', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Schisandra/*chemistry']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/09/16 06:00,['2011/06/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/07 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules16064836 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules16064836 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2011 Jun 10;16(6):4836-49. doi: 10.3390/molecules16064836.,20110610,PMC6264271,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review, we summarize recent advances in the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of fungal pneumonia and improvement in the outcome of such patients. RECENT FINDINGS: The epidemiology of IMIs in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients has evolved in response to changes in conditioning regimens, increasing use of alternative sources of stem cells and antifungal prophylaxis, among other factors. PCR analysis and serologic tests, used in combination with imaging findings, have improved the timing and accuracy of diagnosis of these infections.Recent guidelines incorporated evidence-based treatment recommendations; however, application in real world situations is often difficult. A new treatment approach known as preemptive therapy, based on screening with biomarkers combined with early clinical and imaging findings, is being compared with the traditional empirical therapy in neutropenic patients with persistent or recurrent fever. The use of new triazoles and prompt diagnosis has contributed to improved outcomes in these patients. In addition, therapeutic drug monitoring may be useful when administering voriconazole. SUMMARY: Evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of fungal pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancies are becoming increasingly institution-specific and patient-specific, integrating host factors, new diagnostic methods, and epidemiologic and pharmacologic considerations.","['Mulanovich, Victor E', 'Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P']","['Mulanovich VE', 'Kontoyiannis DP']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. vmulanov@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Infect Dis,Current opinion in infectious diseases,8809878,,IM,"['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*microbiology/therapy', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/*complications/therapy', 'Pneumonia/*complications/microbiology/therapy']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/11/09 06:00,['2011/06/14 06:00'],"['2011/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/QCO.0b013e3283486d1d [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Infect Dis. 2011 Aug;24(4):323-32. doi: 10.1097/QCO.0b013e3283486d1d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surprisingly, rather than impairing homologous recombination repair (HRR), expression of K1702M resulted in hyper-recombination coinciding with an accumulation of cells in S-G2 and no effect on nonhomologous end-joining. These cells also showed increased RAD51 and RPA nuclear staining. More pronounced effects were seen with a naturally occurring BRCT mutant (M1775R) that also produced elevated levels of ssDNA, in part co-localizing with RPA, in line with excessive DNA resection. M1775R induced unusual, thread-like promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies and clustered RPA foci rather than the typical juxtaposed RPA-PML foci seen with wild-type BRCA1. Interestingly, K1702M hyper-recombination diminished with a second mutation in the BRCA1 RING domain (I26A) known to reduce BRCA1 ubiquitin-ligase activity. Thesein vitro findings correlated with elevated nuclear RAD51 and RPA staining of breast cancer tissue from a patient with the M1775R mutation. Altogether, the disruption of BRCA1 (BRCT)-pS-X-X-F protein binding results in ubiquitination-dependent hyper-recombination via excessive DNA resection and the appearance of atypical PML-NBs. Thus, certain BRCA1 mutations that cause hyper-recombination instead of reduced DSB repair might lead to breast cancer.","['Dever, Seth M', 'Golding, Sarah E', 'Rosenberg, Elizabeth', 'Adams, Bret R', 'Idowu, Michael O', 'Quillin, John M', 'Valerie, Nicholas', 'Xu, Bo', 'Povirk, Lawrence F', 'Valerie, Kristoffer']","['Dever SM', 'Golding SE', 'Rosenberg E', 'Adams BR', 'Idowu MO', 'Quillin JM', 'Valerie N', 'Xu B', 'Povirk LF', 'Valerie K']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Aging (Albany NY),Aging,101508617,"['0 (BRCA1 Protein)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rad51 Recombinase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (RBBP8 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'BRCA1 Protein/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Repair', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases', 'Female', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Rad51 Recombinase/metabolism', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Ubiquitination']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/06/14 06:00'],"['2011/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['100325 [pii]', '10.18632/aging.100325 [doi]']",ppublish,Aging (Albany NY). 2011 May;3(5):515-32. doi: 10.18632/aging.100325.,,PMC3156602,"['R21 NS061748/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA133093/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA16059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES016354/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 NS047463/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA72955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA133093/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21NS061748/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01ES016354/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA040615/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA40615/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P30NS047463/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21ES016636/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 ES016636/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01NS064593/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA072955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS064593/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA085159/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA085159/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['Aging (Albany NY). 2011 May;3(5):461-3.

However, the contribution that Mecom-derived gene products make to normal hematopoiesis remains largely unexplored. To investigate the role of the upstream transcription start site of Mecom in adult hematopoiesis, we created a mouse model with a lacZ knock-in at this site, termed ME(m1), which eliminates Mds1-Evi1 (ME), the longer, PR-domain-containing isoform produced by the gene (also known as PRDM3). beta-galactosidase-marking studies revealed that, within hematopoietic cells, ME is exclusively expressed in the stem cell compartment. ME deficiency leads to a reduction in the number of HSCs and a complete loss of long-term repopulation capacity, whereas the stem cell compartment is shifted from quiescence to active cycling. Genetic exploration of the relative roles of endogenous ME and EVI1 isoforms revealed that ME preferentially rescues long-term HSC defects. RNA-seq analysis in Lin(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) cells (LSKs) of ME(m1) documents near complete silencing of Cdkn1c, encoding negative cell-cycle regulator p57-Kip2. Reintroduction of ME into ME(m1) LSKs leads to normalization of both p57-Kip2 expression and growth control.

Despite advances in understanding the pathogenesis of this disease, little is known about the involvement of oxidative stress. Therefore, this study examined the antioxidant status and the markers of oxidative stress in BLV-infected dairy cows. BLV infection was associated with an increase in triacylglycerol levels, a decrease in glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity and a tendency toward lower superoxide dismutase activity in the infected animals. No significant difference was observed in other markers of oxidative stress (i.e., conjugated dienes, hydroperoxides and malondialdehyde) in the infected animals compared to controls. A novel method for the analysis of oxidative stress, Z-scan based on the measurement of the mean-value of theta in low density lipoprotein indicated that the infected animals had low-density lipoprotein particles that were slightly less modified than those from the healthy group. Thus, we conclude that BLV infection is associated with a selective decrease in GSH-Px activity without any alteration in the common plasma markers of oxidative stress.","['Souza, Fernando N', 'Monteiro, Andrea M', 'dos Santos, Priscilla R', 'Sanchez, Eduardo M Ramos', 'Blagitz, Maiara G', 'Latorre, Andreia O', 'Figueiredo Neto, Antonio M', 'Gidlund, Magnus', 'Della Libera, Alice M M P']","['Souza FN', 'Monteiro AM', 'dos Santos PR', 'Sanchez EM', 'Blagitz MG', 'Latorre AO', 'Figueiredo Neto AM', 'Gidlund M', 'Della Libera AM']","['Department of Clinical Science, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, 05508-270, Brazil. nogueirasouza@yahoo.com.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*blood', 'Female', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/blood', 'Lipids/blood', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/blood', '*Oxidative Stress']",2011/06/15 06:00,2012/01/10 06:00,['2011/06/14 06:00'],"['2011/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/02 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-2427(11)00177-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.05.028 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 2011 Sep 15;143(1-2):162-6. doi: 10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.05.028.

The plasma inhibitory activity (PIA) assay is used clinically to assess FLT3 inhibition ex vivo and guide dosing. AT9283 is a novel Aurora kinase inhibitor with secondary activity against FLT3 and ABL. We adapted the PIA assay to simultaneously detect inhibition of Aurora and FLT3 in AML, and Aurora and ABL in CML by AT9283. Furthermore, we optimized the assay for children, where limited blood volumes are available for pharmacodynamic studies.

In addition, direct cytotoxicity of ctDNA has been found in tissue culture and in mice. In this study, ctDNA and folate receptor targeted cationic liposome complexes (ctDNA-F-CLs) were prepared and evaluated in FR (+) tumors. In addition, the underlying mechanism for the anti-cancer activity of ctDNA-F-CLs was investigated. Selective uptake of ctDNA-F-CLs was observed in FR (+) KB and L1210JF cells using flow cytometry. In RAW264.7 cells and DBA/2 mice, ctDNA-F-CLs and ctDNA-N-CLs significantly induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 production compared to free ctDNA. However, no significant difference in cytokine production was observed between ctDNA-N-CLs and ctDNA-F-CLs. In tumor bearing DBA/2 mice, ctDNA-F-CLs significantly increased INF-gamma and IL-6 production compared to ctDNA-N-CLs. Furthermore in L1210JF cells, ctDNA-F-CLs had significantly increased cytotoxicity compared to ctDNA-N-CLs. Tumor cell apoptosis was also found in co-culture of RAW264.7 cells and ctDNA-F-CLs treated L1210JF cells. In L1210JF tumor bearing mice, ctDNA-F-CLs were found to significantly inhibit tumor growth and prolong the median survival time (MeST). In contrast, ctDNA-N-CLs and free ctDNA showed similar activities for tumor inhibition and animal survival. Moreover, the anti-cancer effect of ctDNA-F-CL was further enhanced by combination with anti-cancer drug doxorubicin. These results suggest that ctDNA-F-CLs are a promising agent for treatment of FR-positive tumors.","['Li, Hong', 'Piao, Longzhu', 'Yu, Bo', 'Yung, Bryant C', 'Zhang, Wenpeng', 'Wang, Peng G', 'Lee, James L', 'Lee, Robert J']","['Li H', 'Piao L', 'Yu B', 'Yung BC', 'Zhang W', 'Wang PG', 'Lee JL', 'Lee RJ']","['Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Department of Chemical, Biomolecular Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'NSF Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center (NSEC), The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Chemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Chemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Department of Chemical, Biomolecular Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'NSF Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center (NSEC), The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'NSF Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center (NSEC), The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biomaterials,Biomaterials,8100316,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cations)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Liposomes)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '91080-16-9 (calf thymus DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cations', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'DNA/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored/*metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Liposomes/*chemistry/toxicity', 'Macrophages/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/11/10 06:00,['2011/06/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.05.037 [doi]', 'S0142-9612(11)00556-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Biomaterials. 2011 Sep;32(27):6614-20. doi: 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.05.037.

The course of the disease is characterized by neurologic manifestations, infections, and cancers. OBJECTIVE: We studied A-T progression and investigated whether manifestations were associated with the ATM genotype. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study in France of 240 patients with A-T born from 1954 to 2005 and analyzed ATM mutations in 184 patients, along with neurologic manifestations, infections, and cancers. RESULTS: Among patients with A-T, the Kaplan-Meier 20-year survival rate was 53.4%; the prognosis for these patients has not changed since 1954. Life expectancy was lower among patients with mutations in ATM that caused total loss of expression or function of the gene product (null mutations) compared with that seen in patients with hypomorphic mutations because of earlier onset of cancer (mainly hematologic malignancies). Cancer (hazard ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6-4.5) and respiratory tract infections (hazard ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4-3.8) were independently associated with mortality. Cancer (hazard ratio, 5.8; 95% CI, 2.9-11.6) was a major risk factor for mortality among patients with null mutations, whereas respiratory tract infections (hazard ratio, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.8-9.1) were the leading cause of death among patients with hypomorphic mutations. CONCLUSION: Morbidity and mortality among patients with A-T are associated with ATM genotype. This information could improve our prognostic ability and lead to adapted therapeutic strategies.","['Micol, Romain', 'Ben Slama, Lilia', 'Suarez, Felipe', 'Le Mignot, Loic', 'Beaute, Julien', 'Mahlaoui, Nizar', ""Dubois d'Enghien, Catherine"", 'Lauge, Anthony', 'Hall, Janet', 'Couturier, Jerome', 'Vallee, Louis', 'Delobel, Bruno', 'Rivier, Francois', 'Nguyen, Karine', 'Billette de Villemeur, Thierry', 'Stephan, Jean-Louis', 'Bordigoni, Pierre', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Aladjidi, Nathalie', 'Pedespan, Jean-Michel', 'Thomas, Caroline', 'Pellier, Isabelle', 'Koenig, Michel', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Picard, Capucine', 'Moshous, Despina', 'Neven, Benedicte', 'Lanternier, Fanny', 'Blanche, Stephane', 'Tardieu, Marc', 'Debre, Marianne', 'Fischer, Alain', 'Stoppa-Lyonnet, Dominique']","['Micol R', 'Ben Slama L', 'Suarez F', 'Le Mignot L', 'Beaute J', 'Mahlaoui N', ""Dubois d'Enghien C"", 'Lauge A', 'Hall J', 'Couturier J', 'Vallee L', 'Delobel B', 'Rivier F', 'Nguyen K', 'Billette de Villemeur T', 'Stephan JL', 'Bordigoni P', 'Bertrand Y', 'Aladjidi N', 'Pedespan JM', 'Thomas C', 'Pellier I', 'Koenig M', 'Hermine O', 'Picard C', 'Moshous D', 'Neven B', 'Lanternier F', 'Blanche S', 'Tardieu M', 'Debre M', 'Fischer A', 'Stoppa-Lyonnet D']","['CEREDIH, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, 75743 Paris Cedex 15, France. romain.micol@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia/epidemiology/*genetics/*mortality/physiopathology', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics', 'Male', 'Morbidity', 'Mutation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/10/25 06:00,['2011/06/14 06:00'],"['2010/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0091-6749(11)00750-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaci.2011.03.052 [doi]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2011 Aug;128(2):382-9.e1. doi: 10.1016/j.jaci.2011.03.052.

In this study, we first explored the differentially expressed genes between MLL-PTD and tMLL using gene expression profiling of our cohort (15 MLL-PTD and 10 tMLL) and one published data set. The top 250 probes were chosen from each set, resulting in 29 common probes (21 unique genes) to both sets. The selected genes include four HOXB genes, HOXB2, B3, B5, and B6. The expression values of these HOXB genes significantly differ between MLL-PTD and tMLL cases. Clustering and classification analyses were thoroughly conducted to support our gene selection results. Second, as MLL-PTD, FLT3-ITD, and NPM1 mutations are identified in AML with normal karyotypes, we briefly studied their impact on the HOXB genes. Another contribution of this study is to demonstrate that using public data from other studies enriches samples for analysis and yields more conclusive results.","['Liu, Hsi-Che', 'Shih, Lee-Yung', 'May Chen, Mei-Ju', 'Wang, Chien-Chih', 'Yeh, Ting-Chi', 'Lin, Tung-Huei', 'Chen, Chien-Yu', 'Lin, Chih-Jen', 'Liang, Der-Cherng']","['Liu HC', 'Shih LY', 'May Chen MJ', 'Wang CC', 'Yeh TC', 'Lin TH', 'Chen CY', 'Lin CJ', 'Liang DC']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet,Cancer genetics,101539150,"['0 (HOXB2 protein, human)', '0 (HOXB5 protein, human)', '0 (HOXB6 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (HoxB3 protein, human)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Duplication', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/08/16 06:00,['2011/06/14 06:00'],"['2010/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/18 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S2210-7762(11)00022-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergen.2011.02.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet. 2011 May;204(5):252-9. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergen.2011.02.003.,,,,,,['2011 Elsevier Inc.

Many patients with cancer predisposition syndromes experience excess toxicity with standard therapeutic regimens and are at lifelong risk for development of additional cancers and must be followed closely; early diagnosis is crucial for appropriate management of these patients. This review describes specific leukemia-predisposing conditions, including the clinical and historical findings that should trigger testing for these syndromes, and discusses recent insights into the management of these disorders. Disorders are organized by mechanism: (1) DNA damage repair defects, including Fanconi anemia, ataxia-telangiectasia, Nijmegen breakage syndrome, and Bloom syndrome; (2) cell cycle and differentiation defects, such as neurofibromatosis type 1, Noonan and Noonan-like syndromes, and severe congenital neutropenia; (3) the hereditary transcription factor syndromes familial platelet disorder with predisposition to myeloid malignancy and CEBPA deficiency; and (4) aneuploidy-associated leukemia predisposition, exemplified by Down syndrome. Identifying the specific mechanisms underlying these relatively rare conditions allows for better understanding of leukemogenesis and development of targeted therapies that benefit a much broader population than simply those with genetic predispositions to leukemia.","['Seif, Alix E']",['Seif AE'],"[""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA. seifa@email.chop.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Genet,Cancer genetics,101539150,,IM,"['Causality', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'DNA Repair-Deficiency Disorders/*complications/genetics', 'Down Syndrome/complications/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Leukemia/complications/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Neurofibromatosis 1/complications/genetics', 'Neutropenia/complications/congenital/genetics', 'Noonan Syndrome/complications/genetics']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/08/16 06:00,['2011/06/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S2210-7762(11)00114-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergen.2011.04.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet. 2011 May;204(5):227-44. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergen.2011.04.005.,,,,,,['2011 Elsevier Inc.

PURPOSE: Using data from the UN cancer database, GLOBOCAN, this study will determine whether a relationship exists for latitude and ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiance with incidence rates of leukemia in 175 countries. METHODS: Multiple regression was used to analyze the independent association between UVB and age-adjusted incidence rates of leukemia in 139 countries in 2002. This study controlled for dietary data on intake of energy from animal sources and per capita healthcare expenditures. The analyses were performed in 2009. RESULTS: People residing in the highest-latitude countries had the highest rates of leukemia in both men (R(2)=0.34, p<0.0001) and women (R(2)=0.24, p<0.0001). In men, UVB was independently inversely associated with leukemia incidence rates (p</=0.001), whereas animal energy consumption (p=0.02) and per capita healthcare expenditures (p</=0.0001) were independently positively associated (R(2) for model=0.61, p</=0.0001). In women, UVB adjusted for cloud cover was independently inversely associated with leukemia incidence rates (p</=0.01), whereas animal energy consumption (p</=0.05) and per capita healthcare expenditures (p=0.0002) were independently positively associated (R(2) for model=0.51, p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Countries with low UVB had higher age-adjusted incidence rates of leukemia. This suggests the possibility that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D status, because of lower levels of UVB, somehow might predict the development of leukemia.","['Mohr, Sharif B', 'Garland, Cedric F', 'Gorham, Edward D', 'Grant, William B', 'Garland, Frank C']","['Mohr SB', 'Garland CF', 'Gorham ED', 'Grant WB', 'Garland FC']","['Division of Epidemiology, Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, 92093-0631, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Am J Prev Med,American journal of preventive medicine,8704773,"['1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', 'A288AR3C9H (25-hydroxyvitamin D)']",IM,"['Databases, Factual', 'Energy Intake', 'Female', 'Health Expenditures/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Meat', 'Regression Analysis', 'Sex Factors', '*Ultraviolet Rays', 'Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/blood', 'Vitamin D Deficiency/complications/*epidemiology']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/10/14 06:00,['2011/06/14 06:00'],"['2010/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0749-3797(11)00259-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.amepre.2011.04.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Prev Med. 2011 Jul;41(1):68-74. doi: 10.1016/j.amepre.2011.04.003.,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2011.

Nevertheless, preclinical and clinical studies demonstrated that TKI also exhibit ""off-target"" effects, that is effects not mediated by the assumed mechanisms of action. We and others showed that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib exert potent antineoplastic effects on EGFR-negative myeloblasts from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we undertook a side-by-side comparison of the anti-leukemic efficacy of four different TKI in MDS and AML. Besides the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib, which served as a point of reference, we employed the dual EGFR/HER2 TKI lapatinib, as well as the multikinase inhibitors dasatinib and sorafenib. All four drugs had anti-leukemic effects on cell line models of MDS/AML in vitro as well as on malignant blasts from MDS/AML patients ex vivo. We explored the biological phenomena underlying this anti-leukemic efficacy. Since it is established that a therapeutic benefit in MDS/AML can be conveyed by induction of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and/or differentiation, we deciphered the individual contribution of these three phenomena to the anti-leukemic action of each of the four TKI. The concomitant assessment of the panel of TKI enables us thus to define (and quantify) their differential capacity to impact on the three biological phenomena, and provide further evidence that these mechanisms are not solely explained by on-target effects.","['Lainey, Elodie', 'Thepot, Sylvain', 'Bouteloup, Cyrielle', 'Sebert, Marie', 'Ades, Lionel', 'Tailler, Maximilien', 'Gardin, Claude', 'de Botton, Stephane', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Kroemer, Guido', 'Boehrer, Simone']","['Lainey E', 'Thepot S', 'Bouteloup C', 'Sebert M', 'Ades L', 'Tailler M', 'Gardin C', 'de Botton S', 'Baruchel A', 'Fenaux P', 'Kroemer G', 'Boehrer S']","['INSERM, U848, 94805 Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Leukocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/12/17 06:00,['2011/06/14 06:00'],"['2011/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/11 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(11)00324-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2011.05.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2011 Nov 15;82(10):1457-66. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2011.05.011.

Here we show that CIITA promoter accessibility in T-cells is epigenetically regulated. In unstimulated T-cells, CIITA-PIII chromatin displays relative high levels of repressive histone methylation marks (3Me-K27-H3 and 3Me-K20-H4) and low levels of acetylated histones H3 (Ac-H3) and H4 (Ac-H4). These repressive histone marks are replaced by histone methylation marks associated with transcriptional active genes (3Me-K4-H3) and high levels of Ac-H3 and Ac-H4 in activated T-cells. This is associated with concomitant recruitment of RNA polymerase II. In T-leukemia cells, devoid of CIITA expression, similar repressive histone methylation marks and low levels of acetylated histone H3 correlated with lack of CIITA expression. This in contrast to CIITA expressing T-lymphoma cells, which display high levels of Ac-H3 and 3Me-K4-H3, and relative low levels of the 3Me-K27-H3 and 3Me-K20-H4 marks. Of interest was the observation that the levels of histone acetylation and methylation modifications in histones H3 and H4 were also noted in chromatin of the downstream CIITA-PIV promoter as well as the upstream CIITA-PI and CIITA-PII promoters both in normal T-cells and in malignant T-cells. Together our data show that CIITA chromatin in T-cells expressing CIITA display similar histone acetylation and methylation characteristics associated with an open chromatin structure. The opposite is true for T-cells lacking CIITA expression, which display histone modifications characteristic of condensed chromatin.","['van Eggermond, Marja C J A', 'Boom, Daniel R', 'Klous, Petra', 'Schooten, Erik', 'Marquez, Victor E', 'Wierda, Rutger J', 'Holling, Tjadine M', 'van den Elsen, Peter J']","['van Eggermond MC', 'Boom DR', 'Klous P', 'Schooten E', 'Marquez VE', 'Wierda RJ', 'Holling TM', 'van den Elsen PJ']","['Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (MHC class II transactivator protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Base Sequence', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/12/17 06:00,['2011/06/14 06:00'],"['2011/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(11)00359-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2011.05.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2011 Nov 15;82(10):1430-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2011.05.026.

METHODS: Two Markov models were built, using published results on progression-free survival (PFS) in patients receiving first- or second-line therapy with R-FC vs FC, rates of disease progression and mortality rates in Spain. Patient-elicited utilities were applied to PFS and progressed health states. The cost of drugs, supportive care, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were estimated over a 10-year period. Univariate and probabilistic (Monte Carlo) sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The addition of rituximab to chemotherapy in first- and second-line therapy increased life-years gained (LYG) and QALYs compared with chemotherapy. The incremental cost per LYG and QALY gained was euro20,703 and euro19,343 for first-line treatment and was euro23,183 and euro24,781 for second-line treatment. CONCLUSION: In patients with previously untreated or relapsed/refractory CLL, the addition of rituximab to the FC regimen increased life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy.

We previously found that LtxA preferentially targets WBCs with high levels of activated LFA-1, which is characteristic of many leukemias and lymphomas, and showed that LtxA exhibits significant anti-leukemia activity in vivo using the humanized SCID mouse model. In this report, we demonstrate that LtxA induces very rapid (1h) apoptosis in acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells characterized by binding of annexin V to cells, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, depletion of cellular ATP, and fragmentation of chromosomal DNA. We tested the activity of LtxA in combination with the standard chemotherapeutic agents, etoposide, mitoxantrone, daunorubicin, busulfan, and imatinib against several leukemia cell lines, including THP-1, GDM-1, HL-60, and KU-812 cells. LtxA exhibited synergism with all the drugs, and the levels of synergy were dependent on the doses used and cell lines examined. In general, the greatest level of synergy was observed with LtxA and etoposide or imatinib. Combination index (CI) values were less than 0.1 for many of the combinations, indicating very strong synergism. In addition, LtxA alone was cytotoxic to primary cells from newly diagnosed, relapsed, and refractory patients with different hematological malignancies. Thus, LtxA is highly effective at inducing rapid apoptosis both as a single agent and in combination with approved leukemia therapies.","['Gupta, Anukriti', 'Le, Amy', 'Belinka, Benjamin A', 'Kachlany, Scott C']","['Gupta A', 'Le A', 'Belinka BA', 'Kachlany SC']","['Department of Oral Biology, New Jersey Dental School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (leukotoxin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Exotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocytes/drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/12/15 06:00,['2011/06/14 06:00'],"['2011/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/06 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(11)00250-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2011.05.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2011 Nov;35(11):1498-505. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2011.05.017.

STUDY DESIGN: Ten women recruited to the study were given mifepristone 5 mg beginning 15 days after initiation of menses. In Group A, five women were administered mifepristone every day for three cycles; in Group B, five women were administered mifepristone every other day for three cycles. The effects on the menstrual cycle and endometrial development were investigated. RESULTS: Following these treatments with mifepristone 5 mg, there was slight suppression of ovulation in both treatment cycles compared with control cycles. The follicular phase in subsequent cycles was prolonged after daily treatment with mifepristone, which was not observed after administration every other day. In addition, continuous treatment increased progesterone receptor (PR) expression and reduced leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) expression in the endometrial epithelium. CONCLUSION: Treatment with low-dose mifepristone every day or every other day starting 15 days after initiation of menses retards endometrial development and impairs endometrial receptivity but has minor effects on the menstrual cycle.","['Chen, Yuezhou', 'Wang, Wen', 'Zhuang, Yaling', 'Chen, Xiuying', 'Huang, Lili']","['Chen Y', 'Wang W', 'Zhuang Y', 'Chen X', 'Huang L']","[""Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 1 Xueshi Road, Hangzhou, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Contraception,Contraception,0234361,"['0 (Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic/*administration & dosage', 'Endometrium/*drug effects/growth & development/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Menstrual Cycle/*drug effects', 'Mifepristone/*administration & dosage', 'Ovulation/*drug effects', 'Receptors, Progesterone/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/10/25 06:00,['2011/06/14 06:00'],"['2010/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2010/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0010-7824(10)00694-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.contraception.2010.12.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Contraception. 2011 Jul;84(1):64-70. doi: 10.1016/j.contraception.2010.12.001.

We analyzed the clinical outcomes of CBT for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Japan and identified the risk factors for the transplant outcomes. From 1997 to 2006, 332 children with ALL underwent CBT from unrelated donors, 270 of which had no prior transplant. Their disease statuses at transplant were first complete remission (CR) (n = 120), second CR (n = 71), and more advanced stages (n = 75). As preconditioning for SCT, total body irradiation (TBI) was given to 194 patients and, for the prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), methotrexate (MTX) was given to 159 patients. The cumulative incidents of neutrophil and platelet recovery (>20 K) were 88.5% and 78.4%, respectively. The incidents of grade II-IV, III-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD), and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) were 45.6%, 20.4%, and 19.2%, respectively, and treatment-related mortality was 22.6%. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) at CR1, CR2, and advanced status were 47.4%, 45.5%, 15.0%, and 63.7%, 59.7%, and 20.7%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that MTX with calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) was associated with decreased incidence of grade II-IV GVHD (CNI alone: hazard ratio [HR] = 1.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-2.83, P = .027; CNI + prednisolone (PSL), HR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.03-2.50, P = .036), III-IV aGVHD (CNI alone: HR = 3.02, 95% CI = 1.55-5.91, P = 0.001; CNI + PSL, HR = 1.89, 95% CI = 0.93-3.83, P = .078), or cGVHD (CNI alone: HR = 1.78, 95% CI = 0.83-3.82, P = .143; CNI + PSL, HR = 2.44, 95% CI = 1.24-4.82, P = .01), compared with CNI alone or CNI + PSL. At an advanced stage of disease, GVHD prophylaxis with MTX + CNI is associated with improved OS compared with CNI alone (CNI alone: HR = 3.20, 95% CI = 1.43-7.15, P = .005; CNI + PSL, HR = 1.47, CI = 0.67-3.20, P = .332).

Aberrant regulation of E-twenty-six (ETS) specific transcription factors such as PU.1 (SPI1) is thought to play a major role in this type of leukemia. The importance of these factors in normal blood development is highlighted by the fact that numerous studies showed a direct link between hematopoietic defects and aberrant regulation of ETS factor expression or expression of mutant forms. Apart from PU.1, another ETS factor, ERG, has emerged as a key player in normal hematopoiesis.

Both stem cell intrinsic factors and extrinsic factors associated with an aging micro-environment could contribute to aging of the hematopoietic system.

Therefore, other alternatives should be pursued to treat leukemia. RESULTS: It is shown that vitamin K3- or vitamin C- induced apoptosis in leukemia cells by oxidative stress mechanism involving superoxide anion radical and hydrogen peroxide generation, activation of NF-kappaB, p53, c-Jun, protease caspase-3 activation and mitochondria depolarization leading to nuclei fragmentation. Cell death was more prominent when Jurkat and K562 cells are exposed to VC and VK3 in a ratio 1000:1 (10 mM: 10 muM) or 100:1 (300 muM: 3 muM), respectively. CONCLUSION: We provide for the first time in vitro evidence supporting a causative role for oxidative stress in VK3- and VC-induced apoptosis in Jurkat and K562 cells in a domino-like mechanism. Altogether these data suggest that VK3 and VC should be useful in the treatment of leukemia.","['Bonilla-Porras, Angelica R', 'Jimenez-Del-Rio, Marlene', 'Velez-Pardo, Carlos']","['Bonilla-Porras AR', 'Jimenez-Del-Rio M', 'Velez-Pardo C']","['School of Medicine, Medical Research Institute, University of Antioquia (UdeA), Calle 62 # 52-59, Building 1, Laboratory 411/412; SIU- Medellin, Colombia. carlos.velez@neurociencias.udea.edu.co.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,2011/06/15 06:00,2011/06/15 06:01,['2011/06/14 06:00'],"['2011/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/15 06:01 [medline]']","['1475-2867-11-19 [pii]', '10.1186/1475-2867-11-19 [doi]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2011 Jun 10;11:19. doi: 10.1186/1475-2867-11-19.,20110610,PMC3127817,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Point mutations were detected in 36 of 154 patients by direct sequencing. In our series, the single most common mutations were G250E, E255K/V, and M351T. The presence of mutations correlated significantly with accelerated phase, lack of molecular response, and lower cytogenetic and hematological responses. While overall survival did not differ between patients with or without mutations, the probability of progression was higher in patients with mutations. Cases with non-P-loop mutations showed a significantly better overall survival from diagnosis. Multivariate analysis showed that the most significant variables related to the development of mutations were accelerated phase, duration of imatinib treatment, and time delay to starting imatinib. Our results demonstrated that mutation frequency increased with the progression of disease, and suggest that imatinib treatment should be started early.","['Bengio, Raquel M', 'Riva, Maria E', 'Moiraghi, Beatriz', 'Lanari, Emilio', 'Milone, Jorge', 'Ventriglia, Veronica', 'Bullorsky, Eduardo', 'Tezanos Pinto, Miguel de', 'Murro, Hector', 'Bianchini, Michele', 'Larripa, Irene']","['Bengio RM', 'Riva ME', 'Moiraghi B', 'Lanari E', 'Milone J', 'Ventriglia V', 'Bullorsky E', 'Tezanos Pinto Md', 'Murro H', 'Bianchini M', 'Larripa I']","['Instituto de Investigaciones Hematologicas, Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina. mutaciones2@yahoo.com.ar']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Argentina', 'Benzamides', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/12/21 06:00,['2011/06/14 06:00'],"['2011/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.578310 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Sep;52(9):1720-6. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.578310.

METHODS: We searched for HCL-associated mutations by performing massively parallel sequencing of the whole exome of leukemic and matched normal cells purified from the peripheral blood of an index patient with HCL. Findings were validated by Sanger sequencing in 47 additional patients with HCL. RESULTS: Whole-exome sequencing identified five missense somatic clonal mutations that were confirmed on Sanger sequencing, including a heterozygous mutation in BRAF that results in the BRAF V600E variant protein. Since BRAF V600E is oncogenic in other tumors, further analyses were focused on this genetic lesion. The same BRAF mutation was noted in all the other 47 patients with HCL who were evaluated by means of Sanger sequencing. None of the 195 patients with other peripheral B-cell lymphomas or leukemias who were evaluated carried the BRAF V600E variant, including 38 patients with splenic marginal-zone lymphomas or unclassifiable splenic lymphomas or leukemias. In immunohistologic and Western blot studies, HCL cells expressed phosphorylated MEK and ERK (the downstream targets of the BRAF kinase), indicating a constitutive activation of the RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in HCL. In vitro incubation of BRAF-mutated primary leukemic hairy cells from 5 patients with PLX-4720, a specific inhibitor of active BRAF, led to a marked decrease in phosphorylated ERK and MEK. CONCLUSIONS; The BRAF V600E mutation was present in all patients with HCL who were evaluated. This finding may have implications for the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and targeted therapy of HCL.

In addition to its association with ARJP, loss of heterozygosity of parkin has been found in several types of malignant tumors, including ovarian, breast, and hepatocellular tumors. Abnormal methylation of parkin promoter was observed in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia in lymphoid blast crisis. We hypothesized that hypermethylation of the parkin promoter might reduce the expression of parkin, which would contribute to the pathogenesis of parkinson's disease (PD) in idiopathic patients and parkin heterozygotes. In this study, we analyzed samples from 17 PD patients with heterozygous parkin mutations, 17 PD patients without parkin mutations, and 10 normal controls. We determined the levels of methylation of the parkin gene promoter in each group using bisulfite genomic sequencing of a region containing 33 CpG sites in the CpG island of the parkin promoter. The methylation levels indicated hypomethylation, and there were no significant differences in the incidence of CpG site methylation among three groups (P > 0.05). These results suggest that the methylation mechanism is unlikely to play a role in the pathogenesis and development of PD.","['Cai, Miao', 'Tian, Jun', 'Zhao, Guo-hua', 'Luo, Wei', 'Zhang, Bao-rong']","['Cai M', 'Tian J', 'Zhao GH', 'Luo W', 'Zhang BR']","['Department of Neurology, Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Neurosci,The International journal of neuroscience,0270707,"['EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (parkin protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Parkinson Disease/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics']",2011/06/15 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/14 06:00'],"['2011/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/00207454.2011.580866 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Neurosci. 2011 Sep;121(9):497-502. doi: 10.3109/00207454.2011.580866.

Through stress-induced activation, p53 accumulates and triggers the expression of target genes that protect the genetic integrity of all cells including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). These protective mechanisms include cell-cycle arrest, DNA repair, induction of apoptosis, or initiation of senescence. In addition to its function under stress conditions, p53 has important functions during steady-state hematopoiesis, regulating HSC quiescence and self-renewal. In addition, it appears that p53 levels affect HSC competition for the hematopoietic niche, with the less p53 activated HSCs preferentially surviving. The specific genes and precise mechanisms underlying p53's effects on normal HSCs are slowly being clarified. p53 also plays an important role in leukemia stem cell (LSC) behavior, with p53 loss affecting drug resistance and disease progression. Pharmacologic activation of p53 function could overcome the adverse impact of p53 inactivation in LSCs. Thus, understanding the p53 regulatory mechanisms active in HSCs and LSCs may promote the development of new therapeutic strategies that could eliminate the population of largely quiescent LSCs.","['Asai, Takashi', 'Liu, Yan', 'Bae, Narae', 'Nimer, Stephen D']","['Asai T', 'Liu Y', 'Bae N', 'Nimer SD']","['Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Lineage', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",2011/06/11 06:00,2011/08/19 06:00,['2011/06/11 06:00'],"['2011/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.22561 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2011 Sep;226(9):2215-21. doi: 10.1002/jcp.22561.,,PMC3081536,"['R01 DK052208/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK052208-12/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 DK052208/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK52208/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS260448'],,"['Copyright (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies have shown that effector memory T (T(EM) ) cells do not cause GVHD but are capable of immune functions post-transplant, including graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects, but the reasons for this are unclear. In mice, the T(EM) pool may have a less diverse T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire than naive T (T(N) ) cells with fewer alloreactive clones. We therefore tested whether enhancing the alloreactivity of T(EM) cells would restore their ability to cause GVHD. In an MHC-matched system, alloreactive T(EM) cells were created by transferring GVHD effector cells into syngeneic recipients and allowing conversion to T(EM) cells. Upon retransfer to freshly transplanted recipients, these cells caused only mild GVHD. Similarly, in an MHC-mismatched system, T(EM) cells with a proven increased precursor frequency of alloreactive clones only caused limited GVHD. Nonetheless, these same cells mounted strong in vitro alloresponses and caused rapid skin graft rejection. T(EM) cells created from CD4(+) T cells that had undergone lymphopenia-induced proliferation (LIP) also caused only mild GVHD. Our findings establish that conversion to T(EM) cells significantly reduces GVHD potency, even in cells with a substantially enhanced alloreactive repertoire.","['Anderson, Britt E', 'Tang, Anita L', 'Wang, Ying', 'Froicu, Monica', 'Rothstein, David', 'McNiff, Jennifer M', 'Jain, Dhanpat', 'Demetris, Anthony J', 'Farber, Donna L', 'Shlomchik, Warren D', 'Shlomchik, Mark J']","['Anderson BE', 'Tang AL', 'Wang Y', 'Froicu M', 'Rothstein D', 'McNiff JM', 'Jain D', 'Demetris AJ', 'Farber DL', 'Shlomchik WD', 'Shlomchik MJ']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520-8035, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,['0 (Isoantigens)'],IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism/pathology/transplantation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor/genetics', 'Graft Rejection/genetics', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory/genetics', 'Isoantigens/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Mice', '*Postoperative Complications', 'Skin Transplantation', 'T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/*metabolism/pathology/transplantation']",2011/06/11 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/11 06:00'],"['2011/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.201141678 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2011 Sep;41(9):2782-92. doi: 10.1002/eji.201141678.

The result of this abnormality is the BCR-ABL protein, a constitutively active kinase involved in cell signaling and survival. When managed with multiagent chemotherapy regimens alone, patients have traditionally had an inferior outcome in terms of remission duration and overall survival when compared with patients who are Philadelphia chromosome-negative. Small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib and dasatinib, directly inhibit the BCR-ABL kinase, offering a targeted approach as a therapeutic option. As a result of several clinical trials with adequate follow-up, imatinib combined with chemotherapy represents the current standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed disease. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation has previously been the only modality to offer the potential for a cure, and it still should be considered for all patients deemed able to tolerate such an intervention. Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as dasatinib, may further improve the outcome in these patients.

The optimal use of this compound will require a probe to identify tumour cells expressing a highly active PTS that might be more sensitive to the treatment. The aim of this study was to design and characterize a scintigraphic probe to evaluate its uptake in cancer cells expressing the PTS. METHODS: Three polyamines coupled to a hydrazinonicotinamide (HYNIC) moiety were synthesized and labelled with 99mTc. Their radiochemical purity was determined by HPLC. The plasma stability of the 99mTc-HYNIC-spermine probe and its capacity to accumulate into PTS-active cells were also evaluated. In vitro internalization was tested using murine melanoma B16/F10 cells and human lung carcinoma A549 cells. Biodistribution was determined in healthy mice and tumour uptake was studied in B16/F10 tumour-bearing mice. A HL-60-Luc human leukaemia model was used to confront single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images obtained with the 99mTc-labelled probe with those obtained by bioluminescence. RESULTS: The 99mTc-HYNIC-spermine probe was selected for its capacity to accumulate into PTS-active cells and its stability in plasma. In vitro studies demonstrated that the probe was internalized in the cells via the PTS. In vivo measurements indicated a tumour to muscle scintigraphic ratio of 7.9+/-2.8.

Although many reports have shown that emodin exhibits anticancer activity in many tumor cell types, there is no available information addressing emodin-affected apoptotic responses in the murine leukemia cell line (WEHI-3) and modulation of the immune response in leukemia mice. We investigated that emodin induced cytotoxic effects in vitro and affected WEHI-3 cells in vivo. This study showed that emodin decreased viability and induced DNA fragmentation in WEHI-3 cells. Cells after exposure to emodin for 24 h have shown chromatin condensation and DNA damage. Emodin stimulated the productions of ROS and Ca(2+) and reduced the level of DeltaPsi(m) by flow cytometry. Our results from Western blotting suggest that emodin triggered apoptosis of WEHI-3 cells through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, caspase cascade-dependent and -independent mitochondrial pathways. In in vivo study, emodin enhanced the levels of B cells and monocytes, and it also reduced the weights of liver and spleen compared with leukemia mice. Emodin promoted phagocytic activity by monocytes and macrophages in comparison to the leukemia mice group. In conclusions, emodin induced apoptotic death in murine leukemia WEHI-3 cells and enhanced phagocytosis in the leukemia animal model.","['Chang, Yuan-Chang', 'Lai, Tung-Yuan', 'Yu, Chun-Shu', 'Chen, Hung-Yi', 'Yang, Jai-Sing', 'Chueh, Fu-Shin', 'Lu, Chi-Cheng', 'Chiang, Jo-Hua', 'Huang, Wen-Wen', 'Ma, Chia-Yu', 'Chung, Jing-Gung']","['Chang YC', 'Lai TY', 'Yu CS', 'Chen HY', 'Yang JS', 'Chueh FS', 'Lu CC', 'Chiang JH', 'Huang WW', 'Ma CY', 'Chung JG']","['School of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung 404, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,,2011/06/11 06:00,2011/06/11 06:01,['2011/06/11 06:00'],"['2011/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2011/523596 [doi]'],ppublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2011;2011:523596. doi: 10.1155/2011/523596.

Silencing of GSK-3beta or p53 expression was cardioprotective, indicating that activation of the ERK-GSK-3beta-p53 signaling pathway is involved in Zn(2+)-sensitive myocyte death. Moreover, the ERK-dependent Noxa-myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) pathway is also involved, as silencing of Noxa expression was cardioprotective and U0126 abolished both the increase in Noxa expression and in Mcl-1 degradation.

Molecular analysis of spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis is difficult as these cells die rapidly and cannot be easily manipulated. We use conditional Hoxb8 expression to generate mouse neutrophils and test the regulation of apoptosis by extensive manipulation of B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (Bcl-2)-family proteins. Spontaneous apoptosis was preceded by downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Loss of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homology domain (BH3)-only protein Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (Bim) gave some protection, but only neutrophils deficient in both BH3-only proteins, Bim and Noxa, were strongly protected against apoptosis. Function of Noxa was at least in part neutralization of induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (Mcl-1) in neutrophils and progenitors. Loss of Bim and Noxa preserved neutrophil function in culture, and apoptosis-resistant cells remained in circulation in mice. Apoptosis regulated by Bim- and Noxa-driven loss of Mcl-1 is thus the final step in neutrophil differentiation, required for the termination of neutrophil function and neutrophil-dependent inflammation.","['Kirschnek, S', 'Vier, J', 'Gautam, S', 'Frankenberg, T', 'Rangelova, S', 'Eitz-Ferrer, P', 'Grespi, F', 'Ottina, E', 'Villunger, A', 'Hacker, H', 'Hacker, G']","['Kirschnek S', 'Vier J', 'Gautam S', 'Frankenberg T', 'Rangelova S', 'Eitz-Ferrer P', 'Grespi F', 'Ottina E', 'Villunger A', 'Hacker H', 'Hacker G']","['Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, Universitat Freiburg, Germany. susanne.kirschnek@uniklinik-freiburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxb8 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Pmaip1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Down-Regulation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neutrophils/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2011/06/11 06:00,2012/02/02 06:00,['2011/06/11 06:00'],"['2011/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd201169 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2011.69 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2011 Nov;18(11):1805-14. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2011.69.

Functionally, the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) demonstrated MM-specific and HLA-A2-restricted proliferation, interferon-gamma secretion and cytotoxic activity in response to MM cell lines and importantly, cytotoxicity against primary MM cells. These data demonstrate the distinct immunogenic characteristics of unique heteroclitic XBP1 peptides, which induce MM-specific CTLs and highlights their potential application for immunotherapy to treat the patients with MM or its pre-malignant condition.","['Bae, J', 'Carrasco, R', 'Lee, A-H', 'Prabhala, R', 'Tai, Y-T', 'Anderson, K C', 'Munshi, N C']","['Bae J', 'Carrasco R', 'Lee AH', 'Prabhala R', 'Tai YT', 'Anderson KC', 'Munshi NC']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (X-Box Binding Protein 1)', '0 (XBP1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism/therapy', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/*immunology', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'X-Box Binding Protein 1']",2011/06/11 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/11 06:00'],"['2011/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['leu2011120 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.120 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Oct;25(10):1610-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.120.

The role of Hh signaling in hematopoiesis is controversial and ill defined. Although some groups observed self-renewal defects with decreased replating and reduced efficiency of secondary murine transplants, other groups reported no hematopoietic phenotypes, which may be related to the timing of Hh abrogation. In malignant hematopoiesis, most attention has been focused on the role of Hh signaling in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), considered by many to be a stem cell disorder that bears the constitutively active BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. Despite the elimination of most leukemia cells through BCR-ABL inhibition, most patients remain PCR positive, suggesting that the putative CML stem cell may be resistant to kinase antagonism. Groups are now exploring the Hh pathway as an alternate pathway supporting CML stem cell survival. Knockdown or inhibition of Smo abrogates or delays the appearance of CML in several in vitro and in vivo models.

The high mortality associated with PEL may be explained in part by resistance of these tumors to chemotherapy. The membrane-bound glycoprotein emmprin (CD147) enhances chemoresistance in tumors through effects on transporter expression, trafficking and interactions. Interactions between hyaluronan and hyaluronan receptors on the cell surface also facilitate emmprin-mediated chemoresistance. Whether emmprin or hyaluronan-receptor interactions regulate chemotherapeutic resistance for virus-associated malignancies is unknown. Using human PEL tumor cells, we found that PEL sensitivity to chemotherapy is directly proportional to expression of emmprin, the lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor-1 (LYVE-1) and a drug transporter known as the breast cancer resistance protein/ABCG2 (BCRP), and that emmprin, LYVE-1 and BCRP interact with each other and colocalize on the PEL cell surface. In addition, we found that emmprin induces chemoresistance in PEL cells through upregulation of BCRP expression, and RNA interference targeting of emmprin, LYVE-1 or BCRP enhances PEL cell apoptosis induced by chemotherapy. Finally, disruption of hyaluronan-receptor interactions using small hyaluronan oligosaccharides reduces expression of emmprin and BCRP while sensitizing PEL cells to chemotherapy. Collectively, these data support interdependent roles for emmprin, LYVE-1 and BCRP in chemotherapeutic resistance for PEL.","['Qin, Z', 'Dai, L', 'Bratoeva, M', 'Slomiany, M G', 'Toole, B P', 'Parsons, C']","['Qin Z', 'Dai L', 'Bratoeva M', 'Slomiany MG', 'Toole BP', 'Parsons C']","['Department of Medicine, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BSG protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (LYVE1 protein, human)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)', '136894-56-9 (Basigin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Basigin/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Primary Effusion/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'RNA Interference', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins/*physiology']",2011/06/11 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/11 06:00'],"['2011/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['leu2011144 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.144 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Oct;25(10):1598-609. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.144.

Phosphorylated AKT is commonly found in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and confers an unfavorable prognosis. Understanding the relative importance of upstream kinases and AKT phosphatase in the activation of AKT is relevant for the therapeutic targeting of this signaling axis in AML. The B55alpha subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) has been implicated in AKT dephosphorylation, but its role in regulating AKT in AML is unknown. We examined B55alpha protein expression in blast cells derived from 511 AML patients using reverse phase protein analysis. B55alpha protein expression was lower in AML cells compared with normal CD34+ cells. B55alpha protein levels negatively correlated with threonine 308 phosphorylation levels. Low levels of B55alpha were associated with shorter complete remission duration, demonstrating that decreased expression is an adverse prognostic factor in AML. These findings suggest that decreased B55alpha expression in AML is at least partially responsible for increased AKT signaling in AML and suggests that therapeutic targeting of PP2A could counteract this.","['Ruvolo, P P', 'Qui, Y H', 'Coombes, K R', 'Zhang, N', 'Ruvolo, V R', 'Borthakur, G', 'Konopleva, M', 'Andreeff, M', 'Kornblau, S M']","['Ruvolo PP', 'Qui YH', 'Coombes KR', 'Zhang N', 'Ruvolo VR', 'Borthakur G', 'Konopleva M', 'Andreeff M', 'Kornblau SM']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. pruvolo@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",IM,"['Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*physiopathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', '*Remission Induction']",2011/06/11 06:00,2011/12/23 06:00,['2011/06/11 06:00'],"['2011/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011146 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.146 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Nov;25(11):1711-7. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.146.

However, imatinib also has potent inhibitory activity against the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). Nilotinib is approved for treating patients with chronic myeloid leukemia showing resistance or intolerance to imatinib. Like imatinib, nilotinib selectively inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of PDGFR. OBJECTIVES: We examined the effect of imatinib and nilotinib on acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis in a mouse model. METHODS: Mice were treated by intratracheal instillation of bleomycin. Imatinib or nilotinib were administered by oral gavage. To study the early inflammatory and late fibrotic phases of lung injury, mice were sacrificed on days 3, 7, 14 and 21 after bleomycin instillation. RESULTS: Histopathology showed that imatinib and nilotinib attenuated the extent of lung injury and fibrosis. The numbers of inflammatory cells and levels of IL-6, IL-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were decreased in the imatinib and nilotinib groups on days 3 and 7. Imatinib and nilotinib therapy significantly reduced the levels of hydroxyproline on days 14 and 21, which was accompanied by decreased expression levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and PDGFR-beta. Imatinib and nilotinib also significantly reduced the expression levels of the genes for TGF-beta1 and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Imatinib and nilotinib treatment also significantly inhibited the PDGF-induced proliferation of lung fibroblasts in vitro. When imatinib or nilotinib was given 7 days after the instillation of bleomycin, only nilotinib attenuated pulmonary fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib and nilotinib attenuated bleomycin-induced acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis in mice. In a therapeutic model, nilotinib showed more potent antifibrotic effects than imatinib.","['Rhee, Chin Kook', 'Lee, Sang Haak', 'Yoon, Hyung Kyu', 'Kim, Seok Chan', 'Lee, Sook Young', 'Kwon, Soon Suk', 'Kim, Young Kyoon', 'Kim, Kwan Hyoung', 'Kim, Tae Jung', 'Kim, Jin Woo']","['Rhee CK', 'Lee SH', 'Yoon HK', 'Kim SC', 'Lee SY', 'Kwon SS', 'Kim YK', 'Kim KH', 'Kim TJ', 'Kim JW']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Respiration,Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,0137356,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Acute Lung Injury/chemically induced/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/adverse effects', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Bleomycin/*adverse effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interleukin-1beta/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/chemically induced/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2011/06/11 06:00,2012/01/11 06:00,['2011/06/11 06:00'],"['2010/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['000327719 [pii]', '10.1159/000327719 [doi]']",ppublish,Respiration. 2011;82(3):273-87. doi: 10.1159/000327719.

We evaluated the prognostic factors for IA in HM patients. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included all HM patients diagnosed with proven or probable IA between June 1993 and June 2008. RESULTS: A total of 449 HM patients were analyzed, the majority of which (75%) had underlying leukemia. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that neutropenia for more than two weeks during IA, steroid use, and intensive care admission were independently associated with failure to respond to antifungal therapy, as well as increased IA-attributable mortality (all p-values < .01). Antifungal therapy with an antimold azole-containing regimen (voriconazole or posaconazole) was also independently associated with improved response to treatment, as well as decreased IA-attributable mortality (all p-values < .0001). Survival analysis showed that primary or salvage therapy with a regimen that contained antimold azoles was significantly associated with improved survival (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In HM patients, persistent neutropenia and the need for intensive care are associated with failure to respond to antifungal therapy. Use of novel antimold azoles, either as primary or salvage therapy, improves the overall outcome and IA-attributable death of HM patients with IA.","['Ramos, Elizabeth R', 'Jiang, Ying', 'Hachem, Ray', 'Kassis, Christelle', 'Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P', 'Raad, Issam']","['Ramos ER', 'Jiang Y', 'Hachem R', 'Kassis C', 'Kontoyiannis DP', 'Raad I']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Azoles)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/*drug therapy/*etiology/microbiology', 'Azoles/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*microbiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2011/06/11 06:00,2012/02/01 06:00,['2011/06/11 06:00'],"['2011/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['theoncologist.2010-0290 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2010-0290 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2011;16(7):1049-60. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2010-0290.

Codependence is not predicted by the expression level of antiapoptotic proteins, rather through interactions with Bim. Consistent with these findings, acquired resistance to ABT-737 results in loss of codependence through redistribution of Bim to Mcl-1.

To investigate the molecular mechanisms whereby fatty acids affect these processes, U937 leukemia cells were conditioned with stearic, oleic, linolenic, alpha-linolenic, arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids. PUFAs affected proliferation; eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) was the most potent on cell cycle progression. EPA enhanced the expression of the myeloid lineage-specific transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPbeta and C/EBPdelta), PU.1, and c-Jun, resulting in increased expression of the monocyte lineage-specific target gene, the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor. Indeed, it is known that PU.1 and C/EBPs interact with their consensus sequences on a small DNA fragment of macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor promoter, which is a determinant for expression. We demonstrated that C/EBPbeta and C/EBPdelta bind the same response element as a heterodimer. We focused on the enhanced expression of C/EBPdelta, which has been reported to be a tumor suppressor gene silenced by promoter hypermethylation in U937 cells. After U937 conditioning with EPA and bisulfite sequencing of the -370/-20 CpG island on the C/EBPdelta promoter region, we found a site-specific CpG demethylation that was a determinant for the binding activity of Sp1, an essential factor for C/EBPdelta gene basal expression. Our results provide evidence for a new role of PUFAs in the regulation of gene expression. Moreover, we demonstrated for the first time that re-expression of the tumor suppressor C/EBPdelta is controlled by the methylation state of a site-specific CpG dinucleotide.","['Ceccarelli, Veronica', 'Racanicchi, Serena', 'Martelli, Maria Paola', 'Nocentini, Giuseppe', 'Fettucciari, Katia', 'Riccardi, Carlo', 'Marconi, Pierfrancesco', 'Di Nardo, Paolo', 'Grignani, Francesco', 'Binaglia, Luciano', 'Vecchini, Alba']","['Ceccarelli V', 'Racanicchi S', 'Martelli MP', 'Nocentini G', 'Fettucciari K', 'Riccardi C', 'Marconi P', 'Di Nardo P', 'Grignani F', 'Binaglia L', 'Vecchini A']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, University of Perugia, Perugia 06126, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '142662-43-9 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta)', 'AAN7QOV9EA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', '*CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'DNA Primers', 'Eicosapentaenoic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Oncogenes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'U937 Cells']",2011/06/11 06:00,2011/10/11 06:00,['2011/06/11 06:00'],"['2011/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)50314-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.253609 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Aug 5;286(31):27092-102. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.253609.

We hypothesized that these memory T cells may lose their function over time in transplanted patients. Here, we offer functional and mechanistic support for this hypothesis, based on immune inhibition by programmed death-1 (PD-1) expressed on MiHA-specific CD8(+) T cells and the associated role of the PD-1 ligand PD-L1 on myeloid leukemia cells, especially under inflammatory conditions. PD-L1 was highly upregulated on immature human leukemic progenitor cells, whereas costimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86 were not expressed. Thus, immature leukemic progenitor cells seemed to evade the immune system by inhibiting T-cell function via the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Blocking PD-1 signaling using human antibodies led to elevated proliferation and IFN-gamma production of MiHA-specific T cells cocultured with PD-L1-expressing leukemia cells. Moreover, patients with relapsed leukemia after initial MiHA-specific T-cell responses displayed high PD-L1 expression on CD34(+) leukemia cells and increased PD-1 levels on MiHA-specific CD8(+) T cells. Importantly, blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interactions augment proliferation of MiHA-specific CD8(+) memory T cells from relapsed patients. Taken together, our findings indicate that the PD-1/PD-L pathway can be hijacked as an immune escape mechanism in hematological malignancies. Furthermore, they suggest that blocking the PD-1 immune checkpoint offers an appealing immunotherapeutic strategy following alloSCT in patients with recurrent or relapsed disease.","['Norde, Wieger J', 'Maas, Frans', 'Hobo, Willemijn', 'Korman, Alan', 'Quigley, Michael', 'Kester, Michel G D', 'Hebeda, Konnie', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'Schaap, Nicolaas', 'de Witte, Theo M', 'van der Voort, Robbert', 'Dolstra, Harry']","['Norde WJ', 'Maas F', 'Hobo W', 'Korman A', 'Quigley M', 'Kester MG', 'Hebeda K', 'Falkenburg JH', 'Schaap N', 'de Witte TM', 'van der Voort R', 'Dolstra H']","['Departments of Laboratory Medicine, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2X5)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'B7-1 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'B7-2 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'B7-H1 Antigen', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Inflammation', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology/surgery', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2X5/immunology', 'Recurrence', 'T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Escape/immunology/*physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",2011/06/11 06:00,2011/10/04 06:00,['2011/06/11 06:00'],"['2011/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-11-0108 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-0108 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Aug 1;71(15):5111-22. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-0108.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Decitabine 20 mg/m(2)/day was given intravenously over one hour for five consecutive days every four weeks. The primary end point was overall response rate. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were analyzed. The International Prognostic Scoring System risk category was Intermediate-2/High in 47.5%. A median of 5 courses (range 1-18) were delivered. The overall response rate was 55.4% (13 complete responses, one partial response, 23 marrow complete responses, and 19 hematologic improvements). Forty-eight patients (47.5%) showed some hematologic improvement. With a median follow-up duration of 478 days (range 69-595), median overall survival was 17.7 months. Patients who showed hematologic improvement had significantly longer overall survival than those who did not (19.2 vs. 15.9 months, P=0.006 by landmark analysis at six months). The difference in overall survival was evident in the Intermediate-2/High risk group but not in the Intermediate-1 risk group.

Identifying genetic variants that influence patients' outcome and response to treatment may provide important insights into the biology of the disease. DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the possibility that genetic variation influences outcome by conducting a genome-wide analysis of 346,831 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 356 patients entered into a phase III trial comparing the efficacy of fludarabine, chlorambucil, and fludarabine with cyclophosphamide as first-line treatment. Genotypes were linked to individual patients' outcome data and response to chemotherapy. The association between genotype and progression-free survival was assessed by Cox regression analysis adjusting for treatment and clinicopathology. RESULTS: The strongest associations were shown for rs1949733 (ACOX3; P=8.22x10-7), rs1342899 (P=7.72x10(-7)) and rs11158493 (PPP2R5E; P=8.50x10(-7)). In addition, the 52 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated at P<10(-4) included rs438034 (CENPF; P=4.86x10(-6)), previously correlated with cancer progression, and rs2255235 (B2M; P=3.10x10(-5)) and rs2064501 (IL22RA2; P=4.81x10(-5)) which map to B-cell genes.

Recently, rs16754 has been reported to affect the outcome of patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia. To validate this finding, we investigated pretreatment features and outcome associated with rs16754 in a large cohort of patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Four-hundred and thirty-three intensively treated and molecularly characterized cytogenetically normal patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (18-83 years old) were analyzed for rs16754. To gain biological insights, we studied the gene- and microRNA-expression profiles for associations with rs16754. RESULTS: Three-hundred and nine (71%) patients were homozygous for A (WT1(AA)), 112 (26%) were heterozygous (WT1(AG)) and 12 (3%) were homozygous for G (WT1(GG)). For comparison with previous studies, we grouped WT1(AG) and WT1(GG) patients and compared them with WT1(AA) patients divided into younger (<60 years) and older (>/=60 years) adults. We found no independent prognostic impact of WT1(AA). However, WT1(GG) patients, who were less often Caucasian than WT1(AG) (P=0.001) or WT1(AA) (P=0.008) patients, and had TET2 mutations more often than WT1(AG) (P=0.02) patients, had, among patients with FLT3-internal tandem duplication and/or NPM1 wild-type, better disease-free (P=0.02) and overall survival (P=0.04) than WT1(AA) and WT1(AG) patients combined. Unsupervised and supervised analyses of the gene- and microRNA-expression profiles suggested that there were no distinct expression patterns associated with any rs16754 genotype. CONCLUSIONS: We did not observe the previously reported adverse impact of WT1(AA) but found favorable outcomes associated with the homozygous WT1(GG). Considering its low frequency, confirmatory studies are necessary. The biological significance of rs16754 remains questionable as no distinct expression profiles were associated with the genotypes.","['Becker, Heiko', 'Maharry, Kati', 'Radmacher, Michael D', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Whitman, Susan P', 'Schwind, Sebastian', 'Kohlschmidt, Jessica', 'Wu, Yue-Zhong', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Carter, Thomas H', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Wetzler, Meir', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Moore, Joseph O', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Becker H', 'Maharry K', 'Radmacher MD', 'Mrozek K', 'Metzeler KH', 'Whitman SP', 'Schwind S', 'Kohlschmidt J', 'Wu YZ', 'Powell BL', 'Carter TH', 'Kolitz JE', 'Wetzler M', 'Carroll AJ', 'Baer MR', 'Moore JO', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Larson RA', 'Marcucci G', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleophosmin', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2011/06/11 06:00,2012/02/11 06:00,['2011/06/11 06:00'],"['2011/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.041905 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.041905 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Oct;96(10):1488-95. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.041905.

In the new caryotype, only one clone is still present: it is the clone in evolution in the first caryotype and which presents additional abnormalities. This evolution allows us to assert the biclonality of the primitive CLL, the two clones evolving differently under treatment.

Case reports and review of literature.",293-7,10.1016/j.clml.2011.03.019 [doi],"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) consists of disorders with overlapping dysplastic and proliferative features. The diagnosis of CMML requires absolute monocytosis (> 1000/muL) in addition to other criteria outlined by the World Health Organization (WHO) classification.(1) Monocytosis not reaching 1000/muL has been observed in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and presents a diagnostic challenge in classification especially if increases in leukocyte count occurring during disease shifts the monocyte count into the absolute range. We discuss the laboratory and clinical features of 3 patients with myelodysplasia and associated monocytosis. Absolute neutropenia was the dominant feature at presentation, with mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, monocytosis (as a percentage), multilineage dysplasia, and increased myeloblasts, consistent with a diagnosis of refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB). Absolute monocytosis fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for CMML developed over 6-8 months, prompting a change in diagnosis. Two of 3 patients had normal cytogenetic examinations. JAK2 V617F mutation was detected after transformation to CMML in 1 of them; in the other, a novel translocation t(5;12)(p13;q24) was observed at the time of progression to acute leukemia. The use of different diagnostic terminologies--MDS, dysplasia with reactive monocytosis, myeloproliferative, and myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic syndromes by different and even the same pathologists at different times created confusion among the clinicians and patients. The disease course in these 3 patients was characterized by better survival and prolonged time to progression to acute leukemia, than predicted based on the original diagnosis of RAEB, suggesting that MDS with monocytosis may represent a subgroup distinct from MDS or CMML.","['Singh, Zeba N', 'Post, Ginell R', 'Kiwan, Elias', 'Maddox, Anne-Marie']","['Singh ZN', 'Post GR', 'Kiwan E', 'Maddox AM']","['Department of Pathology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA. zsingh@uams.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,,IM,"['Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/complications/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality', 'Leukocytosis/complications/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Pancytopenia/complications/*diagnosis/genetics']",2011/06/11 06:00,2011/10/04 06:00,['2011/06/11 06:00'],"['2010/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/30 00:00 [revised]', '2010/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(11)00020-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2011.03.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2011 Jun;11(3):293-7. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2011.03.019.

A multicenter experience in Argentina and Uruguay.,280-5,10.1016/j.clml.2011.03.016 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD) by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients is mandatory in the era of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Achieving a major molecular response (MMR) at 12 and 18 months predicts a better progression and event-free survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The objective of this prospective, multicentric study was to evaluate MRD by standardized RT-PCR in 178 patients with chronic-phase CML who were treated with imatinib at different institutions in Argentina and Uruguay and to determine if achievement of a stable MMR (BCR-ABL transcript levels < 0.1%) identifies a low-risk cytogenetic relapse group. The median age of the patients was 50 years, and 55% of them had received imatinib as first-line therapy. BCR-ABL transcript levels were measured after achievement of complete cytogenetic remission (CCyR) and at 6-month intervals. RESULTS: MMR was detected in 44% patients at the start of the study. This value increased to 79% at month 36 of evaluation. Complete molecular response (CMR) also increased from 24% to 52% of patients. Not achieving a stable MMR determined a higher risk of cytogenetic relapse (9% of MMR patients not achieving an MMR vs. 1% of patients who achieved MMR). Patients with sustained MMR had a significantly better cytogenetic relapse-free survival at 48 months (97% vs. 87%; P = .008) but showed no differences in overall survival. Patients who did not remain in CCyR changed treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A stable MMR is a strong predictor for a durable CCyR. Standardized molecular monitoring could replace cytogenetic analysis once CCyR is obtained. These results emphasize the validity and feasibility of molecular monitoring in all standardized medical centers of the world.","['Pavlovsky, Carolina', 'Giere, Isabel', 'Moiraghi, Beatriz', 'Pavlovsky, Miguel A', 'Aranguren, Pedro Negri', 'Garcia, Juan', 'Fernandez, Isolda', 'Bengio, Raquel', 'Milone, Jorge', 'Labanca, Valentin', 'Uriarte, Rosario', 'Lombardi, Virginia', 'Reinoso, Fernanda Garcia', 'Magarinos, Alicia E', 'Martinez, Lem', 'Murro, Hector', 'Lastiri, Francisco', 'Pavlovsky, Santiago']","['Pavlovsky C', 'Giere I', 'Moiraghi B', 'Pavlovsky MA', 'Aranguren PN', 'Garcia J', 'Fernandez I', 'Bengio R', 'Milone J', 'Labanca V', 'Uriarte R', 'Lombardi V', 'Reinoso FG', 'Magarinos AE', 'Martinez L', 'Murro H', 'Lastiri F', 'Pavlovsky S']","['FUNDALEU, Centro de Internacion e Investigacion Clinica Angelica Ocampo, Buenos Aires, Argentina. cpavlovsky@fundaleu.org.ar']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Argentina', 'Benzamides', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Uruguay', 'Young Adult']",2011/06/11 06:00,2011/10/04 06:00,['2011/06/11 06:00'],"['2010/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/16 00:00 [revised]', '2010/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(11)00017-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2011.03.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2011 Jun;11(3):280-5. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2011.03.016.

This drug is usually used in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. It was recognized to inhibit activity of kinases such as Bcr/Abl, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and c-kit. These proteins play important roles in cell growth, motility, and survival. Therefore, studies on the biological effects of imatinib on different cellular models are very important. Human colon adenocarcinoma LS180 cell line was used in the studies presented. Cells were exposed to 0.1-100 muM imatinib for 24 and 48 h. Dose-dependent decreases in cell viability and morphological changes were observed. Moreover, the apoptotic effect of imatinib (10 muM, 50 muM) after 24 h of exposure was demonstrated as evaluated by translocation of phosphatidylserine to external membrane leaflet and by increased activity of caspase-3. Special attention was focused on imatinib influence on actin cytoskeleton organization and migration ability of LS180 cells. Distinct alterations in actin cytoskeleton architecture occurred in response to drug treatment, accompanied by appearance of filamentous actin aggregates and decrease in actin polymerization state. These changes were correlated with remarkable decrease in cell migration capacity. In summary, our data clearly demonstrate that imatinib induces apoptosis and inhibits human colon adenocarcinoma cell migration. Therefore, this drug may have potential in colon cancer therapy in the future.","['Popow-Wozniak, Agnieszka', 'Wozniakowska, Aleksandra', 'Kaczmarek, Lukasz', 'Malicka-Blaszkiewicz, Maria', 'Nowak, Dorota']","['Popow-Wozniak A', 'Wozniakowska A', 'Kaczmarek L', 'Malicka-Blaszkiewicz M', 'Nowak D']","['Department of Cell Pathology, Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Wroclaw, Przybyszewskiego 63, 51-148 Wroclaw, Poland. apopow@ibmb.uni.wroc.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Actins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Adenocarcinoma/*pathology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Cytoskeleton/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Multimerization/drug effects', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2011/06/11 06:00,2011/12/28 06:00,['2011/06/11 06:00'],"['2010/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-2999(11)00619-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.05.036 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2011 Sep 30;667(1-3):66-73. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.05.036.

Whereas 5-FdUrd substantially lost its cytostatic potential in thymidine kinase (TK)-deficient murine leukaemia L1210 and human lymphocyte CEM cell cultures, NUC-3073 markedly kept its antiproliferative activity in TK-deficient tumour cells, and thus is largely independent of intracellular TK activity to exert its cytostatic action. NUC-3073 was found to inhibit thymidylate synthase (TS) in the TK-deficient and wild-type cell lines at drug concentrations that correlated well with its cytostatic activity in these cells. NUC-3073 does not seem to be susceptible to inactivation by catabolic enzymes such as thymidine phosphorylase (TP) and uridine phosphorylase (UP). These findings are in line with our observations that 5-FdUrd, but not NUC-3073, substantially loses its cytostatic potential in the presence of TP-expressing mycoplasmas in the tumour cell cultures. Therefore, we propose NUC-3073 as a novel 5-FdUrd phosphoramidate prodrug that (i) may circumvent potential resistance mechanisms of tumour cells (e.g. decreased TK activity) and (ii) is not degraded by catabolic enzymes such as TP which is often upregulated in tumour cells or expressed in mycoplasma-infected tumour tissue.","['Vande Voorde, Johan', 'Liekens, Sandra', 'McGuigan, Christopher', 'Murziani, Paola G S', 'Slusarczyk, Magdalena', 'Balzarini, Jan']","['Vande Voorde J', 'Liekens S', 'McGuigan C', 'Murziani PG', 'Slusarczyk M', 'Balzarini J']","['Rega Institute for Medical Research, K.U.Leuven, Minderbroedersstraat 10, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NUC-3073)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', 'EC 2.4.2.3 (Uridine Phosphorylase)', 'EC 2.4.2.4 (Thymidine Phosphorylase)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Floxuridine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prodrugs/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Thymidine Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Thymidine Phosphorylase/physiology', 'Uridine Phosphorylase/physiology']",2011/06/11 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/06/11 06:00'],"['2011/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/20 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(11)00357-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2011.05.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2011 Sep 1;82(5):441-52. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2011.05.024.

Pharmacodynamic parameters such as clinical efficacy and toxicity may be influenced by polymorphisms of CYP3A. AIM: The aim of this study was to document CYP3A5 genotype, vincristine pharmacokinetics (PK) and neurotoxicity profile for 50 children with cancer and determine whether, in a population of Australian children, the CYP3A5 genotype influenced the pharmacodynamics of vincristine as reflected by peripheral neurotoxicity. METHODS: Blood for PK analysis was collected after any single dose of vincristine and assayed using high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection. CYP3A5*3 and CYP3A5*6 genotype was determined using gel-electrophoresis or automated microfluidic electrophoresis. Neurotoxicity was determined by physical examination. RESULTS: The median age of children sampled was 6.5 years (range 1-16.25). Half the patients received concurrent corticosteroids for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Six patients (12%) had experienced grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity. The median clearance, area under the curve and Cmax of vincristine was 482 mL/min/m(2) (range 132-698), 49.7 mcg/L.h (16.5-143.1) and 3.5 mcg/L (1.0-31.2), respectively. In contrast to prediction, all but three children were homozygous for wild-type CYP3A5*3. No CYP3A5*6 polymorphisms were identified. CONCLUSIONS: No correlation was identified between vincristine clearance, vincristine neurotoxicity, age, sex or concomitant steroid therapy. The limited sampling methodology proved acceptable to patients and families and would be suitable for larger scale studies including a wider range of genotypic variants and more detailed prospective evaluation of neurotoxicity.","['Moore, Andrew S', 'Norris, Ross', 'Price, Gareth', 'Nguyen, Thu', 'Ni, Ming', 'George, Rani', 'van Breda, Karin', 'Duley, John', 'Charles, Bruce', 'Pinkerton, Ross']","['Moore AS', 'Norris R', 'Price G', 'Nguyen T', 'Ni M', 'George R', 'van Breda K', 'Duley J', 'Charles B', 'Pinkerton R']","[""Queensland Children's Cancer Centre, Royal Children's and Mater Children's Hospitals, Australia. andrew.moore@icr.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,J Paediatr Child Health,Journal of paediatrics and child health,9005421,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A5 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Comet Assay', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/diagnosis', '*Pharmacogenetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Vincristine/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",2011/06/11 06:00,2012/05/02 06:00,['2011/06/11 06:00'],"['2011/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1754.2011.02103.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Paediatr Child Health. 2011 Dec;47(12):875-82. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1754.2011.02103.x.

However, it can occasionally cause hemolysis. We report a rare case of acute hemolysis caused by anti-IH. CASE REPORT: A 60-year-old man with a long history of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and anemia, blood group A, D+ was found to have an unidentified antibody on serologic workup. He received an A, D+ red blood cell (RBC) unit that was crossmatch compatible by immunoglobulin G indirect antiglobulin test and then experienced an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction with fever, hemoglobinuria, and acute renal failure. The antibody was later identified as an anti-IH with a wide thermal amplitude. The transfused RBCs were later typed as A(2). The patient was subsequently typed as an A(1) individual. The patient recovered completely from the effects of this reaction and was transfused with A(1) RBCs over the next few days with no adverse effect. CONCLUSION: Anti-IH, which is usually clinically insignificant and often found in A(1), B, and A(1) B individuals, can, on rare occasions, cause acute hemolytic transfusion reactions, especially when an A(2) unit is transfused to an A(1) patient.","['Irani, Mehraboon S', 'Richards, Cheryl']","['Irani MS', 'Richards C']","['Tricore Reference Laboratories at Presbyterian Hospital Blood Bank, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA. mirani@bloodsystems.org']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (I Blood-Group System)', '0 (Isoantibodies)']",IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/blood', 'Acute Kidney Injury/blood/etiology', 'Aged', 'Anemia/blood/therapy', 'Blood Group Incompatibility/*blood/etiology', 'Blood Grouping and Crossmatching', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion/*adverse effects', 'Hemoglobinuria/blood/etiology', '*Hemolysis', 'Humans', '*I Blood-Group System', 'Isoantibodies/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/therapy', 'Male']",2011/06/11 06:00,2012/02/03 06:00,['2011/06/11 06:00'],"['2011/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1537-2995.2011.03209.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2011 Dec;51(12):2676-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2011.03209.x.

An aberrant folate metabolism caused by a genetic polymorphism may lead to genomic instability and affect the susceptibility to malignancies including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This study was designed to explore the correlation between the polymorphisms in folate-related genes and the risk of ALL in Han Chinese. The DNA was isolated from 231 patients with pediatric ALL, 130 patients with adult ALL, and 367 healthy subjects (as controls). Polymorphisms were examined for RFC1 80G > A, DHFR 19 bp del/ins and 317A > G, SHMT1 1420C > T, MTHFR 677C > T and 1298A > C, MTR 2756A > G, MTRR 66A > G, TYMS 3R/2R, MTHFD1 1958G > A, and ABCG2 421G > T using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The risk of adult ALL was increased by the RFC1 80AA variant (odds ratio [OR] = 2.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-3.67) and MTRR 66GG variant (OR = 2.15; 95% CI 1.06-4.39) but reduced by the MTHFR 677TT variant (OR = 0.47; 95% CI 0.25-0.88), ABCG2 421GT variant (OR = 0.62; 95% CI 0.41-0.96), and ABCG2 421GT + TT variant (OR = 0.60; 95% CI 0.40-0.90). The increase in risk of adult ALL with the RFC1 80AA associated with the MTRR 66GG variant was even more significant (OR = 8.92; 95% CI 1.97-40.42). Furthermore, the MTHFR 677TT associated with the ABCG2 421GT + TT variant more significantly reduced the risk of adult ALL (OR = 0.32; 95% CI 0.12-0.85). However, all gene polymorphisms tested in this study failed to affect the pediatric ALL risk. Our study clearly demonstrates that polymorphisms in folate-related genes only modulate the susceptibility to adult ALL, but not to pediatric ALL, in Han Chinese.","['Yang, Lin', 'Liu, Liang', 'Wang, Jianxiang', 'Qiu, Lugui', 'Mi, Yingchang', 'Ma, Xiaotang', 'Xiao, Zhijian']","['Yang L', 'Liu L', 'Wang J', 'Qiu L', 'Mi Y', 'Ma X', 'Xiao Z']","['State Key Laboratory of Experiment Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alleles', 'Asians/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/ethnology', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways/genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Risk', 'Young Adult']",2011/06/11 06:00,2011/12/21 06:00,['2011/06/11 06:00'],"['2011/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.578186 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Sep;52(9):1770-6. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.578186.

Traditional approaches to sequence analysis, including Sanger sequencing, pyrosequencing and allele-specific PCR, are now widely used to guide therapy for patients diagnosed with lung and colorectal cancer as well as for melanoma, sarcomas (e.g., gastrointestinal stromal tumors) and subtypes of leukemia and lymphoma. Traditional sequence analysis has been limited in bandwidth and throughput and as a result, has been focused exclusively on testing the most common aberrations in key genes or fully sequencing single genes. The massively parallel or next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach to DNA analysis holds a number of potential advantages over the traditional methods, including the ability to fully sequence large numbers of genes (hundreds to thousands) in a single test. Furthermore, NGS can simultaneously detect deletions, insertions, copy number alterations, translocations and exome-wide base substitutions (including known hot-spot mutations) in all known cancer-related genes. However, significant challenges, particularly with respect to demands on expertise and infrastructure, will have to be overcome to translate NGS to the bedside of the cancer patient. Extensive computational expertise is required to bring NGS into clinical context, and a deep knowledge of cancer medicine and cancer biology will be required to generate truly useful, so-called 'clinically actionable' reports for clinicians. While NGS is on the cusp of being launched as a clinical test, it may be expected that the near future will continue to bring major advances in the technology that will lower the overall cost, speed up the turnaround time, increase the breadth of genome sequencing, and detect epigenetic markers and other important genomic parameters, while becoming applicable to smaller and smaller specimens, including circulating tumor cells and circulating free DNA in plasma.","['Cronin, Maureen', 'Ross, Jeffrey S']","['Cronin M', 'Ross JS']","['Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA, USA. mcronin@foundationmedicine.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Biomark Med,Biomarkers in medicine,101312535,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/therapy', 'Precision Medicine', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/instrumentation/*methods']",2011/06/11 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/06/11 06:00'],"['2011/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/bmm.11.37 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomark Med. 2011 Jun;5(3):293-305. doi: 10.2217/bmm.11.37.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T-cell leukemia has a very poor prognosis, even with intensive chemotherapy, indicating the need for development of new drugs to treat the disease. Triterpenoid cucurbitacins have been shown to have antitumor activity, but the mechanism of this activity is not fully understood. METHODS: The effects of cucurbitacin D on the proliferation and apoptotic induction of T-cell leukemia cells using the Cell viability assay and Annexin V staining were evaluated. To investigate the mechanisms of apoptosis, antiapoptotic protein, NF-kappaB, and the proteasome activity of leukemia cells treated with cucurbitacin D were evaluated by Western blotting both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: In this study, cucurbitacin D was found to inhibit proliferation and to induce apoptosis of T-cell leukemia cells. Constitutively activated NF-kappaB was inhibited by cucurbitacin D in the nucleus, which resulted in accumulation of NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm, leading to down-regulation of the expression of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-2. Furthermore, cucurbitacin D induced the accumulation of inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB)alpha by inhibition of proteasome activity. Low doses of cucurbitacin D synergistically potentiated the antiproliferative effects of the histone deacetylase inhibitor VPA. Finally, the proapoptotic and proteasome inhibitory activities of cucurbitacin D also were demonstrated using SCID mice in an in vivo study. CONCLUSIONS: Cucurbitacin D induced apoptosis through suppression of proteasome activity both in vitro and in vivo, making cucurbitacin D a promising candidate for clinical applications in the treatment of T-cell leukemia.","['Ding, Ning', 'Yamashita, Uki', 'Matsuoka, Hidetada', 'Sugiura, Tsutomu', 'Tsukada, Junichi', 'Noguchi, Junko', 'Yoshida, Yasuhiro']","['Ding N', 'Yamashita U', 'Matsuoka H', 'Sugiura T', 'Tsukada J', 'Noguchi J', 'Yoshida Y']","['Department of Immunology and Parasitology, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '5I62H4ORC7 (cucurbitacin D)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Ubiquitination']",2011/06/10 06:00,2011/08/13 06:00,['2011/06/10 06:00'],"['2010/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/15 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25711 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2011 Jun 15;117(12):2735-46. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25711.

METHODS: This secondary analysis of the AZA-001 phase 3 study evaluated the time to first response and the potential benefit of continued azacitidine treatment beyond first response in responders. RESULTS: Overall, 91 of 179 patients achieved a response to azacitidine; responding patients received a median of 14 treatment cycles (range, 2-30). Median time to first response was 2 cycles (range, 1-16). Although 91% of first responses occurred by 6 cycles, continued azacitidine improved response category in 48% of patients. Best response was achieved by 92% of responders by 12 cycles. Median time from first response to best response was 3.5 cycles (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0-6.0) in 30 patients who ultimately achieved a complete response, and 3.0 cycles (95% CI, 1.0-3.0) in 21 patients who achieved a partial response. CONCLUSIONS: Continued azacitidine therapy in responders was associated with a quantitative increase in response to a higher response category in 48% of patients, and therefore may enhance clinical benefit in patients with higher-risk MDS.","['Silverman, Lewis R', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Santini, Valeria', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva', 'Gattermann, Norbert', 'Sanz, Guillermo', 'List, Alan F', 'Gore, Steven D', 'Seymour, John F']","['Silverman LR', 'Fenaux P', 'Mufti GJ', 'Santini V', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E', 'Gattermann N', 'Sanz G', 'List AF', 'Gore SD', 'Seymour JF']","['Department of Medicine - Oncology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA. lewis.silverman@mssm.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Risk', 'Time Factors']",2011/06/10 06:00,2011/08/13 06:00,['2011/06/10 06:00'],"['2010/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2010/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25774 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2011 Jun 15;117(12):2697-702. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25774.

Two of these drugs, azacitidine and decitabine, have received FDA approval for the treatment of MDS and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). However, phase 2 and 3 studies that assessed these agents in MDS included only a small number of patients with CMML. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of azacitidine in the treatment of CMML. METHODS: The records of thirty-eight patients diagnosed with CMML and treated with azacitidine at our institution were reviewed. Azacitidine was administered at 75 mg/m(2) /day for 7 days or 100 mg/m(2) /day for 5 days every 4 weeks. Patients who received at least 1 cycle of the drug were considered evaluable for response. RESULTS: Response was assessed by the modified International Working Group (IWG) criteria. The overall response rate was 39% (14 of 36); complete response (CR) rate was 11% (4 of 36); partial response (PR) rate was 3% (1 of 36); hematologic improvement (HI) was 25% (9 of 36). The median overall survival was 12 months. There was a statistically significant overall survival advantage in responders compared with nonresponders: 15.5 months versus 9 months, respectively (P = .04). Treatment was generally well tolerated. One of 2 patients had complete resolution of a skin rash that was due to monocytic infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: Azacitidine is active in the treatment of CMML. The therapy-associated toxicity is acceptable. Our results support further investigation of azacitidine in CMML, particularly in combination with other agents.","['Costa, Rubens', 'Abdulhaq, Haifaa', 'Haq, Bushra', 'Shadduck, Richard K', 'Latsko, Joan', 'Zenati, Mazen', 'Atem, Folefac D', 'Rossetti, James M', 'Sahovic, Entezam A', 'Lister, John']","['Costa R', 'Abdulhaq H', 'Haq B', 'Shadduck RK', 'Latsko J', 'Zenati M', 'Atem FD', 'Rossetti JM', 'Sahovic EA', 'Lister J']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Western Pennsylvania Cancer Institute, Western Pennsylvania Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA 15224, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Decitabine', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",2011/06/10 06:00,2011/08/13 06:00,['2011/06/10 06:00'],"['2010/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2010/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25759 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2011 Jun 15;117(12):2690-6. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25759.

METHODS: Eligible patients had histologically confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma deemed locally unresectable without evidence of metastatic disease. In addition, all patients underwent laparoscopy or laparotomy before study entry to rule out peritoneal carcinomatosis. Patients received radiation therapy (50.4 Gy) with concurrent infusional 5FU (200 mg/m(2) 5 days/week) and weekly gemcitabine (200 mg/m(2) ). After a 3-week break, patients received weekly gemcitabine at 1000 mg/m(2) for 3 of 4 weeks, for 4 cycles. The primary endpoint of the trial was the proportion of patients surviving 9 months from study entry. Secondary endpoints included objective tumor response, CA19-9 response, overall survival (OS) time to progression (TTP), and toxicity. RESULTS: Between November 2001 and October 2004, 81 patients were enrolled, 78 of whom were eligible for analysis. With a median follow-up of 55.2 months, the median OS was 12.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.9-14.9) and the median TTP was 10 months (95% CI, 6.4-12.0). An objective tumor response was seen in 19 patients (25%), and among 56 patients with an elevated CA19-9 at baseline, 29 (52%) had a sustained CA19-9 response. Overall, 41% of patients had grade 3 or greater treatment-related gastrointestinal adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of 5FU, gemcitabine, and radiation is well tolerated.

Irradiation of the tumor excites the light-sensitive porphyrins and results in ROS production and cell death. In this study we investigated the effect of the expression levels of two main enzymes in heme biosynthesis, ALA dehydratase (ALAD) and porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), on the capacity of K562 cells to undergo cell death following ALA-PDT. We manipulated PBGD and ALAD expression levels by shRNAs and PBGD overexpressing plasmid. PBGD down-regulation induced an elevation in ALAD activity, while overexpression of PBGD reduced ALAD activity, indicating a novel regulation feedback of PBGD on ALAD activity. This feedback mechanism enabled partial PpIX synthesis under PBGD silencing, whereas ALAD silencing reduced PpIX production to a minimum. ALA-PDT efficacy was directly correlated to PpIX levels. Thus, only ALAD-silenced cells were not affected by ALA+ irradiation, while following PBGD silencing, the accumulated PpIX, though decreased, was sufficient for successful ALA-PDT. The alterations in ALAD activity level initiated by changes in PBGD expression indicates PBGD's central role in heme synthesis. This enables efficient ALA-PDT, even when PBGD is not fully active.

Notably, many PTKs have been identified as proto-oncogenes whose aberrant expression, mutations or co-option by pathogens can lead to human malignancies. Thus, it is obvious that PTK functions must be precisely regulated in order to maintain homeostasis of an organism. Investigations over the past fifteen years have revealed that members of the Cbl family proteins can serve as negative regulators of PTK signaling, and biochemical and cell biological studies have unraveled the mechanistic basis of this regulation. Yet, it is only recently that the field has begun to appreciate the real significance of this novel regulatory apparatus in shaping PTK-mediated signaling in organismic contexts and in human diseases. Here, we discuss recent progress in murine models that are beginning to provide insights into the critical roles of Cbl proteins in physiological pathways, with important implications in understanding how aberrations of Cbl proteins contribute to oncogenesis.","['Naramura, Mayumi', 'Band, Vimla', 'Band, Hamid']","['Naramura M', 'Band V', 'Band H']","['Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases; College of Medicine; University of Nebraska Medical Center; Omaha, NE USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Commun Integr Biol,Communicative & integrative biology,101478473,,,,2011/06/10 06:00,2011/06/10 06:01,['2011/06/10 06:00'],"['2011/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4161/cib.4.2.14716 [doi]', '1942-0889-4-2-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Commun Integr Biol. 2011 Mar;4(2):159-62. doi: 10.4161/cib.4.2.14716.,,PMC3104568,"['R01 CA087986/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA096844/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA116552/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105489/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA099163/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cbl', 'E3 ubiquitin ligase', 'RING finger', 'animal models', 'hematology', 'immunology', 'leukemia', 'protein tyrosine kinase', 'signal transduction', 'stem cell']",,,,,,,,

Indications for biopsy were nephrotic-range proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome in four) and chronic renal insufficiency. The mean time from diagnosis of the neoplasms to biopsy was 7.2 years. Histologically, mesangial sclerosis and hypercellularity were seen in all 11 cases, segmental sclerosis in 8, features of chronic thrombotic microangiopathy in 9, and intracapillary hematopoietic cells in 4.

The ideal T cell population must be able to home toward tumor site, exert prolonged antitumoral activity, and display minimal toxicity against normal tissues. Therefore, we characterized the in vitro antitumoral properties of three effector T-cell populations: Epstein-Barr virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (EBV-CTLs), cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells, and gamma(9)delta(2) T (GDT) cells, after transduction with a chimeric receptor specific for the CD33 antigen, broadly expressed on acute myeloid leukemia cells. EBV-CTLs, CIK, and GDT cells were generated and transduced with high efficiency with a retroviral vector coding for an anti-CD33-zeta chimeric receptor without alterations of their native phenotype. Anti-CD33-zeta chimeric receptor-redirected T cells displayed analogous in vitro chemotactic activity toward CXCL12. In addition, anti-CD33-zeta chimeric receptor-expressing EBV-CTLs, CIK, and GDT cells showed potent and similar cytotoxicity against several CD33(+) leukemic targets both in short-term 4-hours-(5)(1)chromium-release assays (mean killing vs primary leukemic cells at effector:target ratio of 5:1; 50%, 61%, and 50% for EBV-CTLs, CIK, and GDT cells, respectively) and in long-term assays, where they were cocultured with leukemic cells for 6 days on stromal mesenchymal cells (mean survival of primary leukemic cells at effector:target ratio of 1:100; 18%, 16%, and 29% for EBV-CTLs, CIK, and GDT cells, respectively). Moreover, all effector cells acquired consistent capability to proliferate in vitro after contact with CD33(+) cells and to release high and comparable levels of immunostimulatory cytokines, while secreting similar low amount of immunoregulatory cytokines as the unmanipulated counterpart. Our results indicate that expression of an anti-CD33-zeta chimeric receptor potently and similarly increase the antileukemic functions of different effector T-cell subtypes, underlying the impossibility to identify a more potent T-cell population through in vitro analysis, and consistently with recent observations that have emerged from clinical trials with chimeric receptor-modified T cells, suggesting the need to perform such type of studies in the human setting.","['Pizzitola, Irene', 'Agostoni, Valentina', 'Cribioli, Elisabetta', 'Pule, Martin', 'Rousseau, Raphael', 'Finney, Helene', 'Lawson, Alastair', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Biagi, Ettore', 'Marin, Virna']","['Pizzitola I', 'Agostoni V', 'Cribioli E', 'Pule M', 'Rousseau R', 'Finney H', 'Lawson A', 'Biondi A', 'Biagi E', 'Marin V']","['Centro Ricerca M.

This study examines utilization of Spanish-language oncology web-based resources and evaluates oncology-related Internet browsing practices of Spanish-speaking patients. METHODS: OncoLink (http://www.oncolink.org) is the oldest and among the largest Internet-based cancer information resources. In September 2005, OncoLink pioneered OncoLink en espanol (OEE) (http://es.oncolink.org), a Spanish translation of OncoLink. Internet utilization data on these sites for 2006 to 2007 were compared. RESULTS: Visits to OncoLink rose from 4,440,843 in 2006 to 5,125,952 in 2007. OEE had 204,578 unique visitors and 240,442 visits in 2006, and 351,228 visitors and 412,153 visits in 2007. Although there was no time predilection for viewing OncoLink, less relative browsing on OEE was conducted during weekends and early morning hours. Although OncoLink readers searched for information on the most common cancers in the United States, OEE readers most often search for gastric, vaginal, osteosarcoma, leukemia, penile, cervical, and testicular malignancies. Average visit duration on OEE was shorter, and fewer readers surveyed OEE more than 15 minutes (4.5% vs. 14.9%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Spanish-speaking users of web-based oncology resources are increasingly using the Internet to supplement their cancer knowledge. Limited available resources written in Spanish contribute to disparities in information access and disease outcomes. Spanish-speaking oncology readers differ from English-speaking readers in day and time of Internet browsing, visit duration, Internet search patterns, and types of cancers searched. By acknowledging these differences, content of web-based oncology resources can be developed to best target the needs of Spanish-speaking viewers.","['Simone, Charles B 2nd', 'Hampshire, Margaret K', 'Vachani, Carolyn', 'Metz, James M']","['Simone CB 2nd', 'Hampshire MK', 'Vachani C', 'Metz JM']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. csimone@alumni.upenn.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,,IM,"['Consumer Health Information/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hispanic or Latino/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', '*Information Seeking Behavior', 'Information Services/*statistics & numerical data', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Internet/*statistics & numerical data', 'Language', '*Neoplasms', 'Time Factors', 'User-Computer Interface']",2011/06/10 06:00,2013/01/29 06:00,['2011/06/10 06:00'],"['2011/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/COC.0b013e31821d4906 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 2012 Dec;35(6):520-6. doi: 10.1097/COC.0b013e31821d4906.,,PMC3171691,['Z99 CA999999/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS293067'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since hypomethylating agent, notably azacitidine, constitute an efficient therapy for patients with high-risk MDS, we assessed whether such compounds can activate the DDR in malignant blasts. While azacitidine and decitabine had moderate effects on apoptosis and cell cycle progression, both agents induced profound changes in the expression and functionality of DDR-related proteins. Decitabine, and to a lesser degree azacitidine, induced the activation of checkpoint kinases Chk-1 and Chk-2 and the phosphorylation of the DDR-sensor H2AX. In addition, hypomethylating agents were found to cause the dephosphorylation of the transcriptional regulator forkhead box O3, best known as FOXO3A, whose phosphorylation has been related to poor prognosis in AML. The dephoasphorylation of FOXO3A induced by azacitidine or decitabine in malignant blasts was accompanied by the translocation of FOXO3A from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.

The mechanisms for the formation of these variant translocations are not fully characterized. Here we report CML cases presenting a variant translocation indicating two-step mechanism with rare/novel chromosomal rearrangement. METHODS: Karyotype analysis was performed on metaphases obtained through short-term cultures of bone marrow and blood. Detection of BCR-ABL fusion gene was performed using dual-color dual-fusion (D-FISH) and extra signal (ES) translocation probes. BAC-FISH was also carried out. RESULTS: In Patient 1, the third partner chromosome was der(11)(p15) with a 2F2G1R signal pattern, which is an unusual signal pattern with the two-step mechanism. Patients 2 and 3 showed typical positive (2F1G1R) signal pattern. In Patient 2, both the chromosome 22s were involved in variant formation. The second fusion was observed below the BCR gene of the second homologue. In Patient 3 the third chromosome was der(13)(q14). The fourth patient showed a variant pattern with BCR/ABL-ES probe involving der(X)(q13) region. CONCLUSION: The presence of different rearrangements of both 9q34 and 22q11 regions highlights the genetic heterogeneity of this subgroup of CML. In each case with variants, further studies with FISH, BAC-FISH or more advanced technique such as microarray should be performed. Future studies should be performed to confirm the presence of true breakpoint hot spots and assess their implications in CML with variant Ph.","['Brahmbhatt, Manisha M', 'Trivedi, Pina J', 'Dalal, Esha N', 'Patel, Dharmesh M', 'Purani, Sejal S', 'Shukla, Shilin N', 'Shah, Pankaj M', 'Patel, Prabhudas S']","['Brahmbhatt MM', 'Trivedi PJ', 'Dalal EN', 'Patel DM', 'Purani SS', 'Shukla SN', 'Shah PM', 'Patel PS']","['Cell Biology Division, The Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute at Asarwa, Ahmedabad, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Assoc Genet Technol,Journal of the Association of Genetic Technologists,9807282,,,,2011/06/10 06:00,2011/06/10 06:01,['2011/06/10 06:00'],"['2011/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/10 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Assoc Genet Technol. 2011;37(2):69-75.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report the development of a Au-NC based targeted fluorescent nano-bioprobe for the flow-cytometric detection of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells. Au-NCs with approximately 25-28 atoms showing bright red-NIR fluorescence (600-750 nm) and average size of approximately 0.8 nm were prepared by bovine serum albumin assisted reduction-cum-stabilization in aqueous phase. The protein protected clusters were conjugated with monoclonal antibody against CD33 myeloid antigen, which is overexpressed in approximately 99.2% of the primitive population of AML cells, as confirmed by immunophenotyping using flow cytometry. Au-NC-CD33 conjugates having average size of approximately 12 nm retained bright fluorescence over an extended duration of approximately a year, as the albumin protein protects Au-NCs against degradation. Nanotoxicity studies revealed excellent biocompatibility of Au-NC conjugates, as they showed no adverse effect on the cell viability and inflammatory response. Target specificity of the conjugates for detecting CD33 expressing AML cells (KG1a) in flow cytometry showed specific staining of approximately 95.4% of leukaemia cells within 1-2 h compared to a non-specific uptake of approximately 8.2% in human peripheral blood cells (PBMCs) which are CD33(low). The confocal imaging also demonstrated the targeted uptake of CD33 conjugated Au-NCs by leukaemia cells, thus confirming the flow cytometry results. This study demonstrates that novel nano-bioprobes can be developed using protein protected fluorescent nanoclusters of Au for the molecular receptor targeted flow cytometry based detection and imaging of cancer cells.","['Retnakumari, Archana', 'Jayasimhan, Jasusri', 'Chandran, Parwathy', 'Menon, Deepthy', 'Nair, Shantikumar', 'Mony, Ullas', 'Koyakutty, Manzoor']","['Retnakumari A', 'Jayasimhan J', 'Chandran P', 'Menon D', 'Nair S', 'Mony U', 'Koyakutty M']","['Amrita Centre for Nanoscience and Molecular Medicine, Amrita Institute of Medical Science, Cochin 682 041, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nanotechnology,Nanotechnology,101241272,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*immunology', 'Biosensing Techniques/*methods', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Gold/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Inflammation/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry/toxicity/ultrastructure', 'Propidium/metabolism', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/metabolism', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared']",2011/06/10 06:00,2011/12/20 06:00,['2011/06/10 06:00'],"['2011/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0957-4484(11)80226-6 [pii]', '10.1088/0957-4484/22/28/285102 [doi]']",ppublish,Nanotechnology. 2011 Jul 15;22(28):285102. doi: 10.1088/0957-4484/22/28/285102.

We undertook an epidemiologic study to estimate the true rate of early death with data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. A total of 1400 patients with a diagnosis of APL between 1992 and 2007 were identified. The overall early death rate was 17.3%, and only a modest change in early death rate was observed over time. The early death rate was significantly higher in patients aged >/= 55 years (24.2%; P < .0001). The 3-year survival improved from 54.6% to 70.1% over the study period but was significantly lower in patients aged >/= 55 years (46.4%; P < .0001). This study shows that the early death rate remains high despite the wide availability of all-trans retinoic acid and appears significantly higher than commonly reported in multicenter clinical trials.

However, the effect of TKIs on leukemic stem cells remains incompletely understood. On the basis of a statistical modeling approach that used the 10-year imatinib mesylate treatment response of patients with CML and a patient cohort receiving first-line nilotinib therapy, we found that successful long-term therapy results in a triphasic exponential decline of BCR-ABL1 transcripts in many patients. Within our framework, the first slope of -0.052 +/- 0.018 (imatinib mesylate) and -0.042 +/- 0.015 (nilotinib) per day represents the turnover rate of leukemic differentiated cells, whereas the second slope of -0.0057 +/- 0.0038 (imatinib mesylate) and -0.0019 +/- 0.0013 (nilotinib) per day represents the turnover rate of leukemic progenitor cells. The third slope allows an inference of the behavior of immature leukemic cells, potentially stem cells. This third slope is negative in most patients, positive in others, and not observable in some patients. This variability in response may be because of insufficient follow-up, missing data, disease heterogeneity, inconsistent compliance to drug, or acquired resistance. Our approach suggests that long-term TKI therapy may reduce the abundance of leukemic stem cells in some patients.","['Tang, Min', 'Gonen, Mithat', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Field, Chani', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Branford, Susan', 'Michor, Franziska']","['Tang M', 'Gonen M', 'Quintas-Cardama A', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H', 'Field C', 'Hughes TP', 'Branford S', 'Michor F']","['Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Benzamides', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/06/10 06:00,2011/10/19 06:00,['2011/06/10 06:00'],"['2011/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40793-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-02-339267 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Aug 11;118(6):1622-31. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-02-339267.

Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFTs) are characterized by the t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation that generates the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 and Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (EWS-FLI1) fusion transcription factor responsible for the highly malignant phenotype of this tumor. Although continued expression of EWS-FLI1 is believed to be critical for ESFT cell survival, a clinically effective small-molecule inhibitor remains elusive likely because EWS-FLI1 is a transcription factor and therefore widely felt to be ""undruggable."" METHODS: We developed a high-throughput screen to evaluate more than 50 000 compounds for inhibition of EWS-FLI1 activity in TC32 ESFT cells. We used a TC32 cell-based luciferase reporter screen using the EWS-FLI1 downstream target NR0B1 promoter and a gene signature secondary screen to sort and prioritize the compounds. We characterized the lead compound, mithramycin, based on its ability to inhibit EWS-FLI1 activity in vitro using microarray expression profiling, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and immunoblot analysis, and in vivo using immunohistochemistry. We studied the impact of this inhibition on cell viability in vitro and on tumor growth in ESFT xenograft models in vivo (n = 15-20 mice per group). All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Mithramycin inhibited expression of EWS-FLI1 downstream targets at the mRNA and protein levels and decreased the growth of ESFT cells at half maximal inhibitory concentrations between 10 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 8 to 13 nM) and 15 nM (95% CI = 13 to 19 nM). Mithramycin suppressed the growth of two different ESFT xenograft tumors and prolonged the survival of ESFT xenograft-bearing mice by causing a decrease in mean tumor volume. For example, in the TC32 xenograft model, on day 15 of treatment, the mean tumor volume for the mithramycin-treated mice was approximately 3% of the tumor volume observed in the control mice (mithramycin vs control: 69 vs 2388 mm(3), difference = 2319 mm(3), 95% CI = 1766 to 2872 mm(3), P < .001). CONCLUSION: Mithramycin inhibits EWS-FLI1 activity and demonstrates ESFT antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo.","['Grohar, Patrick J', 'Woldemichael, Girma M', 'Griffin, Laurie B', 'Mendoza, Arnulfo', 'Chen, Qing-Rong', 'Yeung, Choh', 'Currier, Duane G', 'Davis, Sean', 'Khanna, Chand', 'Khan, Javed', 'McMahon, James B', 'Helman, Lee J']","['Grohar PJ', 'Woldemichael GM', 'Griffin LB', 'Mendoza A', 'Chen QR', 'Yeung C', 'Currier DG', 'Davis S', 'Khanna C', 'Khan J', 'McMahon JB', 'Helman LJ']","['Molecular Oncology Section, Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, 10 Center Dr-MSC 1104, 10 CRC 1W-3816, Bethesda, MD 20892-1104, USA. groharp@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (EWS-FLI fusion protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein EWS)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'NIJ123W41V (Plicamycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Plicamycin/*pharmacology', 'Protein Array Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/*drug effects/*genetics', 'RNA-Binding Protein EWS/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Translocation, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2011/06/10 06:00,2011/08/19 06:00,['2011/06/10 06:00'],"['2011/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['djr156 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djr156 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2011 Jun 22;103(12):962-78. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djr156.

Doing Our Part was identified as the core theme explaining the process of adherence and involves the parent (or patient) taking responsibility for assuring that medications are taken as prescribed. Understanding the association between taking oral chemotherapy and control/cure of leukemia (Making the Connection) appeared to mediate adherence behaviors.","['Landier, Wendy', 'Hughes, Cynthia B', 'Calvillo, Evelyn R', 'Anderson, Nancy L R', 'Briseno-Toomey, Deborah', 'Dominguez, Leticia', 'Martinez, Alex M', 'Hanby, Cara', 'Bhatia, Smita']","['Landier W', 'Hughes CB', 'Calvillo ER', 'Anderson NL', 'Briseno-Toomey D', 'Dominguez L', 'Martinez AM', 'Hanby C', 'Bhatia S']","['Department of Population Sciences, Center for Cancer Survivorship, City of Hope, 1500 E.

It is unknown whether prenatal immune development may differ in children who develop the disease. The current study examines the association between neonatal cytokine profiles, a proxy measure for a child's prenatal immune development, and childhood ALL. METHODS: Neonatal blood spots of 116 childhood ALL cases and 116 controls living in California were ascertained. Eleven cytokines associated with Th1, Th2, and Th17 lymphocytes were measured using a multiplex bead-based assay. Unconditional logistic regression was done to estimate the odds ratio (OR) by measuring the association between neonatal cytokines and ALL adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and household income. RESULTS: Of the 11 cytokines measured, 5 [interleukin (IL)4, IL6, IL10, IL12, and IL13] were detectable. Except for IL12, the other 4 cytokines were all significantly lower among cases than controls. In a multivariable model including the 5 cytokines, only IL10 remained independently associated with childhood ALL with an OR = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.18, comparing the highest tertile to the lowest tertile. CONCLUSIONS: A child's neonatal level of IL10, a key regulator for modulating the intensity and duration of immune responses, is associated with his/her subsequent risk of developing ALL. IMPACT: The current analysis shows that children with ALL may have a dysregulated immune function present at birth.","['Chang, Jeffrey S', 'Zhou, Mi', 'Buffler, Patricia A', 'Chokkalingam, Anand P', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Wiemels, Joseph L']","['Chang JS', 'Zhou M', 'Buffler PA', 'Chokkalingam AP', 'Metayer C', 'Wiemels JL']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143-0520, USA. jeffreychang@nhri.org.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,['130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/blood/*deficiency/immunology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Risk Factors']",2011/06/10 06:00,2012/02/02 06:00,['2011/06/10 06:00'],"['2011/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-11-0162 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-11-0162 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2011 Aug;20(8):1736-40. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-11-0162.

Homozygous Ddx18 mutant embryos exhibit a profound loss of myeloid and erythroid cells along with cardiovascular abnormalities and reduced size. These mutants also display prominent apoptosis and a G1 cell-cycle arrest. Loss of p53, but not Bcl-xl overexpression, rescues myeloid cells to normal levels, suggesting that the hematopoietic defect is because of p53-dependent G1 cell-cycle arrest. We then sequenced primary samples from 262 patients with myeloid malignancies because genes essential for myelopoiesis are often mutated in human leukemias. We identified 4 nonsynonymous sequence variants (NSVs) of DDX18 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples. RNA encoding wild-type DDX18 and 3 NSVs rescued the hematopoietic defect, indicating normal DDX18 activity. RNA encoding one mutation, DDX18-E76del, was unable to rescue hematopoiesis, and resulted in reduced myeloid cell numbers in ddx18(hi1727/+) embryos, indicating this NSV likely functions as a dominant-negative allele. These studies demonstrate the use of the zebrafish as a robust in vivo system for assessing the function of genes mutated in AML, which will become increasingly important as more sequence variants are identified by next-generation resequencing technologies.","['Payne, Elspeth M', 'Bolli, Niccolo', 'Rhodes, Jennifer', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar I', 'Levine, Ross', 'Hedvat, Cyrus V', 'Stone, Richard', 'Khanna-Gupta, Arati', 'Sun, Hong', 'Kanki, John P', 'Gazda, Hanna T', 'Beggs, Alan H', 'Cotter, Finbarr E', 'Look, A Thomas']","['Payne EM', 'Bolli N', 'Rhodes J', 'Abdel-Wahab OI', 'Levine R', 'Hedvat CV', 'Stone R', 'Khanna-Gupta A', 'Sun H', 'Kanki JP', 'Gazda HT', 'Beggs AH', 'Cotter FE', 'Look AT']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. e.payne@ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (DDX18 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Ddx18 protein, zebrafish)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/*genetics', 'Cell Separation', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Zebrafish/*metabolism', 'Zebrafish Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/06/10 06:00,2011/10/15 06:00,['2011/06/10 06:00'],"['2011/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44680-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-11-318022 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jul 28;118(4):903-15. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-11-318022.

These phenomena are often associated with the appearance of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL1 kinase mutants (eg, T315I) and overexpression of BCR-ABL1. Here we show that BCR-ABL1 (nonmutated and T315I mutant) promoted RAD51 recombinase-mediated unfaithful homeologous recombination repair (HomeoRR) in a dosage-dependent manner. BCR-ABL1 SH3 domain interacts with RAD51 proline-rich regions, resulting in direct phosphorylation of RAD51 on Y315 (pY315). RAD51(pY315) facilitates dissociation from the complex with BCR-ABL1 kinase, migrates to the nucleus, and enhances formation of the nuclear foci indicative of recombination sites. HomeoRR and RAD51 nuclear foci were strongly reduced by RAD51(Y315F) phosphorylation-less mutant. In addition, peptide aptamer mimicking RAD51(pY315) fragment, but not that with Y315F phosphorylation-less substitution, diminished RAD51 foci formation and inhibited HomeoRR in leukemia cells. In conclusion, we postulate that BCR-ABL1 kinase-mediated RAD51(pY315) promotes unfaithful HomeoRR in leukemia cells, which may contribute to accumulation of secondary chromosomal aberrations responsible for CML relapse and progression.","['Slupianek, Artur', 'Dasgupta, Yashodhara', 'Ren, Shu-Yue', 'Gurdek, Ewa', 'Donlin, Milene', 'Nieborowska-Skorska, Margaret', 'Fleury, Fabrice', 'Skorski, Tomasz']","['Slupianek A', 'Dasgupta Y', 'Ren SY', 'Gurdek E', 'Donlin M', 'Nieborowska-Skorska M', 'Fleury F', 'Skorski T']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rad51 Recombinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Repair/*physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rad51 Recombinase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2011/06/10 06:00,2011/10/15 06:00,['2011/06/10 06:00'],"['2011/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44697-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-09-307256 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jul 28;118(4):1062-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-09-307256.

Toll-like receptors (TLR) are transmembrane inflammatory receptors that on recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns trigger an innate immune response and bridge the innate and adaptive immune response by acting as costimulatory signals for B cells. Fine tuning of TLR and IL-1R-like (ILR) activity is regulated by TIR8 (SIGIRR), a transmembrane receptor of the TLR/ILR family which inhibits other family members. To test the hypothesis that TLR and/or ILR may play a role in the natural history of chronic B-cell tumors, we crossed Emu-TCL1 transgenic mice, a well established model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), with mice lacking the inhibitory receptor TIR8 that allow an unabated TLR-mediated stimulation. We here report that in the absence of TIR8 the appearance of monoclonal B-cell expansions is accelerated and mouse life span is shortened. The morphology and phenotype of the mouse leukemic expansions reproduce the progression of human CLL into an aggressive and frequently terminal phase characterized by the appearance of prolymphocytes. This study reveals an important pathogenetic implication of TLR in CLL development and progression.","['Bertilaccio, Maria Teresa Sabrina', 'Simonetti, Giorgia', 'Dagklis, Antonis', 'Rocchi, Martina', 'Rodriguez, Tania Veliz', 'Apollonio, Benedetta', 'Mantovani, Alberto', 'Ponzoni, Maurilio', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Garlanda, Cecilia', 'Caligaris-Cappio, Federico', 'Muzio, Marta']","['Bertilaccio MT', 'Simonetti G', 'Dagklis A', 'Rocchi M', 'Rodriguez TV', 'Apollonio B', 'Mantovani A', 'Ponzoni M', 'Ghia P', 'Garlanda C', 'Caligaris-Cappio F', 'Muzio M']","['Division of Molecular Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Cd5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (Tcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tir8 protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'CD5 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/immunology/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1/*genetics/*immunology', 'Toll-Like Receptors/immunology']",2011/06/10 06:00,2011/10/08 06:00,['2011/06/10 06:00'],"['2011/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44746-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-01-329870 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jul 21;118(3):660-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-01-329870.

METHODS: In total, 20 paediatric patients with de novo ALL were included. In each patient, vincristine toxicity in the period with and without azole co-medication was retrospectively graded according to the US National Cancer Institute toxicity scale. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and McNemar's test. RESULTS: Patients receiving vincristine in combination with azole treatment experienced significantly more constipation and peripheral neurotoxicity (P = 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). Vincristine-induced CNS toxicity was only seen in patients (30%) receiving vincristine in combination with azole treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Vincristine toxicity is significantly enhanced when combined with azole treatment and can even be life threatening.

By virtue of its involvement in the regulation of cell physiology, it is not surprising that a deregulation of the Notch pathway leads to the development of different tumors. In this review, we critically discuss the latest findings concerning Notch roles in hematologic oncology, with a special focus on T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and B-cell malignancies.

Due to concern over long-term use, the NTP evaluated the subchronic and chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of androstenedione in male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice. In subchronic studies, dose limiting effects were not observed. A chronic (2-year) exposure by gavage at 10, 20, or 50 mg/kg in rats and male mice, and 2, 10, or 50 mg/kg in female mice (50 mg/kg, maximum feasible dose) was conducted. Increased incidences of lung alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma and carcinoma occurred in the 20 mg/kg male rats and increases in mononuclear cell leukemia occurred in the 20 and 50 mg/kg female rats, which may have been related to androstenedione administration. In male and female mice, androstenedione was carcinogenic based upon a significant increase in hepatocellular tumors. A marginal increase in pancreatic islet cell adenomas in male (50 mg/kg) and female (2, 10, 50 mg/kg) mice was considered to be related to androstenedione administration. Interestingly, incidences of male rat Leydig cell adenomas and female rat mammary gland fibroadenomas decreased. In conclusion, androstenedione was determined to be carcinogenic in male and female mice, and may have been carcinogenic in rats.","['Blystone, Chad R', 'Elmore, Susan A', 'Witt, Kristine L', 'Malarkey, David E', 'Foster, Paul M D']","['Blystone CR', 'Elmore SA', 'Witt KL', 'Malarkey DE', 'Foster PM']","['National Toxicology Program, National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institute of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, United States. blystonecr@niehs.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '409J2J96VR (Androstenedione)']",IM,"['Androstenedione/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344']",2011/06/10 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/10 06:00'],"['2011/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/19 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0278-6915(11)00238-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fct.2011.05.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2011 Sep;49(9):2116-24. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2011.05.026.

They are useful for gene expression studies and genetic manipulation in vitro and in vivo. Many retroviral vectors are derived from the mouse gammaretrovirus, murine leukemia virus (MLV). These vectors have been widely used in gene therapy clinical trials. XMRV, initially found in prostate cancer tissue, was the first human gammaretrovirus described. FINDINGS: We developed a new retroviral vector based on XMRV called pXC. It was developed for gene transfer to human cells and is produced by transient cotransfection of LNCaP cells with pXC and XMRV-packaging plasmids. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that pXC mediates expression of inserted transgenes in cell lines. This new vector will be a useful tool for gene transfer in human and non-human cell lines, including gene therapy studies.","['Cervantes-Garcia, Daniel', 'Rojas-Martinez, Augusto', 'Camerini, David']","['Cervantes-Garcia D', 'Rojas-Martinez A', 'Camerini D']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Center for Virus Research and Institute for Immunology, University of California, Irvine, California, 92697-4068, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,,IM,"['Cell Line', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Virus Assembly', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/*genetics']",2011/06/10 06:00,2011/09/14 06:00,['2011/06/10 06:00'],"['2011/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1743-422X-8-284 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-8-284 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2011 Jun 8;8:284. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-8-284.,20110608,PMC3125358,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypoxia is also an important environmental factor in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), because bone marrow is intrinsically hypoxic in nature. Systems-wide analyses of tumors have recently identified receptor tyrosine kinase coactivation as an important mechanism by which cancer cells achieve chemoresistance. Recent work suggests that Src activation might play a prominent role in the response to hypoxia to promote cell survival, progression, and metastasis of a variety of human cancer. Other studies also established a functional link between Bcr-Abl and the Src family tyrosine kinases. It is well known that mutations can also cause some tyrosine kinases to become constitutively active, a nonstop functional state that may contribute to initiation or progression of cancer as in CML. Leukemic cells carrying chromosomal alteration, are sensitive to imatinib that induces complete remission in most patients. This inhibitor is a highly selective Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). There is a considerable interest in understanding how activated signaling pathways enhance tumor cell survival under hypoxia, because this might lead to the introduction of more effective treatments to target these resistant subpopulations. For all these reasons it is important to identify new TKIs which are also active in hypoxia, the real tumor microenvironment, as possible alternative therapy.","['Filippi, I', 'Naldini, A', 'Carraro, F']","['Filippi I', 'Naldini A', 'Carraro F']","['Unit of Neuroimmunophysiology, Department of Physiology, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Hypoxia/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*drug effects', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2011/06/10 06:00,2011/10/26 06:00,['2011/06/10 06:00'],"['2011/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['BSP/CMC/E-Pub/2011/ 211 [pii]', '10.2174/092986711796150540 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2011;18(19):2885-92. doi: 10.2174/092986711796150540.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ATO (arsenic trioxide) is a multi-target drug that has been effectively used as an anticancer drug in acute promyelocytic leukaemia. However, a Phase II trial involving patients with HCC indicates that the use of arsenic as a single agent is not effective against HCC. TGIF (TG-interacting factor) is a transcriptional co-repressor that interferes with TGF-beta (transforming growth factor-beta) signalling which plays a growth-inhibitory role in HCC. In the present study, we demonstrated that ATO induced hepatocellular apoptosis via TGF-beta/Smad signalling and led to downstream induction of p21(WAF1/CIP1) (p21). However, ATO could also induce TGIF expression via a post-transcriptional regulation mechanism to antagonize this effect. Using a biotin-labelled RNA probe pull-down assay and in vivo RNA immunoprecipitation analysis, we identified that HuR (human antigen R) bound to the TGIF mRNA 3'-UTR (3'-untranslated region) and prevented it from degradation. ATO treatment increased the interaction between HuR and TGIF mRNA, and reduction of HuR expression inhibited ATO-induced TGIF expression. Moreover, the EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor)/PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/Akt pathway was shown to mediate the post-transcriptional regulation of TGIF in response to ATO. Finally, we also demonstrated that the down-regulation of TGIF could sensitize ATO-induced HepG2 cell apoptosis. Collectively, we propose that the EGFR/PI3K/Akt pathway may regulate the post-transcriptional regulation of TGIF expression to antagonize ATO-induced apoptosis in HCC.

However, most patients with a diagnosis of CLL will subsequently have significant morbidity and die from their disease and its complications. For these patients, CLL is not the 'good leukemia' with a predictably 'benign' outcome. Indeed, we can now identify a cohort of patients with high-risk CLL at diagnosis who will have rapid disease progression, poor response to treatment, and poor survival based on prognostic methods developed from an improved understanding of the biology of CLL. The concomitant development of improved treatments has led to risk-adjusted management approaches that could improve outcomes. We discuss the clinical and laboratory components of comprehensive risk evaluation of patients with CLL and our approach to the management of patients with a high to very high risk of disease progression and poor outcome. In addition, we review the challenges and prospects for improving prognostic precision and the development of new drugs to improve the treatment of patients with CLL with a high risk of adverse outcome.","['Zent, Clive S', 'Kay, Neil E']","['Zent CS', 'Kay NE']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. zent.clive@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",2011/06/09 06:00,2011/12/20 06:00,['2011/06/09 06:00'],"['2011/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.568654 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Aug;52(8):1425-34. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.568654.

Myeloablative conditioning before allogeneic umbilical cord blood transplant (allo-UCBT) results in thymic epithelial cell injury and T-cell immune deficiency. Full-term fetal blood cells were used as hematopoietic cells in a previous murine allo-UCBT model with a limited number of mice surviving the myeloablative conditioning. We designed a viable murine allo-UCBT protocol with platelet concentrate support. Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is a mitogen of thymic epithelial cells that promotes recovery of thymic epithelium when given before total body irradiation (TBI)-containing conditioning in experimental murine models. We hypothesized that KGF pre-administration would improve post-allo-UCBT thymopoiesis. To test this hypothesis, allo-UCBT recipient mice were given KGF or control saline prior to UCBT. Platelet concentrate support significantly improved the survival rate of murine allo-UCBT recipients. KGF administration significantly increased donor-derived T and natural killer T (NKT) cells at day +35 in spleens of allo-UCBT recipients. KGF administration also improved thymic function after allo-UCBT, resulting in higher copies of signal joint T-cell receptor rearrangement excision circles (sjTRECs) in splenocytes. Finally, we found that KGF pre-administration could enhance the graft-versus-leukemia effect. In conclusion, KGF can be administered safely to recipients of allo-UCBT to enhance T-cell immune reconstitution.","['Wang, Yi', 'Chen, Guanghua', 'Qiao, Shumin', 'Ma, Xiao', 'Tang, Xiaowen', 'Sun, Aining', 'Wu, Depei']","['Wang Y', 'Chen G', 'Qiao S', 'Ma X', 'Tang X', 'Sun A', 'Wu D']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Ministry of Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['126469-10-1 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 7)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 7/*pharmacology', 'Graft Survival/drug effects/immunology', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*drug effects/immunology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Pregnancy', 'Spleen/drug effects/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Thymectomy', 'Thymus Gland/drug effects/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2011/06/09 06:00,2011/12/20 06:00,['2011/06/09 06:00'],"['2011/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.573037 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Aug;52(8):1556-66. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.573037.

In total, 108 IGH@ rearrangements were analyzed. Most of them (75.3%) were non-productive. IGHV@ segments proximal to IGHD-IGHJ@ were preferentially rearranged (45.3%). Increased utilization of IGHV3 segments IGHV3-13 (11.3%) and IGHV3-15 (9.3%), IGHD3 (30.5%), and IGHJ4 (34%) was noted. In pro-B ALL more frequent were IGHV3-11 (33.3%) and IGHV6-1 (33.3%), IGHD2-21 (50%), IGHJ4 (50%), and IGHJ6 (50%) segments. Shorter CDR3 length was observed in IGHV@6, IGHD7, and IGHJ1 segments, whereas increased CDR3 length was related to IGHV3, IGHD2, and IGHJ4 segments. Increased risk of relapse was found in patients with productive sequences. Specifically, the relapse-free survival rate at 5 years in patients with productive sequences at diagnosis was 75% (standard error [SE] +/-9%), whereas in patients with non-productive sequences it was 97% (SE +/-1.92%) (p-value =0.0264). Monoclonality and oligoclonality were identified in 81.2% and 18.75% cases at diagnosis, respectively. Sequence analysis revealed IGHV@ to IGHDJ joining only in 6.6% cases with oligoclonality. The majority (75%) of relapsed patients had monoclonal IGH@ rearrangements. The preferential utilization of IGHV@ segments proximal to IGHDJ depended on their location on the IGHV@ locus. Molecular mechanisms occurring during IGH@ rearrangement might play an essential role in childhood ALL prognosis. In our study, the productivity of the rearranged sequences at diagnosis proved to be a significant prognostic factor.","['Katsibardi, Katerina', 'Braoudaki, Maria', 'Papathanasiou, Chrissa', 'Karamolegou, Kalliopi', 'Tzortzatou-Stathopoulou, Fotini']","['Katsibardi K', 'Braoudaki M', 'Papathanasiou C', 'Karamolegou K', 'Tzortzatou-Stathopoulou F']","[""Hematology/Oncology Unit, First Department of Pediatrics, University of Athens, Aghia Sophia' Children's Hospital, Athens, Greece. katharinakats@hotmail.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis']",2011/06/09 06:00,2011/12/21 06:00,['2011/06/09 06:00'],"['2011/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.582907 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Sep;52(9):1751-7. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.582907.

Interactions between tumor cells and the extracellular matrix are in part mediated by CD44, whose principal ligand is hyaluronic acid. Here, we show that CD44 is more highly expressed on CLL cells of the clinically more progressive immunglobulin heavy chain variable gene (IGHV)-unmutated subtype than on cells of the IGHV-mutated type. Engagement of CD44 activated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK pathways and increased myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL-1) protein expression. Consistent with the induction of these anti-apoptotic mechanisms, CD44 protected CLL cells from spontaneous and fludarabine-induced apoptosis. Obatoclax, an antagonist of MCL-1, blocked the pro-survival effect of CD44. In addition, obatoclax synergized with fludarabine to induce apoptosis of CLL cells. In conclusion, components of the extracellular matrix may provide survival signals to CLL cells through engagement of CD44. Inhibition of MCL-1 is a promising strategy to reduce the anti-apoptotic effect of the microenvironment on CLL cells.","['Herishanu, Yair', 'Gibellini, Federica', 'Njuguna, Ndegwa', 'Hazan-Halevy, Inbal', 'Farooqui, Mohammed', 'Bern, Sarah', 'Keyvanfar, Keyvan', 'Lee, Elinor', 'Wilson, Wyndham', 'Wiestner, Adrian']","['Herishanu Y', 'Gibellini F', 'Njuguna N', 'Hazan-Halevy I', 'Farooqui M', 'Bern S', 'Keyvanfar K', 'Lee E', 'Wilson W', 'Wiestner A']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Blood, and Lung Institute, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD20892-1202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Extracellular Matrix/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2011/06/09 06:00,2011/12/21 06:00,['2011/06/09 06:00'],"['2011/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.569962 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Sep;52(9):1758-69. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.569962.

In our screen, the presence of APBs was used as a marker to identify proteins required for the ALT mechanism. A cell-based assay and an automatic confocal image acquisition procedure were established. Using automatic image analysis based on 3D parametric intensity models to identify APBs, we conducted an unbiased and quantitative analysis of nine different candidate genes. A comparison with the literature and manual analysis of the gene knockdown demonstrates the reliability of our approach.

The MDM2 SNP309 genotypes in 173 CLL patients and 260 healthy controls were detected by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method, which was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. Compared with the T/T genotype, the SNP309 G/G genotype instead of T/G heterozygote was associated with a significantly increased risk of CLL (OR = 2.84; 95% CI 1.61-5.03; p < 0.001). Age at onset of CLL was similar irrespective of MDM2 status. MDM2 mRNA expression within CLL of G/G genotype was significantly higher than that in T/G (p = 0.009) and T/T genotypes (p < 0.001). Excluding patients with p53 deletions or mutations enhanced the significance of the findings (G/G vs. T/T, p < 0.001; G/G vs. T/G p = 0.001), which prompted us to study the role of the polymorphism in p53 wild-type individuals. In the p53 wild-type groups, survival analysis showed that the patients with MDM2 SNP309 G/G and T/G genotypes both had significantly shorter treatment-free survival (TFS) than SNP309 T/T genotype. Notably, univariate and multivariate analyses showed that MDM2 SNP309 genotypes were associated with TFS. These data show that MDM2 309G polymorphisms contribute to the risk of developing CLL. The unfavorable MDM2 SNP309 G/G genotype was associated with an increase of MDM2 mRNA expression. MDM2 SNP309 was found to be associated with TFS in p53 wild-type Chinese CLL populations.","['Dong, Hua-Jie', 'Fang, Cheng', 'Fan, Lei', 'Zhu, Dan-Xia', 'Wang, Dong-Mei', 'Zhu, Hua-Yuan', 'Zhuang, Yun', 'Miao, Kou-Rong', 'Liu, Peng', 'Xu, Wei', 'Li, Jian-Yong']","['Dong HJ', 'Fang C', 'Fan L', 'Zhu DX', 'Wang DM', 'Zhu HY', 'Zhuang Y', 'Miao KR', 'Liu P', 'Xu W', 'Li JY']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",2011/06/08 06:00,2012/05/16 06:00,['2011/06/08 06:00'],"['2011/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.26222 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2012 May 1;130(9):2054-61. doi: 10.1002/ijc.26222.

Vav1 is also important for the agonist-induced maturation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)-derived promyelocytes, in which it promotes the acquisition of a mature phenotype by playing multiple functions at both cytoplasmic and nuclear levels. We investigated the possible role of Vav1 in the differentiation of leukemic precursors to monocytes/macrophages. Tumoral promyelocytes in which Vav1 was negatively modulated were induced to differentiate into monocytes/macrophages with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and monitored for their maturation-related properties. We found that Vav1 was crucial for the phenotypical differentiation of tumoral myeloid precursors to monocytes/macrophages, in terms of CD11b expression, adhesion capability and cell morphology. Confocal analysis revealed that Vav1 may synergize with actin in modulating nuclear morphology of PMA-treated adherent cells. Our data indicate that, in tumoral promyelocytes, Vav1 is a component of lineage-specific transduction machineries that can be recruited by various differentiating agents. Since Vav1 plays a central role in the completion of the differentiation program of leukemic promyelocytes along diverse hematopoietic lineages, it can be considered a common target for developing new therapeutic strategies for the various subtypes of myeloid leukemias.","['Bertagnolo, Valeria', 'Nika, Ervin', 'Brugnoli, Federica', 'Bonora, Massimo', 'Grassilli, Silvia', 'Pinton, Paolo', 'Capitani, Silvano']","['Bertagnolo V', 'Nika E', 'Brugnoli F', 'Bonora M', 'Grassilli S', 'Pinton P', 'Capitani S']","['Signal Transduction Unit, Section of Human Anatomy, Department of Morphology and Embryology, University of Ferrara, Via Fossato di Mortara 66, Ferrara, Italy. bgv@unife.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cell Tissue Res,Cell and tissue research,0417625,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '0 (VAV1 protein, human)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus Shape/drug effects', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Cytoskeleton/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2011/06/08 06:00,2011/11/16 06:00,['2011/06/08 06:00'],"['2010/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00441-011-1195-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Tissue Res. 2011 Jul;345(1):163-75. doi: 10.1007/s00441-011-1195-5.

Caveat emptor!,e19953,10.1371/journal.pone.0019953 [doi],"BACKGROUND: XMRV is the most recently described retrovirus to be found in Man, firstly in patients with prostate cancer (PC) and secondly in 67% of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and 3.7% of controls. Both disease associations remain contentious. Indeed, a recent publication has concluded that ""XMRV is unlikely to be a human pathogen"". Subsequently related but different polytropic MLV (pMLV) sequences were also reported from the blood of 86.5% of patients with CFS. and 6.8% of controls. Consequently we decided to investigate blood donors for evidence of XMRV/pMLV. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Testing of cDNA prepared from the whole blood of 80 random blood donors, generated gag PCR signals from two samples (7C and 9C). These had previously tested negative for XMRV by two other PCR based techniques. To test whether the PCR mix was the source of these sequences 88 replicates of water were amplified using Invitrogen Platinum Taq (IPT) and Applied Biosystems Taq Gold LD (ABTG). Four gag sequences (2D, 3F, 7H, 12C) were generated with the IPT, a further sequence (12D) by ABTG re-amplification of an IPT first round product. Sequence comparisons revealed remarkable similarities between these sequences, endogeous MLVs and the pMLV sequences reported in patients with CFS. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Methodologies for the detection of viruses highly homologous to endogenous murine viruses require special caution as the very reagents used in the detection process can be a source of contamination and at a level where it is not immediately apparent. It is suggested that such contamination is likely to explain the apparent presence of pMLV in CFS.","['Tuke, Philip W', 'Tettmar, Kate I', 'Tamuri, Asif', 'Stoye, Jonathan P', 'Tedder, Richard S']","['Tuke PW', 'Tettmar KI', 'Tamuri A', 'Stoye JP', 'Tedder RS']","['Transfusion Microbiology Research and Development, National Transfusion Microbiology Laboratories, National Health Service Blood and Transplant, Colindale, London, United Kingdom. philip.tuke@hpa.org.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', '*DNA Contamination', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Mice', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'RNA, Viral/blood/genetics', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/genetics']",2011/06/08 06:00,2011/09/23 06:00,['2011/06/08 06:00'],"['2011/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0019953 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-01147 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(5):e19953. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0019953.

In contrast to other proteases, the understanding of Taspase1's (patho)biological relevance and function is limited, since neither small molecule inhibitors nor cell based functional assays for Taspase1 are currently available. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: Efficient cell-based assays to probe Taspase1 function in vivo are presented here. These are composed of glutathione S-transferase, autofluorescent protein variants, Taspase1 cleavage sites and rational combinations of nuclear import and export signals. The biosensors localize predominantly to the cytoplasm, whereas expression of biologically active Taspase1 but not of inactive Taspase1 mutants or of the protease Caspase3 triggers their proteolytic cleavage and nuclear accumulation. Compared to in vitro assays using recombinant components the in vivo assay was highly efficient. Employing an optimized nuclear translocation algorithm, the triple-color assay could be adapted to a high-throughput microscopy platform (Z'factor = 0.63). Automated high-content data analysis was used to screen a focused compound library, selected by an in silico pharmacophor screening approach, as well as a collection of fungal extracts. Screening identified two compounds, N-[2-[(4-amino-6-oxo-3H-pyrimidin-2-yl)sulfanyl]ethyl]benzenesulfonamide and 2-benzyltriazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid, which partially inhibited Taspase1 cleavage in living cells. Additionally, the assay was exploited to probe endogenous Taspase1 in solid tumor cell models and to identify an improved consensus sequence for efficient Taspase1 cleavage. This allowed the in silico identification of novel putative Taspase1 targets. Those include the FERM Domain-Containing Protein 4B, the Tyrosine-Protein Phosphatase Zeta, and DNA Polymerase Zeta. Cleavage site recognition and proteolytic processing of these substrates were verified in the context of the biosensor. CONCLUSIONS: The assay not only allows to genetically probe Taspase1 structure function in vivo, but is also applicable for high-content screening to identify Taspase1 inhibitors. Such tools will provide novel insights into Taspase1's function and its potential therapeutic relevance.","['Knauer, Shirley K', 'Fetz, Verena', 'Rabenstein, Jens', 'Friedl, Sandra', 'Hofmann, Bettina', 'Sabiani, Samaneh', 'Schroder, Elisabeth', 'Kunst, Lena', 'Proschak, Eugen', 'Thines, Eckhard', 'Kindler, Thomas', 'Schneider, Gisbert', 'Marschalek, Rolf', 'Stauber, Roland H', 'Bier, Carolin']","['Knauer SK', 'Fetz V', 'Rabenstein J', 'Friedl S', 'Hofmann B', 'Sabiani S', 'Schroder E', 'Kunst L', 'Proschak E', 'Thines E', 'Kindler T', 'Schneider G', 'Marschalek R', 'Stauber RH', 'Bier C']","['Institute for Molecular Biology, Centre for Medical Biotechnology (ZMB), University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Protease Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (taspase1, human)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Biological Assay/*methods', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Pharmacogenetics/*methods', 'Protease Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology']",2011/06/08 06:00,2011/09/23 06:00,['2011/06/08 06:00'],"['2010/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0018253 [doi]', 'PONE-D-10-05577 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(5):e18253. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0018253.

However, allogeneic stem cell transplantation was offered to standard risk patients with a sibling donor and to all high-risk patients in contrast to the pediatric protocol. Feasibility was defined by achieving complete remission (CR) and completion of treatment within a strict timeframe in at least 60% of patients.

However, in some dasatinib-treated leukemia patients, clonal lymphocytosis with large granular lymphocyte (LGL) morphology develops, and this is associated with enhanced therapeutic responses. To elucidate the mechanistic basis for this paradoxical observation, we conducted detailed phenotypic and functional analyses of T-cell and NK-cell populations from 25 dasatinib-treated leukemia patients. All tested patients with LGL expansions (15/16) were cytomegalovirus (CMV) immunoglobulin (IgG) seropositive with high frequencies of CMV-specific CD8(+) T-cells; 5/16 LGL patients also experienced symptomatic CMV reactivation during dasatinib therapy. Expanded T-cell and NK-cell populations exhibited late differentiated (CD27(-)CD57(+)) phenotypes; this was associated with a predisposition to apoptosis within the T-cell compartment and impaired NK-cell cytotoxicity. Only 3/9 non-LGL patients were CMV IgG seropositive. Dasatinib inhibited in vitro lymphocyte functions, similarly in LGL patients and controls. Notably, distinct CD8(high) and CD8(low) T-cell subsets were observed in LGL patients; this phenotypic dichotomy was also apparent in CMV-specific CD8(+) T-cell populations, and exhibited features consistent with antigen-driven activation. In addition, plasma levels of IP-10, IL-6, monokine induced by interferon-gamma and interleukin-2R were significantly increased in LGL patients. These data provide evidence that dasatinib-associated LGL expansion is linked to CMV reactivation and suggest a potential mechanism for this phenomenon.","['Kreutzman, A', 'Ladell, K', 'Koechel, C', 'Gostick, E', 'Ekblom, M', 'Stenke, L', 'Melo, T', 'Einsele, H', 'Porkka, K', 'Price, D A', 'Mustjoki, S', 'Seggewiss, R']","['Kreutzman A', 'Ladell K', 'Koechel C', 'Gostick E', 'Ekblom M', 'Stenke L', 'Melo T', 'Einsele H', 'Porkka K', 'Price DA', 'Mustjoki S', 'Seggewiss R']","['Hematology Research Unit, Biomedicum Helsinki, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH) and University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*cytology', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Division', 'Cytomegalovirus/*physiology', 'DNA Primers', 'Dasatinib', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thiazoles/*adverse effects', '*Virus Activation']",2011/06/08 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/08 06:00'],"['2011/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['leu2011135 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.135 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Oct;25(10):1587-97. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.135.

Somatic IDH1/IDH2 mutations were rare in ALL (N=1), but were more common in AML, occurring in 3.5% (IDH1 N=3 and IDH2 N=5), with the frequency higher in AMLs with a normal karyotype (9.8%). The identified IDH1 mutations occurred in codon 132 resulting in replacement of arginine with either cysteine (N=3) or histidine (N=1). By contrast, mutations in IDH2 did not affect the homologous residue but instead altered codon 140, resulting in replacement of arginine with either glutamine (N=4) or tryptophan (N=1). Structural modeling of IDH2 suggested that codon 140 mutations disrupt the enzyme's ability to bind its substrate isocitrate. Accordingly, recombinant IDH2 R140Q/W were unable to carry out the decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG), but instead gained the neomorphic activity to reduce alpha-KG to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarete (2-HG). Analysis of primary leukemic blasts confirmed high levels of 2-HG in AMLs with IDH1/IDH2 mutations. Interestingly, 3/5 AMLs with IDH2 mutations had FLT3-activating mutations, raising the possibility that these mutations cooperate in leukemogenesis.","['Andersson, A K', 'Miller, D W', 'Lynch, J A', 'Lemoff, A S', 'Cai, Z', 'Pounds, S B', 'Radtke, I', 'Yan, B', 'Schuetz, J D', 'Rubnitz, J E', 'Ribeiro, R C', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Zhang, J', 'Mullighan, C G', 'Shurtleff, S A', 'Schulman, B A', 'Downing, J R']","['Andersson AK', 'Miller DW', 'Lynch JA', 'Lemoff AS', 'Cai Z', 'Pounds SB', 'Radtke I', 'Yan B', 'Schuetz JD', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Raimondi SC', 'Zhang J', 'Mullighan CG', 'Shurtleff SA', 'Schulman BA', 'Downing JR']","[""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

TAL1 binds histone deacetylase 1 and incubation with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) promotes apoptosis of leukemia cells obtained from TAL1 transgenic mice. Here, we show for the first time that TAL1 protein expression is strikingly downregulated upon histone deacetylase inhibition in T-ALL cells. This is due to decreased TAL1 gene transcription in cells with native TAL1 promoter, and due to impaired TAL1 mRNA translation in cells that harbor the TAL1(d) microdeletion and consequently express TAL1 under the control of the SCL/TAL1 interrupting locus (SIL) promoter. Notably, HDACi-triggered apoptosis of T-ALL cells is significantly reversed by TAL1 forced overexpression. Our results indicate that the HDACi-mediated apoptotic program in T-ALL cells is partially dependent on their capacity to downregulate TAL1 and provide support for the therapeutic use of HDACi in T-ALL.","['Cardoso, B A', 'de Almeida, S F', 'Laranjeira, A B A', 'Carmo-Fonseca, M', 'Yunes, J A', 'Coffer, P J', 'Barata, J T']","['Cardoso BA', 'de Almeida SF', 'Laranjeira AB', 'Carmo-Fonseca M', 'Yunes JA', 'Coffer PJ', 'Barata JT']","['Cancer Biology Unit, Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', '*Down-Regulation', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Up-Regulation']",2011/06/08 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/08 06:00'],"['2011/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['leu2011140 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.140 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Oct;25(10):1578-86. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.140.

We investigated D-loop polymorphisms and mtDNA content in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The D-loop was sequenced in 251 children: precursor B ALL (n=114), with 76 paired remission/relapse samples; T-ALL (n=24); cord blood controls (n=113). The mtDNA copy number was analyzed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction for 92 controls and 54 ALL patients at diagnosis and remission. Polymorphisms around H-strand replication origin (nucleotides 150 to 199) and conserved sequence block II (nucleotides 299 to 317) were associated with leukemia biology and treatment response. T-ALL patients were more likely to have longer nt303 poly-C tract. T199C polymorphism was associated with increased risk of ALL in Malays; T152C was more frequent in good responders. There was no difference in mtDNA content between diagnostic ALL samples and controls; however, there was significant decrease in mtDNA content after treatment, especially in samples with OH polymorphisms.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the 5-year survival rate in children diagnosed with leukemia and lymphomas in the University Hospital of Valle, at Cali, Colombia. METHODS: Three hundred and twenty-four patients younger than 15 years of age were included, diagnosed with either leukemia or lymphomas from 1998 to 2006. Active follow-up was conducted by clinical records reviewing and phone contacting. The cumulative survival rate was estimated to be from 1 to 5 years from diagnosis using the actuarial method. The Cox regression model was used to determine some of the factors associated with the prognosis. RESULTS: Of all cases, 61.8% were male patients, 75.3% corresponded to leukemia, and the rest to lymphomas. The global cumulated survival rate at 1 and 5 years were 71% and 50%, respectively. The risk of death from lymphomas was lower compared with leukemia, hazard ratio=0.36 (P<0.01). The highest cumulated survival rate was found in the group 5 to 9 years old (61%), followed by the group 0 to 4 years old (48%) and the group 10 to 14 years old (41%), all results reaching statistical significance (P<0.01), and showing lower survival rates than the data from international literature. CONCLUSIONS: The survival rates for leukemia and lymphomas in Cali are lower compared with the data of developed countries, suggesting that there are deficiencies in early diagnosis and in access to medication and opportune treatment.","['Diaz, Yaisa Valeria', 'Nichols-Vinueza, Diana Ximena', 'Alvarez-Argote, Juliana', 'Gutierrez-Montealegre, Andres', 'Garcia, Luz Estela', 'Bravo, Luis Eduardo']","['Diaz YV', 'Nichols-Vinueza DX', 'Alvarez-Argote J', 'Gutierrez-Montealegre A', 'Garcia LE', 'Bravo LE']","['University of Valle, Cali, Colombia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colombia', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survival Rate']",2011/06/08 06:00,2012/02/02 06:00,['2011/06/08 06:00'],"['2011/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e31820d0eb9 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2011 Oct;33(7):e284-8. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e31820d0eb9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these treatments are associated with neurocognitive compromise, the extent of which is correlated with higher dose and younger age at treatment. The aims of this study were to explore long-term neurocognitive outcomes in adult survivors of childhood ALL, and to identify measures sensitive to neurotoxicity in long-term survivors. We examined 24 adults who received 18 Gy CRT and chemotherapy for treatment of ALL between ages 2 and 15 years (median, 5.5). Time since diagnosis ranged from 6 to 26 years (median, 16.6). Younger age at diagnosis and longer time since diagnosis were associated with lower scores on a computerized battery that requires speed and accuracy across a number of domains (MicroCog), and other standardized neurocognitive tests. When compared with population norms, MicroCog indices were below average in survivors diagnosed with ALL before age 5, but only the reasoning/calculation index was below average in survivors diagnosed with ALL after age 5. In contrast, intelligence quotient (IQ) scores were average. In addition to confirming earlier studies showing that younger children are more vulnerable to treatment-related neurotoxicity, here we show that deficits exist many years post treatment even with a relatively lower dose of CRT, and that these deficits are especially evident on tasks involving rapid processing of information.","['Edelstein, Kim', ""D'agostino, Norma"", 'Bernstein, Lori J', 'Nathan, Paul C', 'Greenberg, Mark L', 'Hodgson, David C', 'Millar, Barbara Ann', 'Laperriere, Normand', 'Spiegler, Brenda J']","['Edelstein K', ""D'agostino N"", 'Bernstein LJ', 'Nathan PC', 'Greenberg ML', 'Hodgson DC', 'Millar BA', 'Laperriere N', 'Spiegler BJ']","['Psychosocial Oncology & Palliative Care, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. kim.edelstein@uhn.on.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/*etiology/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition Disorders/*etiology/mortality', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intelligence', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/*therapy', 'Survival Rate', '*Survivors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2011/06/08 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/06/08 06:00'],"['2011/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e31820d86f2 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2011 Aug;33(6):450-8. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e31820d86f2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although blood leukocyte CMV antigen and CMV staining in colonic mucosa became negative after ganciclovir treatment, hemorrhagic diarrhea did not improve. However, after discontinuance of dasatinib, hemorrhagic colitis drastically improved and did not recur after administration of nilotinib. It is possible that hemorrhagic diarrhea occurred due to dasatinib-related hemorrhagic colitis.

Deregulation of normal B cell maturation can lead to the development of autoimmune syndromes as well as B cell malignancies. Elucidation of the molecular features of normal B cell development is important for the development of new target therapies for autoimmune diseases and B cell malignancies. Employing B cell-specific conditional knockout mice, we have demonstrated here that the transcription factor leukemia/lymphoma-related factor (LRF) forms an obligate dimer in B cells and regulates mature B cell lineage fate and humoral immune responses via distinctive mechanisms. Moreover, LRF inactivation in transformed B cells attenuated their growth rate. These studies identify what we believe to be a new key factor for mature B cell development and provide a rationale for targeting LRF dimers for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and B cell malignancies.","['Sakurai, Nagisa', 'Maeda, Manami', 'Lee, Sung-Uk', 'Ishikawa, Yuichi', 'Li, Min', 'Williams, John C', 'Wang, Lisheng', 'Su, Leila', 'Suzuki, Mai', 'Saito, Toshiki I', 'Chiba, Shigeru', 'Casola, Stefano', 'Yagita, Hideo', 'Teruya-Feldstein, Julie', 'Tsuzuki, Shinobu', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Maeda, Takahiro']","['Sakurai N', 'Maeda M', 'Lee SU', 'Ishikawa Y', 'Li M', 'Williams JC', 'Wang L', 'Su L', 'Suzuki M', 'Saito TI', 'Chiba S', 'Casola S', 'Yagita H', 'Teruya-Feldstein J', 'Tsuzuki S', 'Bhatia R', 'Maeda T']","['Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Duarte, California 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Cdkn2a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zbtb7a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics/immunology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Germinal Center/cytology/*immunology/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Multimerization', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*immunology']",2011/06/08 06:00,2011/10/14 06:00,['2011/06/08 06:00'],"['2010/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['45682 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI45682 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2011 Jul;121(7):2583-98. doi: 10.1172/JCI45682.

Several studies have shown high efficacy of single-agent arsenic trioxide in newly diagnosed APL. However, long-term follow-up results are needed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred ninety-seven patients with newly diagnosed APL were treated with arsenic trioxide 0.15 mg/kg daily intravenous infusion until complete remission (CR). After achieving CR, the patients received one to four more courses of therapy with arsenic trioxide as consolidation and were observed with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction studies from peripheral blood (to detect of minimal residual disease) every 3 months or until relapse or death. RESULTS: The morphologic CR rate was 85.8%. The most common cause of remission failure was early death owing to APL differentiation syndrome (13.2%). The most important prognostic factor for early mortality was a high WBC count at presentation. The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 66.7% +/- 4% (SE). Relapse after 5 years in CR was rare. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate by intention-to-treat analysis was 64.4% +/- 4%. In patients who achieved CR, OS and DFS were identical.

To prevent these events, we designed an international phase II trial (International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group 10 [IELSG-10]) that addressed feasibility and activity of conventional chemoimmunotherapy associated with CNS prophylaxis and contralateral testis irradiation. The trial was conducted by the IELSG and the Italian Lymphoma Foundation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients (age 22 to 79 years) with untreated stage I or II PTL were treated with six to eight courses of rituximab added to cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) every 21 days (R-CHOP21); four doses of intrathecal methotrexate (IT-MTX) and radiotherapy (RT) to the contralateral testis (30 Gy) for all patients and to regional lymph nodes (30 to 36 Gy) for stage II disease. RESULTS: All patients received R-CHOP21, 50 received CNS prophylaxis, and 47 received testicular RT. With a median follow-up of 65 months, 5-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 74% (95% CI, 59% to 84%) and 85% (95% CI, 71% to 92%), respectively. Ten patients relapsed or progressed: two in lymph nodes, five in extranodal organs, and three in the CNS. The 5-year cumulative incidence of CNS relapse was 6% (95% CI, 0% to 12%). No contralateral testis relapses occurred. Ten patients died: lymphoma (n = 6), secondary leukemia (n = 2), heart failure (n = 1), and gastric cancer (n = 1). Grade 3 to 4 toxicities were neutropenia, 28%; infections, 4%; and neurologic, 13%. No deaths occurred as a result of toxicity. CONCLUSION: This international prospective trial shows that combined treatment with R-CHOP21, IT-MTX, and testicular RT was associated with a good outcome in patients with PTL. RT avoided contralateral testis relapses, but CNS prophylaxis deserves further investigation.","['Vitolo, Umberto', 'Chiappella, Annalisa', 'Ferreri, Andres J M', 'Martelli, Maurizio', 'Baldi, Ileana', 'Balzarotti, Monica', 'Bottelli, Chiara', 'Conconi, Annarita', 'Gomez, Henry', 'Lopez-Guillermo, Armando', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Merli, Francesco', 'Novero, Domenico', 'Orsucci, Lorella', 'Pavone, Vincenzo', 'Ricardi, Umberto', 'Storti, Sergio', 'Gospodarowicz, Mary K', 'Cavalli, Franco', 'Sarris, Andreas H', 'Zucca, Emanuele']","['Vitolo U', 'Chiappella A', 'Ferreri AJ', 'Martelli M', 'Baldi I', 'Balzarotti M', 'Bottelli C', 'Conconi A', 'Gomez H', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Martinelli G', 'Merli F', 'Novero D', 'Orsucci L', 'Pavone V', 'Ricardi U', 'Storti S', 'Gospodarowicz MK', 'Cavalli F', 'Sarris AH', 'Zucca E']","['Battista Hospital and University, Turin, Italy. uvitolo@molinette.piemonte.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'CHOP protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*prevention & control/secondary', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Rituximab', 'Survival Analysis', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",2011/06/08 06:00,2011/09/21 06:00,['2011/06/08 06:00'],"['2011/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.31.4187 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.31.4187 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Jul 10;29(20):2766-72. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.31.4187.

There is considerable knowledge about the contributions of IFN-producing Th1 cells that supports the role of cytotoxic cluster of differentiation (CD8) T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, but much less is known about how IL-4-producing Th2 cells contribute to tumor immunity. In this study, we investigated the cellular and molecular mechanisms employed by memory Th2 cells in sustaining tumor immunity by using a mouse model system wherein ovalbumin (OVA) is used as a specific tumor antigen. In this model, we found that OVA-specific memory Th2 cells exerted potent and long-lasting antitumor effects against NK-sensitive OVA-expressing tumor cells, wherein antitumor effects were mediated by NK cells. Specifically, NK cell cytotoxic activity and expression of perforin and granzyme B were dramatically enhanced by the activation of memory Th2 cells. Interleukin 4 (IL-4) produced by memory Th2 cells in vivo was critical for the antitumor effects of the NK cells, which IL-4 directly stimulated to induce their perforin- and granzyme-B-dependent cytotoxic activity. Our findings show that memory Th2 cells can induce potent antitumor immunity through IL-4-induced activation of NK cells, suggesting potential applications in cellular therapy for cancer patients.","['Kitajima, Masayuki', 'Ito, Toshihiro', 'Tumes, Damon J', 'Endo, Yusuke', 'Onodera, Atsushi', 'Hashimoto, Kahoko', 'Motohashi, Shinichiro', 'Yamashita, Masakatsu', 'Nishimura, Takashi', 'Ziegler, Steven F', 'Nakayama, Toshinori']","['Kitajima M', 'Ito T', 'Tumes DJ', 'Endo Y', 'Onodera A', 'Hashimoto K', 'Motohashi S', 'Yamashita M', 'Nishimura T', 'Ziegler SF', 'Nakayama T']","['Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Inohana, Chuo-ku, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Growth Processes/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Immunologic Memory/immunology', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin-4/immunology/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/immunology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Th2 Cells/cytology/*immunology']",2011/06/08 06:00,2011/10/21 06:00,['2011/06/08 06:00'],"['2011/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-1572 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1572 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Jul 15;71(14):4790-8. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1572.

We examined the effect of ON 01910.Na on DNA damage-signaling molecules upstream of Cdc25C (Chk1, Chk2, and H2AX), as well as on Ran GTPase-activating protein 1 conjugated to small ubiquitin-related modifier 1 (RanGAP1.SUMO1), a mitosis coordinator. Prostate cancer, lymphoma, and leukemic cells were incubated with the drug for 4, 16, or 24 hours. Cell lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. Camptothecin and doxorubicin treatment caused activation/phosphorylation of DNA damage-responsive molecules by 4 hours, whereas ON 01910.Na did not do so. ON 01910.Na caused hyperphosphorylation of RanGAP1.SUMO1 within 4 hours that was sustained for more than 24 hours. Mild phosphorylation of Chk2 was observed only after 24-hour exposure, indicating that DNA damage response was not an initial effect of ON 01910.Na. MOLT-3 cells, synchronized by double-thymidine block, when released into a medium containing ON 01910.Na, accumulated mitotic cell number with a peak from 10 to 14 hours and remained near plateau for 20 hours, which corresponded with the time of RanGAP phosphorylation. ON 01910.Na had minimal effects on tubulin polymerization. These findings imply that ON 01910.Na neither induces DNA damage directly nor acts as a tubulin toxin. Its biological activity appears to rely on prolonged phosphorylation/hyperphosphorylation of RanGAP1.SUMO1. M-phase arrest and the consequent induction of apoptosis that follows could possibly be attributed to it. ON 01910.Na may act as an inhibitor of a RanGAP1.SUMO1 phosphatase or a stimulant of a new kinase.

The envelope glycoproteins are recognized by neutralizing Abs and CTL following a protective immune response, and therefore, represent attractive components for a HTLV-1 vaccine.

The recombinant SU protein is highly immunogenic and induces high titer Ab responses, facilitating selection of hybridomas that secrete mAbs targeting SU. Many of these mAbs recognize envelope displayed on the surface of HTLV-1-infected cells and virions and several of the mAbs robustly antagonize envelope-mediated membrane fusion and neutralize pseudovirus infectivity. The most potently neutralizing mAbs recognize the N-terminal receptor-binding domain of SU, though there is considerable variation in neutralizing proficiency of the receptor-binding domain-targeted mAbs. By contrast, Abs targeting the C-terminal domain of SU tend to lack robust neutralizing activity. Importantly, we find that both neutralizing and poorly neutralizing Abs strongly stimulate neutrophil-mediated cytotoxic responses to HTLV-1-infected cells. Our data demonstrate that recombinant forms of SU possess immunological features that are of significant utility to subunit vaccine design.","['Kuo, Chien-Wen S', 'Mirsaliotis, Antonis', 'Brighty, David W']","['Kuo CW', 'Mirsaliotis A', 'Brighty DW']","['Biomedical Research Institute, College of Medicine Dentistry and Nursing, Ninewells Hospital, The University of Dundee, Dundee DD1 9SY, Scotland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Deltaretrovirus Antibodies)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Vaccines, Subunit)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis/toxicity', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/biosynthesis/*toxicity', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/immunology', 'Deltaretrovirus Antibodies/biosynthesis/*toxicity', 'Gene Products, env/administration & dosage/genetics/*immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology/prevention & control/virology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/administration & dosage/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/*virology', 'Vaccines, Subunit/genetics/immunology/therapeutic use', '*Virus Internalization']",2011/06/08 06:00,2011/08/31 06:00,['2011/06/08 06:00'],"['2011/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1100070 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1100070 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2011 Jul 1;187(1):361-71. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1100070.

We reported that the DP2 supertype was associated with susceptibility, whereas DP1 was associated with protection. However, the association of genetic variants in children with early-onset diseases such as ALL may be a proxy for parental effects. Here we examine whether maternal DP1 and DP2 are associated with BCP ALL by fitting log-linear models in a combined series of family triads (both parents and case child) and dyads (1 parent and case child; n = 571) in comparison with similar models in non-BCP leukemia (n = 198). We report no evidence of maternal DP1 or DP2 associations with BCP ALL, but we did identify suggestive evidence of maternal undertransmission of the infrequent supertypes DP11 and DP15.

The disease is often difficult to diagnose and treat due to co-morbidities and performance status, and patients tend to discontinue chemotherapy prematurely. There are no systemic studies of the reasons and factors that create a higher withdrawal rate in older acute leukemia patients. This study tried to understand the initial characteristics, blood counts and bone marrow measurements in older acute leukemia patients by comparing them with a younger group to provide information and assistance in early clinical diagnosis, treatment and reasons for treatment withdrawal. METHODS: Using retrospective medical record reviews, we examined clinical characteristics and chemotherapy completion status in the patients of two groups (age >/= 60, n = 183 and age <60, n = 183) who were diagnosed with acute leukemia for the first time and were hospitalized in Union Hospital Affiliated with Fujian Medical University from 2004 to 2008. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences in initial presenting symptoms of fatigue (67.2% vs. 57.9%, P>0.05) and pallor (53% vs. 59.6%, P>0.05) between the two groups, but older patients demonstrated more underlying diseases including lung infections (25.7%, P = <0.001), cardiovascular disease (4.4%, P = 0.007), and hypertension (20.8%, P =< 0.001). The complete remission rate after chemotherapy (1 to 2 courses) was 49.5% in the older group and 66.7% in the younger group (chi2 = 6.202, P = 0.013). The percentage of patients age 60 and older who prematurely discontinued chemotherapy (50.3%), mainly due to the influences of traditional Chinese concept of critical illness, financial difficulties, and intolerance to adverse reactions to chemotherapy, was significantly higher than that of younger patients (37.7%) (chi2 = 5.866, P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive approach to diagnosis, treatment selection, and toxicity management, and implementing strategies to enhance treatment compliance may improve outcomes in older adults with acute leukemia.","['Hu, Rong', 'Wu, Yong', 'Jiang, Xiaoying', 'Zhang, Wenteng', 'Xu, Le']","['Hu R', 'Wu Y', 'Jiang X', 'Zhang W', 'Xu L']","['Nursing School of Fujian Medical University, 1 Xueyuan Road, Shangjie Town, Minhou County, Fuzhou, Fujian 350108, PR, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Medication Adherence/statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2011/06/08 06:00,2011/09/17 06:00,['2011/06/08 06:00'],"['2010/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-11-224 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-11-224 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2011 Jun 7;11:224. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-11-224.,20110607,PMC3130702,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we have analysed the effect two novel aspirin analogues, 2-hydroxy benzoate zinc (2HBZ) and 4-hydroxy benzoate zinc (4HBZ), on primary CLL samples. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytotoxic effects of 2HBZ and 4HBZ were analysed in primary CLL cells derived from 52 patients, and normal B- and T-lymphocytes. Mechanisms of action of these agents were also elucidated. RESULTS: Both analogues induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Apoptosis was associated with activation of caspase-3 that could be partially abrogated by the caspase-9 inhibitor (Z-LEHD.fmk). Importantly, both agents demonstrated preferential cytotoxicity in CLL cells when compared to normal B- and T-lymphocytes. In terms of their molecular mechanisms of action, 4HBZ and 2HBZ inhibited COX-2 transcription and protein expression and this was associated with upstream inhibition of transcription factor Rel A. Co-culture of CLL cells with CD40 ligand-expressing mouse fibroblasts significantly increased COX-2 expression and inhibited spontaneous apoptosis. Importantly, the most potent analogue, 4HBZ, overcame pro-survival effects of the co-culture system and significantly repressed COX-2. Finally, elevated COX-2 expression was associated with poor prognostic subsets and increased sensitivity to 4HBZ. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate therapeutic potential of 4HBZ and are consistent with a mechanism involving suppression of Rel A nuclear translocation and inhibition of COX-2 transcription.","['Pepper, C', 'Mahdi, J G', 'Buggins, A G S', 'Hewamana, S', 'Walsby, E', 'Mahdi, E', ""Al-Haza'a, A"", 'Mahdi, A J', 'Lin, T T', 'Pearce, L', 'Morgan, L', 'Bowen, I D', 'Brennan, P', 'Fegan, C']","['Pepper C', 'Mahdi JG', 'Buggins AG', 'Hewamana S', 'Walsby E', 'Mahdi E', ""Al-Haza'a A"", 'Mahdi AJ', 'Lin TT', 'Pearce L', 'Morgan L', 'Bowen ID', 'Brennan P', 'Fegan C']","['Department of Haematology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath Park, UK. peppercj@cf.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Parabens)', '0 (RELA protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-leucyl-glutamyl-histidyl-aspartic acid fluoromethyl ketone)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'JG8Z55Y12H (4-hydroxybenzoic acid)', 'O414PZ4LPZ (Salicylic Acid)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Aspirin/*analogs & derivatives', 'CD40 Antigens/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/genetics', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Parabens/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Salicylic Acid/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Transcription Factor RelA/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/metabolism']",2011/06/08 06:00,2011/09/06 06:00,['2011/06/08 06:00'],"['2011/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2184.2011.00760.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2011 Aug;44(4):380-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.2011.00760.x.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Decreased levels of HDL-C were observed in plasma of leukaemic patients, levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C, triglycerides and phospholipids were unchanged or only slightly increased. As compared to normal lymphocytes, freshly isolated leukaemic cells showed increased levels of cholesterol esters and reduction in free cholesterol. Growth stimulation of ALL and CLL cells with phytohemagglutinin led to further increase in levels of cholesterol esters. Conversely, treatment with an inhibitor of cell proliferation such as the mTOR inhibitor, RAD, caused decline in population growth rate of leukaemia cells, which was preceded by sharp reduction in rate of cholesterol esterification. On the other hand, exposure of leukaemic cells to two inhibitors of cholesterol esterification, progesterone and SaH 58-035, caused 60% reduction in their proliferation rate. In addition to demonstrating tight correlation between cell number expansion and cholesterol esterification in leukaemic cells, these results suggest that pathways that control cholesterol esterification might represent a promising targets for novel anticancer strategies.","['Mulas, M F', 'Abete, C', 'Pulisci, D', 'Pani, A', 'Massidda, B', 'Dessi, S', 'Mandas, A']","['Mulas MF', 'Abete C', 'Pulisci D', 'Pani A', 'Massidda B', 'Dessi S', 'Mandas A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Cagliari, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cholesterol Esters)', '0 (Cholesterol, HDL)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Organosilicon Compounds)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '78934-83-5 (SAN 58035)', '9HW64Q8G6G (Everolimus)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amides/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cholesterol Esters/blood/*metabolism', 'Cholesterol, HDL/blood', 'Everolimus', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lipid Metabolism/drug effects', 'Lipids/blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Organosilicon Compounds/pharmacology', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/metabolism/*pathology', 'Progesterone/pharmacology', 'Sirolimus/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2011/06/08 06:00,2011/09/06 06:00,['2011/06/08 06:00'],"['2011/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2184.2011.00758.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2011 Aug;44(4):360-71. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.2011.00758.x.

To carry out this selective killing, NK cells have an ample repertoire of receptors on their surface. Signalling by inhibitory and activating receptors by interaction with their ligands will determine whether the NK cell becomes activated and kills the target cell. Here, we show reduced expression of NKp46, NKp30, DNAM-1, CD244 and CD94/NKG2C activating receptors on NK cells from acute myeloid leukaemia patients. This reduction may be induced by chronic exposure to their ligands on leukaemic blasts. The analysis of ligands for NK cell-activating receptors showed that leukaemic blasts from the majority of patients express ligands for NK cell-activating receptors. DNAM-1 ligands are frequently expressed on blasts, whereas the expression of the NKG2D ligand MICA/B is found in half of the patients and CD48, a ligand for CD244, in only one-fourth of the patients. The decreased expression of NK cell-activating receptors and/or the heterogeneous expression of ligands for major receptors on leukaemic blasts can lead to an inadequate tumour immunosurveillance by NK cells. A better knowledge of the activating receptor repertoire on NK cells and their putative ligands on blasts together with the possibility to modulate their expression will open new possibilities for the use of NK cells in immunotherapy against leukaemia.","['Sanchez-Correa, Beatriz', 'Morgado, Sara', 'Gayoso, Inmaculada', 'Bergua, Juan M', 'Casado, Javier G', 'Arcos, Maria Jose', 'Bengochea, Maria Luisa', 'Duran, Esther', 'Solana, Rafael', 'Tarazona, Raquel']","['Sanchez-Correa B', 'Morgado S', 'Gayoso I', 'Bergua JM', 'Casado JG', 'Arcos MJ', 'Bengochea ML', 'Duran E', 'Solana R', 'Tarazona R']","['Immunology Unit, Department of Physiology, Faculty of Veterinary, University of Extremadura, Avenida de la Universidad s/n, 10003 Caceres, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunomodulation', '*Immunotherapy', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Ligands', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', '*Tumor Escape']",2011/06/07 06:00,2011/10/05 06:00,['2011/06/07 06:00'],"['2011/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-011-1050-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2011 Aug;60(8):1195-205. doi: 10.1007/s00262-011-1050-2.

MTHFR has a common functional polymorphism C677T. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of MTHFR polymorphisms in Egyptian children with ALL and the relation to MTX-related toxicity, relapse, and MTX pharmacokinetic parameters. Forty patients with ALL were included in the study. They were treated according to ALL-NCI total XIII protocol. MTX-related toxicity and MTX pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed during therapy. MTHFR genotyping was done with a PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism assay, and MTX pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed by HPLC. The MTHFR C677T polymeric allele frequencies were 55, 35, and 10% for CC, CT, and TT genotypes, respectively, among the studied patients with ALL. MTX therapy was significantly associated with toxicity signs in TT genotype: elevated transaminases (P < 0.0001), elevated serum alpha 1-microglobulin protein (P < 0.0001), anemia (P < 0.0001), neutropenia (P < 0.0001), thrombocytopenia (P < 0.0001), and elevated CSF-beta-glucuronidase activity (P < 0.0001). Patients with TT genotype showed significant increase in MTX t((1/2)) and AUC (P < 0.0001), while MTX elimination rate and total body clearance were significantly decreased (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.05, respectively) compared with CC genotype. The TT genotype was significantly associated with relapse in 2 years in 50% compared with 28.57% in CT and 13.64% in CC alleles. The overall 2-year survival was significantly lower in TT genotype (50%) compared with CC genotype (90.91%; P = 0.01). MTHFR TT genotype is significantly associated with increased toxicity during methotrexate therapy as well as increased relapse rate in pediatric patients with ALL. In future, MTX dose adjustment in ALL treatment protocols should be considered based on patient's genotype.","['El-Khodary, Noha M', 'El-Haggar, Sahar M', 'Eid, Manal A', 'Ebeid, Emad N']","['El-Khodary NM', 'El-Haggar SM', 'Eid MA', 'Ebeid EN']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tanta University, Tanta 31527, Egypt. n.ohan.mk@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (MTHFR protein, human)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics']",2011/06/07 06:00,2013/06/15 06:00,['2011/06/07 06:00'],"['2011/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-011-9997-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2012 Sep;29(3):2053-62. doi: 10.1007/s12032-011-9997-6.

A notable characteristic of this virus is that it induces tumors of multiple hematopoietic lineages, including myeloid, erythroid, T-lymphoid and B-lymphoid. In a previous study, a sequence with high homology to SRS19-6MuLV in a murine dendritic cell sarcoma (DCS) was identified through cDNA expression screening with mAb 983D4. To investigate the relationship between SRS19-6MuLV and DCS, the existence of a specific SRS19-6MuLV DNA fragment in DCS cells, 15 murine tumor cells, 2 murine tumor tissues, 12 normal murine cells/tissues, 11 human tumor cell lines and SRSV/3T3 (NIH/3T3 cells infected with SRS cell supernatant) was detected by PCR. The specific fragment of SRS19-6MuLV was detected in DCS, mouse fore-gastric cancer cells, L tumor tissue from which DCS is derived and SRSV/3T3. In addition, the integration sites of SRS19-6MuLV in the positive cells were examined by inverse PCR. Thus, 7 integration sites for SRS19-6MuLV were detected in DCS and 3 in SRSV/3T3. Analysis of sequences by BLAST revealed that some of the integration sites were associated with common fragile sites and some Ras-regulating miRNAs. Our results indicate that SRS19-6MuLV not only induced four types of leukemia, but also induced DCS. This virus does not infect human cells. Multiple integration of SRS19-6MuLV into chromosomes around fragile sites accounts for its carcinogenic effects.","['Liu, Yanyan', 'Bian, Xiaocui', 'Gu, Bei', 'Feng, Hailiang', 'Yang, Zhenli', 'Zhang, Min', 'Zhao, Wenjing', 'Liu, Yuqin']","['Liu Y', 'Bian X', 'Gu B', 'Feng H', 'Yang Z', 'Zhang M', 'Zhao W', 'Liu Y']","['Department of Pathology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100005, P.R.

The MUC1-C oncoprotein is expressed in CML blasts but not chronic phase cells. The present studies demonstrate that treatment of KU812 and K562 CML cells with a cell-penetrating MUC1-C inhibitor, designated GO-203, is associated with increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and depletion of glutathione. GO-203 treatment resulted in the complete downregulation of Bcr-Abl expression and induced cell cycle arrest by a ROS-mediated mechanism that was blocked by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Progression of CML to blast crisis has been linked to dysregulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and an arrest of differentiation. The present results show that inhibition of MUC1-C induces ROS-mediated suppression of beta-catenin expression and induction of a differentiated myeloid phenotype. Our studies also show that GO-203 treatment is associated with ROS-induced decreases in ATP and loss of survival by late apoptosis/necrosis. These findings demonstrate that inhibition of the MUC1-C oncoprotein in CML cells disrupts redox balance and thereby 1) downregulates expression of both Bcr-Abl and beta-catenin and 2) induces terminal myeloid differentiation by ROS-mediated mechanisms.","['Yin, Li', 'Kufe, Donald']","['Yin L', 'Kufe D']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Cancer,Genes & cancer,101516546,,,,2011/06/07 06:00,2011/06/07 06:01,['2011/06/07 06:00'],"['2010/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/1947601911405044 [doi]', '10.1177_1947601911405044 [pii]']",ppublish,Genes Cancer. 2011 Jan;2(1):56-64. doi: 10.1177/1947601911405044.,,PMC3107545,"['R01 CA042802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA042802-23/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA042802-24/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS278259'],,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcr-Abl', 'CML', 'MUC1', 'ROS', 'beta-catenin']",,,,,,,,

Though great progress has been made for improvement in clinical treatment during the past decades, only minority with AML achieve long-term survival. Therefore, further understanding mechanisms of leukemogenesis and exploring novel therapeutic strategies are still crucial for improving disease outcome. MicroRNA-100 (miR-100), a small non-coding RNA molecule, has been reported as a frequent event aberrantly expressed in patients with AML; however, the molecular basis for this phenotype and the statuses of its downstream targets have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we found that the expression level of miR-100 in vivo was related to the stage of the maturation block underlying the subtypes of myeloid leukemia. In vitro experiments further demonstrated that miR-100 was required to promote the cell proliferation of promyelocytic blasts and arrest them differentiated to granulocyte/monocyte lineages. Significantly, we identified RBSP3, a phosphatase-like tumor suppressor, as a bona fide target of miR-100 and validated that RBSP3 was involved in cell differentiation and survival in AML. Moreover, we revealed a new pathway that miR-100 regulates G1/S transition and S-phase entry and blocks the terminal differentiation by targeting RBSP3, which partly in turn modulates the cell cycle effectors pRB/E2F1 in AML. These events promoted cell proliferation and blocked granulocyte/monocyte differentiation. Our data highlight an important role of miR-100 in the molecular etiology of AML, and implicate the potential application of miR-100 in cancer therapy.","['Zheng, Y-S', 'Zhang, H', 'Zhang, X-J', 'Feng, D-D', 'Luo, X-Q', 'Zeng, C-W', 'Lin, K-Y', 'Zhou, H', 'Qu, L-H', 'Zhang, P', 'Chen, Y-Q']","['Zheng YS', 'Zhang H', 'Zhang XJ', 'Feng DD', 'Luo XQ', 'Zeng CW', 'Lin KY', 'Zhou H', 'Qu LH', 'Zhang P', 'Chen YQ']","['Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CTDSPL protein, human)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN100 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/analysis/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology']",2011/06/07 06:00,2012/02/22 06:00,['2011/06/07 06:00'],"['2011/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2011208 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2011.208 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2012 Jan 5;31(1):80-92. doi: 10.1038/onc.2011.208.

However, a comprehensive analysis of the contribution of miRNAs to the pathogenesis of any specific cancer is lacking. Here we show that in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a small set of miRNAs is responsible for the cooperative suppression of several tumor suppressor genes. Cross-comparison of miRNA expression profiles in human T-ALL with the results of an unbiased miRNA library screen allowed us to identify five miRNAs (miR-19b, miR-20a, miR-26a, miR-92 and miR-223) that are capable of promoting T-ALL development in a mouse model and which account for the majority of miRNA expression in human T-ALL. Moreover, these miRNAs produce overlapping and cooperative effects on tumor suppressor genes implicated in the pathogenesis of T-ALL, including IKAROS (also known as IKZF1), PTEN, BIM, PHF6, NF1 and FBXW7. Thus, a comprehensive and unbiased analysis of miRNA action in T-ALL reveals a striking pattern of miRNA-tumor suppressor gene interactions in this cancer.","['Mavrakis, Konstantinos J', 'Van Der Meulen, Joni', 'Wolfe, Andrew L', 'Liu, Xiaoping', 'Mets, Evelien', 'Taghon, Tom', 'Khan, Aly A', 'Setty, Manu', 'Rondou, Pieter', 'Vandenberghe, Peter', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Benoit, Yves', 'Socci, Nicholas B', 'Leslie, Christina S', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter', 'Speleman, Frank', 'Wendel, Hans-Guido']","['Mavrakis KJ', 'Van Der Meulen J', 'Wolfe AL', 'Liu X', 'Mets E', 'Taghon T', 'Khan AA', 'Setty M', 'Rondou P', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Delabesse E', 'Benoit Y', 'Socci NB', 'Leslie CS', 'Van Vlierberghe P', 'Speleman F', 'Wendel HG']","['Cancer Biology & Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Infant', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",2011/06/07 06:00,2011/09/16 06:00,['2011/06/07 06:00'],"['2010/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ng.858 [pii]', '10.1038/ng.858 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Genet. 2011 Jun 5;43(7):673-8. doi: 10.1038/ng.858.,20110605,PMC4121855,"['P41 RR000862/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA142798/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA183876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA142798-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS608190'],,,,,,"['Nat Genet. 2011 Aug;43(8):815.

Two major molecular subtypes can be distinguished, characterized respectively by a high or low number of somatic hypermutations in the variable region of immunoglobulin genes. The molecular changes leading to the pathogenesis of the disease are still poorly understood. Here we performed whole-genome sequencing of four cases of CLL and identified 46 somatic mutations that potentially affect gene function. Further analysis of these mutations in 363 patients with CLL identified four genes that are recurrently mutated: notch 1 (NOTCH1), exportin 1 (XPO1), myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MYD88) and kelch-like 6 (KLHL6). Mutations in MYD88 and KLHL6 are predominant in cases of CLL with mutated immunoglobulin genes, whereas NOTCH1 and XPO1 mutations are mainly detected in patients with unmutated immunoglobulins. The patterns of somatic mutation, supported by functional and clinical analyses, strongly indicate that the recurrent NOTCH1, MYD88 and XPO1 mutations are oncogenic changes that contribute to the clinical evolution of the disease. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of CLL combining whole-genome sequencing with clinical characteristics and clinical outcomes. It highlights the usefulness of this approach for the identification of clinically relevant mutations in cancer.","['Puente, Xose S', 'Pinyol, Magda', 'Quesada, Victor', 'Conde, Laura', 'Ordonez, Gonzalo R', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Escaramis, Georgia', 'Jares, Pedro', 'Bea, Silvia', 'Gonzalez-Diaz, Marcos', 'Bassaganyas, Laia', 'Baumann, Tycho', 'Juan, Manel', 'Lopez-Guerra, Monica', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Tubio, Jose M C', 'Lopez, Cristina', 'Navarro, Alba', 'Tornador, Cristian', 'Aymerich, Marta', 'Rozman, Maria', 'Hernandez, Jesus M', 'Puente, Diana A', 'Freije, Jose M P', 'Velasco, Gloria', 'Gutierrez-Fernandez, Ana', 'Costa, Dolors', 'Carrio, Anna', 'Guijarro, Sara', 'Enjuanes, Anna', 'Hernandez, Lluis', 'Yague, Jordi', 'Nicolas, Pilar', 'Romeo-Casabona, Carlos M', 'Himmelbauer, Heinz', 'Castillo, Ester', 'Dohm, Juliane C', 'de Sanjose, Silvia', 'Piris, Miguel A', 'de Alava, Enrique', 'San Miguel, Jesus', 'Royo, Romina', 'Gelpi, Josep L', 'Torrents, David', 'Orozco, Modesto', 'Pisano, David G', 'Valencia, Alfonso', 'Guigo, Roderic', 'Bayes, Monica', 'Heath, Simon', 'Gut, Marta', 'Klatt, Peter', 'Marshall, John', 'Raine, Keiran', 'Stebbings, Lucy A', 'Futreal, P Andrew', 'Stratton, Michael R', 'Campbell, Peter J', 'Gut, Ivo', 'Lopez-Guillermo, Armando', 'Estivill, Xavier', 'Montserrat, Emili', 'Lopez-Otin, Carlos', 'Campo, Elias']","['Puente XS', 'Pinyol M', 'Quesada V', 'Conde L', 'Ordonez GR', 'Villamor N', 'Escaramis G', 'Jares P', 'Bea S', 'Gonzalez-Diaz M', 'Bassaganyas L', 'Baumann T', 'Juan M', 'Lopez-Guerra M', 'Colomer D', 'Tubio JM', 'Lopez C', 'Navarro A', 'Tornador C', 'Aymerich M', 'Rozman M', 'Hernandez JM', 'Puente DA', 'Freije JM', 'Velasco G', 'Gutierrez-Fernandez A', 'Costa D', 'Carrio A', 'Guijarro S', 'Enjuanes A', 'Hernandez L', 'Yague J', 'Nicolas P', 'Romeo-Casabona CM', 'Himmelbauer H', 'Castillo E', 'Dohm JC', 'de Sanjose S', 'Piris MA', 'de Alava E', 'San Miguel J', 'Royo R', 'Gelpi JL', 'Torrents D', 'Orozco M', 'Pisano DG', 'Valencia A', 'Guigo R', 'Bayes M', 'Heath S', 'Gut M', 'Klatt P', 'Marshall J', 'Raine K', 'Stebbings LA', 'Futreal PA', 'Stratton MR', 'Campbell PJ', 'Gut I', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Estivill X', 'Montserrat E', 'Lopez-Otin C', 'Campo E']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia, Universidad de Oviedo, 33006 Oviedo, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (KLHL6 protein, human)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (MYD88 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Genome, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyopherins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/chemistry/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2011/06/07 06:00,2011/08/20 06:00,['2011/06/07 06:00'],"['2010/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/20 06:00 [medline]']","['nature10113 [pii]', '10.1038/nature10113 [doi]']",epublish,Nature. 2011 Jun 5;475(7354):101-5. doi: 10.1038/nature10113.,20110605,PMC3322590,"['088340/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '093867/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",['UKMS47511'],"['Nat Rev Clin Oncol. 2011 Aug;8(8):447.

The homologous oligomerization of BCR-ABL protein mediated by BCR coiled-coil (CC) domain plays an important role in ABL kinase activation. The HIV-1 TAT peptide has been used extensively for the introduction of proteins into cells. We recombinated a TAT-CC-HA protein to interrupt the homologous oligomerization of BCR-ABL. The expression conditions for TAT-CC-HA were optimized. The TAT-CC-HA fusion protein was purified with Ni+-NTA resin. TAT-CC-HA fusion protein was added into the cultures of Ba/F3-p210, 32D-p210, K562, KU812, Ba/F3, 32D, and HL-60 cells. It was found that TAT-CC-HA could transduce into these cells. It was confirmed that TAT-CC-HA fusion protein was internalized by Ba/F3-p210, K562, and Ba/F3 cells and located in the cytoplasm observed by confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope. The transduction of TAT-CC-HA fusion protein into K562 cells was in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. The result of coimmunoprecipitation assay indicated that TAT-CC-HA could interact with BCR-ABL in K562 cells. The effects of TAT-CC-HA fusion protein on cell growth and apoptosis were detected by MTT test and flow cytometry. Our findings suggested that TAT-CC-HA fusion protein could specifically inhibit the growth of BCR-ABL positive cells, and specifically induce apoptosis of BCR-ABL positive cells, while not affect the growth and apoptosis of BCR-ABL negative cells.","['Huang, Zhenglan', 'Ji, Maosheng', 'Peng, Zhi', 'Huang, Shifeng', 'Xiao, Qing', 'Li, Chunli', 'Zeng, Jianming', 'Gao, Miao', 'Feng, Wenli']","['Huang Z', 'Ji M', 'Peng Z', 'Huang S', 'Xiao Q', 'Li C', 'Zeng J', 'Gao M', 'Feng W']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cytoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/genetics/*isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic/methods', 'tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/chemistry/genetics/*isolation & purification/*metabolism']",2011/06/07 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/07 06:00'],"['2010/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0753-3322(11)00031-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.biopha.2011.02.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 2011 Jun;65(3):183-92. doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2011.02.013.

A small subset of SM patients with KIT(D816V) mutation require cytoreductive therapy. In these patients, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been actively investigated over the last decade because of codon 816 KIT mutations causing constitutive activation of tyrosine kinase activity of the molecule. The main question has been whether the success story with imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), another disease associated with a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, could be mimicked in mastocytosis. However, the results from various TKIs in SM with KIT(D816V) mutation have been disappointing to date. Only a few of the TKIs sufficiently block KIT(D816V) activity and have shown promising clinical results. The data from these studies indicate that, apart from KIT(D816V), other kinase targets and target pathways may play a role in disease evolution and progression, especially in patients with SM with an associated clonal hematological non-mast cell lineage disease (SM-AHNMD). Imatinib is effective in patients with increased mast cells and eosinophils associated with FIP1L1/PDGFRA+ (e.g., myeloid neoplasm with eosinophilia and rearrangement of PDGFRA) or rare patients with SM associated with KIT mutations outside of exon 17. This review will focus on the KIT receptor, KIT mutations, and the effects of the mutations in SM. The preclinical and clinical activities of FDA approved TKIs (for CML) as well as novel TKIs in SM will be evaluated.","['Ustun, Celalettin', 'DeRemer, David L', 'Akin, Cem']","['Ustun C', 'DeRemer DL', 'Akin C']","['Division of Hematology Oncology and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. custun@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation/physiology', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use']",2011/06/07 06:00,2011/11/09 06:00,['2011/06/07 06:00'],"['2010/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(11)00223-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2011.05.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2011 Sep;35(9):1143-52. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2011.05.006.

Identification of these materials is important for developing more effective treatments for inflammatory disorders where self attack occurs. We stimulated human monocytes and THP-1 cells with LPS/IFNgamma and measured the toxic effects of their conditioned media against differentiated human NT-2 cells. Their cytotoxicity, as measured by LDH release, was reduced by half when their conditioned media was passed through a 3kDa cutoff filter, indicating an equal division between high and low molecular weight materials. When the high molecular weight components tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and IL-6 were removed from the conditioned medium by specific antibodies, the toxicity was reduced by 37-38%. When prostaglandin production was blocked by treatment with the COX inhibitors acetylsalicylic acid and ibuprofen, toxicity was reduced by 15-16%. When oxygen free radical production was blocked by the NADPH inhibitor diphenylene iodonium (DPI) the toxicity was reduced by 17-18%. Treatment with the nitric oxide scavenger carboxy-phenyl-tetramethylimidazolineoxyl-oxide, or the NOS inhibitor N(G)-monomethylene-l-arginine, attenuated the toxicity by about 20%. Removal of released glutamate by glutamate decarboxylase also attenuated the toxicity by 12-13%. In combination, these treatments reduced the toxicity by approximately 50% accounting for the low molecular weight component toxicity. About 10% of the overall toxicity, which was associated with the high molecular weight component, was not identified. Optimal antiinflammatory therapy may require combined suppression of these identified toxin-generating pathways as well as relatively minor pathways yet to be identified.","['Lee, Moonhee', 'Suk, Kyoungho', 'Kang, Yunhee', 'McGeer, Edith', 'McGeer, Patrick L']","['Lee M', 'Suk K', 'Kang Y', 'McGeer E', 'McGeer PL']","['Kinsmen Laboratory of Neurological Research, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Brain Res,Brain research,0045503,"['0 (6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo(1,2-a)imidazole)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Cyclic N-Oxides)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Neurotoxins)', '0 (Nitrites)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '18390-00-6 (2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 1)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 4.1.1.15 (Glutamate Decarboxylase)', 'EC 4.1.1.15 (glutamate decarboxylase 2)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic N-Oxides/pharmacology', 'Cyclooxygenase 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glutamate Decarboxylase/metabolism', 'Glutamic Acid/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/toxicity', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/toxicity', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidases/metabolism', 'Neurotoxins/pharmacology', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I/genetics/metabolism', 'Nitrites/metabolism', 'Pyrroles', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Teratocarcinoma/pathology']",2011/06/07 06:00,2011/10/15 06:00,['2011/06/07 06:00'],"['2011/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/10 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-8993(11)00906-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.brainres.2011.05.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Res. 2011 Jul 11;1400:99-111. doi: 10.1016/j.brainres.2011.05.021.

Aldo-keto reductase family 1 B10 (AKR1B10) is an NADPH-dependent enzyme overexpressed in liver and lung carcinomas. This study was aimed to determine the role of AKR1B10 in tumor resistance to anthracyclines. AKR1B10 activity toward anthracyclines was measured using recombinant protein. Cell resistance to anthracycline was determined by ectopic expression of AKR1B10 or inhibition by epalrestat. Results showed that AKR1B10 reduces C13-ketonic group on side chain of daunorubicin and idarubicin to hydroxyl forms. In vitro, AKR1B10 converted daunorubicin to daunorubicinol at V(max) of 837.42+/-81.39nmol/mg/min, K(m) of 9.317+/-2.25mM and k(cat)/K(m) of 3.24. AKR1B10 showed better catalytic efficiency toward idarubicin with V(max) at 460.23+/-28.12nmol/mg/min, K(m) at 0.461+/-0.09mM and k(cat)/K(m) at 35.94. AKR1B10 was less active toward doxorubicin and epirubicin with a C14-hydroxyl group. In living cells, AKR1B10 efficiently catalyzed reduction of daunorubicin (50nM) and idarubicin (30nM) to corresponding alcohols. Within 24h, approximately 20+/-2.7% of daunorubicin (1muM) or 23+/-2.3% of idarubicin (1muM) was converted to daunorubicinol or idarubicinol in AKR1B10 expression cells compared to 7+/-0.9% and 5+/-1.5% in vector control.

The aim of this study was to examine the regulation of LRF expression in human prostate cells. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptors mediate several tumorigenic cascades that regulate cell differentiation, proliferation, migration and survival of prostate cancer cells. There was significantly higher level of LRF expression in the nucleus of LNCaP and PC-3 cells than RWPE-1 cells. A significant increase in LRF expression was observed with increasing doses of EGF in more aggressive and androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells suggesting that EGF signaling pathway is critical in upregulating the expression of LRF/Pokemon to promote oncogenesis.","['Aggarwal, Himanshu', 'Aggarwal, Anshu', 'Agrawal, Devendra K']","['Aggarwal H', 'Aggarwal A', 'Agrawal DK']","['Center for Clinical & Translational Science, Creighton University School of Medicine, Omaha, NE 68178, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Mol Pathol,Experimental and molecular pathology,0370711,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ZBTB7A protein, human)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Models, Biological', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",2011/06/07 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/07 06:00'],"['2011/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4800(11)00064-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexmp.2011.05.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Pathol. 2011 Oct;91(2):496-501. doi: 10.1016/j.yexmp.2011.05.006.

The internal tandem duplication (ITD) of c-KIT has also been identified as a predominant cause of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), although its role in the activation process is still unclear. To investigate the biological mechanisms of c-KIT activation, we generated a c-KIT receptor bearing two different immunological tags, HA and Flag tags. In this study, we demonstrated that the mutant (Mt)-ITD and Asp816 (D816Y) c-KIT receptors spontaneously formed dimers and that these Mt-ITD forms of c-KIT displayed high levels of phosphorylation and increased cellular tyrosine phosphorylation. The amount of wild-type homodimers increased following the addition of the c-KIT ligand, while the level of mutant homodimers was less affected by the addition of the c-KIT ligand. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Mt-ITD and activating point mutations of D816Y induced constitutive activation of c-KIT kinase in the absence of ligand in COS-1 cells. These data suggest a novel mechanism for the regulation of cell growth autonomy. Overall, our study suggests that c-KIT activation might have significant effects on hematopoietic cells and might help to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of systemic mast cell disease, gastrointestinal stromal tumors and AML and potentially lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches.","['Kim, Soo Young', 'Kang, Jamie J', 'Lee, Hyung Hoan', 'Kang, Jenny J', 'Kim, Bokyung', 'Kim, Chan-Gil', 'Park, Tae-Kyu', 'Kang, Hyun']","['Kim SY', 'Kang JJ', 'Lee HH', 'Kang JJ', 'Kim B', 'Kim CG', 'Park TK', 'Kang H']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Konkuk University, Seoul 143-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Aspartic Acid/*genetics', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2011/06/07 06:00,2011/09/10 06:00,['2011/06/07 06:00'],"['2011/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(11)00885-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.05.111 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2011 Jul 1;410(2):224-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.05.111.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty eight patients with prostate cancer received three-dimensional conformal blocking radiation therapy with a linear accelerator. IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, TNF-alpha, MIP-1-alpha, and LIF levels were measured by the related immunoassay kit 1 day before the beginning of RT and during RT at days 15 and 30. RESULTS: The mean IL-2 values were elevated before and during the RT in contrast with those of IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, TNF-alpha, MIP-1-alpha, and LIF, which were within the normal range under the same conditions. Regarding markers IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, TNF-alpha, MIP-1-alpha, and LIF, comparisons among the three groups (before treatment and 15 and 30 days during RT) did not show significant differences. Although values were within the normal range, there was a significant rise in IL-6 levels at day 15 of RT (p = 0.0049) and a decline at day 30 to levels that were similar to those observed before RT. CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 appeared to peak after 15 days of RT before returning to pre-RT levels. In contrast, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, TNF-alpha, MIP-1-alpha, and LIF levels were not sensitive to irradiation. The increased levels of IL-6 following RT without the concurrent elevation of other cytokines involved in the acute phase reaction did not suggest a classical inflammatory response to radiation exposure. Further studies should be designed to elucidate the role of IL-6 levels in patients with prostate cancer treated with RT.","['Lopes, Carlos Oliveira', 'Callera, Fernando']","['Lopes CO', 'Callera F']","['Universidade do Vale do Paraiba, Centro de Oncologia Radioterapica do Vale do Paraiba, Universidade do Vale do Paraiba Instituto de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento, Universidade do Vale do Paraiba, Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Chemokine CCL3/blood', 'Cytokines/*blood', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/blood', 'Interleukin-4/blood', 'Interleukin-5/blood', 'Interleukin-6/blood', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*blood/*radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy, Conformal/*methods', 'Reference Values', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/blood']",2011/06/07 06:00,2012/04/25 06:00,['2011/06/07 06:00'],"['2010/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0360-3016(11)00561-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.04.040 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2012 Mar 15;82(4):1385-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.04.040.

Genotype and phenotype of primary tumours and their metastases may differ. OBJECTIVES: Determine Her2 status in both tumour components to better assess the potential of anti-Her2 therapies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Histologic examination revealed lymph node metastases in 150 patients with urothelial bladder cancer clinically staged as N0M0. A tissue microarray was constructed with four tumour samples per patient: two from the primary tumour and two from nodal metastases. Her2 status was determined at the gene level by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and at the protein level by immunohistochemistry (IHC). INTERVENTIONS: All patients underwent cystectomy and standardised extended lymphadenectomy. MEASUREMENTS: Overall survival was assessed according to HER2 gene status and protein expression in primary bladder cancers and lymph node metastases. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Her2 amplification was significantly more frequent in lymph node metastases (15.3%) than in matched primary bladder cancers (8.7%; p = 0.003). Her2 amplification in primary tumours was highly preserved in the corresponding metastases as indicated by only one amplified primary tumour without amplification of the metastasis. There was a high concordance in HER2 FISH results between both samples from the primary tumour (kappa = 0.853) and from the metastases (kappa = 0.930). IHC results were less concordant (kappa=0.539 and 0.830). FISH and IHC results were poorly correlated in primary tumours (kappa = 0.566) and metastases (kappa = 0.673). While Her2 amplification in the primary tumour significantly predicted poor outcome (p = 0.044), IHC-based survival prediction was unsuccessful. CONCLUSIONS: Her2 amplification in metastasising bladder cancer is relatively frequent, is homogeneous in each tumour component, and predicts early death. This suggests a high potential for anti-Her2 therapies. For patient selection, FISH might be more accurate than IHC.","['Fleischmann, Achim', 'Rotzer, Diana', 'Seiler, Roland', 'Studer, Urs E', 'Thalmann, George N']","['Fleischmann A', 'Rotzer D', 'Seiler R', 'Studer UE', 'Thalmann GN']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland. achim.fleischmann@pathology.unibe.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Eur Urol,European urology,7512719,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/*genetics', 'Cystectomy', 'Female', '*Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lymph Node Excision', 'Lymph Nodes/*chemistry/pathology/surgery', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/analysis/*genetics', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Switzerland', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/chemistry/*genetics/mortality/secondary/surgery', 'Urothelium/*chemistry/pathology/surgery']",2011/06/07 06:00,2011/10/25 06:00,['2011/06/07 06:00'],"['2011/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0302-2838(11)00524-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.eururo.2011.05.035 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur Urol. 2011 Aug;60(2):350-7. doi: 10.1016/j.eururo.2011.05.035.

To better understand how expression of ABCG2 is controlled in pediatric AML, we performed a detailed analysis of the ABCG2 transcript isoforms from a variety of tissue sources, including 85 pediatric AML samples. These studies revealed a complex 5' untranslated region (UTR) with 6 novel exons and multiple splice variants. Samples from children with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AML FAB-M7) not associated with Down syndrome showed uniformly higher levels of ABCG2 transcripts than samples from children with other AML subtypes. A novel 5' UTR identified 90kb upstream of the exon 2 translation initiation site was expressed only in M7 AML subtypes. An associated upstream promoter fragment was shown to be selectively expressed in megakaryoblastic leukemia cells but not in human epithelial cell lines. These findings identify a new tissue-specific ABCG2 promoter that is selectively expressed in pediatric M7 AML.

Increasing evidence has emerged that host miRNAs serve in animal cells to restrict viral infections. In turn, many viruses encode RNA silencing suppressors (RSS) which are employed to moderate the potency of the cell's miRNA selection against viral replication. Some viruses also encode viral miRNAs. In this review, we summarize findings from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) that illustrate examples of host cell miRNAs that target the viruses, of RSS encoded by viruses, and of host cell miRNA profile changes that are seen in infected cells.

The critical difference from previously published methods is the use of enzymatic degradation of proteins in the later DNA purification steps rather than during the homogenisation procedure. Different DNA-purification methodologies were first compared and the protocol of choice was optimized later on; both steps were performed with [(35)S]-labelled amino acids for labelling of cellular protein, which enabled both the quantification of cellular protein contaminating the DNA sample and the distinction between cellular and enzyme-derived protein. The assay was later evaluated and shown to give reproducible results based on the data obtained with benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and doxorubicin in two different laboratories. In addition, two further reference compounds, dopamine and diazepam and one proprietary AstraZeneca compound were also tested in mouse lymphoma cells in one laboratory. The two compounds B[a]P and doxorubicin were identified as suitable positive controls for routine testing in the presence and absence of S9, respectively. Exposing 90-100x10(6) cells to (14)C-labelled compound with a molar radioactivity of 2MBq/mumol, yields approximately 500mug DNA with <3% total protein contamination, of which approximately 7% is of cellular origin (<0.2%).

Thymol has also been reported as anti-cancer agent, but its anti-cancer mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated. Thus, we aimed to investigate anticancer activity of thymol on HL-60 (acute promyelotic leukemia) cells. In our study, thymol demonstrated dose dependent cytotoxic effects on HL-60 cells after 24h of exposure. However, thymol did not show any cytotoxic effect in normal human PBMC. The cytotoxic effect of thymol on HL-60 cells appears to be associated with induction of cell cycle arrest at sub G0/G1 phase, and apoptotic cell death based on genomic DNA fragmentation pattern. Thymol also showed significant increase in production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity, increase in mitochondrial H(2)O(2) production and depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential. On performing Western Blot analysis, thymol showed increase in Bax protein level with a concomitant decrease in Bcl2 protein expression in a dose dependent manner. Our study also showed activation of caspase -9, -8 and -3 and concomitant PARP cleavage, which is the hallmark of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, to rule out the involvement of other mechanisms in apoptosis induction by thymol, we also studied its effect on apoptosis inducing factor (AIF). Thymol induced AIF translocation from mitochondria to cytosol and to nucleus, thus indicating its ability to induce caspase independent apoptosis. We conclude that, thymol-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells involves both caspase dependent and caspase independent pathways.","['Deb, Dipanwita Dutta', 'Parimala, G', 'Saravana Devi, S', 'Chakraborty, Tapan']","['Deb DD', 'Parimala G', 'Saravana Devi S', 'Chakraborty T']","['Environmental Health Division, National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, Nehru Marg, Nagpur, India. dipaduttadeb@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '3J50XA376E (Thymol)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'G1 Phase', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle', 'Thymol/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2011/06/07 06:00,2011/09/10 06:00,['2011/06/07 06:00'],"['2011/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(11)00220-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2011.05.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2011 Aug 15;193(1):97-106. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2011.05.009.

To measure the chaperone activity of both proteins, a special test was developed for their recognition and binding of a denatured protein. Using this test, the chaperone activity could be concurrently estimated in large numbers of cellular or tissue extracts. We also estimated the contents of both chaperones in cells by immunoblotting. The values for contents of Hsp70 and Hdj1 obtained by two independent test systems coincided, and this suggested that the substrate-binding activity could change proportionally to the chaperone content in the protein mixture. Therefore, the test developed by us can be employed for high throughput screening of drugs activating cellular chaperones. The analysis of quantity and activity of two cellular chaperones during the cell response to heat stress or to the drug-like substance U-133 showed that both factors caused the accumulation of chaperones with similar kinetics. We conclude that the efficiency of drug preconditioning could be close to the efficiency of hyperthermia and that the high activity of chaperones could be retained in human cells for no less than 1.5 days.","['Lazarev, V F', 'Onokhin, K V', 'Antimonova, O I', 'Polonik, S G', 'Guzhova, I V', 'Margulis, B A']","['Lazarev VF', 'Onokhin KV', 'Antimonova OI', 'Polonik SG', 'Guzhova IV', 'Margulis BA']","['Institute of Cytology, Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry (Mosc),Biochemistry.

Protein kinase C-beta (PKC-?) has been identified as one of the key signaling hubs downstream of the BCR and constitutes a valuable target in B-NHL. As a potent PKC-? inhibitor, enzastaurin is currently being tested in Phase II/III trials. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the latest results and ongoing clinical trials with enzastaurin in light of basic scientific advances in the understanding of various lymphoid cancers, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and Waldenstr?m's macroglobulinemia (WM). EXPERT OPINION: While its continued clinical development is uncertain, enzastaurin should be regarded as a stepping stone for the development of future therapies; indeed, the recent research has provided valuable insight into the possible molecular mechanisms that explain its limited clinical activity especially in the treatment of DLBCL and MCL. It should be noted that there is still some interest in enzastaurin, in combination, for the treatment of WM.","['Ysebaert, Loic', 'Morschhauser, Franck']","['Ysebaert L', 'Morschhauser F']","['Department of Haematology, Ho^pital Claude Huriez, CHRU, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)', 'UC96G28EQF (enzastaurin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C beta', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2011/06/07 06:00,2011/12/21 06:00,['2011/06/07 06:00'],"['2011/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2011.590130 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2011 Aug;20(8):1167-74. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2011.590130.

METHODS: Using the multiprobe AML/MDS panel designed to detect upto eight different FISH probes, which was for AML1/ETO transfusion gene, PML-RARalpha transfusion gene, CBFbeta/MYH11 transfusion gene, MLL breakapart, P53 deletion,Del(5q), Del(7q), Del(20q), 40 cases of AML were investigated. The conventional karyotype analysis and the in-formation about the treatment responses were also used for assessing. RESULTS: 22 of the 40 AML cases were found to carry 7 types of cytogenetic abnormalities by multiprobe FISH panel including AML1/ETO transfusion gene, PML-RARa transfusion gene, MLL breakapart, P53 deletion, Del (5q), Del7q and trisomy 8. However conventional karyotype analysis only discovered 11 cases with the corresponding cytogenetic abnormalities, the positive ratio was 57.5% in multiprobe FISH panel higher than that in karyotype analysis (27.50%). Patiens with AML1/ETO or PML-RARa transfusion gene are easily to reach CR in the first induction chemotherapy, while the Del(7q), MLL breakapart, complex cytogenetic abnormalities may indicate poor prognosis.

Absolute CD19+ B-lymphocytes counts and CD45 expression in 35 whole-blood CLL samples were determined by FCM using either different lysis solutions or using a no wash no lyse (NWNL) protocol. Single platform using microbeads was also evaluated for absolute quantification.

Nonetheless, these techniques are limited by high equipment costs, complex, and costly cell processing and the need for highly trained personnel. Here, we demonstrate the potential of exploiting differences in the relative intensities of backscattered light at three wavelengths to detect the presence of leukemic cells in samples containing varying mixtures of white blood cells (WBCs) and leukemic cells flowing through microfluidic channels. Using 405, 488, and 633 nm illumination, we identify distinct light scattering intensity distributions for Nalm-6 leukemic cells, normal mononuclear (PBMC) and polymorphonuclear (PMN) white blood cells and red blood cells. We exploit these differences to develop cell classification algorithms, whose performance is evaluated based on simultaneous acquisition of light scattering and fluorescence flow cytometry data. When this algorithm is used prospectively for the analysis of samples consisting of mixtures of PBMCs and leukemic cells, we achieve an average specificity and sensitivity of leukemic cell detection of 99.6 and 45.2%, respectively. When we consider samples that include leukemic cells along with PMNs and PBMCs, which can be acquired using a simple red blood cell lysis step following venipuncture, the specificity and sensitivity of the approach decreases to 91.6 and 39.5%, respectively. On the basis of the performance of these algorithms, we estimate that 42 or 71 muL of blood would be adequate to confirm the presence of leukemia at an 80% power level in samples containing 0.01% leukemia to either PBMCs or PBMCs and PMNs, respectively. Therefore, light scattering-based flow cytometry in a microfluidic platform could provide a low cost, highly portable, minimally invasive approach for detection and monitoring of leukemic patients. This could offer significant improvements especially for pediatric patients and for patients in developing countries.","['Greiner, Cherry', 'Hunter, Martin', 'Rius, Francisca', 'Huang, Peter', 'Georgakoudi, Irene']","['Greiner C', 'Hunter M', 'Rius F', 'Huang P', 'Georgakoudi I']","['Biomedical Engineering Department, Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts 02155, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

Previous studies have demonstrated a role for spatial genome organization in the formation of tumorigenic abnormalities. The nonrandom localization of chromosomes and, more specifically, of genes appears to play a role in the mechanism of chromosomal translocations. Here, two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy were used to measure the interphase distance between CBFB and MYH11 in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), where inv(16)(p13q22) is believed to occur, leading to leukemia development. The measured distances in HSCs were compared with mesenchymal stem cells, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and fibroblasts, as spatial genome organization is determined to be cell-type specific. Results indicate that CBFB and MYH11 are significantly closer in HSCs compared with all other cell types examined. Furthermore, the CBFB-MYH11 distance is significantly reduced compared with CBFB and a control locus in HSCs, although separation between CBFB and the control is approximately 70% of that between CBFB and MYH11 on metaphase chromosomes. HSCs were also treated with fragile site-inducing chemicals because both the genes contain translocation breakpoints within these regions. However, treatment with fragile site-inducing chemicals did not significantly affect the interphase distance. Consistent with previous studies, our results suggest that gene proximity may play a role in the formation of cancer-causing rearrangements, providing insight into the mechanism of chromosomal abnormalities in human tumors.","['Weckerle, Allison B', 'Santra, Madhumita', 'Ng, Maggie C Y', 'Koty, Patrick P', 'Wang, Yuh-Hwa']","['Weckerle AB', 'Santra M', 'Ng MC', 'Koty PP', 'Wang YH']","['Department of Biochemistry, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Medical Center Boulevard, Winston-Salem, NC 27157-1016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (CBFB protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (MYH11 protein, human)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', '452-06-2 (2-Aminopurine)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosin Heavy Chains)', 'JI8SAD85NO (diminazene aceturate)', 'Y5G36EEA5Z (Diminazene)']",IM,"['2-Aminopurine/pharmacology', 'Aphidicolin/pharmacology', '*Cell Nucleus', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Fragile Sites/drug effects', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/*genetics', 'Diminazene/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Myosin Heavy Chains/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2011/06/04 06:00,2011/10/25 06:00,['2011/06/04 06:00'],"['2011/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20896 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2011 Sep;50(9):746-55. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20896.

We aimed to evaluate the potential of the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay to detect genomic alterations in CLL. Highly purified (>90%) peripheral mononuclear CD19+ cell populations from 100 untreated CLL patients (pts) in early stage disease (Binet stage A) were included in this study. All samples were investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the presence of trisomy 12 and 17p13.1, 11q22.3, and 13q14.3 deletions. For MPLA analysis, DNA was amplified by means of two commercially available probes sets allowing the simultaneous screening of 56 genomic sequences. Overall, a high degree of concordance (95%) between MPLA and FISH results was found, if the abnormal clone was present in more than 30% of the leukemic cell population. The use of multiple MPLA probes allowed the fine-mapping of the 13q14 deletion and the identification of intragenic or small alterations undetected by FISH.

The screening for antibodies against these viruses is regulated and done systematically during every donation of milk. Breast feeding being the main mode of transmission of the HTLV-1, the last ministerial decree of 25 August 2010 has made the screening test compulsory for the anonymous donation and for the personalized donation (of a mother for her own child) from all women including those affected by the infection. The milk delivered by milk banks is pasteurized (62.5 degrees C for 30 minutes) before freezing at -18 degrees C, which inactivates the pathogens. This double means of prevention of the transmission of the HTLV-1 paradoxically seems disproportionate in the absence of any precautionary measure in the case of direct breast-feeding and the use of mother's raw milk. Indeed, in most neonatal intensive care units in maternity hospitals, unpasteurized milk is administered to the neonates without any systematic preliminary testing of the serological HTLV-1 status of the mother. An increased sensitization of the community of the obstetricians, midwives and neonatologists by the Association of the Milk Banks of France (ADLF) and the Societe de pathologie exotique could address the issue of screening for HTLV-1 in ""donated"" milk and breast-feeding.","['Rigourd, V', 'Meyer, V', 'Kieffer, F', 'Aubry, S', 'Magny, J-F']","['Rigourd V', 'Meyer V', 'Kieffer F', 'Aubry S', 'Magny JF']","['Institut de puericulture et de perinatalogie, Paris, France. ipp.rigourd@free.fr']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Bull Soc Pathol Exot,Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique (1990),9212564,,IM,"['Adult', 'Breast Feeding', 'Cryopreservation', 'Disease Transmission, Infectious/prevention & control', 'Female', 'France', 'HTLV-I Infections/*prevention & control/transmission', 'HTLV-II Infections/*prevention & control/transmission', 'Health Policy', 'Hot Temperature', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/prevention & control', 'Mass Screening/*legislation & jurisprudence', '*Milk Banks/legislation & jurisprudence/standards', 'Milk, Human/*virology', 'Mothers', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Tissue Donors', 'Virus Inactivation']",2011/06/04 06:00,2011/11/11 06:00,['2011/06/04 06:00'],"['2010/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13149-011-0160-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Bull Soc Pathol Exot. 2011 Aug;104(3):205-8. doi: 10.1007/s13149-011-0160-6.

CCN3 normally functions as a negative growth regulator, but it is downregulated in CML, the mechanism of which is not known. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, which negatively regulate protein translation by binding to the complimentary sequences of the 3' UTR of messenger RNAs. Deregulated miRNA expression has emerged as a hallmark of cancer. In CML, BCR-ABL upregulates oncogenic miRNAs and downregulates tumour suppressor miRNAs favouring leukaemic transformation. We report here that the downregulation of CCN3 in CML is mediated by BCR-ABL dependent miRNAs. Using the CML cell line K562, we profiled miRNAs, which are BCR-ABL dependent by transfecting K562 cells with anti-BCR-ABL siRNA. MiRNA expression levels were quantified using the Taqman Low Density miRNA array platform. From the miRNA target prediction databases we identified miRNAs that could potentially bind to CCN3 mRNA and reduce expression. Of these, miR-130a, miR-130b, miR-148a, miR-212 and miR-425-5p were significantly reduced on BCR-ABL knockdown, with both miR-130a and miR-130b decreasing the most within 24 h of siRNA treatment. Transfection of mature sequences of miR-130a and miR-130b individually into BCR-ABL negative HL60 cells resulted in a decrease of both CCN3 mRNA and protein. The reduction in CCN3 was greatest with overexpression of miR-130a whereas miR-130b overexpression resulted only in marginal repression of CCN3. This study shows that miRNAs modulate CCN3 expression. Deregulated miRNA expression initiated by BCR-ABL may be one mechanism of downregulating CCN3 whereby leukaemic cells evade negative growth regulation.","['Suresh, Sukanya', 'McCallum, Lynn', 'Lu, Wanhua', 'Lazar, Noureddine', 'Perbal, Bernard', 'Irvine, Alexandra E']","['Suresh S', 'McCallum L', 'Lu W', 'Lazar N', 'Perbal B', 'Irvine AE']","[""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Lisburn Road, Belfast, BT9 7BL, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Cell Commun Signal,Journal of cell communication and signaling,101308338,,,,2011/06/04 06:00,2011/06/04 06:01,['2011/06/04 06:00'],"['2011/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12079-011-0139-x [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Commun Signal. 2011 Aug;5(3):183-91. doi: 10.1007/s12079-011-0139-x.

CD87 expression has been studied on blasts in 110 newly diagnosed AML patients. Immunophenotyping and cytogenetic analysis of these cases were performed. CD87 was positive in 80 (72.7%) cases of patients. The MFI categorized the expression of CD87 into CD87(High) and CD87(Low) expression. Blast cells show that monocytic differentiation has a significantly more CD87(High) expression than CD87(Low) expression. Cytogenetic abnormalities were found in 58.7% of patients with CD87(Low) AML and 41.25% of patients with CD87(High) AML. Cases with CD87(High) expression cells were characterized by a significantly lower survival period especially when co-expressed with CD56, CD34, and/or CD64. There is a negative prognostic influence of the expression of CD87 on the surface of AML blasts, but more tests are necessary to explain the pathophysiological mechanisms behind these findings and to learn about the mechanism that influences the CD87 expression and function.","['Atfy, Maha', 'Eissa, Mohamad', 'Salah, Hossam E', 'El Shabrawy, Deena A']","['Atfy M', 'Eissa M', 'Salah HE', 'El Shabrawy DA']","['Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine Zagazig University, PO Box:44519, Zagazig, Egypt. mahaatfi@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator/*biosynthesis', 'Young Adult']",2011/06/04 06:00,2013/06/15 06:00,['2011/06/04 06:00'],"['2011/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-011-9993-x [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2012 Sep;29(3):2063-9. doi: 10.1007/s12032-011-9993-x.

Demographic information such as age, sex and type of leukemia were also collected. These data were evaluated by SPSS software, Chi-square and independent sample T test. The relation between different scales of questionnaire and variables was measured and final results were compared with reference values. RESULTS: In acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia patients QOL, physical and cognitive functions were lower in comparison with acute myelogenous leukemia and they had more fatigue, pain and insomnia. The patients between ages of 12-18-years-old had more financial difficulties and diarrhea and lower cognitive function in comparison with 6-12-years-old patients. The present patients achieved higher scores than reference value, but they had more economic problem. CONCLUSIONS: The patients had relatively good QOL. The lowest impression was in cognitive function and the highest was in emotional function.

Resistance often arises from second-line mutations in BCR-ABL or overexpression of the BCR-ABL protein but in ~20% of CML cases resistance mechanisms do not involve altered BCR-ABL function. Imatinib-resistant CML cell lines have been widely used for comparative proteome/genome-wide expression screens in order to decipher resistance mechanisms but a clearcut molecular mechanism or molecular player in BCR-ABL-independent resistance to Imatinib has not yet evolved from those studies. Here, we report the identification of a novel mechanism for Imatinib resistance in CML cells with unaltered BCR-ABL function. Pharmacological analysis evidenced a constitutive, Imatinib-insensitive activation of the Erk-MAPK pathway in resistant cells. A systematic analysis of pathway constituents illustrated that Ras-GTP accumulation remained fully sensitive to Imatinib but c-Raf activity from serum-fed cultures was largely resistant to the drug's action. Sequencing excluded mutations in either B-Raf or c-Raf as the origin of resistance, indicating that a functional alteration in the regulation of c-Raf activity was responsible for this effect. Collectively, these findings highlight a novel mechanism of acquired Imatinib resistance based on the BCR-ABL and Ras-independent constitutive activation of the Erk-MAPK pathway through activated c-Raf, which could prove helpful for a better functional classification of the causes of Imatinib resistance in CML.","['Hentschel, Julia', 'Rubio, Ignacio', 'Eberhart, Melanie', 'Hipler, Christina', 'Schiefner, Jana', 'Schubert, Katrin', 'Loncarevic, Ivan F', 'Wittig, Ute', 'Baniahmad, Aria', 'von Eggeling, Ferdinand']","['Hentschel J', 'Rubio I', 'Eberhart M', 'Hipler C', 'Schiefner J', 'Schubert K', 'Loncarevic IF', 'Wittig U', 'Baniahmad A', 'von Eggeling F']","['Institute of Human Genetics, Jena University Hospital, Kollegiengasse 10, D-07743 Jena, Germany. julia.hentschel@mti.uni-jena.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (2-(2-chloro-4-iodophenylamino)-N-cyclopropylmethoxy-3,4-difluorobenzamide)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (raf Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clone Cells', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'raf Kinases/*metabolism', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",2011/06/04 06:00,2012/01/12 06:00,['2011/06/04 06:00'],"['2011/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2011.1062 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2011 Sep;39(3):585-91. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2011.1062.

Forty-nine percent of the probands showed MLL rearrangements.

Thus, alterations of the normal function of these genes could generate genetic instability, shifting the normal process of the cell cycle, leading the cells to develop into cancer. In this work we analyzed exon 18 of the hRAD54 gene, which has been previously reported by our group to carry a silent polymorphism, 2290 C/T (Ala730Ala), associated to meningiomas. We performed a PCR-SSCP method to detect the polymorphism in 239 samples including leukemia and normal control population. The results revealed that the 2290 C/T polymorphism has frequencies of 0.1 for the leukemia and 0.1 for the control group. These frequencies show no statistical differences. Additionally, we dissected the leukemia group in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to evaluate the polymorphism. The frequencies found in these subgroups were 0.14 for CML and 0.05 for ALL. We found statistically significant differences between CML patients and the control group (p < 0.05) but we did not find significant differences between ALL and the control group (p > 0.05). These results suggest a possible link between the 2290 C/T polymorphism of the hRAD54 gene and CML.","['Paz-Y-Mino, Cesar', 'Lopez-Cortes, Andres', 'Munoz, Maria Jose', 'Castro, Bernardo', 'Cabrera, Alejandro', 'Sanchez, Maria Eugenia']","['Paz-Y-Mino C', 'Lopez-Cortes A', 'Munoz MJ', 'Castro B', 'Cabrera A', 'Sanchez ME']","['Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de las Americas, Quito Ecuador.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Brazil,Genet Mol Biol,Genetics and molecular biology,100883590,,,,2011/06/04 06:00,2011/06/04 06:01,['2011/06/04 06:00'],"['2009/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1590/S1415-47572010005000095 [doi]'],ppublish,Genet Mol Biol. 2010 Oct;33(4):646-9. doi: 10.1590/S1415-47572010005000095.

DSBs in human cells are repaired via non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination repair pathways. In the former process, the structure of DNA termini plays an important role, as does the genetic constitution of the cells, through being different in normal and pathological cells. In order to investigate the dependence of NHEJ on DSB structure in normal and cancer cells, we used linearized plasmids with various, complementary or non-complementary, single-stranded or blunt DNA termini, as well as whole-cell extract isolated from normal human lymphocytes, chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells and lung cancer A549 cells. We observed a pronounced variability in the efficacy of NHEJ reaction depending on the type of ends. Plasmids with complementary and blunt termini were more efficiently repaired than the substrate with 3' protruding single-strand ends. The hierarchy of the effectiveness of NHEJ was on average, from the most effective to the least, A549/ normal lymphocytes/ K562. Our results suggest that the genetic constitution of the cells together with the substrate terminal structure may contribute to the efficacy of the NHEJ reaction. This should be taken into account on considering its applicability in cancer chemo- or radiotherapy by pharmacologically modulating NHEJ cellular responses.","['Poplawski, Tomasz', 'Pastwa, Elzbieta', 'Blasiak, Janusz']","['Poplawski T', 'Pastwa E', 'Blasiak J']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Banacha, Lodz Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Brazil,Genet Mol Biol,Genetics and molecular biology,100883590,,,,2010/04/01 00:00,2010/04/01 00:01,['2011/06/04 06:00'],"['2009/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1590/S1415-47572010005000018 [doi]'],ppublish,Genet Mol Biol. 2010 Apr;33(2):368-73. doi: 10.1590/S1415-47572010005000018.

We tested whether the null genotypes of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes, involved in benzene inactivation, altered the risk for NEB in southeastern Brazil. Genomic DNA from 55 NEB patients and 330 controls was analysed by multiplex-polymerase chain reaction. The frequency of the GSTM1, GSTT1 and combined null genotypes was similar in patients and controls (GSTM1, 27.3% vs. 38.8%, p = 0.16; GSTT1, 25.5% vs. 19.7%, p = 0.24; GSTM1/GSTT1, 12.7% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.26; respectively). The distribution of genotype classes in NEB patients was similar to normal controls, suggesting that GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes make no specific contribution to the risk of NEB. As the GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes were previously associated with increased risk for AML in Brazil and elsewhere, we hypothesise that different thresholds of chemical exposure relative to distinct GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes may determine whether AML or NEB manifests in benzene exposed individuals from southeastern Brazil. Although indicative, our results still require support by prospective and large scale epidemiological studies, with rigorous assessment of daily chemical exposures and control of the possible contribution of other polymorphic genes involved in benzene metabolism.","['Lima, Carmen Silvia Passos', 'Lourenco, Gustavo Jacob', 'Lorand-Metze, Irene', 'Nascimento, Helvia', 'Saad, Sara Teresinha Ollala', 'Costa, Fernando Ferreira']","['Lima CS', 'Lourenco GJ', 'Lorand-Metze I', 'Nascimento H', 'Saad ST', 'Costa FF']","['Departamento de Clinica Medica, Faculdade de Ciencias Medicas, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas, SP Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Brazil,Genet Mol Biol,Genetics and molecular biology,100883590,,,,2009/10/01 00:00,2009/10/01 00:01,['2011/06/04 06:00'],"['2008/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1590/S1415-47572009005000067 [doi]'],ppublish,Genet Mol Biol. 2009 Oct;32(4):709-11. doi: 10.1590/S1415-47572009005000067.

H60 has been characterized as a dominant antigen expressed on hematopoietic cells and considered to be an ideal model antigen for study on graft-versus-leukemia effect. METHODS: Splenocytes from C57BL/6 mice immunized with H60 congenic splenocytes were used for establishment of H60-specific CTL clones. Then the clones were characterized for proliferation capacity and cytotoxicity after stimulation with H60. Clone #14, #15, and #23 were tested for the TCR binding avidity to H60-peptide/H-2K(b) and analyzed for TCR sequences. RESULTS: H60-specific CTL clones showed different levels of proliferation capacity and cytotoxic activity to H60-stimulation. Clones #14, #15, and #23 showed high proliferation activity, high cytotoxicity, and low activities on both aspects, respectively, and have TCRs with different binding avidities to H60-peptide/H-2K(b) with t(1/2) values of 4.87, 6.92, and 13.03 minutes, respectively.

EAR-2 is expressed highly in long-term hematopoietic stem cells, relative to short-term hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and is downregulated in AML cells after induction of differentiation. Exogenous expression of EAR-2 increased the growth of U937 cells and prevented the proliferative arrest associated with terminal differentiation, and blocked differentiation of U937 and 32Dcl3 cells. Conversely, silencing of EAR-2 by short-hairpin RNA initiated terminal differentiation of these cell lines. These data identify EAR-2 as an important factor in the regulation of clonogenicity and differentiation, and establish that analysis of clonal siblings allows the elucidation of differences in gene expression within the AML hierarchy.","['Ichim, C V', 'Atkins, H L', 'Iscove, N N', 'Wells, R A']","['Ichim CV', 'Atkins HL', 'Iscove NN', 'Wells RA']","['Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2011/06/04 06:00,2011/12/23 06:00,['2011/06/04 06:00'],"['2011/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011137 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.137 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Nov;25(11):1687-96. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.137.

The use of cyclophosphamide plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to mobilize peripheral blood stem cells may overcome this concern. In newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) patients, we investigated the influence of lenalidomide on stem cell collection. In a prospective study, 346 patients received four cycles of lenalidomide-dexamethasone (Rd). Stem cells were mobilized with cyclophosphamide and G-CSF. Patients failing to collect a minimum of 4 x 10(6) CD34(+)/kg cells received a second mobilization course. After mobilization, a median yield of 8.7 x 10(6) CD34(+)/kg was obtained from patients receiving Rd induction. After first mobilization, inadequate yield was observed in 21% of patients, whereas only 9% of patients failed to collect the target yield after the second mobilization attempt. In conclusion, we confirm that a short induction with lenalidomide allowed sufficient stem cells collection to perform autologous transplantation in 91% of newly diagnosed patients.","['Cavallo, F', 'Bringhen, S', 'Milone, G', 'Ben-Yehuda, D', 'Nagler, A', 'Calabrese, E', 'Cascavilla, N', 'Montefusco, V', 'Lupo, B', 'Liberati, A M', 'Crippa, C', 'Rossini, F', 'Passera, R', 'Patriarca, F', 'Cafro, A M', 'Omede, P', 'Carella, A M', 'Peccatori, J', 'Catalano, L', 'Caravita, T', 'Musto, P', 'Petrucci, M T', 'Boccadoro, M', 'Palumbo, A']","['Cavallo F', 'Bringhen S', 'Milone G', 'Ben-Yehuda D', 'Nagler A', 'Calabrese E', 'Cascavilla N', 'Montefusco V', 'Lupo B', 'Liberati AM', 'Crippa C', 'Rossini F', 'Passera R', 'Patriarca F', 'Cafro AM', 'Omede P', 'Carella AM', 'Peccatori J', 'Catalano L', 'Caravita T', 'Musto P', 'Petrucci MT', 'Boccadoro M', 'Palumbo A']","['Myeloma Unit, Division of Hematology, University of Torino, AOU S Giovanni Battista, Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', '*Transplantation Conditioning']",2011/06/04 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/04 06:00'],"['2011/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['leu2011131 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.131 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Oct;25(10):1627-31. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.131.

Aiming to further improve antineoplastic efficacy, the trifunctional bispecific antibody FBTA05 was developed. FBTA05 is thought to function by simultaneously binding B cells and T cells by its variable regions and by recruiting FcgammaR-positive accessory immune cells by its intact Fc region. As it was previously shown that this antibody shows considerable cytotoxicity towards a spectrum of B-cell lymphoma cell lines, we here tested its potential efficacy ex vivo against malignant B-CLL cells. Therefore, we assessed the capacity of increasing concentrations of FBTA05 to bind to neoplastic cells, to induce cytotoxicity (comparing it with rituximab and alemtuzumab) and cytokine release. We evaluated the results with respect to the extent of CD20 expression, the effector:target cell ratio as well as with the patients' overall effector cell status. Thus, we show that, although FBTA05-elicited cytotoxicity was comparable with that induced by alemtuzumab, it considerably exceeded the antineoplastic effects of rituximab. Noteworthy, FBTA05 shows effective elimination of malignant B cells even if CD20 surface expression is low. Importantly, a high grade of cytotoxicity was associated with the induction of T-cell proliferation and the concomittant release of interferon-gamma and interleukin-6, thus overcoming the detrimental effects of an unfavourable effector:target cell ratio. In conclusion, we here present novel evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of the trifunctional, bispecific antibody FBTA05 in CLL and provide evidence for the importance of immune-mediated mechanisms conveying the cytotoxic effects against malignant B lymphocytes.","['Boehrer, Simone', 'Schroeder, Petra', 'Mueller, Tina', 'Atz, Judith', 'Chow, Kai Uwe']","['Boehrer S', 'Schroeder P', 'Mueller T', 'Atz J', 'Chow KU']","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Hopital Avicenne, AP-HP/Universite Paris XIII, Bobigny, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bi20 antibody)', '0 (Cytokines)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD20/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granzymes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Perforin/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Rituximab', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology']",2011/06/04 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2011/06/04 06:00'],"['2011/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/CAD.0b013e328344887f [doi]', '00001813-201107000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2011 Jul;22(6):519-30. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e328344887f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether microRNAs can discriminate patients with a progressive disease from patients with a stable disease. We analyzed microRNA expression on leukemic cells isolated from 358 sequential samples of 114 patients with either stable or progressive disease. We found that during the course of the disease the expression values of miR-181b, the most dysregulated microRNA, decreased in samples of patients with a progressive (P < .001, training and validation sets) but not in samples of patients with a stable disease (P = .3, training set; P = .2, validation set) over time. A drop of >/= 50% between sequential samples and/or a miR-181b value </= 0.005 at the starting time point were significant to differentiate progressive from stable disease (P = .004, training set; P < .001, validation set). These parameters were associated with high risk of requiring treatment (risk ratio, 5.8; 95% confidence interval, 2.5-14.9). We also observed that miR-181b targets Mcl-1 protein and that the decrease of its expression inversely correlated with increased protein levels of MCL1 and BCL2 target genes.

However, the direct effects of SCF on neovascularization activity of EPCs have not been characterized. We sought to determine whether SCF regulates the neovascularization ability of EPCs by comparing its roles in mature endothelial cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: In vitro and in vivo assays revealed that SCF substantially increased the neovascularization activity of human EPCs through the c-Kit receptor. Notably, the SCF-induced increase in neovascularization activity was substantially greater in EPCs than that in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). SCF-induced phosphorylation of c-Kit and downstream signalling molecules was consistently found to be more potent and longer-lasting in EPCs than in HUVECs. This high responsiveness of EPCs to SCF was explained by the finding that the cell-surface expression of c-Kit is far higher in EPCs than in HUVECs. A c-Kit promoter assay revealed that the increased expression of c-Kit in EPCs could be attributed to the greater expression of stem cell leukaemia, LIM-only 2, and GATA-binding protein 2. CONCLUSION: In addition to its documented role in the mobilization and recruitment of EPCs, our findings show that SCF directly enhances the neovascularization activity of EPCs. Furthermore, the present study provides further evidence that EPCs exhibit differentially greater responsiveness to hypoxia-inducible cytokines, including SCF, than mature endothelial cells, suggesting that EPCs in ischaemic tissues function differently from mature endothelial cells, although they exhibit very similar phenotypes.","['Kim, Koung Li', 'Meng, Yongsun', 'Kim, Ji Yeon', 'Baek, Eun Jung', 'Suh, Wonhee']","['Kim KL', 'Meng Y', 'Kim JY', 'Baek EJ', 'Suh W']","['College of Pharmacy, Ajou University, San 5, Woncheon-Dong, Yeongtong-Gu, Suwon 443-749, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cardiovasc Res,Cardiovascular research,0077427,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/analysis', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/analysis', 'Endothelial Cells/*cytology', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins/analysis', '*Neovascularization, Physiologic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/analysis/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Factor/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/*physiology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1']",2011/06/04 06:00,2012/01/24 06:00,['2011/06/04 06:00'],"['2011/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['cvr161 [pii]', '10.1093/cvr/cvr161 [doi]']",ppublish,Cardiovasc Res. 2011 Oct 1;92(1):132-40. doi: 10.1093/cvr/cvr161.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 in LIF-mediated proliferation of HTR-8/SVneo cells. Stimulation of HTR-8/SVneo cells with LIF (50 ng mL(-1)) resulted in an increase in cell proliferation (P < 0.05) via increased transition of cells to the G(2)/M phase of cell cycle. Stimulation with LIF resulted in the activation of both signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 Tyr(705) and ERK1/2, but inhibition of ERK1/2 signalling by pretreatment of cells with U0126 (10 microM) for 2h resulted in abrogation of LIF-mediated increases in G(2)/M transition, with a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in absolute cell numbers compared with control. Although STAT3 silencing had no effect on LIF-dependent proliferation of HTR-8/SVneo cells, it did result in an increase in cell apoptosis, which increased further upon inhibition of ERK1/2 activation irrespective of LIF stimulation. Stimulation of cells with LIF increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, whereas ERK1/2 inhibition decreased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, even after LIF stimulation. Hence, it can be inferred that ERK1/2 activation is essential for LIF-mediated increases in proliferation and that both STAT3 and ERK1/2 activation are important for the survival of HTR-8/SVneo cells.","['Prakash, Golla Jaya', 'Suman, Pankaj', 'Morales Prieto, Diana M', 'Markert, Udo R', 'Gupta, Satish K']","['Prakash GJ', 'Suman P', 'Morales Prieto DM', 'Markert UR', 'Gupta SK']","['Reproductive Cell Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Immunology, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi 110 067, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Reprod Fertil Dev,"Reproduction, fertility, and development",8907465,"['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (U 0126)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming/genetics', 'Apoptosis', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Trophoblasts/drug effects/*enzymology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2011/06/04 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/06/04 06:00'],"['2010/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['RD10315 [pii]', '10.1071/RD10315 [doi]']",ppublish,Reprod Fertil Dev. 2011;23(5):714-24. doi: 10.1071/RD10315.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show how the histone signature, DNA methylation and levels of select tumour-suppressor proteins can be affected by inhibitors of HDACs (histone deacetylases) and Dnmts (DNA methyltransferases). Both inhibitors, TSA (trichostatin A) and 5-AZA (5-azacytidine), have the ability to change the histone signature in a tumour-specific manner. In MM cells, we observed changes in H3K4 methylation, while in leukaemia cells, H3K9 methylation was especially affected by select inhibitors. Compared with normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, tumour cell samples were characterized by increased H3K9 acetylation, increased H3K4me2, H3K9me2 and HP1alpha (heterochromatin protein 1alpha) levels and specific changes were also observed for DNA methylation. Additionally, we showed that the tumour suppressor pRb1 (retinoblastoma protein) is more sensitive to epigenetic-based anti-cancer stimuli than p53. We have found significant decrease in the levels of pRb1 and p53 in both myeloma and leukaemia cells after HDAC inhibition.","['Jugova, Alzbeta', 'Sustackova, Gabriela', 'Legartova, Sona', 'Stixova, Lenka', 'Kozubek, Stanislav', 'Bartova, Eva']","['Jugova A', 'Sustackova G', 'Legartova S', 'Stixova L', 'Kozubek S', 'Bartova E']","['Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Brno.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CBX5 protein, human)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '107283-02-3 (Chromobox Protein Homolog 5)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Chromobox Protein Homolog 5', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Methylases/genetics/metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",2011/06/04 06:00,2012/06/07 06:00,['2011/06/04 06:00'],"['2011/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['CBI20100820 [pii]', '10.1042/CBI20100820 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2011 Dec;35(12):1195-203. doi: 10.1042/CBI20100820.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a recently completed Phase I?II study, ruxolitinib, a selective orally available JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, has shown efficacy in patients with advanced myelofibrosis. Constitutive activation of the JAK?STAT pathway has also been implicated in other hematological malignancies suggesting a potential role of JAK kinase inhibitors in these malignancies. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the chemistry, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of ruxolitinib. The literature for this article was retrieved from PubMed database searches using the keywords ?ruxolitinib?, ?INCB 018424?, ?JAK2 inhibitors? and ?leukemia?. EXPERT OPINION: The JAK?STAT signaling pathway plays a vital role in leukemogenesis. Ruxolitinib, a potent JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, known to decrease spleen size and alleviate constitutional symptoms in myelofibrosis, represents a potentially promising agent for the treatment of leukemias by inhibiting the JAK?STAT signaling. Further studies of ruxolitinib, in patients with acute and chronic leukemias, are now needed to establish the clinical usefulness of this promising drug.","['Naqvi, Kiran', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Naqvi K', 'Verstovsek S', 'Kantarjian H', 'Ravandi F']","['University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Leukemia, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism', 'Nitriles', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2011/06/04 06:00,2011/12/21 06:00,['2011/06/04 06:00'],"['2011/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2011.589383 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2011 Aug;20(8):1159-66. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2011.589383.

Although individuals can differ in their sensitivity to odor and eye irritation, the majority of authoritative reviews of the formaldehyde literature have concluded that an air concentration of 0.3 ppm will provide protection from eye irritation for virtually everyone. A weight of evidence-based formaldehyde exposure limit of 0.1 ppm (100 ppb) is recommended as an indoor air level for all individuals for odor detection and sensory irritation. It has recently been suggested by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the National Toxicology Program (NTP), and the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) that formaldehyde is causally associated with nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) and leukemia. This has led US EPA to conclude that irritation is not the most sensitive toxic endpoint and that carcinogenicity should dictate how to establish exposure limits for formaldehyde. In this review, a number of lines of reasoning and substantial scientific evidence are described and discussed, which leads to a conclusion that neither point of contact nor systemic effects of any type, including NPC or leukemia, are causally associated with exposure to formaldehyde. This conclusion supports the view that the equivocal epidemiology studies that suggest otherwise are almost certainly flawed by identified or yet to be unidentified confounding variables. Thus, this assessment concludes that a formaldehyde indoor air limit of 0.1 ppm should protect even particularly susceptible individuals from both irritation effects and any potential cancer hazard.","['Golden, Robert']",['Golden R'],"['ToxLogic LLC, Potomac, Maryland 20854, USA. rgolden124@aol.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Crit Rev Toxicol,Critical reviews in toxicology,8914275,"['0 (Irritants)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)']",IM,"['Air Pollution, Indoor/*analysis', 'Carcinoma', 'Formaldehyde/*toxicity', 'Humans', '*Inhalation Exposure', 'Irritants/*toxicity', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Assessment/methods']",2011/06/04 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/04 06:00'],"['2011/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10408444.2011.573467 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Toxicol. 2011 Sep;41(8):672-721. doi: 10.3109/10408444.2011.573467.

The concern stems from certain epidemiology studies reporting an association, although particulars of endpoints and dosimetry are inconsistent across studies and several other studies show no such effects. Animal studies generally report neither hematotoxicity nor leukemia associated with formaldehyde inhalation, and hematotoxicity studies in humans are inconsistent. Formaldehyde's reactivity has been thought to preclude systemic exposure following inhalation, and its apparent inability to reach and affect the target tissues attacked by known leukemogens has, heretofore, led to skepticism regarding its potential to cause human lymphohematopoietic cancers. Recently, however, potential modes of action for formaldehyde leukemogenesis have been hypothesized, and it has been suggested that formaldehyde be identified as a known human leukemogen. In this article, we apply our hypothesis-based weight-of-evidence (HBWoE) approach to evaluate the large body of evidence regarding formaldehyde and leukemogenesis, attending to how human, animal, and mode-of-action results inform one another. We trace the logic of inference within and across all studies, and articulate how one could account for the suite of available observations under the various proposed hypotheses. Upon comparison of alternative proposals regarding what causal processes may have led to the array of observations as we see them, we conclude that the case for a causal association is weak and strains biological plausibility. Instead, apparent association between formaldehyde inhalation and leukemia in some human studies is better interpreted as due to chance or confounding.","['Rhomberg, Lorenz R', 'Bailey, Lisa A', 'Goodman, Julie E', 'Hamade, Ali K', 'Mayfield, David']","['Rhomberg LR', 'Bailey LA', 'Goodman JE', 'Hamade AK', 'Mayfield D']","['Gradient, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, USA. lrhomberg@gradientcorp.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Crit Rev Toxicol,Critical reviews in toxicology,8914275,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', '0 (Mutagens)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Causality', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Ecotoxicology/methods', 'Formaldehyde/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/chemically induced/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Mutagens/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Assessment']",2011/06/04 06:00,2011/11/09 06:00,['2011/06/04 06:00'],"['2011/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10408444.2011.560140 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Toxicol. 2011 Aug;41(7):555-621. doi: 10.3109/10408444.2011.560140.

The first set was based on use of artificial microRNAs (miRNAs) and second one was intended for production of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). It was shown that Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 leukemia cells can be efficiency transduced by each new lentiviral vector. Moreover, the percent of modified leukemia cells that may be easily evaluated in multiplicity of infection (MOI) test achieved more than 90% for Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 cells at MOI 40 and 20, respectively. Comparative study elucidated that the anti-aml1/eto shRNA-based approach induced a stronger knock-down of aml1/eto gene in Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 cells than the miRNA-based method did.

The aim of this study was to record the distribution of the different subtypes, analyze the major subtypes, and compare it with the published data from other countries. A review of pediatric NHL statistics from population-based cancer registries was included in this study. METHODS: The study was conducted using information retrieved from the files of our institution. A total of 467 patients with lymphoma (excluding mycosis fungoides) were recorded in the under 20 years group over a period of 6 years, of which 252 patients suffered from NHL. The demographic characteristics, frequency and distribution of different subtypes were noted and compared with published reports from other parts of the world. RESULTS: T-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia constituted the majority (32.1%) of all NHLs in children and adolescents in our study. The other major subgroups were Burkitt's lymphoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Burkitt's lymphoma in this study had clinical presentations similar to those seen in western countries. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of different subtypes of lymphoma in pediatric and adolescent NHL in India differs considerably from that in western countries and other eastern countries.","['Manipadam, Marie Therese', 'Nair, Sheila', 'Viswabandya, Auro', 'Mathew, Leni', 'Srivastava, Alok', 'Chandy, Mammen']","['Manipadam MT', 'Nair S', 'Viswabandya A', 'Mathew L', 'Srivastava A', 'Chandy M']","['Department of Pathology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India. mtm2005@cmcvellore.ac.in']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,World J Pediatr,World journal of pediatrics : WJP,101278599,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology']",2011/06/03 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/06/03 06:00'],"['2010/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12519-011-0303-7 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Pediatr. 2011 Nov;7(4):318-25. doi: 10.1007/s12519-011-0303-7.

The medical records of all adult patients were reviewed and analysed for clinical, morphological and immunological features at presentation and impact on treatment outcomes. Multivariate analysis and survival studies were performed using Kaplan-Meier statistics. RESULTS: The total number of patients was 54, with a male to female ratio of 3.4:1 and a median age of 28 years. Common presenting symptoms were fever (n is 49) and bleeding (n is 14). 38 patients had haemoglobin less than 10 gms/dl, 21 had white blood cell (WBC) count of 50 x 10E9/L or more, and 35 had lactate dehyrogenase more than 1,000 IU. Morphologically, FAB-L2 was the commonest subtype, with 38 patients with B-ALL and eight with T-ALL. Multivariate analysis showed that age above 30 years, male gender, WBC count above 50 x 10E9/L and T-ALL subtype were independent risk factors for poor survival. 46 (85 percent) patients achieved complete remission. The median survival was 12.3 months. At the end of five years, 16 patients were alive, two were alive with disease and 14 were in complete remission. CONCLUSION: Overall survival and relapse rates in our study were comparable to those reported internationally.","['Shaikh, M U', 'Ali, N', 'Adil, S N', 'Khurshid, M']","['Shaikh MU', 'Ali N', 'Adil SN', 'Khurshid M']","['Department of Pathology and Microbiology, Aga Khan University and Hospital, PO Box 3500, Stadium Road 74800, Karachi, Pakistan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Singapore,Singapore Med J,Singapore medical journal,0404516,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/06/03 06:00,2011/10/04 06:00,['2011/06/03 06:00'],"['2011/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Singapore Med J. 2011 May;52(5):370-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib uptake was significantly enhanced in OATP1A2-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (P = 0.002). Naringin, an OATP1A2 inhibitor, decreased the transport of imatinib in OATP1A2-transfected HEK293 cells, the human intestinal cell line Caco-2, and K562 CML cells. Linkage disequilibrium was found between the SLCO1A2 -1105G>A and -1032G>A genotypes in 34 CML patients and 100 healthy subjects.

This notwithstanding, we recently showed that a large proportion of human hematologic tumors is resistant to gammadelta peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) activated with specific agonists to the highly prevalent Vgamma9Vdelta2 TCR. Although this probably constitutes an important limitation to current gammadelta T cell-mediated immunotherapy strategies, we describe here the differentiation of a novel subset of Vdelta2(-) Vdelta1(+) PBLs expressing natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) that directly mediate killing of leukemia cell lines and chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient neoplastic cells. We show that Vdelta1(+) T cells can be selectively induced to express NKp30, NKp44 and NKp46, through a process that requires functional phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K)/AKT signaling on stimulation with gamma(c) cytokines and TCR agonists. The stable expression of NCRs is associated with high levels of granzyme B and enhanced cytotoxicity against lymphoid leukemia cells. Specific gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments demonstrated that NKp30 makes the most important contribution to TCR-independent leukemia cell recognition. Thus, NKp30(+) Vdelta1(+) T cells constitute a novel, inducible and specialized killer lymphocyte population with high potential for immunotherapy of human cancer.","['Correia, Daniel V', 'Fogli, Manuela', 'Hudspeth, Kelly', 'da Silva, Maria Gomes', 'Mavilio, Domenico', 'Silva-Santos, Bruno']","['Correia DV', 'Fogli M', 'Hudspeth K', 'da Silva MG', 'Mavilio D', 'Silva-Santos B']","['Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (NCR3 protein, human)', '0 (Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 3)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 3/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*immunology/metabolism']",2011/06/03 06:00,2011/10/15 06:00,['2011/06/03 06:00'],"['2011/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44689-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-02-339135 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jul 28;118(4):992-1001. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-02-339135.

We postulated that a mechanism for this activity is the incorporation of fludarabine into DNA during nucleotide excision repair (NER) stimulated by oxaliplatin adducts. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed CLL cell viability, DNA damage, and signaling pathways in response to treatment by fludarabine, oxaliplatin, or the combination. The dependency of the combination on oxaliplatin-induced DNA repair was investigated using siRNA in CLL cells or cell line models of NER deficiency. RESULTS: Synergistic apoptotic killing was observed in CLL cells after exposure to the combination in vitro. Oxaliplatin induced DNA synthesis in CLL cells, which was inhibited by fludarabine and was eliminated by knockdown of XPF, the NER 5'-endonuclease. Wild-type Chinese hamster ovarian cells showed synergistic killing after combination treatment, whereas only additive killing was observed in cells lacking XPF. Inhibition of repair by fludarabine in CLL cells was accompanied by DNA single-strand break formation. CLL cells initiated both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways as evidenced by the loss of mitochondrial outer membrane potential and partial inhibition of cell death upon incubation with FasL antibody. CONCLUSIONS: The synergistic cell killing is caused by a mechanistic interaction that requires the initiation of XPF-dependent excision repair in response to oxaliplatin adducts, and the inhibition of that process by fludarabine incorporation into the repair patch. This combination strategy may be useful against other malignancies.","['Zecevic, Alma', 'Sampath, Deepa', 'Ewald, Brett', 'Chen, Rong', 'Wierda, William', 'Plunkett, William']","['Zecevic A', 'Sampath D', 'Ewald B', 'Chen R', 'Wierda W', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (xeroderma pigmentosum group F protein)', '04ZR38536J (Oxaliplatin)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Endonucleases/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Oxaliplatin', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use/toxicity']",2011/06/03 06:00,2011/12/20 06:00,['2011/06/03 06:00'],"['2011/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-10-2561 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-2561 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Jul 15;17(14):4731-41. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-2561.

Moreover, ICP0 has a role in the derepression of viral genomes and in the modulation of the host interferon response to virus infection. Here, we report that ICP0 interacts with SIAH-1, a cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase that is involved in multiple cellular pathways and is itself capable of mediating PML degradation. This novel virus-host interaction profoundly stabilized SIAH-1 and recruited this cellular E3 ligase into ICP0-containing nuclear bodies. Moreover, SIAH-1 mediated the polyubiquitination of HSV ICP0 in vitro and in vivo. After infection of SIAH-1 knockdown cells with HSV, higher levels of ICP0 were produced, ICP0 was less ubiquitinated, and the half-life of this multifunctional viral regulatory protein was increased.

Notably, these cells expressed the NKT lineage-specific transcription promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), indicating a developmental relationship with NKT cells and ruling out the possibility that they were conventional MHC-restricted T cells cross-reacting against CD1d-alpha-galactosylceramide. Although PLZF is known to direct the effector program of NKT cells, we show in this study that the naive-like cells expressed it at a significantly lower amount than NKT cells. Further, we present mouse studies demonstrating a sharp PLZF expression threshold requirement for induction of the effector phenotype. These findings directly demonstrate in vivo the existence of naive-like CD1d-restricted human T cells marked by intermediate levels of PLZF.","['Constantinides, Michael G', 'Picard, Damien', 'Savage, Adam K', 'Bendelac, Albert']","['Constantinides MG', 'Picard D', 'Savage AK', 'Bendelac A']","['Committee on Immunology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD1d)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD1d/blood/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Clone Cells', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Middle Aged', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Young Adult', 'Zinc Fingers']",2011/06/03 06:00,2011/08/31 06:00,['2011/06/03 06:00'],"['2011/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1100761 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1100761 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2011 Jul 1;187(1):309-15. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1100761.

We assessed the prognostic value of the new risk classification in a large cohort of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Complete data for classification were available for 1,557 of 1,862 patients treated in the AML96 trial. Patients were assigned to the proposed genetic groups from the ELN recommendations, and survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test for significance testing. RESULTS: The median age of all patients was 67 years. With a median follow-up of 8.3 years, significant differences between all risk categories were observed in patients age </= 60 years regarding the time to relapse, relapse-free survival, and overall survival (OS). Patients in the IR-II group had a better prognosis than patients in the IR-I group. The median OS times in young patients with favorable risk (FR), IR-I, IR-II, and adverse risk (AR) were 5.3, 1.1, 1.6, and 0.5 years, respectively. Separate analyses in the age group older than 60 years revealed significant differences between FR, AR, and IR as a whole, but not between IR-I and IR-II. CONCLUSION: In younger patients with AML, the ELN classification seems to be the best available framework for prognostic estimations to date. Caution is advised concerning its use for prospective treatment allocation before it has been prospectively validated. In elderly patients, alternative prognostic factors are desirable for further risk stratification of IR.","['Rollig, Christoph', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Taube, Franziska', 'Kramer, Michael', 'Mohr, Brigitte', 'Aulitzky, Walter', 'Bodenstein, Heinrich', 'Tischler, Hans-Joachim', 'Stuhlmann, Reingard', 'Schuler, Ulrich', 'Stolzel, Friedrich', 'von Bonin, Malte', 'Wandt, Hannes', 'Schafer-Eckart, Kerstin', 'Schaich, Markus', 'Ehninger, Gerhard']","['Rollig C', 'Bornhauser M', 'Thiede C', 'Taube F', 'Kramer M', 'Mohr B', 'Aulitzky W', 'Bodenstein H', 'Tischler HJ', 'Stuhlmann R', 'Schuler U', 'Stolzel F', 'von Bonin M', 'Wandt H', 'Schafer-Eckart K', 'Schaich M', 'Ehninger G']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Dresden, Dresden, Germany. christoph.roellig@uniklinikumdresden.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', '*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Population Surveillance/*methods', '*Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Analysis']",2011/06/03 06:00,2011/09/21 06:00,['2011/06/03 06:00'],"['2011/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.32.8500 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.32.8500 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Jul 10;29(20):2758-65. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.32.8500.

Several second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been designed rationally so as to enhance potency and retain the ability to bind mutated forms of Bcr-Abl. Since the preclinical phase of their development, most of these inhibitors have been tested in in vitro studies to assess their half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(5)(0)) for unmutated and mutated Bcr-Abl-that is, the drug concentration required to inhibit the cell proliferation or the phosphorylation processes driven by either the unmutated or the mutated forms of the kinase. A number of such studies have been published, and now that two inhibitors-dasatinib and nilotinib-are available for the treatment of imatinib-resistant cases, it is tempting for clinicians to reason on the IC(5)(0) values to guess, case by case, which one will work best in patients harboring specific Bcr-Abl KD mutations.

The activation of mTOR results in the production of proteins involved in cell metabolism, growth, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Aberrant activation of mTOR signaling has been identified in a number of cancers, and targeted inhibition of mTOR has been successful in achieving tumor responses, prolonging progression-free survival, and increasing overall survival in various oncologic patient populations. In particular, persistent activation of mTOR signaling has been identified in cell lines and patient samples with leukemias, Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), multiple myeloma (MM), and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM). In vitro and preclinical studies using agents that inhibit mTOR signaling have demonstrated cytostatic and cytotoxic effects in these hematologic malignancies, suggesting that mTOR is a rational target for therapy in these disease states. In addition, the combination of mTOR inhibitors with traditional therapies may help to overcome the development of resistance and may improve response rates over those seen with established regimens through synergistic or additive effects. Inhibitors of mTOR signaling currently are being investigated in clinical trials of hematologic malignancies as single agents and as components of combination regimens. Thus far, promising results have been seen with the application of mTOR inhibitors as single agents in patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia, HL, NHL, MM, and WM.","['Younes, Anas', 'Samad, Nousheen']","['Younes A', 'Samad N']","['Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. ayounes@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Down-Regulation', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/drug therapy/metabolism']",2011/06/03 06:00,2011/10/21 06:00,['2011/06/03 06:00'],"['2011/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['theoncologist.2010-0318 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2010-0318 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2011;16(6):730-41. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2010-0318.

Survivors of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at increased risk of overweight and obesity. The purpose of this study was to assess leptin and leptin soluble receptor levels, as well as polymorphisms of selected genes in survivors of pediatric ALL, and the influence of chemo- and radiotherapy on development of overweight in the context of leptin regulation. METHODS: Eighty two patients (55% males), of median age 13.2 years (m: 4.8 years; M: 26.2 years) were included in the study. The ALL therapy was conducted according to modified Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM; n = 69) regimen or New York (n = 13) regimen. In 38% of patients cranial radiotherapy (CRT) was used in median dose of 18.2Gy (m: 14Gy; M: 24Gy). Median age at diagnosis was 4.5 (m: 1 year; M: 16.9 years) and median time from completion of ALL treatment was 3.2 years (m: 0.5 year; M: 4.3 years). Patients with BMI >/=85 percentile were classified as overweight. Correlation of plasma levels of leptin and leptin soluble receptor, and polymorphisms of leptin gene -18G > A, leptin receptor genes K109R and Q223R, and the overweight status were analyzed in relation to gender, intensity of chemotherapy (high intensity vs. standard intensity regimens) and to the use of CRT. RESULTS: Significant differences of leptin levels in patients treated with and without CRT, both in the entire study group (22.2+/- 3.13 ng/ml vs. 14.9+/-1.6 ng/ml; p < 0.03) and in female patients (29.9+/-4.86 ng/ml vs. 16.9+/-2.44 ng/ml; p = 0.014), were found. Significant increase of leptin levels was also found in overweight patients compared to the non-overweight patients in the entire study group (29.2+/-2.86 ng/ml vs. 12.6+/-1.51 ng/ml; p < 0.0001), female patients (35.4+/-6.48 ng/ml vs. 18.4+/-2.5 ng/ml; p = 0.005), and male patients (25.7+/-2.37 ng/ml vs. 6.9+/-0.95 ng/ml; p < 0.0001). Negative correlation was observed for plasma levels of soluble leptin receptor and overweight status, with significant differences in overweight and non-overweight patients, both in the entire study group (18.2+/-0.75 ng/ml vs. 20.98+/-0.67 ng/ml; p = 0.017) and in male patients (18.2+/-1.03 ng/ml vs. 21.8+/- 1.11 ng/ml; p = 0.038). Significant (p < 0.05) negative correlation was found between leptin and leptin receptor levels in the entire group (correlation coefficient: 0.393) and in both gender subgroups (correlation coefficient in female patients: -0.427; in male patients: -0.396). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of overweight in our cohort was higher than in general European population (31% vs 20%) and increased regardless of the use of CRT. Leptin and leptin receptor levels may be used as useful markers of high risk of becoming overweight in ALL survivors, particularly in females treated with CRT. Polymorphisms of leptin gene -18G > A and leptin receptor genes K109R and Q223R were not associated with overweight status in ALL survivors.","['Skoczen, Szymon', 'Tomasik, Przemyslaw J', 'Bik-Multanowski, Miroslaw', 'Surmiak, Marcin', 'Balwierz, Walentyna', 'Pietrzyk, Jacek J', 'Sztefko, Krystyna', 'Gozdzik, Jolanta', 'Galicka-Latala, Danuta', 'Strojny, Wojciech']","['Skoczen S', 'Tomasik PJ', 'Bik-Multanowski M', 'Surmiak M', 'Balwierz W', 'Pietrzyk JJ', 'Sztefko K', 'Gozdzik J', 'Galicka-Latala D', 'Strojny W']","['Department of Immunology, Chair of Clinical Immunology and Transplantation, Jagiellonian University Medical College, ul.

However, determination of low-level Hb in erythroid precursors or haemolytic plasma is inaccurate because of contribution from light scatter and/or nonhaemoglobin components with overlapping absorbance. Therefore, this study developed a sole method allowing accurate spectrophotometric quantification of Hb at a low concentration range. METHODS: Advantage was taken of the unique absorption spectra of carbon monoxide-Hb complex (COHb) as compared to oxyHb. The visible absorption spectra of samples were recorded prior and following carbon monoxide exposure. A difference extinction coefficient at the maximal difference absorption was used to calculate Hb concentrations. RESULTS: Known amounts of Hb were added to mouse erythroleukaemia (MEL) cells lysate or plasma to yield known 'theoretical' concentrations. The concentrations were measured by the current and known methods. The current method was found much more accurate compared with previous methods specifically at low concentrations. CONCLUSION: The method is valid for accurate quantification of Hb at a wide concentration range (>0.1 mum/L) in erythroid precursors or plasma and is optional for other biological fluids.","['Toobiak, S', 'Sher, E A', 'Shaklai, M', 'Shaklai, N']","['Toobiak S', 'Sher EA', 'Shaklai M', 'Shaklai N']","['Department of Human Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '7U1EE4V452 (Carbon Monoxide)', '9061-29-4 (Carboxyhemoglobin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carbon Monoxide/chemistry', 'Carboxyhemoglobin/analysis', 'Cell Extracts/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*chemistry', 'Hemoglobins/*analysis/chemistry', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/blood/pathology', 'Mice', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Spectrophotometry/*methods']",2011/06/03 06:00,2012/03/17 06:00,['2011/06/03 06:00'],"['2011/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1751-553X.2011.01338.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2011 Dec;33(6):645-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2011.01338.x.

CLL has been associated with multiple other secondary malignancies, especially skin cancer. OBJECTIVE: To further understand the characteristics and behavior of MCC in the setting of concomitant CLL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified patients with diagnoses of both MCC and CLL who were seen at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) from January 1, 1976, to December 31, 2008, and retrospectively reviewed the charts of the identified patients. RESULTS: Seven patients received diagnoses of MCC and CLL. Five of these patients appeared to have higher rates of recurrence, metastasis, and mortality than patients with MCC but not CLL.

Thus it is not surprising that mutations of cytokine receptors contribute to the formation of haemopoietic disorders, including cancer. We recently identified transforming properties of IL27R, the ligand-binding component of the receptor for interleukin-27. Although wild-type IL27R exhibits transforming properties in haemopoietic cells, in the present study we set out to determine if the transforming activity of IL27R could be enhanced by mutation. We identified three mutations of IL27R that enhance its transforming activity. One of these mutations is a phenylalanine to cysteine mutation at residue 523 (F523C) in the transmembrane domain of the receptor. The two other mutations identified involve deletions of amino acids in the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region of the receptor. Expression of each of these mutant IL27R proteins led to rapid cytokine-independent transformation in haemopoietic cells. Moreover, the rate of transformation induced by these mutants was significantly greater than that induced by wild-type IL27R. Expression of these IL27R mutants also induced enhanced activation of JAK (Janus kinase)/STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) signalling compared with wild-type. An activating deletion mutation of IL27R enhanced homodimerization of the receptor by a mechanism that may involve disulfide bonding. These transforming IL27R mutants displayed equal or greater transforming activity than bona fide haemopoietic oncogenes such as BCR-ABL (breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukaemia viral oncogene homologue) and JAK2-V617F. Since IL27R is expressed on haemopoietic stem cells, lymphoid cells and myeloid cells, including acute myeloid leukaemia blast cells, mutation of this receptor has the potential to contribute to a variety of haemopoietic neoplasms.","['Lambert, Que T', 'Pradhan, Anuradha', 'Roll, J Devon', 'Reuther, Gary W']","['Lambert QT', 'Pradhan A', 'Roll JD', 'Reuther GW']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, 12902 Magnolia Drive, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (IL27RA protein, human)', '0 (Il27ra protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Membrane', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dimerization', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Kidney/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cells/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*genetics/metabolism', 'STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",2011/06/03 06:00,2011/10/07 06:00,['2011/06/03 06:00'],"['2011/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['BJ20110351 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20110351 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2011 Aug 15;438(1):155-64. doi: 10.1042/BJ20110351.,,PMC3145822,"['P30 CA076292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA127250/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA127250-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA127250/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS303753'],,['(c) The Authors Journal compilation (c) 2011 Biochemical Society'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we describe for the first time the effects of PSE on T-cell activation events. We found that PSE inhibits interleukin-2 (IL-2) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha-gene transcription in stimulated Jurkat cells, a human T-cell leukemia cell line. To further characterize the inhibitory mechanisms of PSE at the transcriptional level, we examined the transcriptional activities of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), and activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors and found that PSE inhibited NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional activity without affecting either the phosphorylation, the degradation of the cytoplasmic NF-kappaB inhibitory protein, IkappaBalpha or the DNA-binding activity. However, phosphorylation of the p65/RelA subunit was clearly inhibited by PSE in stimulated cells. In addition, PSE inhibited the transcriptional activity of NFAT without interfering with the calcium-induced NFAT dephosphorylation event, which represents the major signaling pathway for its activation. NFAT cooperates with c-Jun, a compound of the AP-1 complex, to activate target genes, and we also found that PSE inhibited both JNK activation and AP-1 transcriptional activity. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into the potential immunomodulatory activities of PSE and highlight their potential in designing novel therapeutic strategies to manage inflammatory diseases.","['Fiebich, Bernd L', 'Collado, Juan A', 'Stratz, Cristian', 'Valina, Christian', 'Hochholzer, Willibald', 'Munoz, Eduardo', 'Bellido, Luz M']","['Fiebich BL', 'Collado JA', 'Stratz C', 'Valina C', 'Hochholzer W', 'Munoz E', 'Bellido LM']","['Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Freiburg Medical School, Freiburg, Germany. bernd.fiebich@uniklinik-freiburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol,Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology,8800150,"['0 (Bronchodilator Agents)', '0 (IL2 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (RELA protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '7CUC9DDI9F (Pseudoephedrine)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,"['Bronchodilator Agents/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Pseudoephedrine/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelA/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2011/06/03 06:00,2012/04/17 06:00,['2011/06/03 06:00'],"['2011/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08923973.2011.582118 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol. 2012 Feb;34(1):98-106. doi: 10.3109/08923973.2011.582118.

Multiple human diseases result from bone marrow dysfunction. It is also the site in which liquid tumors, including leukemia and multiple myeloma, develop as well as a frequent site of metastases. Understanding the complex cellular and microenvironmental interactions that govern normal bone marrow function as well as diseases and cancers of the bone marrow would be a valuable medical advance. Our goal is the development of a spatially-explicit in silico model of the bone marrow to understand both its normal function and the evolutionary dynamics that govern the emergence of bone marrow malignancy. Here we introduce a multiscale computational model of the bone marrow that incorporates three distinct spatial scales, cell, hematopoietic subunit, whole marrow. Our results, using parameter estimates from literature, recapitulates normal bone marrow function and suggest an explanation for the fractal-like structure of trabeculae and sinuses in the marrow, which would be an optimization of the hematopoietic function in order to maximize the number of mature blood cells produced daily within the volumetric restrictions of the marrow.","['Silva, Ariosto', 'Anderson, Alexander R A', 'Gatenby, Robert']","['Silva A', 'Anderson AR', 'Gatenby R']","['H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, United States. ariosto.silva@moffitt.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Math Biosci Eng,Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,101197794,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*blood supply/*physiology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Models, Cardiovascular', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/*physiology']",2011/06/03 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2011/06/03 06:00'],"['2011/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3934/mbe.2011.8.643 [doi]'],ppublish,Math Biosci Eng. 2011 Apr;8(2):643-58. doi: 10.3934/mbe.2011.8.643.,,PMC3754791,['U54 CA143970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS489700'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the main causes for treatment failure in CML is the generation of drug resistance by mutations of cancerous cells. We use mathematical methods to develop general guidelines on optimal cyclic treatment scheduling, with the aim of minimizing the resistance generation. We define a condition on the drugs' potencies which allows for a relatively successful application of cyclic therapies. We find that the best strategy is to start with the stronger drug, but use longer cycle durations for the weaker drug. We further investigate the situation where a degree of cross-resistance is present, such that certain mutations cause cells to become resistant to both drugs simultaneously.","['Komarova, Natalia L']",['Komarova NL'],"['Department of Mathematics, University of California Irvine, Irvine CA 92697, United States. komarova@uci.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Math Biosci Eng,Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,101197794,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Chronic Disease', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Therapy, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Humans', '*Models, Biological', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/06/03 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2011/06/03 06:00'],"['2011/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3934/mbe.2011.8.289 [doi]'],ppublish,Math Biosci Eng. 2011 Apr;8(2):289-306. doi: 10.3934/mbe.2011.8.289.,,,"['R01 AI-58153/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA129286/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The efflux of tyrosine kinase inhibitors by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug transporters, which actively pump these drugs out of cells utilizing ATP as an energy source, has been linked to the development of drug resistance in CML patients. We report here the synthesis and characterization of a fluorescent derivative of Tasigna to study its interaction with two major ABC transporters, P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and ABCG2, in in vitro and ex vivo assays. A fluorescent derivative of Tasigna, BODIPY FL Tasigna, inhibited the BCR-ABL kinase activity in K562 cells and was also effluxed by Pgp- and ABCG2-expressing cells in both cultured cells and rat brain capillaries expressing Pgp and ABCG2. In addition, [(3)H]-Tasigna was found to be transported by Pgp-expressing polarized LLC-PK1 cells in a transepithelial transport assay. Consistent with these results, both Tasigna and BODIPY FL Tasigna were less effective at inhibiting the phosphorylation of Crkl (a substrate of BCR-ABL kinase) in Pgp- and ABCG2-expressing K562 cells due to their reduced intracellular concentration. Taken together, these data provide evidence that BODIPY FL Tasigna is transported by Pgp and ABCG2, and Tasigna is transported by Pgp. Further, we propose that BODIPY FL Tasigna can potentially be used as a probe for functional analysis of Pgp and ABCG2 in cancer cells and in other preclinical studies.","['Shukla, Suneet', 'Skoumbourdis, Amanda P', 'Walsh, Martin J', 'Hartz, Anika M S', 'Fung, King Leung', 'Wu, Chung-Pu', 'Gottesman, Michael M', 'Bauer, Bjorn', 'Thomas, Craig J', 'Ambudkar, Suresh V']","['Shukla S', 'Skoumbourdis AP', 'Walsh MJ', 'Hartz AM', 'Fung KL', 'Wu CP', 'Gottesman MM', 'Bauer B', 'Thomas CJ', 'Ambudkar SV']","['Laboratory of Cell Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-4256, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene)', '0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boron Compounds)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Boron Compounds/*chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'LLC-PK1 Cells', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Swine']",2011/06/03 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2011/06/03 06:00'],"['2011/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/mp2001022 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2011 Aug 1;8(4):1292-302. doi: 10.1021/mp2001022.

We have isolated and characterized the exosomes generated from LAMA84 CML cells and demonstrated that addition of exosomes to human vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) induces an increase of both ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 cell adhesion molecules and interleukin-8 expression. The stimulation of cell-cell adhesion molecules was paralleled by a dose-dependent increase of adhesion of CML cells to a HUVEC monolayer. We further showed that the treatment with exosomes from CML cells caused an increase in endothelial cell motility accompanied by a loss of VE-cadherin and beta-catenin from the endothelial cell surface. Functional characterization of exosomes isolated from CML patients confirmed the data obtained with exosomes derived from CML cell line. CML exosomes caused reorganization into tubes of HUVEC cells cultured on Matrigel. When added to Matrigel plugs in vivo, exosomes induced ingrowth of murine endothelial cells and vascularization of the Matrigel plugs. Our results suggest for the first time that exosomes released from CML cells directly affect endothelial cells modulating the process of neovascularization.","['Taverna, Simona', 'Flugy, Anna', 'Saieva, Laura', 'Kohn, Elise C', 'Santoro, Alessandra', 'Meraviglia, Serena', 'De Leo, Giacomo', 'Alessandro, Riccardo']","['Taverna S', 'Flugy A', 'Saieva L', 'Kohn EC', 'Santoro A', 'Meraviglia S', 'De Leo G', 'Alessandro R']","['Dipartimento di Biopatologia e Biotecnologie Mediche e Forensi, Sezione di Biologia e Genetica, Universita di Palermo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '0 (cadherin 5)', '119978-18-6 (matrigel)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cadherins/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'Drug Combinations', 'Exosomes/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/genetics/metabolism', 'Laminin/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteoglycans/metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/genetics/metabolism', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",2011/06/02 06:00,2012/05/16 06:00,['2011/06/02 06:00'],"['2010/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.26217 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2012 May 1;130(9):2033-43. doi: 10.1002/ijc.26217.

We recently demonstrated that highly peptide- and HLA-specific T cells can readily be generated against allogeneic HLA-A*02:01 in complex with a peptide from the B cell-restricted protein CD20. Here, we show that such CD20-specific T cells can easily be induced from naive precursors in cord blood, demonstrating that they do not represent cross-reactive memory cells. The cells displayed high avidity and mediated potent cytotoxic effects on cells from patients with the CD20(pos) B cell malignancies follicular lymphoma (FL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, the cytotoxicity was consistently lower for cells from two of the ALL patients. The ALL cells that were less efficiently killed did not display lower surface expression of CD20 or HLA-A*02:01, or mutations in the CD20 sequence. Peptide pulsing fully restored the levels of cytotoxicity, indicating that they are indeed susceptible to T cell-mediated killing. Adoptive transfer of CD20-specific T cells to an HLA-A*02:01(pos) patient requires an HLA-A*02:01(neg) , but otherwise HLA identical, donor. A search clarified that donors meeting these criteria can be readily identified even for patients with rare haplotypes.

One promising target is DNA-PK, a pivotal kinase in double-strand break repair. The purpose of this study was to further characterise the activity of the DNA-PK inhibitor NU7441, giving some new insights into the biology of DNA-PK. METHODS: We used NU7441, a potent DNA-PK inhibitor, to evaluate potential pharmacodynamic markers of DNA-PK inhibition, inhibition of DNA repair and chemo- and radio-potentiation in isogenic human cancer cells proficient (M059-Fus1) and deficient (M059 J) in DNA-PK. RESULTS: NU7441 strongly inhibited DNA-PK in cell lines (IC(50) = 0.3 muM) but only weakly inhibited PI3 K (IC(50) = 7 muM). The only available anti-phospho-DNA-PK antibody also recognised some phosphoprotein targets of ATM. NU7441 caused doxorubicin- and IR-induced DNA DSBs (measured by gamma-H2AX foci) to persist and also slightly decreased homologous recombination activity, as assessed by Rad51 foci. Chemo- and radio-potentiation were induced by NU7441 in M059-Fus-1, but not in DNA-PK-deficient M059 J cells. DNA-PK was highly expressed in a chronic lymphocytic leukaemia sample but undetectable in resting normal human lymphocytes, although it could be induced by PHA-P treatment. In K652 cells, DNA-PK expression was not related to cell cycle phase. CONCLUSION: These data confirm NU7441 not only as a potent chemo- and radio-sensitiser clinical candidate but also as a powerful tool to study the biology of DNA-PK.","['Tavecchio, Michele', 'Munck, Joanne M', 'Cano, Celine', 'Newell, David R', 'Curtin, Nicola J']","['Tavecchio M', 'Munck JM', 'Cano C', 'Newell DR', 'Curtin NJ']","[""Northern Institute for Cancer Research, School of Medical Sciences, Newcastle University, Paul O' Gorman Building, Framlington Place, NE2 4HH Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (8-dibenzothiophen-4-yl-2-morpholin-4-yl-chromen-4-one)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Morpholines)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromones/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', '*DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Glioblastoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Morpholines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2011/06/02 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/06/02 06:00'],"['2010/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-011-1662-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2012 Jan;69(1):155-64. doi: 10.1007/s00280-011-1662-4.

We studied late cardiotoxicity in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with low anthracycline doses 10 to 20 years earlier. METHODS: Seventy-seven ALL survivors who received a cumulative anthracycline dose <250 mg/m(2) and were at least 10 years after treatment were evaluated for signs of clinical heart failure. Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography including tissue Doppler measurements of the septal mitral annulus in 37 ALL survivors 10.6-18.3 years (median 13.3 years) after anthracycline treatment with cumulative doses of 180 (n = 19) or 240 mg/m(2) (n = 18). The control group consisted of 30 healthy volunteers matched for age, sex, BSA, and BMI. RESULTS: No clinical relevant cardiotoxicity was found. Left ventricular shortening fraction (SF) was significantly reduced in male ALL survivors. Three of the 19 male ALL survivors had an SF below 30%. Male ALL survivors showed a significantly lower early filling velocity to atrial contraction velocity ratio but myocardial velocity during early filling was comparable between patients and controls. ALL survivors had a significantly longer isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT). Thirty percent of the ALL survivors have an abnormal IVRT compared to the normal range of the controls. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: At a median of 13.3 years after exposure to cumulative doses of anthracyclines of 180 or 240 mg/m(2), no clinical relevant cardiotoxicity was found but subclinical cardiac abnormalities were present in 30% of the patients.","['Vandecruys, Els', 'Mondelaers, Veerle', 'De Wolf, Daniel', 'Benoit, Yves', 'Suys, Bert']","['Vandecruys E', 'Mondelaers V', 'De Wolf D', 'Benoit Y', 'Suys B']","['Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, Ghent University Hospital, De Pintelaan 185, Ghent, Belgium. els.vandecruys@ugent.be']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases/*chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardium/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Sex Factors', '*Survivors', 'Time Factors', 'Ultrasonography', 'Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/chemically induced/diagnostic imaging', 'Young Adult']",2011/06/02 06:00,2012/06/20 06:00,['2011/06/02 06:00'],"['2011/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11764-011-0186-6 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2012 Mar;6(1):95-101. doi: 10.1007/s11764-011-0186-6.

The translocation results in an in-frame fusion of two genes, resulting in a fusion protein of one N-terminal domain from the AML1 gene and four C-terminal domains from the ETO gene. This protein has multiple effects on the regulation of the proliferation, the differentiation, and the viability of leukemic cells. The translocation can be detected as the only genetic abnormality or as part of more complex abnormalities. If t(8;21) is detected in a patient with bone marrow pathology, the diagnosis AML can be made based on this abnormality alone. t(8;21) is usually associated with a good prognosis. Whether the detection of the fusion gene can be used for evaluation of minimal residual disease and risk of leukemia relapse remains to be clarified. To conclude, detection of t(8;21) is essential for optimal handling of these patients as it has both diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications.","['Reikvam, Hakon', 'Hatfield, Kimberley Joanne', 'Kittang, Astrid Olsnes', 'Hovland, Randi', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Reikvam H', 'Hatfield KJ', 'Kittang AO', 'Hovland R', 'Bruserud O']","['Division of Hematology, Institute of Medicine, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biomed Biotechnol,Journal of biomedicine & biotechnology,101135740,,IM,"['Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2011/06/02 06:00,2011/11/04 06:00,['2011/06/02 06:00'],"['2010/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/31 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2011/104631 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Biotechnol. 2011;2011:104631. doi: 10.1155/2011/104631.

Recent data indicates that transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) may play a role in development of GVH reaction. MATERIAL/METHODS: Forty patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) were included. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to assess the expression of mRNA TGF-beta1. TGF-beta1 serum concentration was assessed using a commercial ELISA. RESULTS: In all patients, a prompt decrease in TGF-beta1 mRNA expression and its serum concentration was demonstrated after conditioning. In patients with acute GVHD, TGF-beta1 mRNA expression and its serum concentration remained low until day +30 after transplant as compared to the day of transplant (p<0.03 and p<0.006, respectively). TGF-beta1 mRNA expression and its serum concentration significantly increased on day +100 in patients who developed chronic GVHD as compared to the day of transplant (p<0.0009 and p<0.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: TGF-beta1 seems to be an additional regulator of donor engraftment; its low levels probably being one of the factors contributing to the development of acute GVHD. On the other hand, chronic GVHD symptoms seem to correlate with high TGF-beta1 mRNA expression and its serum concentration in patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation for myeloid leukemias. Nevertheless, further studies with greater numbers of patients are needed to establish the role of TGF-beta1 in graft-versus-host disease pathophysiology.","['Kyrcz-Krzemien, Slawomira', 'Helbig, Grzegorz', 'Zielinska, Patrycja', 'Markiewicz, Miroslaw']","['Kyrcz-Krzemien S', 'Helbig G', 'Zielinska P', 'Markiewicz M']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland. klinhem@sum.edu.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*blood/*genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/*blood/*genetics', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2011/06/02 06:00,2011/09/23 06:00,['2011/06/02 06:00'],"['2011/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['881804 [pii]', '10.12659/msm.881804 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2011 Jun;17(6):CR322-8. doi: 10.12659/msm.881804.,,PMC3539544,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BCL2 usually translocates to the immunoglobulin (IG) heavy chain (IGH) gene as t(14;18)(q32;q21.3) and rarely to IG light chain (IGK, IGL) loci as t(2;18)(p11;q21.3) or t(18;22)(q21.3;q11). The t(14;18) translocation is observed in 70-95% of follicular lymphoma cases and 20-30% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cases. The MYC gene on chromosome band 8q24 acts as an accelerator of cell proliferation. MYC translocates to 14q32/IGH as t(8;14)(q24;q32) or less commonly to 2p11/IGK as t(2;8)(p11;q24) or 22q11/IGL as t(8;22)(q24;q11). The 8q24/MYC translocation is detected in nearly all Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and up to 10% of DLBCL cases. Both translocations rarely occur in an identical cell and this lymphoid malignancy is termed BCL2 and MYC dual-hit lymphoma/leukemia (DHL). The pathological diagnosis in most cases of DHL with BCL2-IG and MYC-IG translocation is B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and BL, although DLBCL is most common in DHL with BCL2-IG and MYC-nonIG translocation. The frequency of DHL with BCL2 and MYC translocation is estimated at around 2% of all B-cell malignancies. The condition is characterized by elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, the presence of B symptoms, bone marrow involvement, advanced disease stage, extranodal involvement, and central nervous system (CNS) involvement at presentation or disease progression. Despite treatment strategies including CNS-targeted therapy, the prognosis for DHL is extremely poor. In this review, the current knowledge of the clinicopathological status of DHL is summarized and discussed.","['Tomita, Naoto']",['Tomita N'],"['Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan. cavalier@ch-yamate.dlenet.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,J Clin Exp Hematop,Journal of clinical and experimental hematopathology : JCEH,101141257,,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genes, bcl-2/*genetics', 'Genes, myc/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",2011/06/02 06:00,2011/10/14 06:00,['2011/06/02 06:00'],"['2011/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jslrt/51.7 [pii]', '10.3960/jslrt.51.7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Exp Hematop. 2011;51(1):7-12. doi: 10.3960/jslrt.51.7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The selectivity of these molecules for BCL2, BCL-X(L), or MCL1 has been established in vitro; whether they inhibit these proteins in cells has not been rigorously investigated. In this study, we used a panel of leukemia cell lines to assess the ability of seven putative BH3 mimetics to inhibit antiapoptotic proteins in a cell-based system. We show that ABT-737 is the only BH3 mimetic that inhibits BCL2 as assessed by displacement of BAD and BIM from BCL2. The other six BH3 mimetics activate the endoplasmic reticulum stress response inducing ATF4, ATF3, and NOXA, which can then bind to and inhibit MCL1. In most cancer cells, inhibition of one antiapoptotic protein does not acutely induce apoptosis. However, by combining two BH3 mimetics, one that inhibits BCL2 and one that induces NOXA, apoptosis is induced within 6 h in a BAX/BAK-dependent manner. Because MCL1 is a major mechanism of resistance to ABT-737, these results suggest a novel strategy to overcome this resistance. Our findings highlight a novel signaling pathway through which many BH3 mimetics inhibit MCL1 and suggest the potential use of these agents as adjuvants in combination with various chemotherapy strategies.","['Albershardt, Tina C', 'Salerni, Bethany L', 'Soderquist, Ryan S', 'Bates, Darcy J P', 'Pletnev, Alexandre A', 'Kisselev, Alexei F', 'Eastman, Alan']","['Albershardt TC', 'Salerni BL', 'Soderquist RS', 'Bates DJ', 'Pletnev AA', 'Kisselev AF', 'Eastman A']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, New Hampshire 03756, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (ATF3 protein, human)', '0 (ATF4 protein, human)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factor 3)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Peptidomimetics)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '145891-90-3 (Activating Transcription Factor 4)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Activating Transcription Factor 4/genetics/metabolism', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/*drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments/*pharmacology', 'Peptidomimetics/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects/genetics', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2011/06/02 06:00,2012/01/25 06:00,['2011/06/02 06:00'],"['2011/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)48651-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.255828 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Jul 15;286(28):24882-95. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.255828.

Here, we show that ectopic expression of miR-17, -20,-93 and -106, all AAAGUGC seed-containing miRNAs, increases proliferation, colony outgrowth and replating capacity of myeloid progenitors and results in enhanced P-ERK levels. We found that these miRNAs are endogenously and abundantly expressed in myeloid progenitors and down-regulated in mature neutrophils. Quantitative proteomics identified sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), an ubiquitin-binding protein and regulator of autophagy-mediated protein degradation, as a major target for these miRNAs in myeloid progenitors. In addition, we found increased expression of Sqstm1 transcripts during CSF3-induced neutrophil differentiation of 32D-CSF3R cells and an inverse correlation of SQSTM1 protein levels and miR-106 expression in AML samples. ShRNA-mediated silencing of Sqstm1 phenocopied the effects of ectopic miR-17/20/93/106 expression in hematopoietic progenitors in vitro and in mice. Further, SQSTM1 binds to the ligand-activated colony-stimulating factor 3 receptor (CSF3R) mainly in the late endosomal compartment, but not in LC3 positive autophagosomes. SQSTM1 regulates CSF3R stability and ligand-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. We demonstrate that AAAGUGC seed-containing miRNAs promote cell expansion, replating capacity and signaling in hematopoietic cells by interference with SQSTM1-regulated pathways.","['Meenhuis, Annemarie', 'van Veelen, Peter A', 'de Looper, Hans', 'van Boxtel, Nicole', 'van den Berge, Iris J', 'Sun, Su M', 'Taskesen, Erdogan', 'Stern, Patrick', 'de Ru, Arnoud H', 'van Adrichem, Arjan J', 'Demmers, Jeroen', 'Jongen-Lavrencic, Mojca', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Touw, Ivo P', 'Sharp, Phillip A', 'Erkeland, Stefan J']","['Meenhuis A', 'van Veelen PA', 'de Looper H', 'van Boxtel N', 'van den Berge IJ', 'Sun SM', 'Taskesen E', 'Stern P', 'de Ru AH', 'van Adrichem AJ', 'Demmers J', 'Jongen-Lavrencic M', 'Lowenberg B', 'Touw IP', 'Sharp PA', 'Erkeland SJ']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (SQSTM1 protein, human)', '0 (Sequestosome-1 Protein)', '0 (Sqstm1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proteomics/methods', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequestosome-1 Protein', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",2011/06/02 06:00,2011/10/15 06:00,['2011/06/02 06:00'],"['2011/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44681-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-02-336487 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jul 28;118(4):916-25. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-02-336487.

Conversely, 10% of miRNA duplexes showed a comparable expression of both strands, whereas the remaining 40% exhibited variable ratios across the examined libraries, as exemplified by miR-223/miR-223* in murine and human cell lines. Functional analyses revealed a regulatory role for miR-223* in myeloid progenitor cells, which implies an active role for both arms of the miR-223 duplex. This was further underscored by the demonstration that miR-223 and miR-223* targeted the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase axis and that high miR-223* levels were associated with increased overall survival in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Thus, we found a supporting role for miR-223* in differentiating myeloid cells in normal and leukemic cell states.

Imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine compound, SGI-1776 inhibits Pim-1, Pim-2 and Pim-3, and was evaluated in AML-cell line, -xenograft model, and -primary blasts. Treatment of AML cells with SGI-1776 results in a concentration-dependent induction of apoptosis and we investigated its effect on Pim kinase functions. Phosphorylation of traditional Pim kinase targets, c-Myc(Ser62) and 4E-BP1 (Thr36/Thr47), were both decreased in actively cycling AML cell lines MV-4-11, MOLM-13 and OCI-AML-3. Levels of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), XIAP, and proapoptotic Bak and Bax were unchanged; however, a significant reduction in Mcl-1 was observed. This was correlated with inhibition of global RNA and protein synthesis and MCL-1 transcript decline after SGI-1776 treatment. These data suggest that SGI-1776 mechanism in AML involves Mcl-1 protein reduction. Consistent with cell line data, xenograft model studies with mice bearing MV-4-11 tumors showed efficacy with SGI-1776. Importantly, SGI-1776 was also cytotoxic in AML primary cells, irrespective of FLT3 mutation status and resulted in Mcl-1 protein decline.

The translocation arises in utero and is necessary but insufficient for the development of leukemia. Single-nucleotide polymorphism array analysis of ETV6-RUNX1 patient samples has identified multiple additional genetic alterations; however, the role of these lesions in leukemogenesis remains undetermined. Moreover, murine models of ETV6-RUNX1 ALL that faithfully recapitulate the human disease are lacking. To identify novel genes that cooperate with ETV6-RUNX1 in leukemogenesis, we generated a mouse model that uses the endogenous Etv6 locus to coexpress the Etv6-RUNX1 fusion and Sleeping Beauty transposase. An insertional mutagenesis screen was performed by intercrossing these mice with those carrying a Sleeping Beauty transposon array. In contrast to previous models, a substantial proportion (20%) of the offspring developed BCP-ALL. Isolation of the transposon insertion sites identified genes known to be associated with BCP-ALL, including Ebf1 and Epor, in addition to other novel candidates. This is the first mouse model of ETV6-RUNX1 to develop BCP-ALL and provides important insight into the cooperating genetic alterations in ETV6-RUNX1 leukemia.","['van der Weyden, Louise', 'Giotopoulos, George', 'Rust, Alistair G', 'Matheson, Louise S', 'van Delft, Frederik W', 'Kong, Jun', 'Corcoran, Anne E', 'Greaves, Mel F', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Huntly, Brian J', 'Adams, David J']","['van der Weyden L', 'Giotopoulos G', 'Rust AG', 'Matheson LS', 'van Delft FW', 'Kong J', 'Corcoran AE', 'Greaves MF', 'Mullighan CG', 'Huntly BJ', 'Adams DJ']","['Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge, UK. lvdw@sanger.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Transposases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Separation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transposases/genetics']",2011/06/02 06:00,2011/10/15 06:00,['2011/06/02 06:00'],"['2011/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44695-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-02-338848 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jul 28;118(4):1041-51. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-02-338848.

Our analysis included polymerase chain reaction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction procedures for detection of viral nucleic acids and assays for detection of infectious virus and virus-specific antibodies. We found no evidence of XMRV or other MLVs in these blood samples. In addition, we found that these gammaretroviruses were strongly (X-MLV) or partially (XMRV) susceptible to inactivation by sera from CFS patients and healthy controls, which suggested that establishment of a successful MLV infection in humans would be unlikely. Consistent with previous reports, we detected MLV sequences in commercial laboratory reagents.

We hypothesized that an understanding of when and how XMRV first arose might help explain the discrepant results. We studied human prostate cancer cell lines CWR22Rv1 and CWR-R1, which produce XMRV virtually identical to the viruses recently found in patient samples, as well as their progenitor human prostate tumor xenograft (CWR22) that had been passaged in mice. We detected XMRV infection in the two cell lines and in the later passage xenografts, but not in the early passages. In particular, we found that the host mice contained two proviruses, PreXMRV-1 and PreXMRV-2, which share 99.92% identity with XMRV over >3.2-kilobase stretches of their genomes. We conclude that XMRV was not present in the original CWR22 tumor but was generated by recombination of two proviruses during tumor passaging in mice. The probability that an identical recombinant was generated independently is negligible (~10(-12)); our results suggest that the association of XMRV with human disease is due to contamination of human samples with virus originating from this recombination event.","['Paprotka, Tobias', 'Delviks-Frankenberry, Krista A', 'Cingoz, Oya', 'Martinez, Anthony', 'Kung, Hsing-Jien', 'Tepper, Clifford G', 'Hu, Wei-Shau', 'Fivash, Matthew J Jr', 'Coffin, John M', 'Pathak, Vinay K']","['Paprotka T', 'Delviks-Frankenberry KA', 'Cingoz O', 'Martinez A', 'Kung HJ', 'Tepper CG', 'Hu WS', 'Fivash MJ Jr', 'Coffin JM', 'Pathak VK']","['Viral Mutation Section, HIV Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor/*virology', 'DNA Contamination', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/genetics', 'Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic/virology', 'Gammaretrovirus/*genetics', 'Genes, env', 'Genes, gag', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*virology', 'Proviruses/genetics/isolation & purification', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/*genetics/*isolation & purification']",2011/06/02 06:00,2011/07/13 06:00,['2011/06/02 06:00'],"['2011/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [medline]']","['science.1205292 [pii]', '10.1126/science.1205292 [doi]']",ppublish,Science. 2011 Jul 1;333(6038):97-101. doi: 10.1126/science.1205292.

Due to the lack of any nationwide leukemia screening program, the majority of the people are not aware of the disease. Epidemiological study can play a vital role in understanding the occurrence and outcome of the disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Focusing on variables like age, sex, race, blood group and lifestyle habits, detailed reports of 417 males and 230 females (M:F ratio 1.8:1) were collected from different hospitals of North Karnataka and analyzed for their risk of leukemia. RESULTS: Compared to female patients, Hindu males were found to have greater risk of occurrence of leukemia (p=0.0333). The males of scheduled caste (SC) and Lingayat communities showed a high risk than other communities (p=0.000). The occurrence of AML showed a significant relationship with ABO blood groups (p=0.0090). The frequency of leukemia is quite high in Belgaum district when compared to others districts of North Karnataka and totally absent in Bidar district. The reasons need precise molecular and genetical studies of the population. CONCLUSIONS: The localized communities of Lingayat and SCs needs to be further studied to get a better understanding of the higher risk of occurrence of leukemia in males. Moreover, since the spectrum of cancer epidemiology seen in India is different from that in developed countries more emphasis should be placed on better development of regional and national registries.","['Modak, Harendra', 'Kulkarni, Suyamindra S', 'Kadakol, G S', 'Hiremath, S V', 'Patil, B R', 'Hallikeri, Umesh', 'Gai, Pramod B']","['Modak H', 'Kulkarni SS', 'Kadakol GS', 'Hiremath SV', 'Patil BR', 'Hallikeri U', 'Gai PB']","['Research Center for DNA Diagnostics, Department of Applied Genetics, Karnatak University, Karnataka, India. pramodbgai@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Medical Records', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",2011/06/02 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/06/02 06:00'],"['2011/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2011;12(3):671-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aims of this study were to identify the mechanism of cell death of human leukemic HL-60 and U937 cells induced by 4'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (4'-HCA) isolated from A. galanga. 4'-HCA was cytotoxic to both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.05) as demonstrated by MTT assay. Apoptosis induced by 4'-HCA was demonstrated by a variety of methods: visualization of propidium iodide (PI)-stained cells under fluorescence microscope, detection of subdiploid cells by PI-staining and flow cytometry, and assay of active caspase-3 using a specific fluorogenic substrate. 4'-HCA-treated cells (10 and 50 mug/ml for 4 h) showed significant increase in reactive oxygen species production and decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential as detected by dichlorohydrofluorescein diacetate and 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide respectively, together with flow cytometry. The apoptotic death involved cytochrome c release, increase in Bax level and concomitant decreases in levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (using Western blotting), and elevation in cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca(2)(+) contents (using compartment-specific fluorescent Ca2+ dyes). These results indicate that 4'-HCA induces apoptosis of human leukemic cell through a combination of mitochondrial and ER stress pathways.","['Banjerdpongchai, Ratana', 'Punyati, Pimpinun', 'Nakrob, Aree', 'Pompimon, Wilart', 'Kongtawelert, Prachya']","['Banjerdpongchai R', 'Punyati P', 'Nakrob A', 'Pompimon W', 'Kongtawelert P']","['Thailand Excellence Center for Tissue Engineering, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Thailand. ratana.b@cmu.ac.th']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Cinnamates)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (p-hydroxycinnamaldehyde)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Alpinia/*chemistry', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cinnamates/*pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2011/06/02 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/06/02 06:00'],"['2011/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2011;12(3):593-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this paper was to highlight the importance of preventive measures in maintaining oral health, as well the measures for controlling oral disorders onset during the course of illness and applied therapy in children with acute leukaemia. All preventive measures that include proper, regular hygiene and intervention depend on the patient's haematological status and general health condition, and are performed with the consultation and approval of the haematologists-in-charge. The preventive program can be implicated in three stages; before the beginning of cytotoxic therapy, during active cytotoxic therapy and after cytotoxic therapy. Having in mind that oral disease can influence general treatment in children with acute leukaemia dramatically, developing protocols on the implementation of all measures of oral prevention and treatment is mandatory.","['Ivanovic, Mirjana', 'Jovcic, Olivera', 'Mandic, Jelena', 'Bogetic, Dusko', 'Maddalone, Marcello']","['Ivanovic M', 'Jovcic O', 'Mandic J', 'Bogetic D', 'Maddalone M']",,['srp'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Serbia,Srp Arh Celok Lek,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,0027440,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Mouth Diseases/etiology/*prevention & control']",2011/06/02 06:00,2011/06/23 06:00,['2011/06/02 06:00'],"['2011/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2298/sarh1104242i [doi]'],ppublish,Srp Arh Celok Lek. 2011 Mar-Apr;139(3-4):242-7. doi: 10.2298/sarh1104242i.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of her physical and hematologic abnormalities, she was tested for Fanconi anemia (FA). Lymphocytes and fibroblasts from this patient demonstrated increased chromosome breakage with exposure to the clastogen mitomycin C, but not, in contrast to most FA patients, to diepoxybutane. Further testing by Western analysis and complementation testing did not show a defect in the function of known Fanconi proteins. Her constitutional deletion was later found to span 13.2 Mb by chromosome microarray analysis, encompassing the RUNX1 gene that has been implicated in thrombocytopenia and predisposition to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) when in the haploinsufficient state. We compare her phenotype to other individuals with similar 21q deletions and thrombocytopenia, as well as those with FA. We suggest that deletion of RUNX1 or another critical gene within the deleted region may result in chromosomal instability similar to that seen in FA.","['Click, Eleanor S', 'Cox, Barbara', 'Olson, Susan B', 'Grompe, Markus', 'Akkari, Yassmine', 'Moreau, Lisa A', 'Shimamura, Akiko', 'Sternen, Darci L', 'Liu, Yajuan J', 'Leppig, Kathleen A', 'Matthews, Dana C', 'Parisi, Melissa A']","['Click ES', 'Cox B', 'Olson SB', 'Grompe M', 'Akkari Y', 'Moreau LA', 'Shimamura A', 'Sternen DL', 'Liu YJ', 'Leppig KA', 'Matthews DC', 'Parisi MA']","[""Seattle Children's Hospital, Washington, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Med Genet A,American journal of medical genetics.

Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), one of the important compounds in cruciferous vegetables, has been shown to induce apoptosis in many types of human cancer cell lines, but there is no available information addressing the effects on normal and leukemia mice in vivo. The purpose of this study is to focus on the in vivo effects of PEITC on immune responses of normal and WEHI-3 leukemia BALB/c mice in vivo. Influences of PEITC on BALB/c mice after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection with WEHI-3 cells and normal mice were investigated. In normal BALB/c mice, PEITC did not affect the body weight when compared to the olive oil treated animals. Moreover, PEITC promoted phagocytosis by macrophages from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and peritoneal cavity, increased the levels of CD11b and Mac-3, decreased the level of CD19 and promoted natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxic activity, but it did not alter the level of CD3. Also, PEITC enhanced T cell proliferation after concanavalin A (Con A) stimulation. Otherwise, PEITC increased the body weight, but decreased the weight of liver and spleen as compared to the olive oil-treated WEHI-3 leukemia mice. PEITC also increased the level of CD19, decreased the levels of CD3 and Mac-3 rather than influence in the level of CD11b, suggesting that the differentiation of the precursor of macrophages and T cells was inhibited, but the differentiation of the precursor of B cells was promoted in leukemia mice. Furthermore, PEITC enhanced phagocytosis by monocytes and macrophages from PBMC and peritoneal cavity, and also promoted the NK cell cytotoxic activity in comparison with the group of leukemia mice. Based on these observations, the biological properties of PEITC can promote immune responses in normal and WEHI-3 leukemia mice in vivo. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Subjective interpretation contexts develop in the course of illness. The study focuses on the ideal-typical gestalt of these contents. METHODS: In a follow-up study on coping, 12 patients with acute leukaemia (AL) were interviewed using a semistructured interview at the end of initial inpatient treatment. Using qualitative methodology, we inductively developed categories and assigned them to formal main categories. RESULTS: The following categories were developed: causal uncertainty as burden; discrepancy between subjective and objective assessment of degree of threat; knowledge of disease: conflict between information-seeking and information-avoiding behavior; dominance of medical approach to treatment; pursuit of normality; defense of emotions; orientation to workflows on the ward; adjustment as a coping strategy; positive attitude as a resource; life between hope and fear; limited future; latent fear of death. CONCLUSION: Themes of coping with the disease become visible. Some of these contents are tacit and latent, although of high subjective relevance to the patient. Their consideration could improve the patient-physician relationship.","['Koehler, Katharina', 'Dogan, Elif', 'Koehler, Michael', 'Heine, Viktoria', 'Frommer, Jorg']","['Koehler K', 'Dogan E', 'Koehler M', 'Heine V', 'Frommer J']","['Klinik fur Psychosomatische Medizin und Psychotherapie, Medizinische Fakultat der Otto-von-Guericke-Universitat Magdeburg. katharina.koehler@med.ovgu.de']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Z Psychosom Med Psychother,Zeitschrift fur Psychosomatische Medizin und Psychotherapie,100886617,,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Attitude to Death', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Helplessness, Learned', 'Humans', 'Interview, Psychological', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Motivation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*psychology', 'Prognosis', 'Quality of Life/psychology', '*Sick Role', 'Young Adult']",2011/06/01 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2011/06/01 06:00'],"['2011/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.13109/zptm.2011.57.2.141 [doi]'],ppublish,Z Psychosom Med Psychother. 2011;57(2):141-56. doi: 10.13109/zptm.2011.57.2.141.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Das Uberleben der initialen Phase: Subjektive Krankheitsvorstellungen von Patienten mit akuter Leukamie zum Ende der stationaren Erstbehandlung.,,,

Of the cats from urban and rural areas, 10.4% (5/48) and 27.2% (6/22) were positive for T. gondii, respectively. Breed, age, food, and contact with animals of other species were significant for considering the positivity for T. gondii (P </= 0.0001). Cats having access to streets (17.1%, 11/64), cats cohabiting with rats (19.6%, 10/51), and cats feeding on homemade food and raw milk (27.2%, 6/22) were positive for T. gondii.

These results seem to confirm the diagnostic and prognostic significance of these parameters determined in routine laboratory tests in B-CLL patients.","['Rusak, Malgorzata', 'Osada, Joanna', 'Pawlus, Joanna', 'Chociej-Stypulkowska, Joanna', 'Dabrowska, Milena', 'Kloczko, Janusz']","['Rusak M', 'Osada J', 'Pawlus J', 'Chociej-Stypulkowska J', 'Dabrowska M', 'Kloczko J']","['Department of Hematological Diagnostics, Medical University of Bialystok, Waszyngtona 15a, 15-276, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Hematological Diagnostics, Medical University of Bialystok, Waszyngtona 15a, 15-276, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Hematological Diagnostics, Medical University of Bialystok, Waszyngtona 15a, 15-276, Bialystok, Poland. joanna.pawlus@interia.pl.', 'Department of Hematological Diagnostics, Medical University of Bialystok, Waszyngtona 15a, 15-276, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Hematological Diagnostics, Medical University of Bialystok, Waszyngtona 15a, 15-276, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital in Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/genetics', '*Diagnostic Tests, Routine/standards', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematologic Tests', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics/metabolism']",2011/06/01 06:00,2011/10/20 06:00,['2011/06/01 06:00'],"['2010/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-011-0862-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-011-0862-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2011 Jun;93(6):736-744. doi: 10.1007/s12185-011-0862-3.

Elucidating the mechanisms of drug resistance should thus lead to novel therapeutic strategies. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 signaling induces the assembly of a multi-protein complex that provides tumor cells with the molecular machinery necessary for drug resistance. This complex, which involves protein kinase C (PKC) epsilon, v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (B-RAF) and p70 S6 kinase beta (S6K2), enhances the selective translation of anti-apoptotic proteins such as B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) and inhibitors of apoptosis protein (IAP) family members and these are able to protect multiple cancer cell types from chemotherapy-induced cell death. The Janus kinases (JAKs) are most noted for their critical roles in mediating cytokine signaling and immune responses. Here, we show that JAKs have novel functions that support their consideration as new targets in therapies aimed at reducing drug resistance. As an example, we show that the Janus kinase TYK2 is phosphorylated downstream of FGF-2 signaling and required for the full phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. Moreover, TYK2 is necessary for the induction of key anti-apoptotic proteins, such as BCL-2 and myeloid cell leukemia sequence (MCL) 1, and for the promotion of cell survival upon FGF-2. Silencing JAK1, JAK2 or TYK2 using RNA interference (RNAi) inhibits FGF2-mediated proliferation and results in the sensitization of tumor cells to chemotherapy-induced killing. These effects are independent of activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1, STAT3 and STAT5A/B, the normal targets of JAK signaling. Instead, TYK2 associates with the other kinases previously implicated in FGF-2-mediated drug resistance. In light of these findings we hypothesize that TYK2 and other JAKs are important modulators of FGF-2-driven cell survival and that inhibitors of these kinases will likely improve the effectiveness of other cancer therapies.","['Carmo, Catarina R', 'Lyons-Lewis, Janet', 'Seckl, Michael J', 'Costa-Pereira, Ana P']","['Carmo CR', 'Lyons-Lewis J', 'Seckl MJ', 'Costa-Pereira AP']","['Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5A protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 Kinase)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bone Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Janus Kinases/*metabolism', 'Osteosarcoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'TYK2 Kinase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2011/06/01 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/01 06:00'],"['2011/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0019861 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-02754 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(5):e19861. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0019861.

A first-in-human dose study was designed to investigate a safe and biologically effective dose range for LY2457546, a novel multikinase inhibitor, in patients with relapsed AML. METHODS: In this nonrandomized, open-label, dose escalation Phase I study, LY2457546 was administered orally once a day. Safety, pharmacokinetics, changes in phosphorylation of target kinases in AML blasts, and risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI) were assessed. RESULTS: Five patients were treated at the starting and predicted minimal biologically effective dose of 50 mg/day. The most commonly observed adverse events were febrile neutropenia, epistaxis, petechiae, and headache. The majority of adverse events (81%) were Grade 1 or 2. One patient had generalized muscle weakness (Grade 3), which was deemed to be a dose-limiting toxicity. Notably, the pharmacokinetic profile of LY2457546 showed virtually no elimination of LY2457546 within 24 hours, and thus prevented further dose escalation. No significant DDI were observed. Ex vivo flow cytometry studies showed downregulation of the phosphoproteins, pcKIT, pFLT3, and pS6, in AML blasts after LY2457546 administration. No medically relevant responses were observed in the five treated patients. CONCLUSION: No biologically effective dose could be established for LY2457546 in chemotherapy-resistant AML patients. Lack of drug clearance prevented safe dose escalation, and the study was terminated early. Future efforts should be made to develop derivatives with a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile.","['Wacheck, Volker', 'Lahn, Michael', 'Dickinson, Gemma', 'Fureder, Wolfgang', 'Meyer, Renata', 'Herndlhofer, Susanne', 'Fureder, Thorsten', 'Dorfner, Georg', 'Pillay, Sada', 'Andre, Valerie', 'Burkholder, Timothy P', 'Akunda, Jacqueline K', 'Flye-Blakemore, Leann', 'Van Bockstaele, Dirk', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Valent, Peter']","['Wacheck V', 'Lahn M', 'Dickinson G', 'Fureder W', 'Meyer R', 'Herndlhofer S', 'Fureder T', 'Dorfner G', 'Pillay S', 'Andre V', 'Burkholder TP', 'Akunda JK', 'Flye-Blakemore L', 'Van Bockstaele D', 'Schlenk RF', 'Sperr WR', 'Valent P']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna, Wahringer Gurtel, Vienna, Austria;']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,2011/06/01 06:00,2011/06/01 06:01,['2011/06/01 06:00'],"['2011/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMR.S19341 [doi]', 'cmr-3-157 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2011;3:157-75. doi: 10.2147/CMR.S19341.

In normal cells, epigenetics modulates gene expression through all development steps. When ""imprinted"" early by the environment, epigenetic changes influence the organism at an early stage and can be transmitted to the progeny. Together with DNA sequence alterations, DNA aberrant cytosine methylation and microRNA deregulation, epigenetic modifications participate in the malignant transformation of cells. Their reversible nature has led to the emergence of the promising field of epigenetic therapy. The efforts made to inhibit in particular the epigenetic enzyme family called histone deacetylases (HDACs) are described. HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) have been proposed as a viable clinical therapeutic approach for the treatment of leukemia and solid tumors, but also to a lesser degree for noncancerous diseases. Three epigenetic drugs are already arriving at the patient's bedside, and more than 100 clinical assays for HDACi are registered on the National Cancer Institute website. They explore the eventual additive benefits of combined therapies. In the context of the pleiotropic effects of HDAC isoforms, more specific HDACi and more informative screening tests are being developed for the benefit of the patients.","['Martinet, Nadine', 'Bertrand, Philippe']","['Martinet N', 'Bertrand P']","['Laboratory of Bioactive Molecules, Institute of Chemistry, University of Nice - Sophia Antipolis, Parc Valrose, Nice, France;']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,2011/06/01 06:00,2011/06/01 06:01,['2011/06/01 06:00'],"['2011/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMR.S9661 [doi]', 'cmr-3-117 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2011;3:117-41. doi: 10.2147/CMR.S9661.

Activation of NOTCH1 requires a double proteolytic processing in the extracellular region of the receptor (S2) and in the transmembrane domain (S3). Currently, anti-NOTCH1 therapies based on the inhibition of S3 processing via small molecule gamma-secretase inhibitors are in development. Here we report on the characterization of the protease system responsible for S2 processing of NOTCH1 in T-ALL. Analysis of NOTCH1 heterodimerization (HD) class I, NOTCH1 HD class II and NOTCH1 JME alleles characterized by increased and aberrant S2 processing shows that both ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10), a metalloprotease previously implicated in activation of wild-type NOTCH1 in mammalian cells, and ADAM17, a closely related protease capable of processing NOTCH1 in vitro, contribute to the activation of oncogenic forms of NOTCH1. However, and despite this apparent functional redundancy, inhibition of ADAM10 is sufficient to blunt NOTCH1 signaling in T-ALL lymphoblasts. These results provide further insight on the mechanisms that control the activation of oncogenic NOTCH1 mutants and identify ADAM10 as potential therapeutic target for the inhibition of oncogenic NOTCH1 in T-ALL.","['Sulis, M L', 'Saftig, P', 'Ferrando, A A']","['Sulis ML', 'Saftig P', 'Ferrando AA']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.81 (ADAM10 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.81 (ADAM10 protein, human)']",IM,"['ADAM Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'ADAM10 Protein', 'Alleles', 'Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Dimerization', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', '*Oncogenes', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, Notch1/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",2011/06/01 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/01 06:00'],"['2011/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['leu2011130 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.130 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Oct;25(10):1564-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.130.

Studies have suggested a connection between TGF-beta signaling and IRFs. Thus, we investigated the effect of ICSBP on transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling in HL-60, an acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line. Stable expression of ICSBP in HL-60 cells resulted in strong induction of TGF-beta receptor expression and activation of non-Smad as well as Smad pathways. ICSBP expression also augmented cell growth. ICSBP knockdown with small interfering RNA (siRNA) attenuated cell growth and decreased TGF-beta receptor I (TGF-betaRI) expression. In addition, reduction of TGF-betaRI using siRNA or pharmacological inhibitor reduced growth of ICSBP-expressing cells. ICSBP expression also led to increased phosphorylation and activation of Akt and p38 MAPK. However, p38 MAPK, but not PI3K-Akt, inhibition abrogated ICSBP-mediated proliferation. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of either ICSBP or TGF-betaRI resulted in decreased p38 activation. Intriguingly, TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK-1), which phosphorylates p38, was activated in ICSBP-expressing cells and its activity was reduced by TGF-betaRI inhibition. Finally, siRNA knockdown of ICSBP or TGF-betaRI reduced TAK-1 phosphorylation. This study identifies a novel role for ICSBP in regulating cell growth via TGF-beta receptor upregulation and subsequent activation of the TGF-beta receptor/TAK-1/p38 pathway.","['Sung, Jee Young', 'Kim, Heejung', 'Kim, Yong-Nyun', 'Na, Yoon Sook', 'Park, Byung-Kiu']","['Sung JY', 'Kim H', 'Kim YN', 'Na YS', 'Park BK']","['Pediatric Oncology Branch, National Cancer Center, Gyeonggi-do, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2011/06/01 06:00,2011/10/19 06:00,['2011/06/01 06:00'],"['2011/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['labinvest201190 [pii]', '10.1038/labinvest.2011.90 [doi]']",ppublish,Lab Invest. 2011 Sep;91(9):1304-13. doi: 10.1038/labinvest.2011.90.

Although for several years IgE binding to FcepsilonRI was considered to be a passive sensitization process, the outcomes of several recent studies have revealed a variety of different cellular responses to IgE binding compared to IgE plus Antigen binding. The present study applied a functional proteomics-based approach to investigate mast cell signaling events and provided new insights to FcepsilonRI-mediated cell signaling in RBL-2H3.1 cells, and may point to the activation of alternative signaling pathways in response to IgE or IgE plus Ag. Comparative analysis by 2-D PAGE of RBL cells activated with IgE plus Ag for three and four hours compared to non-activated cells was followed by mass spectrometric protein identification and provided evidence for the induction of Stathmin 1 (STMN1) gene expression in response to IgE plus Ag activation.Complementary SDS-PAGE analysis showed a distinct up-regulation of STMN1 induction in response to challenge with IgE plus Ag compared to sensitization with IgE only. Phosphoproteomics analysis gave evidence for significant increase at phosphorylation of STMN1 on ser16 after 1min, though a slight rise at 5 min, and on ser38 after 1 and 5min sensitization with IgE and a similar result was observed for 1min IgE plus Ag-activation. IgE plus Ag-activation was also found to induce the phosphorylation of ser38 to a greater extent than sensitization with IgE. In contrast, IgE alone was more effective than IgE plus Ag at inducing phosphorylation of ser16. Collectively this study provides further insights into the role of stathmin 1 in FcRI-mediated activation of cells of mast cell lineage and might shed light on the diverse response of these cells to IgE or IgE plus Ag.","['Sadroddiny, Esmaeil', 'Moir, Arthur J G', 'A Helm, Birgit']","['Sadroddiny E', 'Moir AJ', 'A Helm B']","['Department of Tissue Engineering, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

In this study, we investigated whether leukemia-associated fusion proteins, which differ in their ability to activate Hox expression, could initiate leukemia in the absence of Bmi1. AML1-ETO and PLZF-RARalpha, which do not activate Hox, triggered senescence in Bmi1(-/-) cells. In contrast, MLL-AF9, which drives expression of Hoxa7 and Hoxa9, readily transformed Bmi1(-/-) cells. MLL-AF9 could not initiate leukemia in Bmi1(-/-)Hoxa9(-/-) mice, which have further compromised HSC functions. But either gene could restore the ability of MLL-AF9 to establish LSCs in the double null background.

Successful treatment is based on the selective advantage conferred on T-cell precursors through their expression of the therapeutic transgene. However, ""first-generation"" retroviral vectors also caused leukemia in some patients with X-linked SCID because of the constructs' tendency to insert into active genes (eg, proto-oncogenes) in progenitor cells and transactivate an oncogene through a viral element in the long terminal repeat. These elements have been deleted from the vectors now in use. Together with the use of lentiviral vectors (which are more potent for transducing stem cells), these advances should provide a basis for the safe and effective extension of gene therapy's indications in the field of primary immunodeficiencies.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage CSF are standard agents approved for peripheral blood stem cell mobilization since the early 1990s. Between 5% and 20% of patients, however, fail to mobilize a sufficient numbers of peripheral blood stem cells in response to G-CSF with or without chemotherapy. Recent advances in defining the basic mechanisms regulating the interactions between hematopoietic stem cells and their marrow niche had led to the discovery that CXCR4 and stromal-cell-derived factor 1alpha axis play a significant role. Plerixafor, an antagonist of the CXCR4-stromal-cell-derived factor 1alpha axis has been shown to result in a significant mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated that the combination of G-CSF and AMD3100 (G+A) resulted in a significant increase in CD34(+) cell yield as compared to the administration of G-CSF alone. In particular, the progenitors mobilized have been shown to comprise a significantly higher proportion of primitive and possibly more potent CD34(+)/CD38(-) subpopulation. Transplantation of PBSC mobilized by G+A administration have led to a rapid and sustained neutrophil and platelet engraftment. Another prospective role of this new class of agents might lie in the mobilization of dormant leukemia stem cells that are well protected by the niche. The future role of CXCR4 antagonists in treatment of hematologic malignancies includes mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation and mobilization of leukemia-initiating cells for long-term cure.","['Mohty, Mohamad', 'Ho, Anthony D']","['Mohty M', 'Ho AD']","['Centre Hospitalier et Universitaire (CHU) de Nantes, Hematologie Clinique, Nantes, France. mohamad.mohty@univ-nantes.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Cyclams)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'S915P5499N (plerixafor)']",IM,"['Benzylamines', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Cyclams', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Niche/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism']",2011/06/01 06:00,2011/10/04 06:00,['2011/06/01 06:00'],"['2011/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(11)00226-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2011.05.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2011 Jul;39(7):723-9. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2011.05.004.

However, little is known about the influence of modern targeted therapy on chronic myeloid leukemia-associated platelet disorders.

For patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, developing such a lesion may indicate impending leukemic transition. These patients are also often immunocompromised, putting them at risk for infection by opportunistic fungal pathogens such as Fusarium. We describe an 85-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome who presented with a reddish-purple nodule with a surrounding erythematous plaque on his shin. Histopathologic examination revealed a dense diffuse infiltrate of large atypical cells in the reticular dermis, with ulceration and necrosis. Immunohistochemical studies showed positive staining with CD15, CD68 and myeloperoxidase of constituent large cells. Concurrently, there were branching and septate hyphae with occasional macroconidia-like structures throughout the infiltrate. Cultures from this lesion grew Fusarium and Enterococcus, supporting the diagnosis: leukemia cutis with superinfection involving both Fusarium and Enterococcus. To our knowledge, this is a novel report of two separate infections occurring in a lesion of leukemia cutis.

Expansion of myeloid blasts with suppression of normal haematopoiesis is the hallmark of AML, whereas MPN is associated with over-proliferation of one or more lineages that retain the capacity to differentiate, and MDS is characterized by cytopenias and aberrant differentiation. MPD and MDS can progress to AML, which is likely due to the acquisition of cooperative mutations. Juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML) is an aggressive myeloid neoplasm of childhood that is clinically characterized by overproduction of monocytic cells that can infiltrate organs, including the spleen, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and lung. JMML is categorized as an overlap MPN/MDS by the World Health Organization and also shares some clinical and molecular features with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, a similar disease in adults.

This review outlines our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of JMML with a recent update on the discovery of novel CBL mutations, as well as a brief review on current therapeutic approaches.","['Loh, Mignon L']",['Loh ML'],"['Department of Pediatrics and the Helen Diller Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. lohm@peds.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Child', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Genes, ras', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/*genetics/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary/genetics', 'Prognosis']",2011/06/01 06:00,2011/08/19 06:00,['2011/06/01 06:00'],"['2011/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08525.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Mar;152(6):677-87. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08525.x.,,,,,,['(c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. Setting. Antenatal clinics of two major public maternity units in Hong Kong. POPULATION: Pregnant women. METHODS: Self-administered questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The survey explored knowledge about the use of self-stored umbilical cord blood (UCB) stem cells and attitude towards CCBB. RESULTS: Of the 2,000 women recruited, 1 866 (93.3%) completed the questionnaire. The majority (78.2%) had no idea that there was the chance of using self-stored stem cells. Moreover, most of the respondents were unclear about which diseases other than leukemia are amenable to treatment with UCB stem cells in general. Only 20.3% of women knew that stem cells are available from the Red Cross in case their children need hematopoietic cell transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study revealed inadequate knowledge on UCB stem cell banking and its applications among most of our pregnant women. The government and clinicians should combine efforts to provide accurate information on utilization of UCB stem cells during antenatal care.","['Suen, Stephen Sik Hung', 'Lao, Terence T', 'Chan, Oi Ka', 'Kou, Thomas Kam On', 'Chan, Sammy Chung Sum', 'Kim, Jean Hee', 'Lau, Tze Kin', 'Leung, Tak Yeung']","['Suen SS', 'Lao TT', 'Chan OK', 'Kou TK', 'Chan SC', 'Kim JH', 'Lau TK', 'Leung TY']","['Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, Hong Kong, PRC. shsuen@cuhk.edu.hk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand,Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,0370343,,IM,"['*Blood Banks', '*Comprehension', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data Collection', 'Female', '*Fetal Blood', 'Hong Kong', 'Humans', '*Knowledge', 'Pregnancy', '*Pregnant Women', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2011/06/01 06:00,2011/11/11 06:00,['2011/06/01 06:00'],"['2011/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0412.2011.01201.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand. 2011 Sep;90(9):1005-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0412.2011.01201.x.

The major challenge, in this regard, is to develop a formulation, which can prevent photodegradation of the actives, thus allowing a significant amount to be deposited at the site. In recent decades, liposomal formulations have been extensively employed to overcome the barrier properties of the skin and photodegradation of actives. In the present study, chitosan-reduced gold nanoparticles were investigated for its potential as a carrier to prepare liposomes by a spray-drying method. Liposomes so obtained were characterized for phospholipid recovery, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy, particle size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, and deposition of drug and gold nanoparticles in the rat skin. Further, a liposomal gel formulation was prepared using Carbopol(R) 980 NF (Noveon Systems, Kochi, India) and evaluated for drug deposition in the skin. Antioxidant activity of vitamin C encapsulated in gold liposomes was determined on a human leukemia (HL-60) cell line. The use of gold nanoparticles as a carrier showed improved phospholipid recovery and thus overcomes the liposome scalability problem. DRIFT spectra confirmed the presence of phospholipid in the formulation. Liposomal gel showed improved drug deposition, as compared to control and marketed preparations. A more interesting contribution of the chitosan-reduced gold nanoparticles was an enhanced antioxidant activity seen in case of the vitamin C-loaded gold liposomal formulation. Liposomal formulation was found to be stable for 3 months at 30 degrees C and 65% relative humidity.","['Padamwar, Mahesh N', 'Patole, Milind S', 'Pokharkar, Varsha B']","['Padamwar MN', 'Patole MS', 'Pokharkar VB']","['Department of Pharmaceutics, Bharati Vidyapeeth University, Poona College of Pharmacy, Erandwane, Pune, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Liposome Res,Journal of liposome research,9001952,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)', '9012-76-4 (Chitosan)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Administration, Topical', 'Animals', 'Ascorbic Acid/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Chitosan/*chemistry', 'Drug Carriers/chemistry', 'Gold/*chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liposomes/*administration & dosage/*chemistry', 'Metal Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Particle Size', 'Rats']",2011/06/01 06:00,2012/03/20 06:00,['2011/06/01 06:00'],"['2011/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08982104.2011.575380 [doi]'],ppublish,J Liposome Res. 2011 Dec;21(4):324-32. doi: 10.3109/08982104.2011.575380.

The pathophysiology of thrombosis in patients with MPN is complex. Traditionally, abnormalities of platelet number and function have been claimed as the main players, but increased dynamic interactions between platelets, leukocytes, and the endothelium do probably represent a fundamental interplay in generating a thrombophilic state. In addition, endothelial dysfunction, a well-known risk factor for vascular disease, may play a role in the thrombotic risk of patients with PV and ET. The identification of plasma markers translating the hemostatic imbalance in patients with PV and ET would be extremely helpful in order to define the subgroup of patients with a significant clinical risk of thrombosis.","['Vianello, Fabrizio', 'Battisti, Anna', 'Cella, Giuseppe', 'Marchetti, Marina', 'Falanga, Anna']","['Vianello F', 'Battisti A', 'Cella G', 'Marchetti M', 'Falanga A']","['Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Padova University School of Medicine, Padova, Italy. fabrizio.vianello@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,ScientificWorldJournal,TheScientificWorldJournal,101131163,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Selectins)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/blood', 'Blood Platelets/physiology', 'Endothelium/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukocytes/physiology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*complications/epidemiology', 'Nitric Oxide/physiology', 'Polycythemia Vera/complications/epidemiology/pathology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Selectins/physiology', 'Thrombocytosis/complications/epidemiology/pathology', 'Thrombosis/*complications/epidemiology/pathology']",2011/05/31 06:00,2012/01/13 06:00,['2011/05/31 06:00'],"['2011/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1100/tsw.2011.108 [doi]'],epublish,ScientificWorldJournal. 2011 May 26;11:1131-7. doi: 10.1100/tsw.2011.108.,20110526,PMC5720029,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various studies have reported the trends of fungal infections in autopsies. Because of limitations in antemortem clinical diagnosis owing to lack of sensitive diagnostic tools, information regarding frequency and pathogenesis of fungal infections is largely dependent on autopsy studies. AIM: To study the prevalence of fungal infections at autopsy spanning a period of 20 years and to document recent trends, prevalence of various fungi over decades along with underlying predisposing factors and pathological findings. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Retrospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All autopsies between 1988 and 2007 were reviewed and all cases showing fungal infections were analyzed. The clinical details and demographic data were retrieved from medical records. Representative sections from all organs were stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain and special stains including Gomori's silver methenamine (GMS) and periodic acid Schiff (PAS). Culture details were noted, wherever available. RESULTS: A total of 401 autopsies were performed during the study period. Fungal infections were identified in 35 (8.7%) of these cases. Leukemia was the commonest risk factor. The commonest pathogen in the present study was Aspergillus sp. The commonest single organ involved was brain (n = 18). Culture positivity was seen in 23.8% cases. CONCLUSION: The study highlights various predisposing factors and organisms in autopsy series. Existing diagnostic modalities are not sensitive to ensure antemortem diagnosis of fungal infections.","['Uppin, Megha S', 'Anuradha, S V N', 'Uppin, Shantveer G', 'Paul, Tara Roshni', 'Prayaga, Aruna K', 'Sundaram, C']","['Uppin MS', 'Anuradha SV', 'Uppin SG', 'Paul TR', 'Prayaga AK', 'Sundaram C']","[""Department of Pathology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,7605904,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Autopsy', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fungi/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*diagnosis/microbiology/*mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2011/05/31 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2011/05/31 06:00'],"['2011/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJPatholMicrobiol_2011_54_2_344_81634 [pii]', '10.4103/0377-4929.81634 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Pathol Microbiol. 2011 Apr-Jun;54(2):344-9. doi: 10.4103/0377-4929.81634.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is known to present with highly variable morphological features and may mimic with other lymphoid neoplasms. Multicolor flow cytometry (MFC) with availability of newer markers is highly useful in the diagnosis of the plasma cell leukemia. We present an immunophenotypic profile in ten cases of PCL along with their clinical and laboratory findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied immunophenotypic profile of 10 cases of plasma cell leukemia (out of 4615 cases of hematolymphoid neoplasms) using five parameter, three color flow cytometric analysis. We also studied their clinical presentation and other laboratory findings. RESULTS: Common clinical features at presentation were weakness, bone pain, anemia, thrombocytopenia and osteolytic lesions. Plasma cell population was identified on strong expression of CD38 and co-expression of CD38 and CD138. CD56 was expressed in 44% cases. CD19 and CD20 were negative in all cases. Surface light chain restriction was seen in 50% cases and in remaining 50% cases revealed cytoplasmic light chain restriction. CD117 was expressed in one out of two cases studied. CONCLUSIONS: MFC immunophenotyping is highly useful to differentiate Plasma cell leukemia from other chronic lymphoproliferative disorders with plasmacytoid morphology as well as from non-neoplastic reactive PC and co-expression of CD38 and CD138 is a best combination to identify the plasma cells by MFC.","['Tembhare, Prashant R', 'Subramanian, P G', 'Sehgal, Kunal', 'Yajamanam, Badrinath', 'Kumar, Ashok', 'Gadge, Vijaya', 'Inamdar, Nitin', 'Gujral, Sumeet']","['Tembhare PR', 'Subramanian PG', 'Sehgal K', 'Yajamanam B', 'Kumar A', 'Gadge V', 'Inamdar N', 'Gujral S']","['Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Center, Mumbai, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",India,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,7605904,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'India', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*pathology', 'Plasma Cells/*chemistry', 'Retrospective Studies']",2011/05/31 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2011/05/31 06:00'],"['2011/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJPatholMicrobiol_2011_54_2_294_81603 [pii]', '10.4103/0377-4929.81603 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Pathol Microbiol. 2011 Apr-Jun;54(2):294-8. doi: 10.4103/0377-4929.81603.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among 121 216 eligible women, 629 were diagnosed with NHL, 119 with MM, and 38 with Hodgkin lymphoma between 1995-1996 and 2007. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Residential UVR levels within a 20-km radius were associated with reduced risk of overall NHL (RR for highest vs lowest statewide quartile of minimum UVR [>/= 5100 vs < 4915 W-h/m(2)], 0.58; 95% CI, 0.42-0.80), especially diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (RR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.17-0.78) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.21-1.01), and MM (RR for maximum UVR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.36-0.90). These associations were not modified by skin sensitivity to sunlight, race/ethnicity, body mass index, or neighborhood socioeconomic status. Dietary vitamin D also was not associated with risk of lymphoid malignancies. These results support a protective effect of routine residential UVR exposure against lymphomagenesis through mechanisms possibly independent of vitamin D.","['Chang, Ellen T', 'Canchola, Alison J', 'Cockburn, Myles', 'Lu, Yani', 'Wang, Sophia S', 'Bernstein, Leslie', 'Clarke, Christina A', 'Horn-Ross, Pamela L']","['Chang ET', 'Canchola AJ', 'Cockburn M', 'Lu Y', 'Wang SS', 'Bernstein L', 'Clarke CA', 'Horn-Ross PL']","['Cancer Prevention Institute of California, Fremont, CA, USA. ellen@cpic.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Bone Density Conservation Agents)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Density Conservation Agents/administration & dosage', 'California/epidemiology', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Faculty/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*epidemiology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', '*Sunlight', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Ultraviolet Rays', 'Vitamin D/*administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",2011/05/31 06:00,2011/10/19 06:00,['2011/05/31 06:00'],"['2011/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40790-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-02-336065 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Aug 11;118(6):1591-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-02-336065.

We chose a p19Arf(-/-)Rag1(-/-) mouse model to confirm the previously published results concerning the contribution of CDKN2A (p19ARF /INK4a) and RAG1 copy number alterations in precursor B cells to the initiation and/or progression to B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).

In human RAG1-deficient BM, a similar CD34(+)CD19(+) population expressed p19ARF.

Activins stimulate FSHbeta subunit (Fshb) gene transcription in gonadotrope cells, the rate-limiting step in mature FSH synthesis. Activin A-induced murine Fshb gene transcription in immortalized gonadotropes is dependent on homolog of Drosophila mothers against decapentaplegic (SMAD) proteins as well as the forkhead transcription factor FOXL2 (FOXL2). Here, we demonstrate that FOXL2 synergizes with SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 to stimulate murine Fshb promoter-reporter activity in heterologous cells. Moreover, SMAD3-induction of Fshb promoter activity or endogenous mRNA expression is dependent upon endogenous FOXL2 in homologous cells. FOXL2/SMAD synergy requires binding of both FOXL2 and SMAD3 or SMAD4 to DNA. Of three putative forkhead-binding elements identified in the murine Fshb promoter, only the most proximal is absolutely required for activin A induction of reporter activity in homologous cells. Additionally, mutations to the minimal SMAD-binding element adjacent to the proximal forkhead-binding element abrogate activin A or FOXL2/SMAD3 induction of reporter activity. In contrast, a mutation that impairs an adjacent PBX1/PREP1 (pre-B cell leukemia transcription factor 1-PBX/knotted-1 homeobox-1) binding site does not alter activin A-stimulated promoter activity in homologous cells. Collectively, these and previous data suggest a model in which activins stimulate formation of FOXL2-SMAD2/3/4 complexes, which bind to the proximal murine Fshb promoter to stimulate its transcription. Within these complexes, FOXL2 and SMAD3 or SMAD4 bind to adjacent cis-elements, with SMAD3 brokering the physical interaction with FOXL2. Because this composite response element is highly conserved, this suggests a general mechanism whereby activins may regulate and/or modulate Fshb transcription in mammals.","['Tran, Stella', 'Lamba, Pankaj', 'Wang, Ying', 'Bernard, Daniel J']","['Tran S', 'Lamba P', 'Wang Y', 'Bernard DJ']","['Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone, beta Subunit)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein L2)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxl2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pknox1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Smad2 Protein)', '0 (Smad3 Protein)', '0 (Smad4 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (activin A)', '0 (inhibin beta A subunit)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)', '93443-12-0 (Inhibin-beta Subunits)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Activins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone, beta Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Forkhead Box Protein L2', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibin-beta Subunits/metabolism', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Protein Multimerization', '*Response Elements', 'Smad2 Protein/*metabolism', 'Smad3 Protein/*metabolism', 'Smad4 Protein/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2011/05/31 06:00,2011/10/15 06:00,['2011/05/31 06:00'],"['2011/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['me.2010-0480 [pii]', '10.1210/me.2010-0480 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2011 Jul;25(7):1170-83. doi: 10.1210/me.2010-0480.

DESIGN: Cohort data from the St Jude Lifetime Cohort (SJLIFE) study. SETTING: Department of Cancer Control at St Jude Children's Research Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects were adults enrolled in St Jude Lifetime Cohort study and treated for childhood ALL between 1962 and 1999. As part of a comprehensive evaluation, participants had dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans and muscle strength testing. The participants consisted of 261 women and 232 men who were 20.4 to 49.8 years old (median, 35.7y), and 12.7 to 46.5 years from diagnosis of childhood ALL (median, 27.2y). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: BMD was determined by DEXA scan. Muscle strength of upper and lower extremities was assessed with physical performance testing. RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates, we found significant (P<0.005) associations between BMD and muscle strength in lower extremities (R(2) range, 0.33-0.40) and strong, significant associations in upper extremities (left-side R(2)=0.558; right-side R(2)=0.560). CONCLUSIONS: Muscle strength was associated with BMD in the extremities of long-term survivors of childhood ALL, a finding suggesting that muscle strengthening interventions may improve bone health in them.","['Joyce, Emily D', 'Nolan, Vikki G', 'Ness, Kirsten K', 'Ferry, Robert J Jr', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Kaste, Sue C']","['Joyce ED', 'Nolan VG', 'Ness KK', 'Ferry RJ Jr', 'Robison LL', 'Pui CH', 'Hudson MM', 'Kaste SC']","[""Department of Radiological Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Phys Med Rehabil,Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,2985158R,,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Density', 'Female', 'Hand Strength', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*physiopathology', 'Survivors', 'Young Adult']",2011/05/31 06:00,2011/08/13 06:00,['2011/05/31 06:00'],"['2010/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/23 00:00 [revised]', '2010/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0003-9993(11)00026-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.apmr.2010.12.039 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Phys Med Rehabil. 2011 Jun;92(6):873-9. doi: 10.1016/j.apmr.2010.12.039.,,PMC3321361,"['P30 CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T35 DK007405/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 HD059292/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 HD059292-02/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS363934'],,"['Copyright (c) 2011 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.

They contain large amounts of potentially useful phytochemicals and could play beneficial roles in health care. In the present study, the principal bioactive phenols in olive-leaf extracts (OLEs) have been identified and quantified, and their genotoxic/antigenotoxic, cytotoxic and apoptotic effects have been assessed. The Somatic Mutation and Recombination Test (SMART) in wing imaginal discs of Drosophila melanogaster has been performed to test the possible genotoxicity of overall OLE and the individual components oleuropein and luteolin at different concentrations. The same assay was able to detect antigenotoxic activity against hydrogen peroxide as oxidative genotoxicant. None of the extracts/phenols tested showed significant mutagenic activity. This fact, together with the antigenotoxic activity against H(2)O(2) detected for all these extracts/phenols, confirmed the safety of OLE, oleuropein and luteolin in terms of DNA protection. HL60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells were used to assess the cytotoxic effects of the extracts/phenols. OLE, oleuropein and luteolin showed a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect with different IC50 (10mul/ml, 170muM, and 40muM, respectively). DNA fragmentation patterns and cell staining with acridine orange and ethidium bromide indicated that the mechanism for the cytotoxic effect of OLE, oleuropein and luteolin was the apoptotic pathway, with DNA laddering and cytoplasmic and nuclear changes. These results could help explain the mechanism of action that underlies the beneficial effect of OLE, proposed as a nutraceutical in the prevention of human cancer.","['Anter, Jaouad', 'Fernandez-Bedmar, Zahira', 'Villatoro-Pulido, Myriam', 'Demyda-Peyras, Sebastian', 'Moreno-Millan, Miguel', 'Alonso-Moraga, Angeles', 'Munoz-Serrano, Andres', 'Luque de Castro, Maria Dolores']","['Anter J', 'Fernandez-Bedmar Z', 'Villatoro-Pulido M', 'Demyda-Peyras S', 'Moreno-Millan M', 'Alonso-Moraga A', 'Munoz-Serrano A', 'Luque de Castro MD']","['Department of Genetics, University of Cordoba, Campus Rabanales, 14071 Cordoba, Spain. anteruco@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Antimutagenic Agents)', '0 (Iridoid Glucosides)', '0 (Iridoids)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Plant Oils)', '0 (Pyrans)', '2O4553545L (oleuropein)', 'KUX1ZNC9J2 (Luteolin)']",IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antimutagenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Iridoid Glucosides', 'Iridoids', 'Luteolin/*pharmacology', '*Olea', 'Phenols/pharmacology', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves/chemistry', 'Plant Oils/*pharmacology', 'Pyrans/*pharmacology']",2011/05/31 06:00,2011/09/16 06:00,['2011/05/31 06:00'],"['2010/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/11 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1383-5718(11)00127-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrgentox.2011.05.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2011 Aug 16;723(2):165-70. doi: 10.1016/j.mrgentox.2011.05.005.

The results revealed that BJ-B11 triggered growth inhibition in K562 cells and other malignant cell lines in vitro with only minor toxicity in a normal human cell line. BJ-B11 inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, with IC(50) values of 1.1 +/- 0.2 muM and 0.4 +/- 0.1 muM after 48 and 72 h incubations respectively. This most likely results from cell cycle arrest at the G(0)/G(1) phase and the induction of apoptosis. In addition, BJ-B11 degraded the Hsp90 client proteins Bcr-Abl and Akt, induced activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and subsequent cleavage of PARP. The caspase signals may originate from mitochondrial dysfunction, which is supported by the finding of cytochrome c release. In addition, inactivation of the Akt signaling pathway may be involved in the process of BJ-B11-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our data provide a putative molecular mechanism for the anticancer effect of BJ-B11 on K562 cells, and suggest a potential application for BJ-B11 in chronic myeloid leukemia therapy.","['Ju, Huai-Qiang', 'Wang, Shao-Xiang', 'Xiang, Yang-Fei', 'Liu, Zhong', 'Liu, Jin-Yun', 'Chen, Zhen-Ping', 'Zeng, Fan-Li', 'Xia, Min', 'Liu, Zong-Hua', 'Xing, Guo-Wen', 'Wang, Sha-Yan', 'Wang, Yi-Fei']","['Ju HQ', 'Wang SX', 'Xiang YF', 'Liu Z', 'Liu JY', 'Chen ZP', 'Zeng FL', 'Xia M', 'Liu ZH', 'Xing GW', 'Wang SY', 'Wang YF']","['Guangzhou Jinan Biomedicine Research and Development Center, National Engineering Research Center of Genetic Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0', '(2-(4-acetyloxycyclohexylamino)-4-(3,6,6-trimethyl-4-oxo-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-in', 'dazol-1-yl)-benzamide)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Indazoles/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2011/05/31 06:00,2011/10/26 06:00,['2011/05/31 06:00'],"['2011/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/04 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-2999(11)00550-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.05.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2011 Sep;666(1-3):26-34. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.05.020.

Although the pharmacological roles of carotenoids in the prevention and reduction of cancer incidence have received more and more attention, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying anticancer effects of carotenoids remain unclear yet. Activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) plays an inhibitory role in cancer cell proliferation and growth. Involvement of PPARgamma in the growth inhibition of leukemia K562 cells by carotenoids was investigated in the present study. The results demonstrated that beta-carotene, astaxanthin, capsanthin, and bixin inhibited the proliferation and decreased the viability of leukemia K562 cells in dose- and time-dependent manners, induced cell apoptosis, and interfered with cell cycle progression. Pretreatment with GW9662, a potent antagonist of PPARgamma, partly attenuated the inhibition of K562 cell proliferation by the four carotenoids at 8muM. These carotenoids up-regulated the expression of PPARgamma and p21 and down-regulated the expression of cyclin D1 in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, beta-carotene, astaxanthin, capsanthin and bixin also up-regulated the expression of Nrf2, an important transcription factor in Keap1-Nrf2/EpRE/ARE signaling pathway. It appears to us that PPARgamma signaling pathways and Keap1-Nrf2/EpRE/ARE signaling pathway were involved in the inhibition of K562 cell proliferation by carotenoids and the up-regulation of PPARgamma expression at least partly contributed to the antiproliferative effects of beta-carotene, astaxanthin, capsanthin, and bixin on K562 cells.","['Zhang, Xia', 'Zhao, Wen-En', 'Hu, Liqiang', 'Zhao, Lei', 'Huang, Jinyong']","['Zhang X', 'Zhao WE', 'Hu L', 'Zhao L', 'Huang J']","['School of Chemical Engineering and Energy, Zhengzhou University, No. 100 Science Road, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '36-88-4 (Carotenoids)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Carotenoids/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics', 'PPAR gamma/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2011/05/31 06:00,2011/09/13 06:00,['2011/05/31 06:00'],"['2011/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/10 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0003-9861(11)00176-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.abb.2011.05.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 2011 Aug 1;512(1):96-106. doi: 10.1016/j.abb.2011.05.004.

We examined the positive predictive value (PPV) of the ICD-10 diagnostic coding in the Danish National Registry of Patients (NRP) for the 19 Charlson conditions. METHODS: Among all hospitalizations in Northern Denmark between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2007 with a first-listed diagnosis of a Charlson condition in the NRP, we selected 50 hospital contacts for each condition. We reviewed discharge summaries and medical records to verify the NRP diagnoses, and computed the PPV as the proportion of confirmed diagnoses. RESULTS: A total of 950 records were reviewed. The overall PPV for the 19 Charlson conditions was 98.0% (95% CI; 96.9, 98.8). The PPVs ranged from 82.0% (95% CI; 68.6%, 91.4%) for diabetes with diabetic complications to 100% (one-sided 97.5% CI; 92.9%, 100%) for congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, mild and severe liver disease, hemiplegia, renal disease, leukaemia, lymphoma, metastatic tumour, and AIDS.

Now decades later, the etiology of CFS has yet to be understood, and the role of genetic predisposition in CFS remains controversial. Recent reports of CFS association with the retrovirus xenotropic murine leukemic virus-related virus (XMRV) or other murine leukemia related retroviruses (MLV) might also suggest underlying genetic implications within the host immune system. METHODS: We present analyses of familial clustering of CFS in a computerized genealogical resource linking multiple generations of genealogy data with medical diagnosis data of a large Utah health care system. We compare pair-wise relatedness among cases to expected relatedness in the Utah population, and we estimate risk for CFS for first, second, and third degree relatives of CFS cases. RESULTS: We observed significant excess relatedness of CFS cases compared to that expected in this population. Significant excess relatedness was observed for both close (p <0.001) and distant relationships (p = 0.010). We also observed significant excess CFS relative risk among first (2.70, 95% CI: 1.56-4.66), second (2.34, 95% CI: 1.31-4.19), and third degree relatives (1.93, 95% CI: 1.21-3.07).

Thus, releasing the wild-type p53 from indirect suppression would be crucial to successful killing of cancer cells by DNA-damaging therapeutic agents. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory role of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels on p53 protein in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. More importantly, we were interested to show through which receptor cAMP acts to promote p53 degradation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In cell cultures, we investigated the effects of forskolin/3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) on stimulated p53 of ALL cell lines. Western blotting analysis was performed to detect the expression of p53, phospho-p53, acetylated-p53, phospho-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and Mdm2 proteins. Flow cytometry was applied to analyze apoptosis. The gene expression of p53 and its target genes was examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: We show that elevation of cAMP levels in ALL cells exposed to DNA damage attenuates p53 accumulation. Inhibition of proteosome function with MG-132 reversed the inhibitory effect of cAMP on p53. However, targeting the p53-Mdm2 interaction did not rescue accumulated p53 from the destabilizing signal of cAMP. The specific agonist of the cAMP receptor exchange protein activated by cAMP had no effect on p53 expression in doxorubicin-treated NALM-6 cells, whereas PKA activators decreased p53 accumulation. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our studies demonstrate that cAMP-PKA pathway regulates the sensitivity toward DNA-damaging agents via inhibition of a p53-dependent pathway in B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) cells.","['Safa, Majid', 'Kazemi, Ahmad', 'Zaker, Farhad', 'Razmkhah, Farnaz']","['Safa M', 'Kazemi A', 'Zaker F', 'Razmkhah F']","['Department of Hematology, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. majid.safa@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Recept Signal Transduct Res,Journal of receptor and signal transduction research,9509432,"['0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (RAPGEF3 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'TBT296U68M (1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine)']",IM,"['1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/*pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase 1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",2011/05/31 06:00,2011/12/20 06:00,['2011/05/31 06:00'],"['2011/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10799893.2011.578140 [doi]'],ppublish,J Recept Signal Transduct Res. 2011 Jun;31(3):256-63. doi: 10.3109/10799893.2011.578140.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TLS commonly occurs following initiation of cytotoxic treatment in patients with high-grade lymphomas or acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

We encountered a rare case of CML showing marked lymph node swelling, which represented extramedullary involvement composed of cells at different stages of maturation but not showing blast crisis. In 1996, a 60-year-old Japanese male was diagnosed with CML in the chronic phase, and imatinib mesylate was prescribed following interferon-alpha treatment in 2004. However, the patient chose to discontinue out patient treatment 1 year later. He was referred to our hospital because of severe fatigue in August 2006, and laboratory tests showed a WBC count of 347.9 x 10(9)/l with 6.5% blasts. On bone marrow tests, Ph chromosome presence was found in all cells examined, but there was no additional chromosomal abnormality. Cytogenetic analysis revealed that 82% of cells in on employing FISH showed BCR/ABL. The patient had swelling of the left cervical and both inguinal lymph nodes. A lymph node biopsy showed proliferation in three lineages of hematological cells at different stages of maturation. He was diagnosed with CML in the chronic phase. He was given imatinib mesylate and hydroxyurea, and achieved hematological remission. Sixteen months later, he developed blast crisis and died of cerebral hemorrhage.

The highest frequency of autoantibodies to components of the exosome complex is found in polymyositis-scleroderma overlap patients and therefore the exosome is termed PM/Scl autoantigen in the autoimmune field.

The effect of MS on survival is unknown. METHODS: Patients on CCG protocols 2861, 2891, 2941, and 2961 being treated for AML with intensive-timing chemotherapy were classified for the presence of EML (CSF leukemia, CNS-MS, orbital-MS, or non-CNS MS). CSF leukemia was classified as CNS3 (>5 WBC in the CSF with blasts) and non-CSF leukemia as CNS1/2 (<5 WBC in the CSF with or without blasts). Characteristics and outcomes of these patients were compared. RESULTS: Of the 1,459 total patients, 1,206 (82%) had no EML, 154 (11%) had CSF leukemia, 19 (1%) had CNS-MS, 23 (2%) had orbital-MS, and 57 (4%) had non-CNS MS. The CR rate was significantly higher in patients with orbital-MS and CNS-MS than in those with non-MS and non-CNS MS (96% and 95% vs. 78% and 78%, P = 0.034). Patients with orbital-MS and CNS-MS had significantly higher overall survival than patients with non-CNS MS (92% and 73% vs. 38%, P < 0.001), CNS3 patients (92% and 73% vs. 51, P < 0.001), and CNS1/2 patients (92% and 73% vs. 50%, P < 0.001). Patients with orbital-MS had a significantly lower relapse rate. CONCLUSION: Patients with MS involving orbital and CNS sites had a significantly better survival than patients with non-CNS MS, with CSF leukemia, or with no EML.","['Johnston, Donna L', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Lange, Beverly J', 'Woods, William G']","['Johnston DL', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gerbing RB', 'Lange BJ', 'Woods WG']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. djohnston@cheo.on.ca""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Central Nervous System Neoplasms/classification/drug therapy/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms, Second Primary/classification/drug therapy/mortality', '*Orbital Neoplasms/classification/drug therapy/mortality', '*Sarcoma, Myeloid/classification/drug therapy/mortality', 'Survival Rate']",2011/05/28 06:00,2012/04/07 06:00,['2011/05/28 06:00'],"['2011/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23201 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Apr;58(4):519-24. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23201.

Future improvement in treatment success will involve new technologies and medication, adding to the pressure on limited financial resources. Therefore a retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis of ALL treatment with chemotherapy only according to the two most recent Dutch Childhood Oncology Group treatment protocols was performed. The most recent protocol ALL10 included more expensive medication (pegasparaginase) and implemented a new diagnostic technique (minimal residual disease levels) compared to the previous ALL9 protocol. PROCEDURE: Fifty children from a single center cohort were included. All direct medical costs made during treatment, including those in satellite hospitals, were determined. Costs per life year saved (LYS) were calculated. The cost-effectiveness ratio of the most recent treatment protocol was determined. LYS were calculated based on national 5-year event-free survival. RESULTS: Mean total costs were between $115,858 (ALL9) and $163,350 (ALL10) per patient. Hospital admissions (57%) and medication (11-17%) were important drivers of overall costs, and were higher in the most recent protocol ALL10. Costs per LYS were $1,962 (ALL9) and $2,655 (ALL10) and the cost-effectiveness ratio was $8,215. CONCLUSION: Treatment of childhood ALL with chemotherapy only is well within accepted ranges of cost-effectiveness. The use of new technology and more expensive medication in the most recent protocol ALL10 lead to higher costs but more LYS. In future (ALL) treatment protocols, costs in relation to effects should be taken into account in order to establish more cost-effective disease management without jeopardizing survival and quality of life.","['van Litsenburg, Raphaele R L', 'Uyl-de Groot, Carin A', 'Raat, Hein', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Gemke, Reinoud J B J']","['van Litsenburg RR', 'Uyl-de Groot CA', 'Raat H', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Gemke RJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, VU University Medical Center, P.O.

METHODS: The hospital-based case-control study in Greece derived from the National Registry for Childhood Hematological Malignancies (1996-2008, 814 leukemia and 277 lymphoma incident cases with their 1:1 matched controls). The Swedish case-control study was nested in the Swedish Medical Birth Register (MBR) (1995-2007, 520 leukemia and 71 lymphoma cases with their 5,200 and 710 matched controls) with ascertainment of incident cancer cases in the National Cancer Register. Study-specific and combined odds ratios (OR) were estimated using conditional logistic regression, with adjustment for possible risk factors. RESULTS: Nationwide studies pointed to similar size excess risk of leukemia following IVF, but to a null association between IVF and lymphoma. The proportion of leukemia cases conceived through IVF was 3% in Greece and 2.7% in Sweden; prevalence of IVF in matched controls was 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. In combined multivariable analyses, the increased risk of leukemia was confined to age below 3.8 years (OR = 2.21; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.27-3.85) and to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (OR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.06-2.95) with no sufficient evidence of excess risk for other leukemias (OR = 1.34; 95% CI: 0.38-4.69). Following IVF, OR for ALL was 2.58 (95% CI: 1.37-4.84) before age 3.8 and 4.29 (95% CI: 1.49-12.37) before age 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: IVF seems to be associated with increased risk of early onset ALL in the offspring.","['Petridou, Eleni Th', 'Sergentanis, Theodoros N', 'Panagopoulou, Paraskevi', 'Moschovi, Maria', 'Polychronopoulou, Sophia', 'Baka, Margarita', 'Pourtsidis, Apostolos', 'Athanassiadou, Fani', 'Kalmanti, Maria', 'Sidi, Vasiliki', 'Dessypris, Nick', 'Frangakis, Constantine', 'Matsoukis, Ioannis L', 'Stefanadis, Christodoulos', 'Skalkidou, Alkistis', 'Stephansson, Olof', 'Adami, Hans-Olov', 'Kieler, Helle']","['Petridou ET', 'Sergentanis TN', 'Panagopoulou P', 'Moschovi M', 'Polychronopoulou S', 'Baka M', 'Pourtsidis A', 'Athanassiadou F', 'Kalmanti M', 'Sidi V', 'Dessypris N', 'Frangakis C', 'Matsoukis IL', 'Stefanadis C', 'Skalkidou A', 'Stephansson O', 'Adami HO', 'Kieler H']","['Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Athens University Medical School, Athens, Greece. epetrid@med.uoa.gr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro/*adverse effects', 'Greece/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",2011/05/28 06:00,2012/05/17 06:00,['2011/05/28 06:00'],"['2011/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23194 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Jun;58(6):930-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23194.

We sought to extend current knowledge by using standard and novel statistical methodology to examine polymorphic variants of genes and relapse risk, toxicity, and drug dose delivery in standard risk ALL. PROCEDURE: We genotyped and abstracted chemotherapy drug dose data from treatment roadmaps on 557 patients on the Children's Cancer Group ALL study, CCG-1891. Fourteen common polymorphisms in genes involved in folate metabolism and/or phase I and II drug detoxification were evaluated individually and clique-finding methodology was employed for detection of significant gene-gene interactions. RESULTS: After controlling for known risk factors, polymorphisms in four genes: GSTP1*B (HR = 1.94, P = 0.047), MTHFR (HR = 1.61, P = 0.034), MTRR (HR = 1.95, P = 0.01), and TS (3R/4R, HR = 3.69, P = 0.007) were found to significantly increase relapse risk. One gene-gene pair, MTRR A/G and GSTM1 null genotype, significantly increased the risk of relapse after correction for multiple comparisons (P = 0.012). Multiple polymorphisms were associated with various toxicities and there was no significant difference in dose of chemotherapy delivered by genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that various polymorphisms play a role in relapse risk and toxicity during childhood ALL therapy and that genotype does not play a role in adjustment of drug dose administered. Additionally, gene-gene interactions may increase the risk of relapse in childhood ALL and the clique method may have utility in further exploring these interactions. childhood ALL therapy.","['Sepe, Dana M', 'McWilliams, Thomas', 'Chen, Jinbo', 'Kershenbaum, Aaron', 'Zhao, Huaqing', 'La, Mei', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Lange, Beverly', 'Rebbeck, Timothy R', 'Aplenc, Richard']","['Sepe DM', 'McWilliams T', 'Chen J', 'Kershenbaum A', 'Zhao H', 'La M', 'Devidas M', 'Lange B', 'Rebbeck TR', 'Aplenc R']","[""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-4318, USA. sepe@email.chop.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)']",IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/genetics', 'Methyltransferases/genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",2011/05/28 06:00,2012/04/24 06:00,['2011/05/28 06:00'],"['2011/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23192 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 May;58(5):695-700. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23192.

We evaluated the relationship between folate pathway polymorphisms and neurocognitive impairment after childhood ALL chemotherapy. PROCEDURE: Seventy-two childhood ALL survivors treated with chemotherapy alone underwent a neurocognitive battery consisting of: Trail Making Tests A (TMTA) and B (TMTB), Grooved Pegboard Test Dominant-Hand and Nondominant-Hand, Digit Span subtest, and Verbal Fluency Test. We performed genotyping for: 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR 677C>T and MTHFR 1298A>C), serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT 1420C>T), methionine synthase (MS 2756 A>G), methionine synthase reductase (MTRR 66A>G), and thymidylate synthase (TSER). Student's two sample t-test and analysis of covariance were used to compare test scores by genotype. RESULTS: General impairment on the neurocognitive battery was related to MTHFR 1298A>C (P = 0.03) and MS 2756A>G (P = 0.05). Specifically, survivors with MTHFR 1298AC/CC genotypes scored, on average, 13 points lower on TMTB than those with MTHFR 1298AA genotype (P = 0.001). The MS 2756AA genotype was associated with a 12.2 point lower mean TMTA score, compared to MS 2756 AG/GG genotypes (P = 0.01). The TSER 2R/3R and 3R/3R genotypes were associated with an 11.4 point lower mean score on TMTB, compared to the TSER 2R/2R genotype (P = 0.03). Survivors with >/=6 folate pathway risk alleles demonstrated a 9.5 point lower mean TMTA score (P = 0.06) and 14.5 point lower TMTB score (P = 0.002) than survivors with <6 risk alleles. CONCLUSIONS: Folate pathway polymorphisms are associated with deficits in attention and processing speed after childhood ALL therapy.","['Kamdar, Kala Y', 'Krull, Kevin R', 'El-Zein, Randa A', 'Brouwers, Pim', 'Potter, Brian S', 'Harris, Lynnette L', 'Holm, Suzanne', 'Dreyer, Zoann', 'Scaglia, Fernando', 'Etzel, Carol J', 'Bondy, Melissa', 'Okcu, M Fatih']","['Kamdar KY', 'Krull KR', 'El-Zein RA', 'Brouwers P', 'Potter BS', 'Harris LL', 'Holm S', 'Dreyer Z', 'Scaglia F', 'Etzel CJ', 'Bondy M', 'Okcu MF']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. kykamdar@txccc.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))', 'EC 2.1.1.13 (5-Methyltetrahydrofolate-Homocysteine S-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['5-Methyltetrahydrofolate-Homocysteine S-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/chemically induced/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition Disorders/*chemically induced/*genetics', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways/*genetics', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Survivors']",2011/05/28 06:00,2011/10/15 06:00,['2011/05/28 06:00'],"['2010/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23162 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Sep;57(3):454-60. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23162.

An IL-6-type cytokine receptor, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), is a component of cell-surface receptor complexes for multifunctional cytokines such as LIF. Herein, we report that LIFR is methylated in human colon cancer. LIFR promoter was methylated in primary tumor tissues with high frequency (65%, 52/80). Quantitative methylation-specific PCR (TaqMan-MSP) demonstrated differential promoter methylation of LIFR in primary colorectal cancer tissues as compared to normal colon tissues (5%, 4/80). LIFR methylation was not detectable in 13 normal colon mucosa samples obtained from patients without cancer. The mRNA expression of LIFR was significantly down-regulated in colon cancer tissues as compared to corresponding normal tissues. A strong expression of LIFR protein was observed in all non-malignant normal and adjacent normal colon mucosa tissues whereas down-regulated LIFR protein expression was observed in primary tumors.

The identification of epigenetic biomarker molecules for cisplatin resistance and the elucidation of the function of the identified genes in bladder cancer will provide useful information. We found that the candidate gene TLX3 was unmethylated in cisplatin sensitive cells and methylated in resistant cells. The suppression of TLX3 expression using TLX3-specific shRNA in parental cells increased cisplatin resistance. Contrarily, overexpression of TLX3 in resistant cells induced increased sensitivity to cisplatin. We found that 22 (21%) out of 110 clinical samples of bladder cancer showed the methylated pattern using the COBRA assay in TLX3. We found a correlation between TLX3 methylation and the sensitivity to cisplatin in the clinical samples by SDI test. Cisplatin sensitivity was closely associated with the methylation status of TLX3. These findings showed that the TLX3 methylation may be useful as a novel biomarker for cisplatin resistance and can be used to design therapies to counteract the resistance against cisplatin in bladder cancer.","['Tada, Yasuhiro', 'Yokomizo, Akira', 'Shiota, Masaki', 'Tsunoda, Toshiyuki', 'Plass, Christoph', 'Naito, Seiji']","['Tada Y', 'Yokomizo A', 'Shiota M', 'Tsunoda T', 'Plass C', 'Naito S']","['Department of Urology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (TLX3 protein, human)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', '*DNA Methylation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Transfection', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics']",2011/05/28 06:00,2012/01/12 06:00,['2011/05/28 06:00'],"['2011/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2011.1049 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2011 Sep;39(3):727-33. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2011.1049.

The temperature of 42.5 degrees C is, therefore, well known to be the inflection point of hyperthermia. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular responses to heat stress at temperatures higher and lower than the inflection point, we carried out global scale microarray and computational gene expression analyses. Human leukemia U937 cells were incubated at 42 degrees C or 44 degrees C for 15 min and cultured at 37 degrees C for 0-6 h. Apoptosis accompanied by the activation of caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation was only observed in cells treated with heat stress at 44 degrees C, but not at 42 degrees C. Although a large number of genes were differentially expressed by a factor of 2.0 or greater, we found substantial differences with respect to the biological functions and gene networks of the genes differentially expressed at the two temperatures examined. Interestingly, we identified temperature-specific gene networks that were considered to be mainly associated with cell death or cellular compromise and cellular function and maintenance at 44 degrees C or 42 degrees C, respectively, by using the Ingenuity pathway analysis tools.

Gene therapy is a valid treatment option for RAG-SCID patients, especially for patients lacking a suitable bone marrow donor, but developing such therapy has proven challenging. As a preclinical model for RAG-SCID, we used Rag1-/- mice and lentiviral self-inactivating (SIN) vectors harboring different internal elements to deliver native or codon-optimized human RAG1 sequences. Treatment resulted in the appearance of B and T cells in peripheral blood and developing B and T cells were detected in central lymphoid organs. Serum Ig levels and Ig and TCR Vbeta gene segment usage was comparable to wild-type (WT) controls, indicating that RAG-mediated rearrangement took place. Remarkably, relatively low frequencies of B cells produced WT levels of serum immunoglobulins. Upon stimulation of the TCR, corrected spleen cells proliferated and produced cytokines. In vivo challenge resulted in production of antigen-specific antibodies. No leukemia development as consequence of insertional mutagenesis was observed.

This study aims to identify the common bloodstream isolates in hospitalized leukemia patients with septicemia in our hospital, to choose the ideal combination of antimicrobial agents for infection prophylaxis and to clarify the appropriate time for antibiotic prophylaxis. To know this information, a retrospective analysis was conducted over a 9-year period from July 2001 to July 2010 by reviewing medical records of leukemia children admitted to our hospital. The overall frequencies of isolation were 45% in Gram-positive bacteria, 53.8% in Gram-negative bacteria, and 1.2% in fungi, respectively. Coagulase-negative Staphylococci were the most common organisms isolated, accounting for 32.7% of the total blood culture isolates, followed by Escherichia coli (15.7%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.1%). The incidence of septicemia caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae was high (69.2% and 58.8% of total isolates, respectively). The coverage rate of antimicrobial combinations of ""vancomycin+cefoperazone-sulbactam"" and ""vancomycin+piperacillin-tazobactam"" to blood culture isolates of leukemia patients in our hospital were 91.88% and 90.27%, respectively. More than 90% of septicemia occurred when the absolute neutrophil count was lower than 1.6x10(9)/L and 83.05% when absolute neutrophil count was lower than 1.0x10(9)/L. These results suggest that ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility in leukemia children remains essential. Vancomycin+cefoperazone-sulbactam and vancomycin+piperacillin-tazobactam are the good choice for leukemia children to prevent bacterial infections in our hospital. In an effort to reduce total consumption of antibiotics and to elevate the therapeutic efficacy, antibiotics prophylaxis should be started with the appearance of neutropenia in leukemia children.","['Ye, Qing', 'Xu, Xiaojun', 'Zheng, Yi', 'Chen, Xuejun']","['Ye Q', 'Xu X', 'Zheng Y', 'Chen X']","[""Department of Clinical Microbiological Laboratory, The Children's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Bacterial Infections/*complications/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Hospitalized/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli Infections/complications/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Klebsiella Infections/epidemiology', 'Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'Leukemia/*complications/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sepsis/epidemiology/etiology/*microbiology', 'Staphylococcal Infections/complications/epidemiology']",2011/05/28 06:00,2011/09/02 06:00,['2011/05/28 06:00'],"['2011/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e31821ba92c [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2011 Jul;33(5):e186-91. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e31821ba92c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patient biopsies were obtained from both tumor and normal tissue before the NRCT of locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Protein solutions were separated and immunoblot analysis was performed with heat shock protein (Hsp)16.2, heme-binding protein 2 (SOUL), BCL2-associated X protein (Bax), B-cell-associated leukemia protein 2 (Bcl-2) and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) antibodies. Following NRCT, the patients were restaged according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). Following resections the pathological down-staging was evaluated. RESULTS: Clinical restaging revealed a response rate of 65%. Pathological examination revealed down-staging in 30% and 25% of the cases for the T and N categories respectively. Compared to the normal esophageal mucosa, a decreased expression of Hsp16.2, Hsp90 and SOUL proteins and an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was found in the responding tumors.

Seven months after GO treatment, the disease relapsed and the patient developed pancytopenia. He declined further chemotherapy, and started receiving 1,200-1,800 ml of packed red blood cell transfusion per month together with ICT with deferasirox (baseline serum ferritin level was 1,412 ng/ml). Twelve months after the initiation of deferasirox, the patient's serum ferritin level decreased to below 1,000 ng/ml and deferasirox was discontinued. Four months after discontinuation of deferasirox, the blood cell count normalized and the patient became transfusion-independent.

METHODS: This analysis concerned 535 patients with newly diagnosed AAV from 15 countries who had been enrolled between 1995 and 2002 in four European clinical trials. Over the period 2004-7, study participants' follow-up events were updated, including cancers diagnosed. Age, sex and area-standardised incidence ratios (SIR) and their 95% CI were calculated by linkage to five national cancer databases. RESULTS: During the 2650 person-years' observation period, 50 cancers were diagnosed in 46 patients. SIR (95% CI) were 1.58 (1.17 to 2.08) for cancers at all sites, 1.30 (0.90 to 1.80) for cancers at all sites excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), 2.41 (0.66 to 6.17) for bladder cancer, 3.23 (0.39 to 11.65) for leukaemia, 1.11 (0.03 to 6.19) for lymphoma and 2.78 (1.56 to 4.59) for NMSC. Subgroup SIR for cancers at all sites were 1.92 (1.31 to 2.71) for GPA and 1.20 (0.71 to 1.89) for MPA. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer rates for AAV patients treated with conventional immunosuppressive therapy exceeded those expected for the general population. This cancer excess was largely driven by an increased incidence of NMSC.

In recent literature an increasing number of extracellular pathogens are described in close apposition with the host cell surface embedded in plasma membrane folds, making it difficult to classify them as strictly extracellular pathogens. This review further explores this emerging new lifestyle category tentatively named 'epicellular' in reference to earlier work describing the location of the parasite Cryptosporidium parvum. The lifestyles of three diverse such pathogens were examined: the parasite Cryptosporidium parvum, the Gram-negative bacterium Neisseria meningitidis and the human T cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). The specific cellular location, the mechanisms of adhesion, the induction of plasma membrane folds and the subsequent functional consequences will be compared. Although current knowledge suggests different underlying mechanisms, a concept that emerges is that the particular location of these pathogens has important functional consequences for the pathogens in terms of nutrient acquisition, immune escape, resistance to mechanical stress and transmission. Re-examining the lifestyle of other classically extracellular pathogens might thus shed a new light on the way pathogens interact with cells and point to new areas of investigation.","['Dumenil, Guillaume']",['Dumenil G'],"['INSERM, U970, Paris Cardiovascular Research Center, Paris, F-75015 France. guillaume.dumenil@inserm.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Cell Microbiol,Cellular microbiology,100883691,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/microbiology/parasitology/virology', 'Cryptosporidium parvum/*growth & development/*pathogenicity', 'Epithelial Cells/microbiology/parasitology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*growth & development/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Neisseria meningitidis/*growth & development/*pathogenicity', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology']",2011/05/28 06:00,2011/10/26 06:00,['2011/05/28 06:00'],"['2011/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1462-5822.2011.01613.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Microbiol. 2011 Aug;13(8):1114-21. doi: 10.1111/j.1462-5822.2011.01613.x.

The biopsy specimen showed replacement of the normal architecture of the lymph nodes by a tumor containing a dual cell population composed of large lymphocytes and medium-sized lymphocytes. Sheets of large lymphocytes often were punctuated by clusters of medium-sized lymphocytes. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analysis showed a composite lymphoma with both T-LBL and DLBCL. The T-LBL expressed CD1a, CD3, CD4, CD8, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The DLBCL expressed CD19 and CD20, CD23, bcl-2, bcl-6, MUM1 and immunoglobulin kappa light chain.

This study aimed to test the hypothesis that left ventricular (LV) twisting and untwisting motion may be altered in children after anthracycline therapy. METHODS: Thirty-six childhood leukemia survivors aged 15.6 +/- 5.5 years and 20 healthy controls aged 16.8 +/- 7.7 years (P = 0.54) were studied. LV twisting and untwisting motion was determined using speckle tracking imaging, whereas LV ejection fraction and systolic and diastolic mitral annular velocities were determined respectively by three-dimensional and tissue-Doppler echocardiography. RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients had significantly lower LV ejection fraction (P = 0.01) but similar systolic and diastolic mitral annular velocities (all P > 0.05). Their peak LV torsion (P = 0.003), systolic twisting velocity (P < 0.001), and diastolic untwisting velocity (P = 0.04) were significantly lower than controls, which could be attributable to their reduced apical rotation (P = 0.03) and apical untwisting rate (P = 0.002). For the whole cohort, LV systolic torsion and twisting velocity correlated significantly with apical untwisting rate (P < 0.001) and LV diastolic untwisting velocity (P < 0.001). In patients, none of the twisting or untwisting parameters were found to correlate with cumulative anthracycline dose (all P > 0.05). Twenty-eight (78%) patients had LV ejection fractions >/=50%. Although their systolic and diastolic mitral annular velocities were similar to those of controls, their peak LV torsion (P = 0.005), apical untwisting rate (P = 0.01), and LV systolic twisting velocity (P = 0.001) remained significantly lower. CONCLUSION: Impairment of LV twisting and untwisting motion is evident in children after anthracycline therapy, even in those with ""normal"" LV ejection fractions.","['Cheung, Yiu-fai', 'Li, Shu-na', 'Chan, Godfrey C F', 'Wong, Sophia J', 'Ha, Shau-yin']","['Cheung YF', 'Li SN', 'Chan GC', 'Wong SJ', 'Ha SY']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China. xfcheung@hkucc.hku.hk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Echocardiography,"Echocardiography (Mount Kisco, N.Y.)",8511187,['0 (Anthracyclines)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthracyclines/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Echocardiography, Doppler/*methods', 'Echocardiography, Three-Dimensional/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Survivors', 'Torsion Abnormality/*chemically induced/*diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology', 'Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/*chemically induced/*diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology', 'Young Adult']",2011/05/28 06:00,2011/12/30 06:00,['2011/05/28 06:00'],"['2011/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1540-8175.2011.01429.x [doi]'],ppublish,Echocardiography. 2011 Aug;28(7):738-45. doi: 10.1111/j.1540-8175.2011.01429.x.

CLL cells can also convert CD14(+) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors into cells with morphological similarities to NLCs (CD14(CLL) -cells). However it is unclear whether only CLL cells induce this conversion process. This study showed that CD14(+) PBMCs from healthy donors could also be converted into differentiated cells (CD14(B) -cells) by non-malignant B-cells. In order to identify changes specifically induced by CLL cells, we compared gene expression profiles of NLCs, CD14(CLL) -cells and CD14(B) -cells. CD14(+) cells cultured with CLL cells were more similar to NLCs than those cultured with non-malignant B-cells. The most significant changes induced by CLL cells were deregulation of the antigen presentation pathway and of genes related to immunity. NLCs had reduced levels of lysozyme activity, CD74 and HLA-DR in-vitro while expression of inhibitory FCGR2B was increased. These findings suggest an impaired immunocompetence of NLCs which, if found in-vivo, could contribute to the immunodeficiency in CLL patients.","['Bhattacharya, Nupur', 'Diener, Susanne', 'Idler, Irina S', 'Rauen, Judith', 'Habe, Sarah', 'Busch, Hauke', 'Habermann, Annett', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Mertens, Daniel']","['Bhattacharya N', 'Diener S', 'Idler IS', 'Rauen J', 'Habe S', 'Busch H', 'Habermann A', 'Zenz T', 'Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Mertens D']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']",IM,"['Adaptive Immunity/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/immunology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'HLA Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Immunocompetence/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/blood', 'Muramidase/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2011/05/28 06:00,2011/09/10 06:00,['2011/05/28 06:00'],"['2011/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08747.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Aug;154(3):349-56. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08747.x.

Limited clinical information about HAEs is available. METHODS: We searched the FDA MedWatch database for TMZ and obtained all MedWatch reports on TMZ submitted to the FDA from November 1, 1997 to September 3, 2008. We defined major HAEs, namely agranulocytosis, aplasia, aplastic anemia (AA), leukemia (various), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and lymphoma, and several minor HAEs. RESULTS: A total of 5,127 reports on 3,490 patients were submitted to MedWatch. Among these, we identified 112 cases of major HAEs. Of the 44 reported deaths, the major HAE was considered the cause in 32 cases. The median duration of TMZ treatment was 6 weeks [0.5-108 weeks]. Seventy-six cases of AA or aplasia and 17 cases of leukemia represented the most common major HAE. Important minor HAEs were bone marrow failure and pancytopenia/pancytopenia-like with 325 combined cases; these reports are clinically similar to aplastic anemia. CONCLUSION: The hematologic toxicity profile of TMZ differs from that of other alkylating agents. TMZ HAEs are emerging as significant concerns.

An ICLLSG study.,1123-9,10.1007/s00277-011-1259-3 [doi],"Although the incidence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) increases exponentially with age, data on patients 80 years or older at diagnosis are sparse. The records of patients diagnosed with CLL at age >/=80 years at seven medical centers in Israel during 1979-2009 were reviewed. Patients included 118 men and 96 women with a mean age of 84 years (range 80-94). Diagnosis was established in 56.5% due to routine blood count; 56% had Rai stage 0 disease and 25% of the patients received treatment. By June 2010, 72% had died. Mean survival was 67.7 months (median 56+/-5.4 months) and 5-year survival rate 47.2+/-3.6%. On univariate analysis, factors associated with better survival were age <84 years (p=0.002), early Rai and Binet stages (p=0.023, 0.003), low white blood cell count at time of diagnosis (p=0.015), low beta2 microglobulin level (p=0.006), diagnosis by routine blood test (p<0.001), and low CD38 level (p=0.036). Multivariate analysis using Cox regression revealed that younger age, low white cell count, and diagnosis by routine blood test were independent predictors of good prognosis (hazards ratios 1.8, 1.6, and 1.9, respectively). Patients diagnosed with CLL at age >/=80 years may expect to live a long life. This study identifies several factors predicting good prognosis which are easy to obtain.","['Bairey, Osnat', 'Ruchlemer, Rosa', 'Rahimi-Levene, Neomy', 'Herishanu, Yair', 'Braester, Andre', 'Berrebi, Alain', 'Polliack, Aaron', 'Klepfish, Avraham', 'Shvidel, Lev']","['Bairey O', 'Ruchlemer R', 'Rahimi-Levene N', 'Herishanu Y', 'Braester A', 'Berrebi A', 'Polliack A', 'Klepfish A', 'Shvidel L']","['Institute of Hematology, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Hospital, Petah Tiqwa, Israel. obairey@post.tau.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Review']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/blood', 'Age Factors', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidental Findings', 'Israel', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*diagnosis/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Medical Records', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/blood', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/blood']",2011/05/27 06:00,2011/10/28 06:00,['2011/05/27 06:00'],"['2011/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-011-1259-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2011 Oct;90(10):1123-9. doi: 10.1007/s00277-011-1259-3.

MATERIALS AND METHOD: Nineteen patients aged five months to 12 years with various malignancies, mainly leukaemia, along with probable fungal infection were referred for imaging over a period of 12 months. The imaging findings from their CT and chest radiographs were reviewed by two radiologists and correlated with the clinical findings. Blood culture and/or biopsy of relevant lesions were performed for all patients. RESULTS: Fungus was positively isolated in 11 out of 19 patients, but the remaining patients clinically had fungal infection. The most common species isolated was Candida sp. (five patients), followed by Aspergillus sp. The most common site of fungal infection was the lungs (10 out of 19 patients), where consolidation or cavitating nodules were seen on CT or the plain chest radiograph. One patient developed pulmonary artery aneurysm as a complication. The other sites affected were the intra-abdominal organs (liver, kidneys, and spleen) and the paranasal sinuses, shown on CT. Two patients with clinical evidence of infection and Candida sp. isolated from their blood, however, showed no abnormal findings on imaging. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis of fungal infections in oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy is important, but diagnosis may be difficult through imaging because of the non-specific changes and the presence of abnormalities from the underlying disease. Even if a specific diagnosis cannot be reached, imaging is useful to monitor response to treatment and detect complications.","['Ahmad Sarji, S', 'Wan Abdullah, Wa', 'Wastie, Ml']","['Ahmad Sarji S', 'Wan Abdullah W', 'Wastie M']","['Department of Biomedical Imaging, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Malaysia,Biomed Imaging Interv J,Biomedical imaging and intervention journal,101258681,,,,2006/04/01 00:00,2006/04/01 00:01,['2011/05/27 06:00'],"['2005/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/07 00:00 [revised]', '2006/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2006/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.2349/biij.2.2.e21 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Imaging Interv J. 2006 Apr;2(2):e21. doi: 10.2349/biij.2.2.e21.

METHODS: Using novel, highly sensitive polyomavirus genotyping assays, we evaluated the prevalence of eight distinct HPyVs in a selection of 51 NETs from different entities. In addition, we analyzed these NETs for the presence of DNA from 12 adeno-associated virus (AAV) genotypes, adeno virus-5, 27 mucosal human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes, hepatitis B (HBV), 8 human herpes viruses (HHV), and xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV). RESULTS: 43 of the 50 (86%) NETs were positive for the DNA integrity control. Of these, 2 of 3 MCCs (67%) were positive for MCV. NETs from other entities, however, were negative for all HPyVs. Only a small subset of lung and appendix NETs were positive for EBV, HHV-6, and -7. CONCLUSION: While the association of MCV with MCC was confirmed, other human viruses could not be identified as potentially causative agents of other NETs. IMPACT: Our findings suggest that the human viruses tested for in this study do not play a comparable role in NETs like the polyomavirus MCV in MCC.","['Schmitt, Markus', 'Hofler, Daniela', 'Koleganova, Nadezda', 'Pawlita, Michael']","['Schmitt M', 'Hofler D', 'Koleganova N', 'Pawlita M']","['Research Program Infection and Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 242, Heidelberg, Germany. markus.schmitt@dkfz.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['DNA, Viral/analysis/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors/*virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polyomavirus', 'Polyomavirus Infections/complications', 'Tumor Virus Infections/complications']",2011/05/27 06:00,2011/11/10 06:00,['2011/05/27 06:00'],"['2011/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-11-0424 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-11-0424 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2011 Jul;20(7):1558-61. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-11-0424.

We directly compared the clinical and DNA-hypomethylating activity of decitabine delivered at 20 mg/m(2) by either a 1-hour infusion (Arm A) or a continuous infusion (Arm B) for 3, 5, or 7 days before a single, standard induction with infusional cytarabine (100 mg/m(2) for 7 days) and daunorubicin (60 mg/m(2) x 3 doses). Toxicity was similar to that of standard induction chemotherapy alone. Although we did not identify a maximum tolerated dose, there was more gastro-intestinal toxicity with 7 days of decitabine priming. Decitabine induced DNA hypomethylation at all dose levels and there was a trend toward greater hypomethylation in CD34(+) bone marrow cells when decitabine was delivered by a short pulse (Arm A). Twenty-seven subjects (90%) responded to therapy: 17 with complete remission (57%) and 10 with partial remission (33%). Of the patients with partial remission to protocol treatment, 8 achieved remission to their next therapy, bringing the overall complete remission rate to 83%.

In the present study, we report the findings that 2 of 15 patients with refractory/relapsed APL treated with As(2)O(3) were clinically As(2)O(3) resistant. Leukemia cells from these 2 patients harbored missense mutations in promyelocytic leukemia gene-retinoic acid receptor-alpha gene (PML-RARA) transcripts, resulting in amino acid substitutions of A216V and L218P in the PML B2 domain. When wild-type or mutated PML-RARA (PR-WT and PR-B/L-mut, respectively) were overexpressed in HeLa cells, immunoblotting showed SUMOylated and/or oligomerized protein bands in PR-WT but not in PR-B/L-mut after As(2)O(3) treatment. Protein-localization analysis indicated that PR-WT in the soluble fraction was transferred to the insoluble fraction after treatment with As(2)O(3), but PR-B/L-mut was stably detected in fractions both with and without As(2)O(3). Immunofluorescent microscopy analysis showed PR-WT localization as a microgranular pattern in the cytoplasm without As(2)O(3) and as a macrogranular pattern with As(2)O(3). PR-B/L-mut was diffusely observed in the cytoplasm with and without As(2)O(3). Nearly identical localization patterns were observed in patients' primary cells. Therefore, B2 domain mutations may play an important role in aberrant molecular responses toAs(2)O(3) and may be critical for As(2)O(3) resistance in APL.","['Goto, Emi', 'Tomita, Akihiro', 'Hayakawa, Fumihiko', 'Atsumi, Akihide', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Goto E', 'Tomita A', 'Hayakawa F', 'Atsumi A', 'Kiyoi H', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oxides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sumoylation/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'Young Adult']",2011/05/27 06:00,2011/10/19 06:00,['2011/05/27 06:00'],"['2011/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40791-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-01-329433 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Aug 11;118(6):1600-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-01-329433.

Accordingly, we have used (213)Bi in mice with human leukemia xenografts. Results demonstrated excellent localization of (213)Bi-DOTA-biotin to tumors with minimal uptake into normal organs. After 10 minutes, 4.5% +/- 1.1% of the injected dose of (213)Bi was delivered per gram of tumor. alpha-imaging demonstrated uniform radionuclide distribution within tumor tissue 45 minutes after (213)Bi-DOTA-biotin injection. Radiation absorbed doses were similar to those observed using a beta-emitting radionuclide ((90)Y) in the same model. We conducted therapy experiments in a xenograft model using a single-dose of (213)Bi-DOTA-biotin given 24 hours after anti-CD45 Ab-SA conjugate. Among mice treated with anti-CD45 Ab-SA conjugate followed by 800 muCi of (213)Bi- or (90)Y-DOTA-biotin, 80% and 20%, respectively, survived leukemia-free for more than 100 days with minimal toxicity.

Improvement in the recent cohorts was observed regardless of donor type (sibling, 70% vs 24%; unrelated, 61% vs 37%; and haploidentical, 88% vs 19%), attributable to less infection (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.12; P = .005), regimen-related toxicity (HR = 0.25; P = .002), and leukemia-related death (HR = 0.40; P = .01). Survival probability was dependent on leukemia status (first remission vs more advanced disease; HR = 0.63; P = .03) or minimal residual disease (positive vs negative; HR = 2.10; P = .01) at the time of transplantation. We concluded that transplantation has improved over time and should be considered for all children with very high-risk leukemia, regardless of matched donor availability.","['Leung, Wing', 'Campana, Dario', 'Yang, Jie', 'Pei, Deqing', 'Coustan-Smith, Elaine', 'Gan, Kwan', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Sandlund, John T', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Srinivasan, Ashok', 'Hartford, Christine', 'Triplett, Brandon M', 'Dallas, Mari', 'Pillai, Asha', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Laver, Joseph H', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Leung W', 'Campana D', 'Yang J', 'Pei D', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Gan K', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Sandlund JT', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Srinivasan A', 'Hartford C', 'Triplett BM', 'Dallas M', 'Pillai A', 'Handgretinger R', 'Laver JH', 'Pui CH']","[""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA. wing.leung@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasm, Residual/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue Donors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/05/27 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/05/27 06:00'],"['2011/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44769-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-01-333070 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jul 14;118(2):223-30. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-01-333070.

Evidence is accumulating that genetic factors play an important role in conferring susceptibility/resistance to leukemia in children. In this regard, activating killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes are of particular interest. Humans may inherit different numbers of the 6 distinct activating KIR genes. Little is known about the impact of this genetic variation on the innate susceptibility or resistance of humans to the development of B-ALL. We addressed this issue by performing a case-control study in Canadian children of white origin. Our results show that harboring activating KIR genes is associated with reduced risk for developing B-ALL in these children. Of the 6 activating KIR genes, KIR2DS2 was maximally associated with decreased risk for the disease (P = 1.14 x 10(-7)). Furthermore, our results showed that inheritance of a higher number of activating KIR genes was associated with significant reductions in risk for ALL in children. These results were also consistent across different ALL phenotypes, which included children with pre-T cell ALL.

Quantification of the extent of mannose phosphorylation and the relevance to physiological function, however, remain poorly defined. In this study, we investigated the mannose phosphorylation status of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a previously identified high affinity ligand for the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR), and we analyzed the effects of this modification on its secretion and uptake in cultured cells. When media from LIF-overexpressing cells were fractionated using a CI-MPR affinity column, 35-45% of the total LIF molecules were bound and specifically eluted with free Man-6-P thus confirming LIF as a bona fide Man-6-P-modified protein. Surprisingly, mass spectrometric analysis of LIF glycopeptides enriched on the CI-MPR column revealed that all six N-glycan sites could be Man-6-P-modified. The relative utilization of these sites, however, was not uniform. Analysis of glycan-deleted LIF mutants demonstrated that loss of glycans bearing the majority of Man-6-P residues leads to higher steady-state levels of secreted LIF. Using mouse embryonic stem cells, we showed that the mannose phosphorylation of LIF mediates its internalization thereby reducing extracellular levels and stimulating embryonic stem cell differentiation. Finally, immunofluorescence experiments indicate that LIF is targeted directly to lysosomes following its biosynthesis, providing another mechanism whereby mannose phosphorylation serves to control extracellular levels of LIF. Failure to modify LIF in the context of mucolipidosis II and its subsequent accumulation in the extracellular space may have important implications for disease pathogenesis.","['Barnes, Jarrod', 'Lim, Jae-Min', 'Godard, Anne', 'Blanchard, Frederic', 'Wells, Lance', 'Steet, Richard']","['Barnes J', 'Lim JM', 'Godard A', 'Blanchard F', 'Wells L', 'Steet R']","['Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Mannosephosphates)', '3672-15-9 (mannose-6-phosphate)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Lysosomes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mannose/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mannosephosphates/chemistry', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Mucolipidoses/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Protein Transport/physiology']",2011/05/27 06:00,2012/01/25 06:00,['2011/05/27 06:00'],"['2011/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)48648-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.221432 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Jul 15;286(28):24855-64. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.221432.

Insertion of newly synthesized Mcl-1 into the mitochondrial outer membrane is dependent on its C-terminal transmembrane segment, but once inserted, the N terminus of a portion of the Mcl-1 molecules can be subject to proteolytic processing. Remarkably, this processing requires an intact electrochemical potential across the inner membrane. Three lines of evidence directed at the endogenous protein, however, indicate that the resulting Mcl-1DeltaN isoform resides in the outer membrane: (i) full-length Mcl-1 and Mcl-1DeltaN resist extraction by alkali but are accessible to exogenous protease; (ii) almost the entire populations of Mcl-1 and Mcl-1DeltaN are accessible to the membrane-impermeant Cys-reactive agent 4-acetamido-4'-[(iodoacetyl)amino]stilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid; and (iii) Mcl-1 and Mcl-1DeltaN exhibit equivalent chemical cross-linking to Bak in intact mitochondria, an Mcl-1 binding partner located in the outer membrane. In addition to the Mule Bcl-2 homology 3 domain, we show that interaction between Mcl-1 and Mule also requires the extreme N terminus of Mcl-1, which is lacking in Mcl-1DeltaN. Thus, Mcl-1DeltaN does not interact with Mule, exhibits reduced steady-state ubiquitylation, evades the hyper-rapid steady-state degradation that is observed for full-length Mcl-1 in response to treatments that limit global protein synthesis, and confers resistance to UV stress-induced cell death.","['Warr, Matthew R', 'Mills, John R', 'Nguyen, Mai', 'Lemaire-Ewing, Stephanie', 'Baardsnes, Jason', 'Sun, Karen L W', 'Malina, Abba', 'Young, Jason C', 'Jeyaraju, Danny V', ""O'Connor-McCourt, Maureen"", 'Pellegrini, Luca', 'Pelletier, Jerry', 'Shore, Gordon C']","['Warr MR', 'Mills JR', 'Nguyen M', 'Lemaire-Ewing S', 'Baardsnes J', 'Sun KL', 'Malina A', 'Young JC', 'Jeyaraju DV', ""O'Connor-McCourt M"", 'Pellegrini L', 'Pelletier J', 'Shore GC']","['Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec H3G 1Y6, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (HUWE1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (Huwe1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Death/physiology/radiation effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitochondria/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Protein Biosynthesis/physiology/radiation effects', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', '*Proteolysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination/physiology/radiation effects', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",2011/05/27 06:00,2012/01/25 06:00,['2011/05/27 06:00'],"['2011/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)48671-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.218321 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Jul 15;286(28):25098-107. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.218321.

Even though it is becoming clear that DNA methylation strongly interacts with other components of the epigenetic machinery such as histone modifications, aberrant DNA methylation can still be regarded as a crucial hallmark of cancer by itself. In Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), aberrations of DNA methylation also rank among the most frequent alterations observed. Recent studies revealed that specific patterns of DNA methylation characterize AML and help to distinguish AML subtypes. The contribution of this epigenetic dysregulation to leukemogenesis in AML is currently unclear. However, interactions between mutated transcription factors and epigenetic networks have already been shown to be partially responsible for leukemic transformation, for e.g. in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Also, direct mutations in the epigenetic master regulators EZH2 and DNMT3A were recently identified in AML and in diseases leading to secondary leukemia. These findings strengthen the view that dysregulated epigenetic networks can induce AML. Correspondingly, epigenetic therapies e.g. hypomethylating drugs show significant activity in AML. While benefit is observed in many patients, DNA hypomethylating therapy by itself is not curative. Furthermore, it is not clear whether the drugs' effects are solely epigenetic in nature since in vitro studies suggest different mechanisms of action. Current clinical trials aim to improve efficacy of DNA hypomethylating drugs for e.g. by combination with standard AML chemotherapy. Taken together, targeting the epigenetic machinery seems to be the way towards more effective therapies in AML.","['Schoofs, Till', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten']","['Schoofs T', 'Muller-Tidow C']","['Department of Medicine A, University of Muenster, 48129 Muenster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Treat Rev,Cancer treatment reviews,7502030,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods']",2011/05/27 06:00,2011/10/06 06:00,['2011/05/27 06:00'],"['2011/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0305-7372(11)00075-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ctrv.2011.04.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Treat Rev. 2011;37 Suppl 1:S13-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ctrv.2011.04.013.

Biphenotypic acute leukemia (BAL) is a rare disorder that is difficult to diagnose and it displays features of both myeloid and lymphoid lineage. The aim of this study was to highlight the incidence of Philadelphia chromosome and its presence in cases of acute myeloid and biphenotypic leukemia and determine its role in the outcome of these leukemias. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study examined 464 subjects with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia: 312 were males and 152 were females. All individuals were subjected to immunophenotyping and conventional karyotyping. FISH was used in failed cases of conventional cytogenetics analysis to quantify disease and to prove positive BCR-ABL fusion gene. RESULTS: the incidence of Ph+ chromosome was found to be higher in BAL (38.4%) than in AML (1.99%). There was statistically significant difference according to the age and the median survival time between the two groups.

METHODS: 46 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, during the induction phase of the AIEOP ALL 2000 protocol, were stratified into 2 groups. In group ""A"" cerebral thromboembolic events were suspected following the appearance of suggestive signs and symptoms and confirmed by cerebral magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venography; in group ""B"" children underwent a screening by cerebral magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venography, at set times, in absence of symptoms. RESULTS: We observed one cerebral thromboembolic event in both groups; we found no differences between early detecting asymptomatic cerebral thromboembolic events among monitored and not monitored patients.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate plasma proteasome ChT-L activity in patients with newly diagnosed solid tumors at early and advanced stages of the disease. The activity was assayed using the fluorogenic peptide substrate, Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC, in a cohort of 155 patients with early/advanced rectal (n=43/29), gastric (n=6/13), and breast (n=37/27) cancer and compared with that in normal individuals (n=55). The median plasma proteasome ChT-L activity was elevated by 20-32% in patients with advanced stage of rectal, gastric, and breast cancer compared with healthy donors. The difference turned out to be statistically significant (P<0.001). By contrast, values in patients with early stage of malignancies were not significantly different from those observed in normal individuals. We also found that plasma proteasome activity correlated with serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels in the group of patients with rectal cancer (r=0.433, P<0.05). Elevated plasma proteasome ChT-L activity is indicative of advanced stage of rectal, gastric, and breast cancer.

Therefore, a contraceptive which can be administered in tandem with a microbicide to inhibit sexually transmitted infections, is desirable. Uterine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is obligatory for blastocyst implantation in mice and associated with infertility in women. We aimed to determine whether a PEGylated LIF inhibitor (PEGLA) was an effective contraceptive following vaginal delivery and to identify non-uterine targets of PEGLA in mice.Vaginally-applied (125)I-PEGLA accumulated in blood more slowly (30 min vs 10 min) and showed reduced tissue and blood retention (24 h vs 96 h) compared to intraperitoneal injection in mice. Vaginally-applied PEGLA blocked implantation. PEGLA administered by intraperitoneal injection inhibited bone remodelling whereas vaginally-applied PEGLA had no effect on bone. Further, PEGLA had no effect in an animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental auto-immune encephalomyelitis, suggesting PEGLA cannot target the central nervous system.Vaginally-administered PEGLA is a promising non-hormonal contraceptive, one which could be delivered alone, or in tandem with a microbicide. Vaginal application reduced the total dose of PEGLA required to block implantation and eliminated the systemic effect on bone, showing the vagina is a promising site of administration for larger drugs which target organs within the reproductive tract.","['Menkhorst, Ellen', 'Zhang, Jian-Guo', 'Sims, Natalie A', 'Morgan, Phillip O', 'Soo, Priscilla', 'Poulton, Ingrid J', 'Metcalf, Donald', 'Alexandrou, Estella', 'Gresle, Melissa', 'Salamonsen, Lois A', 'Butzkueven, Helmut', 'Nicola, Nicos A', 'Dimitriadis, Evdokia']","['Menkhorst E', 'Zhang JG', 'Sims NA', 'Morgan PO', 'Soo P', 'Poulton IJ', 'Metcalf D', 'Alexandrou E', 'Gresle M', 'Salamonsen LA', 'Butzkueven H', 'Nicola NA', 'Dimitriadis E']","[""Embryo Implantation, Prince Henry's Institute, Clayton, Australia. ellen.menkhorst@princehenrys.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (pegylated MH35-BD-Q29A+G124R protein)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)']",IM,"['Administration, Intravaginal', 'Animals', 'Bone Remodeling/drug effects', 'Bone and Bones/*drug effects/physiology', 'Central Nervous System/drug effects/metabolism', 'Embryo Implantation/*drug effects', 'Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/pathology', 'Epithelium/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fertility/drug effects', 'Half-Life', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/administration & dosage/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Reproduction/drug effects', 'Uterus/drug effects/metabolism']",2011/05/26 06:00,2011/09/13 06:00,['2011/05/26 06:00'],"['2011/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0019665 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-03594 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(5):e19665. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0019665.

The pET-32a-NPM-mA vector with the whole open reading frame of the NPM-mA gene was constructed. E.coli BL21 transformed with the vector were induced to express the NPM-mA recombinant protein. BALB/c mice were immunized with the recombinant NPM-mA. Positive clones were selected by indirect ELISA and the mAbs were obtained. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the NPMc+ in bone marrow smears from 10 AML patients with NPM-mA. The results showed that the pET-32a-NPM-mA vector was successfully constructed and the NPM-mA recombinant protein was used to immunize the mice. Two positive clones (2G3 and 3F9) were selected. The mAbs against NPM-mA were raised, but did cross-react with wild type NPM1. The mAbs can be used to detect the cytoplasmic dislocation of NPM1 in all AMLs carrying NPM-mA.

A review of the research investigating the relationship of treatment regimens for ALL to specific late effect deficits, underlying mechanisms, and possible remediation is warranted to support continued studies. METHODS: The clinical literature was briefly surveyed to describe the occurrence and topography of late effects, specifically neurocognitive deficits. Additionally, the preclinical literature was reviewed to uncover potential underlying mechanisms of these deficits. The advantages of using rodent models to answer these questions are outlined, as is an assessment of the limited number of rodent models of childhood cancer treatment. RESULTS: The literature supports that childhood survivors of ALL exhibit academic difficulties and are more likely to be placed in a special education program. Behavioral evidence has highlighted impairments in the areas of attention, working memory, and processing speed, leading to a decrease in full scale IQ. Neurophysiological and preclinical evidence for these deficits has implicated white matter abnormalities and acquired brain damage resulting from specific chemotherapeutic agents commonly used during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The exact role of chemotherapeutic agents in learning deficits remains mostly unknown. Recommendations for an improved rodent model of learning deficits in childhood cancer survivors are proposed, along with suggestions for future directions in this area of research, in hopes that forthcoming treatment regimens will reduce or eliminate these types of impairments.","['Bisen-Hersh, Emily B', 'Hineline, Philip N', 'Walker, Ellen A']","['Bisen-Hersh EB', 'Hineline PN', 'Walker EA']","['1.

Radiation dose is relatively amplified in children secondary to body size, and children are more susceptible to long-term carcinogenic effects of radiation. Our aim was to measure radiation dose received in pediatric blunt trauma patients during initial CT evaluation and to determine whether doses exceed doses historically correlated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of patients aged 0 years to 17 years was conducted over 6 months. Dosimeters were placed on the neck, chest, and groin before CT scanning to measure surface radiation. Patient measurements and scanning parameters were collected prospectively along with diagnostic findings on CT imaging. Cumulative effective whole body dose and organ doses were calculated. RESULTS: The mean number of scans per patient was 3.1 +/- 1.3. Mean whole body effective dose was 17.43 mSv. Mean organ doses were thyroid 32.18 mGy, breast 10.89 mGy, and gonads 13.15 mGy. Patients with selective CT scanning defined as </=2 scans had a statistically significant decrease in radiation dose compared with patients with >2 scans. CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid doses in 71% of study patients fell within the dose range historically correlated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer and whole body effective doses fell within the range of historical doses correlated with an increased risk of all solid cancers and leukemia. Selective scanning of body areas as compared with whole body scanning results in a statistically significant decrease in all doses.","['Mueller, Deborah L', 'Hatab, Mustapha', 'Al-Senan, Rani', 'Cohn, Stephen M', 'Corneille, Michael G', 'Dent, Daniel L', 'Michalek, Joel E', 'Myers, John G', 'Wolf, Steven E', 'Stewart, Ronald M']","['Mueller DL', 'Hatab M', 'Al-Senan R', 'Cohn SM', 'Corneille MG', 'Dent DL', 'Michalek JE', 'Myers JG', 'Wolf SE', 'Stewart RM']","['Department of Surgery, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, Texas, USA. muellerd@uthscsa.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Trauma,The Journal of trauma,0376373,,IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Prospective Studies', '*Radiation Dosage', 'Risk Factors', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*adverse effects', 'Wounds, Nonpenetrating/*diagnostic imaging']",2011/05/26 06:00,2011/08/13 06:00,['2011/05/26 06:00'],"['2011/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/TA.0b013e3182092ff8 [doi]', '00005373-201103000-00028 [pii]']",ppublish,J Trauma. 2011 Mar;70(3):724-31. doi: 10.1097/TA.0b013e3182092ff8.,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stable incorporation of SF-1 into embryonic stem cells (SF-1-ES cells) has been shown to prime the cells for steroidogenesis. When provided with exogenous cholesterol substrate, and after treatment with retinoic acid and cAMP, SF-1-ES cells produce progesterone but do not produce other steroids such as cortisol, estradiol, or testosterone. In this study, we explored culture conditions that optimize SF-1-mediated differentiation of ES cells into defined steroidogenic lineages. When embryoid body formation was used to facilitate cell lineage differentiation, SF-1-ES cells were found to be restricted in their differentiation, with fewer cells entering neuronal pathways and a larger fraction entering the steroidogenic lineage. Among the differentiation protocols tested, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) removal, followed by prolonged cAMP treatment was most efficacious for inducing steroidogenesis in SF-1-ES cells. In this protocol, a subset of SF-1-ES cells survives after LIF withdrawal, undergoes morphologic differentiation, and recovers proliferative capacity. These cells are characterized by induction of steroidogenic enzyme genes, use of de novo cholesterol, and production of multiple steroids including estradiol and testosterone. Microarray studies identified additional pathways associated with SF-1 mediated differentiation. Using biotinylated SF-1 in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, SF-1 was shown to bind directly to multiple target genes, with induction of binding to some targets after steroidogenic treatment. These studies indicate that SF-1 expression, followed by LIF removal and treatment with cAMP drives ES cells into a steroidogenic pathway characteristic of gonadal steroid-producing cells.","['Jadhav, Unmesh', 'Jameson, J Larry']","['Jadhav U', 'Jameson JL']","['Department of Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Arthur J.

Although this type of therapy has increased the cancer-free survival of patients, not all tumors respond to this treatment and cancers often develop resistance to the antibody. Despite the fact that Herceptin function has been extensively studied, the precise mechanism underlying its antitumor activity still remains incompletely defined. We previously demonstrated on human breast MCF-7 carcinoma and T-lymphoblastoid CEM cells that monoclonal antibody in combination with Lipoplex consisting of Lipofectamine mixed with plasmid DNA showed a more profound effect on cancer cell viability than antibody alone. The analyses of N-glycans isolated from cancer cells showed dramatic differences in profiles when cells were exposed to Herceptin. Moreover, the investigation of glycosylated peptides from the same cancer cell models after treatment revealed further alterations in the post-translational modifications. Tandem mass spectra obtained from the samples treated confirmed the presence of a series of glycopeptides bearing characteristic oligosaccharides as described in IgG1. However some of them differed by mass differences that corresponded to peptide backbones not described previously and more of them were detected from Herceptin treated samples than from cells transfected with Heceptin/Lipoplex. The results indicate that the presence of Lipoplex prevents antibody transformation and elongates its proper function. The better understanding of the multipart changes described in the glycoconjugates could provide new insights into the mechanism by which antibody induces regression in cancers.","['Lattova, Erika', 'Bartusik, Dorota', 'Spicer, Vic', 'Jellusova, Julia', 'Perreault, Helene', 'Tomanek, Boguslaw']","['Lattova E', 'Bartusik D', 'Spicer V', 'Jellusova J', 'Perreault H', 'Tomanek B']","['Chemistry Department, University of Manitoba, 144 Dysart Road, Winnipeg, MB R3T2N2, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glycopeptides)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Lipofectamine)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'P188ANX8CK (Trastuzumab)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Glycomics/*methods', '*Glycopeptides/analysis/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Lipids', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasmids', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Transfection', 'Trastuzumab', 'Trypsin/metabolism']",2011/05/26 06:00,2012/01/31 06:00,['2011/05/26 06:00'],"['2011/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-9476(20)30159-6 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M111.007765 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2011 Sep;10(9):M111.007765. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M111.007765.

The submitted clinical evidence included one study: a non-randomised, single-arm study. Two other studies were identified but both were non-comparative and provided evidence for therapies other than ofatumumab. For this reason these studies were not discussed in full in the main body of the submission. In the Hx-CD20-406 study, the overall response rate was 58% (99% confidence interval 40% to 74%, p < 0.001). Complete resolution of constitutional symptoms and improved performance status occurred in 57% of patients. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) times were 5.7 and 13.7 months, respectively. The most common adverse events during treatment were infusion reactions and infections, which were primarily grade 1 or 2 events. The MS concluded that ofatumumab provides a new, effective and well-tolerated therapy for patients with CLL who are refractory to both fludarabine and alemtuzumab [double refractory (DR)]. The ERG undertook a critical appraisal of the submission. The ERG had a number of concerns regarding the manufacturer's estimates of effectiveness based on evidence from a single-arm, non-randomised study. An 'area-under-the-curve' or 'partitioned-survival' model was used to project expected clinical and economic outcomes for patients with DR CLL who were assumed to receive ofatumumab or best supportive care (BSC). The model had a three-state structure: 'alive pre-progression', 'alive post progression' and 'dead'. Overall, the modelling approach is reasonable given the limited evidence available for the drug in the patient population under review. However, a number of uncertainties were identified in the economic evaluation; for example, the BSC arm used data from patients in the Hx-CD20-406 study who did not respond to ofatumumab treatment - 'non-responders' - and the ofatumumab arm used data from all of those treated in the Hx-CD20-406 study. Further uncertainty arose regarding the choice of utilities, the omission of 17p and 11q chromosomal deletions as factors in the Cox proportional hazards models for PFS and OS, and the omission of the costs of drugs in progressive disease. It was felt that these factors biased cost-effectiveness in favour of ofatumumab. When revisions were made to the assumptions in the model based on the ERG's review of the published and submitted evidence, the revised base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for ofatumumab increased to pound 81,500 per quality-adjusted life-year.

METHODS: From January to December 2007, 16 patients with RGM pulmonary disease, who had been treated for 6-48 months, average (15 +/- 11) months but still sputum positive, were included in the study and treated with a new regimen containing cefoxitin, fluoroquinolone, macrolide, and SMZco. Cefoxitin was used in the first 3 months and the total duration of therapy was 18 months. Sputum conversion rate, radiology change and side effects were observed before and after the therapy. RESULTS: Underlying chronic diseases including COPD (n = 2), tuberculosis (n = 3), bone-marrow transplantation due to chronic leukemia (n = 1) and bronchiectasis (n = 5), were present in 11 patients. Main symptoms before therapy were cough and expectoration. There were multi-focal patchy, small nodular shadows with cavities on CT scans. The 16 clinical strains were highly resistant to anti-tuberculous drugs: 15/16 to streptomycin, 16/16 to isoniazid, 14/16 to rifampin, 13/16 to ethambutol, 14/15 to amikacin, 15/15 to capreomycin and 14/15 to ofloxacin. After treatment, the clinical symptoms improved in all patients. Eight of the 16 patients became sputum negative by 6 months which lasted to the end of the therapy, while another 8 patients remained sputum positive. Six patients showed radiological improvement. No one experienced side effects induced by cefoxitin. The total cure rate was 8/16. CONCLUSION: The regimen containing cefoxitin has certain effect on highly drug-resistant nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease, especially for RGM.","['Sha, Wei', 'Liang, Li', 'Jiang, Rui-hua', 'Fang, Yong', 'Yin, Hong-yun', 'Xiao, He-ping']","['Sha W', 'Liang L', 'Jiang RH', 'Fang Y', 'Yin HY', 'Xiao HP']","['Department of Tuberculosis, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital Affiliated to Tongji University, Shanghai 200433, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi,Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,8712226,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '6OEV9DX57Y (Cefoxitin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cefoxitin/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Diseases/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycobacterium Infections/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Nontuberculous Mycobacteria/drug effects', 'Retrospective Studies']",2011/05/26 06:00,2012/10/19 06:00,['2011/05/26 06:00'],"['2011/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/19 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi. 2011 Apr;34(4):265-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A small-cell variant of MCL (small-MCL), resembling small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), has been added to the World Health Organization classification. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies focusing on this neoplasm. In the present study, we analyzed 15 cases of CCND1-positive small-MCL, including immunohistochemical analysis of Ki-67 and CCND1 expression, and compared our findings with those of 151 cases of classical MCL. Morphologically, most small-MCL showed a diffuse growth pattern (76.9%), whereas others featured a very thin mantle zone pattern resembling a reactive follicle (23.1%). Bone marrow involvement and splenomegaly occurred significantly more frequently in small-MCL than in classical MCL (P < 0.05). Ki-67 expression in small-MCL was lower than in classical MCL (mean [+/- 2 SD] 12.5 +/- 17.3% and 25.2 +/- 25.5%, respectively; P < 0.001), but there was no significant difference in CCND1 expression (P = 0.2445). The 5-year survival rate in small-MCL was 83.3%. Although there was no significant difference in outcome between small-MCL and classical MCL (P = 0.287), only one small-MCL patient died of the disease. Thus, small-MCL constitutes a specific subset of indolent lymphoma with distinguishing features, possibly making a major contribution to the accuracy of therapeutic decisions. In addition, clinicians should be aware of the possible presence of small-MCL to avoid making a misdiagnosis of follicular hyperplasia or CLL/SLL.","['Kimura, Yoshizo', 'Sato, Kensaku', 'Imamura, Yutaka', 'Arakawa, Fumiko', 'Kiyasu, Junichi', 'Takeuchi, Masanori', 'Miyoshi, Hiroaki', 'Yoshida, Maki', 'Niino, Daisuke', 'Sugita, Yasuo', 'Morito, Toshiaki', 'Yoshino, Tadashi', 'Nakamura, Shigeo', 'Ohshima, Koichi']","['Kimura Y', 'Sato K', 'Imamura Y', 'Arakawa F', 'Kiyasu J', 'Takeuchi M', 'Miyoshi H', 'Yoshida M', 'Niino D', 'Sugita Y', 'Morito T', 'Yoshino T', 'Nakamura S', 'Ohshima K']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University, Kurume, Japan. yoshizo830@yahoo.co.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow Neoplasms/secondary', 'Cyclin D1/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Splenomegaly']",2011/05/26 06:00,2011/10/21 06:00,['2011/05/26 06:00'],"['2011/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.01988.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2011 Sep;102(9):1734-41. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.01988.x.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the outcome of the NHL-BFM-95 protocol in children and adolescents hospitalized during the period 1999-2006. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multi-institutional, non-randomized study of children and adolescents up to age 21 with T cell lymphoma admitted to pediatric departments in six hospitals in Israel, with regard to prevalence, clinical characteristics, pathological characteristics, prognostic factors, overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS). All patients had a minimal follow-up of one year after diagnosis. The study was based on the NHL-BFM-95 protocol. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 4 years (range 1-9 years), OS and EFS for all patients was 86.5% and 83.8%, respectively. OS was 86.7% and 83.3% for patients with stage III and stage IV, respectively, and EFS was 83.3% and 83.3%, respectively. EFS was 62.5% for Arab patients and 89.7% for Jewish patients (P = 0.014). Patients who did not express CD45 antigen showed superior survival (P = 0.028). Five patients (13.5%) relapsed, four of whom died of their disease.

We recently reported that SCFFbw7 regulates cellular apoptosis by controlling the ubiquitination and destruction of the pro-survival protein, Mcl-1, in a GSK3 phosphorylation-dependent manner. We found that human T-ALL cell lines displayed a close relationship between Fbw7 loss and Mcl-1 overexpression. More interestingly, T-ALL cell lines that are deficient in Fbw7 are particularly sensitive to sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor that has been demonstrated to reduce Mcl-1 expression through an unknown mechanism. On the other hand, Fbw7-deficient T-ALL cell lines are much more resistant to the Bcl-2 antagonist, ABT-737. Furthermore, reconstitution of Fbw7 or depletion of Mcl-1 in Fbw7-deficient cells restores ABT-737 sensitivity, suggesting that elevated Mcl-1 expression is important for Fbw7-deficient cells to evade apoptosis. Therefore, our work provides a novel molecular mechanism for the tumor suppression function of Fbw7. Furthermore, it provides the rationale for targeted usage of Mcl-1 antagonists to treat Fbw7-deficient T-ALL patients.","['Inuzuka, Hiroyuki', 'Fukushima, Hidefumi', 'Shaik, Shavali', 'Liu, Pengda', 'Lau, Alan W', 'Wei, Wenyi']","['Inuzuka H', 'Fukushima H', 'Shaik S', 'Liu P', 'Lau AW', 'Wei W']","['Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'F-Box Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination']",2011/05/25 06:00,2011/08/27 06:00,['2011/05/25 06:00'],"['2011/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['242 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.242 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2011 Mar;2(3):239-44. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.242.,,PMC3260810,"['R01 GM089763/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM089763/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory activities, which is mainly mediated through its inhibitory effect on nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). But the role of arctigenin in JAK-STAT3 signaling pathways is still unclear. In present study, we investigated the effect of arctigenin on signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway and evaluated whether suppression of STAT3 activity by arctigenin could sensitize cancer cells to a chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin. Our results show that arctigenin significantly suppressed both constitutively activated and IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation in cancer cells. Inhibition of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation was found to be achieved through suppression of Src, JAK1, and JAK2, while suppression of STAT3 serine phosphorylation was mediated by inhibition of ERK activation. Pervanadate reversed the arctigenin-induced downregulation of STAT3 activation, suggesting the involvement of a protein tyrosine phosphatase. Indeed, arctigenin can obviously induce the expression of the PTP SHP-2. Furthermore, the constitutive activation level of STAT3 was found to be correlated to the resistance of cancer cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Arctigenin dramatically promoted cisplatin-induced cell death in cancer cells, indicating that arctigenin enhanced the sensitivity of cancer cells to cisplatin mainly via STAT3 suppression. These observations suggest a novel anticancer function of arctigenin and a potential therapeutic strategy of using arctigenin in combination with chemotherapeutic agents for cancer treatment.","['Yao, Xiangyang', 'Zhu, Fenfen', 'Zhao, Zhihui', 'Liu, Chang', 'Luo, Lan', 'Yin, Zhimin']","['Yao X', 'Zhu F', 'Zhao Z', 'Liu C', 'Luo L', 'Yin Z']","['Jiangsu Province Key Laboratory for Molecular and Medicine Biotechnology, College of Life Science, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Lignans)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (BIRC3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U76MR9VS6M (arctigenin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Cyclin D1', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Furans/*pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Lignans/*pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2011/05/25 06:00,2012/04/13 06:00,['2011/05/25 06:00'],"['2011/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.23198 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2011 Oct;112(10):2837-49. doi: 10.1002/jcb.23198.,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is the etiological agent of adult T leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and of tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1 associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM), two diseases that develop after a long latency period. Importantly, HTLV-1 does not cause ATLL through insertional mutagenesis. Apart from the gag, pro, pol and env genes, which are common to all retroviruses, HTLV-1 genome also encodes regulatory and auxiliary viral proteins. Among the former, Tax promotes cell transformation and HBZ is involved in the leukemic cells proliferation and in the maintenance of the transformed phenotype. Anti-ATLL therapies have lately made significant progress with an efficient antiviral treatment against the chronic and smoldering forms of this leukemia, but an efficient treatment of TSP/HAM patients is still lacking. Results from a recent study associating histone acetylase inhibitor with an anti-viral drug will be discussed here. While an increase in proviral load is considered a marker for disease progression, this treatment allows a significant drop of the proviral load in asymptomatic carriers.","['Mahieux, R']",['Mahieux R'],"['Equipe oncogenese retrovirale, Inserm-U758 virologie humaine, Lyon cedex 07, France. renaud.mahieux@ens-lyon.fr']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",France,Bull Soc Pathol Exot,Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique (1990),9212564,"['0 (Anti-Retroviral Agents)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Genome, Viral', 'HTLV-I Infections/drug therapy/prevention & control/*virology', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/virology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/drug therapy/virology', 'Primates', 'Proviruses/drug effects', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Valproic Acid/therapeutic use', 'Viral Load', 'Virus Replication']",2011/05/25 06:00,2011/11/11 06:00,['2011/05/25 06:00'],"['2011/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13149-011-0161-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Bull Soc Pathol Exot. 2011 Aug;104(3):181-7. doi: 10.1007/s13149-011-0161-5.

Expression of both CXCR4 and SDF-1 was found to be increased, but excessively retained, in the MSCs in AML. In contrast, the SDF-1 level in bone marrow plasma and supernatant of cultured MSCs from AML patients were reduced, while the SDF-1 was able to efficiently induce a dose-dependent migration of MSCs in vitro. Our results demonstrate that altered expression and distribution of SDF-1/CXCR4 in MSCs may contribute to SDF-1 deficiency in the plasma of AML patients. The migration of MSCs may be negatively affected by the SDF-1 deficiency.","['Ge, Jian', 'Hou, Ruiqin', 'Liu, Quanhua', 'Zhu, Rongjia', 'Liu, Kaiyan']","['Ge J', 'Hou R', 'Liu Q', 'Zhu R', 'Liu K']","[""Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China. liukaiyan@medmail.com.cn.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*physiopathology', 'Cell Movement', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, CXCR4/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Young Adult']",2011/05/25 06:00,2011/10/20 06:00,['2011/05/25 06:00'],"['2011/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-011-0869-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-011-0869-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2011 Jun;93(6):750-759. doi: 10.1007/s12185-011-0869-9.

Some N-acylhydrazones of 1 were previously found to have an improved tumour and organ selectivity. In order to clarify the molecular basis for this effect, the cellular uptake into various cancer cells and the localisation in PtK(2) potoroo kidney cells of 1 and its N-acylhydrazones derived from heptadecanoic acid (2) and 11-(menthoxycarbonyl)undecanoic acid (3) were studied drawing on their intrinsic fluorescence. METHODS: The uptake of compounds 1-3 into human cells of HL-60 leukaemia, 518A2 melanoma, HT-29 colon, and resistant KB-V1/Vbl and MCF-7/Topo breast carcinomas was determined fluorometrically from their residual amounts in the supernatant. Their time-dependent accumulation in PtK(2) potoroo kidney cells was visualised by fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: The uptake, though not the cytotoxicity, of 2 in multi-drug resistant MCF-7/Topo breast cancer cells was conspicuously greater than that of 1 and 3, probably due to an attractive lipophilic interaction with the lipid-rich membranes of these cells. In non-malignant PtK(2) cells, both 1 and 3 accumulated initially in the nuclei. Upon prolonged incubation, their fluorescent metabolites were visualised in lysosomes neighbouring the nuclei. In contrast, conjugate 2 was not observed in the nuclei at any time. After 2 h, it had accumulated in vesicles scattered all over the cells, and upon prolonged incubation, its fluorescent metabolites were concentrated in the cellular membrane. CONCLUSIONS: Long unbranched fatty acyl residues when attached to doxorubicin via a hydrazone can act as lipophilic membrane anchors. This allows an increased uptake of such derivatives into lipid-rich membranes especially of multi-drug resistant cancer cells, a retarded release from there into the cytosol and the eventual storage of their metabolites again in the cell membrane rather than in lysosomes.","['Effenberger-Neidnicht, Katharina', 'Breyer, Sandra', 'Mahal, Katharina', 'Sasse, Florenz', 'Schobert, Rainer']","['Effenberger-Neidnicht K', 'Breyer S', 'Mahal K', 'Sasse F', 'Schobert R']","['Organic Chemistry Laboratory, University Bayreuth, Universitaetsstrasse 30, NW 1, 95447 Bayreuth, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Hydrazones)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Doxorubicin/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fluorometry', 'Humans', 'Hydrazones/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Kidney/cytology/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Potoroidae', 'Time Factors']",2011/05/25 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/05/25 06:00'],"['2011/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-011-1675-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2012 Jan;69(1):85-90. doi: 10.1007/s00280-011-1675-z.

New strategies are required that specifically target this malignant stem cell population.","['Thomas, Xavier']",['Thomas X'],"['Xavier Thomas, Department of Hematology, Edouard Herriot Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 69437 Lyon cedex 03, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,World J Stem Cells,World journal of stem cells,101535826,,,,2009/12/31 00:00,2009/12/31 00:01,['2011/05/25 06:00'],"['2009/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/20 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/31 00:01 [medline]']",['10.4252/wjsc.v1.i1.49 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Stem Cells. 2009 Dec 31;1(1):49-54. doi: 10.4252/wjsc.v1.i1.49.,,PMC3097908,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Leukemia stem cells', 'Prognosis', 'Targeted therapy']",,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The purpose of this study was to examine the alterations of bone mineral metabolism in two groups of children (n=42) according to immunophenotyping (B-cell type, T-cell type) both quantitative (bone mineral density z-scores) and qualitative (serum osteocalcin - OC and carboxyl-terminal telopeptide of human type I collagen - ICTP) during diagnosis (T=0), after the intensified chemotherapy period (T=0.5) and the consolidation period (T=1). RESULTS: According to our results 15 patients had osteopenia and 1 child developed osteoporosis at T=0.5 and 13 patients had osteopenia at T=1. Mean BMD z-score was significantly decreased in both groups during chemotherapy and especially statistically significant decline of T-cell type ALL group compared with B-cell type ALL patients. OC mean level remains in low levels for both groups reaching in plateau during chemotherapy and ICTP level was increased in T-cell type ALL group of patients compared with B-cell type in both periods of chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that not only the combination of chemotherapeutic agents but also the cell lineage of ALL are important parameters of altering bone mineral metabolism.","['Tragiannidis, A', 'Dokos, Ch', 'Sidi, V', 'Papageorgiou, Th', 'Koliouskas, D', 'Karamouzis, M', 'Papastergiou, Ch', 'Tsitouridis, I', 'Katzos, G', 'Rousso, I', 'Athanassiadou-Piperopoulou, F']","['Tragiannidis A', 'Dokos Ch', 'Sidi V', 'Papageorgiou T', 'Koliouskas D', 'Karamouzis M', 'Papastergiou Ch', 'Tsitouridis I', 'Katzos G', 'Rousso I', 'Athanassiadou-Piperopoulou F']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Hippokratia,Hippokratia,101296613,,,,2011/05/25 06:00,2011/05/25 06:01,['2011/05/25 06:00'],"['2011/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/25 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Hippokratia. 2011 Jan;15(1):43-7.,,PMC3093144,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'bone biochemical markers', 'bone mineral density', 'cell lineage', 'children']",,,,,,,,

High-resolution HLA-matching significantly impacts outcome and also the European Group of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) risk score, based on patient age, disease stage, donor type, time from diagnosis to SCT and gender combination, may predict for non-relapse mortality and overall survival (OS). We evaluated the individual and combined effects of allele-matching and the EBMT risk score in 327 patients with poor-risk acute leukemia or myelodysplasia, who received a T-cell depleted URD alloSCT. Matching for HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRB1 alleles (8/8 match) was associated with a 5-year OS of 40% compared with 30% for mismatched (</=7/8) pairs (P=0.02). Patients with EBMT risk scores of 1-2, 3, 4 and 5-7 had 5-year OS estimates of 53, 43, 30 and 20%, respectively (P<0.001). The favorable prognostic impact of an 8/8 donor was most pronounced if the EBMT risk score was low (1-2). Five-year OS was 74+/-8% vs 39+/-11% for fully matched patients with a low-risk EBMT score as compared with EBMT low-risk patients with </=7/8 donors. These data underscore the importance of incorporating both the EBMT risk score and the degree of high-resolution HLA-matching in the risk assessment prior to URD alloSCT.","['Lodewyck, T', 'Oudshoorn, M', 'van der Holt, B', 'Petersen, E', 'Spierings, E', 'von dem Borne, P A', 'Schattenberg, A', 'Allebes, W', 'Groenendijk-Sijnke, M', 'Duinhouwer, L', 'Willemze, R', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Verdonck, L F', 'Meijer, E', 'Cornelissen, J J']","['Lodewyck T', 'Oudshoorn M', 'van der Holt B', 'Petersen E', 'Spierings E', 'von dem Borne PA', 'Schattenberg A', 'Allebes W', 'Groenendijk-Sijnke M', 'Duinhouwer L', 'Willemze R', 'Lowenberg B', 'Verdonck LF', 'Meijer E', 'Cornelissen JJ']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', '*Alleles', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*surgery', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*surgery', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology']",2011/05/25 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/05/25 06:00'],"['2011/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['leu2011123 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.123 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Oct;25(10):1548-54. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.123.

Such interactions might be best recreated in animal models; however, this needs extensive verification. We therefore investigated the composition of the T-cell compartment in the Emu-TCL1 transgenic mouse, currently the most widely used murine model for CLL. Immunophenotyping and transplant approaches were used to define T-cell subsets at various stages of CLL. Analogous to human CLL, we observed a skewing of T-cell subsets from naive to antigen-experienced memory T cells that was more pronounced in lymph nodes than in blood. Transplantation of CLL into non-transgenic recipients was feasible without immunosuppression in a pure C57BL/6 background and resulted in the prominent skewing of the T cells of the recipient mice. Both in spontaneously developed CLL and in the transplantation setting, a loss in T-cell receptor diversity was observed, with a relevant number of clonal T-cell populations arising. This suggests that antigen-dependent differentiation toward the T memory pool is initiated by murine CLL cells. In summary, we validate the TCL1 transgenic mouse model for analysis of T-cell phenotypes and suggest a CLL-dependent antigen-driven skewing of T cells in these mice.","['Hofbauer, J Pinon', 'Heyder, C', 'Denk, U', 'Kocher, T', 'Holler, C', 'Trapin, D', 'Asslaber, D', 'Tinhofer, I', 'Greil, R', 'Egle, A']","['Hofbauer JP', 'Heyder C', 'Denk U', 'Kocher T', 'Holler C', 'Trapin D', 'Asslaber D', 'Tinhofer I', 'Greil R', 'Egle A']","['Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, 3rd Medical Department for Hematology, Federal Hospital of Salzburg and Paracelsus Medical Private University, Salzburg, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Tcl1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*etiology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2011/05/25 06:00,2011/11/08 06:00,['2011/05/25 06:00'],"['2011/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011111 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.111 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Sep;25(9):1452-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.111.

However, much remains unclear about its clinical significance. In this study, we developed a highly sensitive mutation detection method known as mutation-biased PCR (MB-PCR) and investigated the relationship between c-kit mutations and prognosis. When c-kit mutations were analyzed for 26 cases of t(8;21) AML using the direct sequence (DS) and MB-PCR, the latter had a much higher detection rate of c-kit mutations at initial presentation (DS 5/26(19.2%) vs MB-PCR 12/26(46.2%)). Interestingly for the three cases, in which c-kit mutations were observed only at relapse with the DS, c-kit mutations were detected at initial presentation using the MB-PCR. This result suggests that a minor leukemia clone with c-kit mutations have resistance to treatment and are involved in relapse. In univariate analyses, the presence of a c-kit mutation using DS was not an adverse prognostic factor (P = 0.355), but was a factor when using MB-PCR (P = 0.014). The presence of c-kit mutations with MB-PCR was also an independent adverse prognostic factor by multivariate analyses (P = 0.006). We conclude that sensitivity of c-kit mutation detection method is important to predict prognosis for t(8;21) AML.","['Wakita, S', 'Yamaguchi, H', 'Miyake, K', 'Mitamura, Y', 'Kosaka, F', 'Dan, K', 'Inokuchi, K']","['Wakita S', 'Yamaguchi H', 'Miyake K', 'Mitamura Y', 'Kosaka F', 'Dan K', 'Inokuchi K']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2011/05/25 06:00,2011/11/08 06:00,['2011/05/25 06:00'],"['2011/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011104 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.104 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Sep;25(9):1423-32. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.104.

To investigate the role of the Igh 3' enhancers in Bcl2 deregulation, we used gene targeting to generate knock-in mice in which four DNase I-hypersensitive regions from the murine Igh 3' region were integrated 3' of the Bcl2 locus. Increased levels of Bcl2 mRNA and protein were observed in the B cells of Igh-3'E-bcl2 mice. B cells from Igh-3'E-bcl2 mice showed an extended survival in vitro compared with B cells from wild-type (Wt) mice. The Bcl2 promoter shift from P1 (the 5' promoter) to P2 (the 3' promoter) was observed in B cells from Igh-3'E-bcl2 mice, similar to human t(14;18) lymphomas. The IgH-3'E-bcl2 mice developed monoclonal B-cell follicular lymphomas, which were slowly progressive. These studies show that the Igh 3' enhancers have an important role in the deregulation of Bcl2 and B-cell lymphomagenesis in vivo.","['Xiang, H', 'Noonan, E J', 'Wang, J', 'Duan, H', 'Ma, L', 'Michie, S', 'Boxer, L M']","['Xiang H', 'Noonan EJ', 'Wang J', 'Duan H', 'Ma L', 'Michie S', 'Boxer LM']","['Center for Molecular Biology in Medicine, Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, CA 94305-5156, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '114100-40-2 (Bcl2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/*genetics"", 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*genetics', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2']",2011/05/25 06:00,2011/11/08 06:00,['2011/05/25 06:00'],"['2011/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011115 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.115 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Sep;25(9):1484-93. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.115.

In contrast, recent observations show that variables related to host adaptive immunity and the tumor microenvironment are significant prognostic variables in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Therefore, we retrospectively examined the absolute monocyte and lymphocyte counts as prognostic variables in a cohort of 366 diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma patients who were treated between 1993 and 2007 and followed at a single institution. The absolute monocyte and lymphocyte counts in univariate analysis predicted progression-free and overall survival when analyzed as continuous and dichotomized variables. On multivariate analysis performed with factors included in the IPI, the absolute monocyte and lymphocyte counts remained independent predictors of progression-free and overall survival. Therefore, the absolute monocyte and lymphocyte counts were combined to generate a prognostic score that identified patients with an especially poor overall survival. This prognostic score was independent of the IPI and added to its ability to identify high-risk patients.","['Wilcox, R A', 'Ristow, K', 'Habermann, T M', 'Inwards, D J', 'Micallef, I N M', 'Johnston, P B', 'Colgan, J P', 'Nowakowski, G S', 'Ansell, S M', 'Witzig, T E', 'Markovic, S N', 'Porrata, L']","['Wilcox RA', 'Ristow K', 'Habermann TM', 'Inwards DJ', 'Micallef IN', 'Johnston PB', 'Colgan JP', 'Nowakowski GS', 'Ansell SM', 'Witzig TE', 'Markovic SN', 'Porrata L']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. wilcox.ryan@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",2011/05/25 06:00,2011/11/08 06:00,['2011/05/25 06:00'],"['2011/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011112 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.112 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Sep;25(9):1502-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.112.

Polymorphisms of these genes were investigated for an association with treatment responses in 273 childhood ALL patients. The MRP3 A-189 allele of the regulatory AT polymorphism was associated with reduced event-free survival (P=0.01). The results remained significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons and in the multivariate analysis. Among patients with an event, the A-189 carriers had significantly higher methotrexate plasma levels (P=0.03). MRP3 A-189 also conferred four times higher risk of a relapse in central nervous system (P=0.01). Patients with this allele tended to have lower frequency of thrombocytopenia grade 2 (P=0.06).

Here, we show increased expression of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), which is correlated with poor prognosis, in ALL patient cells. Mutations in EBF1 and PAX5, genes critical for B cell development have also been identified in human ALL. To determine whether mutations in Ebf1 or Pax5 synergize with STAT5 activation to induce ALL, we crossed mice expressing a constitutively active form of STAT5 (Stat5b-CA) with mice heterozygous for Ebf1 or Pax5. Haploinsufficiency of either Pax5 or Ebf1 synergized with Stat5b-CA to rapidly induce ALL in 100% of the mice. The leukemic cells displayed reduced expression of both Pax5 and Ebf1, but this had little effect on most EBF1 or PAX5 target genes. Only a subset of target genes was deregulated; this subset included a large percentage of potential tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. Further, most of these genes appear to be jointly regulated by both EBF1 and PAX5. Our findings suggest a model whereby small perturbations in a self-reinforcing network of transcription factors critical for B cell development, specifically PAX5 and EBF1, cooperate with STAT5 activation to initiate ALL.","['Heltemes-Harris, Lynn M', 'Willette, Mark J L', 'Ramsey, Laura B', 'Qiu, Yi Hua', 'Neeley, E Shannon', 'Zhang, Nianxiang', 'Thomas, Deborah A', 'Koeuth, Thearith', 'Baechler, Emily C', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Farrar, Michael A']","['Heltemes-Harris LM', 'Willette MJ', 'Ramsey LB', 'Qiu YH', 'Neeley ES', 'Zhang N', 'Thomas DA', 'Koeuth T', 'Baechler EC', 'Kornblau SM', 'Farrar MA']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, The Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (EBF1 protein, human)', '0 (Ebf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Pax5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (interleukin-7 receptor, alpha chain)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'VDJ Recombinases/metabolism']",2011/05/25 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2011/05/25 06:00'],"['2011/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20101947 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20101947 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2011 Jun 6;208(6):1135-49. doi: 10.1084/jem.20101947.

Semiquantitative proteomic discovery-based approaches identified unique expression of asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), and ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 2 (RAC2), among others, in an invasive pre-B-cell line that produced CNS leukemia in NOD-SCID mice. Targeting RAC2 significantly inhibited in vitro invasion and delayed disease onset in mice. Induced expression of RAC2 in cell lines with low/absent expression of AEP and ICAM1 did not result in an invasive phenotype or murine CNS disease. Flow cytometric analysis identified an enriched population of blast cells expressing ICAM1/lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)/CD70 in the CD10(+)/CD19(+) fraction of bone marrow aspirates obtained from relapsed compared with normal controls and those with primary disease. CD10(+)/CD19(+) fractions obtained from relapsed patients also express RAC2 and give rise to CNS disease in mice.

METHODS: Two cohort and 38 case-control studies were selected for the first meta-analysis. After evaluating homogeneity among studies using the Cochran Q test, the authors calculated a pooled meta-OR stratified on each cancer site. The authors then constructed a list of variables believed to play an important role in explaining the relation between parental exposure to pesticide and childhood cancer, and performed a series of meta-analyses. The authors also performed a distinct meta-analysis for three cohort studies with RR data. RESULTS: Meta-analysis of the three cohort studies did not show any positive links between parental pesticide exposure and childhood cancer incidence. However, the meta-analysis of the 40 studies with OR values showed that the risk of lymphoma and leukaemia increased significantly in exposed children when their mother was exposed during the prenatal period (OR=1.53; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.91 and OR=1.48; 95% CI 1.26 to 1.75). The risk of brain cancer was correlated with paternal exposure either before or after birth (OR=1.49; 95% CI 1.23 to 1.79 and OR=1.66; 95% CI 1.11 to 2.49). The OR of leukaemia and lymphoma was higher when the mother was exposed to pesticides (through household use or professional exposure). Conversely, the incidence of brain cancer was influenced by the father's exposure (occupational activity or use of household or garden pesticides). CONCLUSION: Despite some limitations in this study, the incidence of childhood cancer does appear to be associated with parental exposure during the prenatal period.","['Vinson, Florence', 'Merhi, Maysaloun', 'Baldi, Isabelle', 'Raynal, Helene', 'Gamet-Payrastre, Laurence']","['Vinson F', 'Merhi M', 'Baldi I', 'Raynal H', 'Gamet-Payrastre L']","['INRA, UMR1089 Xenobiotiques, 180 Chemin de Tournefeuille, BP93173, F-31027 Toulouse Cedex 3, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,['0 (Pesticides)'],IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Odds Ratio', 'Paternal Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Pesticides/*toxicity', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors']",2011/05/25 06:00,2011/10/14 06:00,['2011/05/25 06:00'],"['2011/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['oemed-2011-100082 [pii]', '10.1136/oemed-2011-100082 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2011 Sep;68(9):694-702. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2011-100082.

It remains unclear whether patients harboring TP53 mutations represent a homogenous prognostic group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the survival of patients with CLL and p53 defects identified at our institution by p53 yeast functional assay and complementary interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis detecting del(17p) from 2003 to 2010. RESULTS: A defect of the TP53 gene was identified in 100 of 550 patients. p53 mutations were strongly associated with the deletion of 17p and the unmutated IgVH locus (both P < .001). Survival assessed from the time of abnormality detection was significantly reduced in patients with both missense (P < .001) and nonmissense p53 mutations (P = .004). In addition, patients harboring missense mutation located in p53 DNA-binding motifs (DBMs), structurally well-defined parts of the DNA-binding domain, manifested a clearly shorter median survival (12 months) compared with patients having missense mutations outside DBMs (41 months; P = .002) or nonmissense alterations (36 months; P = .005). The difference in survival was similar in the analysis limited to patients harboring mutation accompanied by del(17p) and was also confirmed in a subgroup harboring TP53 defect at diagnosis. The patients with p53 DBMs mutation (at diagnosis) also manifested a short median time to first therapy (TTFT; 1 month). CONCLUSION: The substantially worse survival and the short TTFT suggest a strong mutated p53 gain-of-function phenotype in patients with CLL with DBMs mutations.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2003, 933 patients (median age, 47 years; range 15 to 60 years) with untreated AML were randomly assigned at diagnosis to receive cytarabine within the first consolidation therapy at either a intermediate-dose of 12 g/m(2) (I-MAC) or a high-dose of 36 g/m(2) (H-MAC) combined with mitoxantrone. Autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation or intermediate-dose cytarabine (10 g/m(2)) were offered as second consolidation. Patients with a matched donor could receive an allogeneic transplantation in a risk-adapted manner. RESULTS: After double induction therapy including intermediate-dose cytarabine (10 g/m(2)), mitoxantrone, etoposide, and amsacrine, complete remission was achieved in 66% of patients. In the primary efficacy analysis population, a consolidation with either I-MAC or H-MAC did not result in significant differences in the 5-year overall (30% v 33%; P = .77) or disease-free survival (37% v 38%; P = .86) according to the intention-to-treat analysis. Besides a prolongation of neutropenia and higher transfusion demands in the H-MAC arm, rates of serious adverse events were comparable in the two groups. CONCLUSION: In young adults with AML receiving intermediate-dose cytarabine induction, intensification of the cytarabine dose beyond 12 g/m(2) within first consolidation did not improve treatment outcome.","['Schaich, Markus', 'Rollig, Christoph', 'Soucek, Silke', 'Kramer, Michael', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Mohr, Brigitte', 'Oelschlaegel, Uta', 'Schmitz, Norbert', 'Stuhlmann, Reingard', 'Wandt, Hannes', 'Schafer-Eckart, Kerstin', 'Aulitzky, Walter', 'Kaufmann, Martin', 'Bodenstein, Heinrich', 'Tischler, Joachim', 'Ho, Anthony', 'Kramer, Alwin', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Schetelig, Johannes', 'Ehninger, Gerhard']","['Schaich M', 'Rollig C', 'Soucek S', 'Kramer M', 'Thiede C', 'Mohr B', 'Oelschlaegel U', 'Schmitz N', 'Stuhlmann R', 'Wandt H', 'Schafer-Eckart K', 'Aulitzky W', 'Kaufmann M', 'Bodenstein H', 'Tischler J', 'Ho A', 'Kramer A', 'Bornhauser M', 'Schetelig J', 'Ehninger G']","['Medizinische Klinik I, Universitatsklinikum C.G.

Indirubin, an active molecule identified in the traditional Chinese herbal medicine-Qing Dai (Indigo naturalis), has been used to treat leukemia for decades. However, the anticancer properties of Natura-alpha, an indirubin derivative, are not well studied in solid tumors, particularly in PC. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The growth kinetics and invasion ability of on human PC cell lines with or without Natura-alpha treatment were measured by cell proliferation and invasion assays. The antitumor effects of Natura-alpha were examined in nude mice tumor xenograft models, and in a patient with advanced hormone-refractory metastatic PC. Signal network proteins targeted by Natura-alpha were analyzed by using proteomic pathway array analysis (PPAA) on xenografts. RESULTS: Natura-alpha inhibited the growth of both androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and androgen-independent (LNCaP-AI, PC-3, and DU145) PC cells with IC(50) between 4 to 10 mmol/L, and also inhibited invasion of androgen-independent PC cells. Its antitumor effects were further evident in in vivo tumor reduction in androgen-dependent and androgen-independent nude mice tumor xenograft models and reduced tumor volume in the patient with hormone refractory metastatic PC. PPAA revealed that antiproliferative and antiinvasive activities of Natura-alpha on PC might primarily be through its downregulation of Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) protein. Forced overexpression of FOXM1 largely reversed the inhibition of growth and invasion by Natura-alpha. CONCLUSION: Natura-alpha could serve as a novel and effective therapeutic agent for treatment of both hormone-sensitive and hormone-refractory PC with minimal side effects.","['Li, Yirong', 'Ligr, Martin', 'McCarron, James P', 'Daniels, Garrett', 'Zhang, David', 'Zhao, Xin', 'Ye, Fei', 'Wang, Jinhua', 'Liu, Xiaomei', 'Osman, Iman', 'Mencher, Simon K', 'Lepor, Hebert', 'Wang, Long G', 'Ferrari, Anna', 'Lee, Peng']","['Li Y', 'Ligr M', 'McCarron JP', 'Daniels G', 'Zhang D', 'Zhao X', 'Ye F', 'Wang J', 'Liu X', 'Osman I', 'Mencher SK', 'Lepor H', 'Wang LG', 'Ferrari A', 'Lee P']","['Department of Pathology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Androgens)', '0 (FOXM1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein M1)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (N-methyl-delta-3,3-dihydroindole-2,2 diketone)']",IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Androgens/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Forkhead Box Protein M1', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/genetics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2011/05/25 06:00,2011/10/25 06:00,['2011/05/25 06:00'],"['2011/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-0431 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-0431 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Jul 1;17(13):4414-24. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-0431.

An increasing number of ATP-Binding-Cassette transporters have been demonstrated to cause resistance to cancer drugs. The aim of this study was to highlight the putative role of other ATP-Binding-Cassette transporters in primary chemoresistant acute myeloid leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: In the first part of this study, using taqman custom arrays, we analyzed the relative expression levels of 49 ATP-Binding-Cassette genes in 51 patients divided into two extreme cohorts, one very sensitive and one very resistant to chemotherapy. In the second part of this study, we evaluated the prognostic impact, in a cohort of 281 patients, of ATP-Binding-Cassette genes selected in the first part of the study. RESULTS: In the first part of the study, six genes (ATP-Binding-CassetteA2, ATP-Binding-CassetteB1, ATP-Binding-CassetteB6, ATP-Binding-CassettC13, ATP-Binding-CassetteG1, and ATP-Binding-CassetteG2) were significantly over-expressed in the resistant group compared with the sensitive group. In the second cohort, overexpression of 5 of these 6 ATP-Binding-Cassette genes was correlated with outcome in univariate analysis, and only the well-known ATP-Binding-CassetteB1 and G2, and the new ATP-Binding-CassetteG1 in multivariate analysis. Prognosis decreased remarkably with the number of these over-expressed ABC genes. Complete remission was achieved in 71%, 59%, 54%, and 0%, (P=0.0011) and resistance disease in 21%, 37%, 43%, and 100% (P<0.0001) of patients over-expressing 0, 1, 2, or 3, ABC genes, respectively. The number of ATP-Binding-Cassette genes expressed, among ATP-Binding-CassetteB1, G1, and G2, was the strongest prognostic factor correlated, in multivariate analysis, with achievement of complete remission (P=0.01), resistant disease (P=0.01), and overall survival (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Using expression profiling, we have emphasized the diversity of ATP-Binding-Cassette transporters that cooperate to promote chemoresistance rather than overexpression of single transporters and the putative role of new ATP-Binding-Cassette tranporters, such as ATP-Binding-CassetteG1. Modulation of these multiple transporters might be required to eradicate leukemic cells.","['Marzac, Christophe', 'Garrido, Edith', 'Tang, Ruoping', 'Fava, Fanny', 'Hirsch, Pierre', 'De Benedictis, Cinzia', 'Corre, Elise', 'Lapusan, Simona', 'Lallemand, Jean-Yves', 'Marie, Jean-Pierre', 'Jacquet, Eric', 'Legrand, Ollivier']","['Marzac C', 'Garrido E', 'Tang R', 'Fava F', 'Hirsch P', 'De Benedictis C', 'Corre E', 'Lapusan S', 'Lallemand JY', 'Marie JP', 'Jacquet E', 'Legrand O']","['Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, INSERM UMRs 872, Equipe 18, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)'],IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",2011/05/25 06:00,2012/01/18 06:00,['2011/05/25 06:00'],"['2011/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.031823 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.031823 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Sep;96(9):1293-301. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.031823.

We aimed to investigate the biological/genetic justification for the different categories of myeloid malignancies with increased erythropoiesis (>/=50% of bone marrow cells). DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated 212 patients (aged 18.5-88.4 years) with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes characterized by 50% or more erythropoiesis: 108 had acute myeloid leukemia (77 with acute erythroid leukemia, corresponding to erythroid/myeloid erythroleukemia, 7 with pure erythroid leukemia, 24 with acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes) and 104 had myelodysplastic syndromes. Morphological and chromosome banding analyses were performed in all cases; subsets of cases were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and immunophenotyping. RESULTS: Unfavorable karyotypes were more frequent in patients with acute myeloid leukemia than in those with myelodysplastic syndromes (42.6% versus 13.5%; P<0.0001), but their frequency did not differ significantly between patients with acute erythroid leukemia (39.0%), pure erythroid leukemia (57.1%), and acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes (50.0%). The incidence of molecular mutations did not differ significantly between the different categories. The 2-year overall survival rate was better for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes than for those with acute myeloid leukemia (P<0.0001), without significant differences across the different acute leukemia subtypes. The 2-year overall survival rate was worse in patients with unfavorable karyotypes than in those with intermediate risk karyotypes (P<0.0001). In multivariate analysis, only myelodysplastic syndromes versus acute myeloid leukemia (P=0.021) and cytogenetic risk category (P=0.002) had statistically significant effects on overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: The separation of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes with 50% or more erythropoietic cells has clinical relevance, but it might be worth discussing whether to replace the subclassifications of different subtypes of acute erythroid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes by the single entity, acute myeloid leukemia with increased erythropoiesis >/=50%.","['Bacher, Ulrike', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Alpermann, Tamara', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Bacher U', 'Haferlach C', 'Alpermann T', 'Kern W', 'Schnittger S', 'Haferlach T']","['Department for Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Erythroid Cells/pathology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*classification/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*classification/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Young Adult']",2011/05/25 06:00,2012/01/18 06:00,['2011/05/25 06:00'],"['2011/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.043687 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.043687 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Sep;96(9):1284-92. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.043687.

Since the impact of white blood cell count on outcome of subgroups defined by the molecular markers NPMc(+) and FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) is unknown, we addressed this issue. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied the effect of white blood cell count on outcome in a clinically and molecularly well-defined cohort of 525 patients with acute myeloid leukemia using these molecular markers. In addition, since an increased white blood cell count has been associated with an increased FLT3-ITD/FLT3 (wild-type) ratio, we investigated whether the effect of white blood cell count on outcome could be explained by the FLT3-ITD/FLT3 ratio. RESULTS: This analysis revealed that white blood cell count had no impact on outcome in patients with the genotypic combinations 'NPMc(+) without FLT3-ITD' and 'NPM1 wild-type with or without FLT3-ITD'. In contrast, white blood cell count had a significant impact on complete remission rate (P=0.034), event-free survival (P=0.009) and overall survival (P<0.001) in patients with the genotypic combination 'NPMc(+) with FLT3-ITD'. A FLT3-ITD/FLT3 ratio greater than 1 was also associated with a reduced complete remission rate (P=0.066) and significantly reduced event-free survival (P= 0.001) and overall survival (P=0.001) in patients with the genotypic combination 'NPMc(+) with FLT3-ITD'. Multivariable analysis revealed that white blood cell count and FLT3-ITD/FLT3 ratio were independent prognostic indicators for outcome in the subgroup with the genotypic combination 'NPMc(+) with FLT3-ITD'.

Tumor-derived microvesicles present in patients' sera exert detrimental effects on immune cells and may influence tumor progression. DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the microvesicle protein level, molecular profile and suppression of natural killer cell activity in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. RESULTS: The patients' sera contained higher levels of microvesicles compared to the levels in controls (P<0.001). Isolated microvesicles had a distinct molecular profile: in addition to conventional microvesicle markers, they contained membrane-associated transforming growth factor-beta1, MICA/MICB and myeloid blasts markers, CD34, CD33 and CD117. These microvesicles decreased natural killer cell cytotoxicity (P<0.002) and down-regulated expression of NKG2D in normal natural killer cells (P<0.001). Sera from patients with acute myeloid leukemia contained elevated levels of transforming growth factor-beta, and urea-mediated dissociation of microvesicles further increased the levels of this protein. Neutralizing anti-transforming growth factor-beta1 antibodies inhibited microvesicle-mediated suppression of natural killer cell activity and NKG2D down-regulation. Interleukin-15 protected natural killer cells from adverse effects of tumor-derived microvesicles. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence for the existence in acute myeloid leukemia of a novel mechanism of natural killer cell suppression mediated by tumor-derived microvesicles and for the ability of interleukin-15 to counteract this suppression.","['Szczepanski, Miroslaw J', 'Szajnik, Marta', 'Welsh, Ann', 'Whiteside, Theresa L', 'Boyiadzis, Michael']","['Szczepanski MJ', 'Szajnik M', 'Welsh A', 'Whiteside TL', 'Boyiadzis M']","['University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA 15232 USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects/immunology', 'Exosomes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/immunology/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/*metabolism']",2011/05/25 06:00,2012/01/18 06:00,['2011/05/25 06:00'],"['2011/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.039743 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.039743 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Sep;96(9):1302-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.039743.

The best-characterized familial myelodysplastic syndrome is that of familial platelet disorder with propensity to myeloid malignancy, caused by heterozygous germline RUNX1 mutations. Recently, there has been an increase in the number of reported cases, allowing for better understanding of the incidence, clinical features, and pathogenesis of this disorder. These recent cases have highlighted the clinical variability of the disorder and confirmed that many patients lack a bleeding and/or thrombocytopenia history. Additionally, several cases of T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia have now been reported, confirming a risk of lymphoid leukemia in patients with inherited RUNX1 mutations. Furthermore, an increased awareness of clinicians has helped detect a number of additional families affected by inherited myelodysplastic syndromes, resulting in the identification of novel causative mechanisms of disease, such as RUNX1 deficiency resulting from constitutional microdeletions of 21q22 and myelodysplasia-associated with telomerase deficiency. Awareness of predisposition to myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia in families may be of critical importance in the management of younger patients with myelodysplasia in whom allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is considered. Such families should be investigated for inherited deficiencies of RUNX1 and/or telomerase to prevent the use of an affected sibling as a donor for transplantation. Here we provide an update on familial platelet disorder in addition to a review of other known familial myelodysplastic syndromes.","['Liew, Elena', 'Owen, Carolyn']","['Liew E', 'Owen C']","['Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', 'Chromosome 21, monosomy 21q22', 'Chromosome 7, monosomy']",IM,"['Blood Platelet Disorders/complications/genetics', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Family Health', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*genetics/therapy', 'Telomere/genetics']",2011/05/25 06:00,2012/02/11 06:00,['2011/05/25 06:00'],"['2011/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.043422 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.043422 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Oct;96(10):1536-42. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.043422.

She had a white blood cell count of 241 x 10(2)/muL with 59.6% blasts, which had a high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio and variably condensed nuclear chromatin. Flow cytometry and chromosomal analysis of bone marrow cells indicated positive findings of CD10, CD19, CD34, HLA-DR antigens and t(9; 22)(q34; q11.2), respectively. No rearrangements of bcr/abl in peripheral blood neutrophils were found by fluorescence in situ hybridization, suggesting that she had B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with Ph chromosome. Blood glucose and HbA(1c) (glycated haemoglobin) levels on admission were 23.4 mmol/L and 21.0%, respectively. The results of 1.5 anhydro-d-glucitol and glycoalbumin tests revealed that she certainly had diabetes mellitus (DM). Insulin therapy was initiated. Her high level of HbA(1c) also suggested the possibility that the patient suffered from haemoglobinopathies in addition to DM. Sequencing analyses of alpha1-, alpha2- and beta-globin genes were all normal. The patient achieved complete remission (CR) by one month after her first course of chemotherapy, and the HbA(1c) level decreased to 10.4% following insulin therapy and chemotherapy, which were initiated when she attained CR. Her extremely high HbA(1c) level was due mainly to DM. Also, suppression of erythropoiesis by proliferation of leukaemic cells and latent iron deficiency might have partially contributed to the increased HbA(1c). This could result in a transient but extremely high HbA(1c) level.

Renal damage is one of the dose-limiting side effects of CP. Oxidative stress is reported to play important roles in CP-induced renal damage. AIM: To find out whether aminoguanidine (AG) protects against CP-induced oxidative stress and renal damage. METHOD: Renal damage was induced in the rats by administration of a single injection of CP at a dose of 150 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally. For the AG pretreatment studies, the rats were injected intraperitoneally with AG at a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight 1 hour before administration of CP. The control rats received AG or saline alone. All the rats were killed 16 hours after the administration of CP or saline. The kidneys were used for histological examination by light microscopy and biochemical assays--malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl content, reduced glutathione (GSH), and the activities of antioxidant enzymes including glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S transferase (GSTase), catalase, glutathione reductase, and myeloperoxidase (MPO), a marker of neutrophil infiltration. RESULTS: Pretreatment with AG attenuated CP-induced renal damage histologically. Pretreatment with AG prevented CP-induced lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, depletion of reduced GSH, and loss of activities of the antioxidant enzymes including GPx, catalase, and GSTase and also MPO activity. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study reveal that AG can prevent CP-induced renal damage by inhibiting oxidative stress. Thus, AG may be useful for prevention of the nephrotoxicity of CP.","['Abraham, Premila', 'Rabi, Suganthy']","['Abraham P', 'Rabi S']","['Department of Biochemistry, Christian Medical College, Bagayam, Vellore 632002, Tamil Nadu, India. premilaabraham@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Redox Rep,Redox report : communications in free radical research,9511366,"['0 (Guanidines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'SCQ4EZQ113 (pimagedine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Cyclophosphamide/*adverse effects', 'Guanidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Kidney/drug effects/enzymology/*pathology', 'Kidney Diseases/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Malondialdehyde/metabolism', 'Models, Animal', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Pilot Projects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2011/05/25 06:00,2011/09/09 06:00,['2011/05/25 06:00'],"['2011/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/174329211X12968219310837 [doi]'],ppublish,Redox Rep. 2011;16(1):8-14. doi: 10.1179/174329211X12968219310837.,,PMC6837718,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, we discuss the possibility of dasatinib itself causing PH after long-term therapy and turn specialist's attention to this possible severe side effect.At present, the true incidence of dasatinib-associated PH remains illusive and systematic data regarding haemodynamics are missing. CONCLUSION: We therefore recommend systematic screening of dasatinib-treated patients for pulmonary hypertension and subsequent collection of haemodynamic data.","['Hennigs, Jan K', 'Keller, Gunhild', 'Baumann, Hans Jorg', 'Honecker, Friedemann', 'Kluge, Stefan', 'Bokemeyer, Carsten', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Klose, Hans']","['Hennigs JK', 'Keller G', 'Baumann HJ', 'Honecker F', 'Kluge S', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Klose H']","['Centre for Pulmonary Hypertension, University Medical Centre Hamburg - Eppendorf, 20246 Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,BMC Pulm Med,BMC pulmonary medicine,100968563,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Dasatinib', 'Humans', 'Hypertension, Pulmonary/*chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/05/25 06:00,2011/10/12 06:00,['2011/05/25 06:00'],"['2010/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2466-11-30 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2466-11-30 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Pulm Med. 2011 May 23;11:30. doi: 10.1186/1471-2466-11-30.,20110523,PMC3121732,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A study published this month in BMC Cancer by Goh et al., directly addresses this issue by using a molecular genetic approach, via an established mouse animal model of human breast cancer. More specifically, alleviation of mitochondrial oxidative stress, via transgenic over-expression of catalase (an anti-oxidant enzyme) targeted to mitochondria, was sufficient to lower tumor grade (from high-to-low) and to dramatically reduce metastatic tumor burden by >12-fold. Here, we discuss these new findings and place them in the context of several other recent studies showing that oxidative stress directly contributes to tumor progression and metastasis. These results have important clinical and translational significance, as most current chemo-therapeutic agents and radiation therapy increase oxidative stress, and, therefore, could help drive tumor recurrence and metastasis. Similarly, chemo- and radiation-therapy both increase the risk for developing a secondary malignancy, such as leukemia and/or lymphoma. To effectively reduce mitochondrial oxidative stress, medical oncologists should now re-consider the use of powerful anti-oxidants as a key component of patient therapy and cancer prevention.

A default mechanism of neural induction may function during development, and in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) neural differentiation is elicited in the absence of any extrinsic signaling in minimal, serum-free culture conditions. The default mechanism can be used to derive clonal neurosphere-forming populations of neural stem cells that have been termed leukemia inhibitory factor-dependent primitive neural stem cells (pNSCs), which subsequently give rise to fibroblast growth factor 2-dependent definitive NSCs (dNSCs). Here we characterized the neural differentiation pattern of these two cell types in vitro and in vivo when transplanted into the dysmyelinated spinal cords of shiverer mice. We compared the differentiation pattern to that observed for neural stem/progenitor cells derived from the adult forebrain subependymal zone [adult neural precursor cells (aNPCs)]. dNSCs produced a differentiation pattern similar to that of aNPCs in vitro and in the shiverer model in vivo, where both cell types produced terminally differentiated oligodendrocytes that associated with host axons and expressed myelin basic protein. This is the first demonstration of the in vivo differentiation of NSCs, derived from ESCs through the default mechanism, into the oligodendrocyte lineage. We conclude that dNSCs derived through the default pathway of neural induction are a similar cell population to aNPCs and that the default mechanism is a promising approach to generate NSCs from pluripotent cell populations for use in cell therapy or other research applications.","['Rowland, James W', 'Lee, Jason J', 'Salewski, Ryan P', 'Eftekharpour, Eftekhar', 'van der Kooy, Derek', 'Fehlings, Michael G']","['Rowland JW', 'Lee JJ', 'Salewski RP', 'Eftekharpour E', 'van der Kooy D', 'Fehlings MG']","['Division of Genetics and Development, Toronto Western Research Institute and Krembil Neuroscience Center, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Mbp protein, mouse)', '0 (Myelin Basic Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Demyelinating Diseases/therapy', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology/transplantation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Myelin Basic Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Neural Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism/transplantation', 'Spheroids, Cellular/cytology/metabolism/transplantation', 'Spinal Cord/cytology']",2011/05/25 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/05/25 06:00'],"['2011/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2011.0214 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2011 Nov;20(11):1829-45. doi: 10.1089/scd.2011.0214.

The present study was designed to extend these observations and to determine whether ribonucleic acid (RNA) generated from a retroviral vector (RVV) and possessing a corresponding triplex forming site can, in a similar fashion, inhibit proliferation of p53-null K-562 leukemia cells. Viral vectors may offer advantages over oligonucleotides for tumor treatment. RVVs have the potential to be taken up more efficiently than oligonucleotides and to be expressed continuously and long-term, circumventing the need for repeated and frequent oligomer administration. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The p53-null human erythroleukemia cell line, K-562, was stably transfected with a tetracycline-repressible p53 expression construct (p53/pUHD10-3). p53 protein in these cells is expressed in the absence of tetracycline but down-regulated upon tetracycline treatment. Triplex-forming oligonucleotides [Hoog 1 (experimental) and Hoog 3 (control)] were cloned into RVVs in order to generate triplex-forming fusion mRNAs. Naive K-562 cells and p53/pUHD10-3-transfected K-562 cells (with and without tetracycline treatment) were infected with viruses that express the triplex-forming RNAs. Cell growth was measured by BrdU incorporation into DNA. RESULTS: RVVs encoding Hoog 1, in both orientations, inhibit the growth of naive K-562 cells and p53-transfected, tet-repressed K-562 cells. p53 expression in K-562 cells decreases growth to the same extent as Hoog 1 RVV treatment. However, Hoog 1-RVV does not further inhibit growth of p53-expressing K-562 cells. Treatment with an RVV encoding the control, Hoog 3, has no growth inhibitory effect. CONCLUSION: Triple helix-forming RNAs directed to a p53 consensus sequence homology reduce leukemia cell proliferation, suggesting a novel method of treatment.","['Re, Richard N', 'Zhang, Zhuo', 'Cook, Julia L']","['Re RN', 'Zhang Z', 'Cook JL']","['Department of Research, Ochsner Clinic Foundation, New Orleans, LA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ochsner J,The Ochsner journal,101125795,,,,2007/07/01 00:00,2007/07/01 00:01,['2011/05/24 06:00'],"['2011/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2007/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ochsner J. 2007 Summer;7(2):58-60.,,PMC3096391,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['P53', 'leukemia', 'triplex-forming RNAs']",,,,,,,,

The most important tyrosine kinase families in the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors are the ABL, SCR, platelet derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor families. Both multi-kinase inhibitors and single-kinase inhibitors have advantages and disadvantages, which are related to potential resistance mechanisms, pharmacokinetics, selectivity and tumor environment. In different malignancies various tyrosine kinases are mutated or overexpressed and several resistance mechanisms exist. Pharmacokinetics is influenced by interindividual differences and differs for two single targeted inhibitors or between patients treated by the same tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Different tyrosine kinase inhibitors have various mechanisms to achieve selectivity, while differences in gene expression exist between tumor and stromal cells. Considering these aspects, one type of inhibitor can generally not be preferred above the other, but will depend on the specific genetic constitution of the patient and the tumor, allowing personalized therapy. The most effective way of cancer treatment by using tyrosine kinase inhibitors is to consider each patient/tumor individually and to determine the strategy that specifically targets the consequences of altered (epi)genetics of the tumor. This strategy might result in treatment by a single multi kinase inhibitor for one patient, but in treatment by a couple of single kinase inhibitors for other patients.","['Broekman, Fleur', 'Giovannetti, Elisa', 'Peters, Godefridus J']","['Broekman F', 'Giovannetti E', 'Peters GJ']","['Fleur Broekman, Elisa Giovannetti, Godefridus J Peters, Department of Medical Oncology, VU University Medical Center, 1007 MB Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,World J Clin Oncol,World journal of clinical oncology,101549149,,,,2011/05/24 06:00,2011/05/24 06:01,['2011/05/24 06:00'],"['2010/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/05 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5306/wjco.v2.i2.80 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Clin Oncol. 2011 Feb 10;2(2):80-93. doi: 10.5306/wjco.v2.i2.80.,,PMC3095472,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia oncogene homolog 1', 'Epidermal growth factor receptor', 'Janus kinase', 'Platelet derived growth factor', 'Targeted therapy', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitors', 'Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor']",,,,,,,,

We compared outcomes of HCT using MSD (N=38) or UCB (N=60) among older patients (age >/= 55 years) with AML or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). All patients received a reduced intensity regimen consisting of CY, fludarabine and 200 cGy TBI. Median age at HCT was 63 years for MSD and 61 years for UCB recipients. Among UCB recipients, 95% received two UCB units and 88% received 1-2 locus HLA-mismatched units to optimize cell dose. OS at 3-years was 37% for MSD and 31% for UCB recipients (P=0.21). On multivariate analysis, donor source (MSD vs UCB) did not impact risks of OS, leukemia-free survival and relapse or treatment-related mortality. UCB is feasible as an alternative donor source for reduced-intensity conditioning HCT among older patients with AML and MDS who do not have a suitable MSD.","['Majhail, N S', 'Brunstein, C G', 'Shanley, R', 'Sandhu, K', 'McClune, B', 'Oran, B', 'Warlick, E D', 'Wagner, J E', 'Weisdorf, D J']","['Majhail NS', 'Brunstein CG', 'Shanley R', 'Sandhu K', 'McClune B', 'Oran B', 'Warlick ED', 'Wagner JE', 'Weisdorf DJ']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. majha001@umn.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Aged', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Siblings', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2011/05/24 06:00,2012/07/31 06:00,['2011/05/24 06:00'],"['2011/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2011114 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2011.114 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2012 Apr;47(4):494-8. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2011.114.

Y251 is located in the highly conserved RT loop structure of the SH3C, a region of Crk involved in the allosteric regulation of the Abl kinase. Exploiting kinase assays to show that Y251 is phosphorylated by Abl in vitro, we generated affinity-purified antisera against phosphorylated Y251 in Crk and showed that Abl induces phosphorylation at Y251 in vivo, and that the kinetics of phosphorylation at Y251 and the negative regulatory Y221 site in vitro are similar. Y251 on endogenous Crk was robustly phosphorylated in chronic myelogenous leukemia cell lines and in A431 and MDA-MB-468 cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor. Using streptavidin-biotin pull downs and unbiased high-throughput Src Homology 2 (SH2) profiling approaches, we found that a pY251 phosphopeptide binds specifically to a subset of SH2 domains, including Abl and Arg SH2, and that binding of pY251 to Abl SH2 induces transactivation of Abl 1b. Finally, the Y251F Crk mutant significantly abrogates Abl transactivation in vitro and in vivo. These studies point to a yet unrealized positive regulatory role resulting from tyrosine phosphorylation of Crk, and identify a novel mechanism by which an adaptor protein activates a non-receptor tyrosine kinase by SH2 domain displacement.","['Sriram, G', 'Reichman, C', 'Tunceroglu, A', 'Kaushal, N', 'Saleh, T', 'Machida, K', 'Mayer, B', 'Ge, Q', 'Li, J', 'Hornbeck, P', 'Kalodimos, C G', 'Birge, R B']","['Sriram G', 'Reichman C', 'Tunceroglu A', 'Kaushal N', 'Saleh T', 'Machida K', 'Mayer B', 'Ge Q', 'Li J', 'Hornbeck P', 'Kalodimos CG', 'Birge RB']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ 07103-6399, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-crk)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-crk/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tyrosine', 'src Homology Domains']",2011/05/24 06:00,2011/12/28 06:00,['2011/05/24 06:00'],"['2011/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/28 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2011170 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2011.170 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2011 Nov 17;30(46):4645-55. doi: 10.1038/onc.2011.170.

The treatment with combinations of anti-Notch molecule neutralizing Abs resulted in the decrease of B-ALL cell survival, either cultured alone or cocultured in presence of stromal cells from normal donors and B-ALL patients. Interestingly, the inhibition of Notch-3 and -4 or Jagged-1/-2 and DLL-1 resulted in a dramatic increase of apoptotic B-ALL cells by 3 days, similar to what is obtained by blocking all Notch signaling with the GSI XII.

Given the long-term suspicion of antigenic stimulation as a primum movens in the disease, the role of the B-cell receptor has been extensively studied in various experimental settings; albeit scarcely in a comparative dynamic proteomic approach. Here we use a quantitative 2-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis technology to compare 48 proteomic profiles of the 2 CLL subsets before and after anti-IgM ligation. Differentially expressed proteins were subsequently identified by mass spectrometry. We show that unstimulated M- and UM-CLL cells display distinct proteomic profiles. Furthermore, anti-IgM stimulation induces a specific proteomic response, more pronounced in the more aggressive CLL. Statistical analyses demonstrate several significant protein variations according to stimulation conditions. Finally, we identify an intermediate form of M-CLL cells, with an indolent profile (ZAP70(-)) but sharing aggressive proteomic profiles alike UM-CLL cells. Collectively, this first quantitative and dynamic proteome analysis of CLL further dissects the complex molecular pathway after B-cell receptor stimulation and depicts distinct proteomic profiles, which could lead to novel molecular stratification of the disease.","['Perrot, Aurore', 'Pionneau, Cedric', 'Nadaud, Sophie', 'Davi, Frederic', 'Leblond, Veronique', 'Jacob, Frederic', 'Merle-Beral, Helene', 'Herbrecht, Raoul', 'Bene, Marie-Christine', 'Gribben, John G', 'Bahram, Seiamak', 'Vallat, Laurent']","['Perrot A', 'Pionneau C', 'Nadaud S', 'Davi F', 'Leblond V', 'Jacob F', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Herbrecht R', 'Bene MC', 'Gribben JG', 'Bahram S', 'Vallat L']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunogenetique Moleculaire Humaine, Centre de Recherche d'Immunologie et d'Hematologie, Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Comment']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Amyloidosis/*drug therapy', 'Boronic Acids/*administration & dosage', 'Bortezomib', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light-chain Amyloidosis', 'Male', 'Protease Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrazines/*administration & dosage']",2011/05/24 06:00,2011/10/15 06:00,['2011/05/24 06:00'],"['2011/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44717-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-02-335125 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jul 28;118(4):e1-15. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-02-335125.

It has also been shown that it is characterized by the late release of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which acts through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and augments the presentation of antigens from dying tumor cells to DCs. Most of the data on immunogenic tumor cell death were obtained using mouse models. In this study, we investigated the capacity of clinically used chemotherapeutics to induce immunogenic cell death in human tumor cell lines and primary tumor cells. We found that only anthracyclines induced a rapid translocation of calreticulin, HSP70, and HSP90 to the cell surface and the release of HMGB1 12 hours after the treatment. The interaction of immature DCs with immunogenic tumor cells led to an increased tumor cell uptake and induces moderate phenotypic maturation of DCs. Killed tumor cell-loaded DCs efficiently stimulated tumor-specific IFN-gamma-producing T cells. DCs pulsed with killed immunogenic tumor cells also induced significantly lower numbers of regulatory T cells than those pulsed with nonimmunogenic tumor cells. These data indicate that human prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells share the key features of immunogenic cell death with mice tumor cells.

Their main therapeutic role is based on Gc receptor (GR)-mediated mechanisms that trigger cell death but this varies depending on the cancer type. This review aims to provide an overview of the mechanisms of Gc-induced cell death and more importantly the changes in GR that lead to resistance to Gc treatment in cancer. The three main cancer types, which are susceptible to Gc resistance and therefore loss of Gc-induced apoptotic effects, are acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, osteosarcoma and small-cell lung carcinoma. A common theme is the loss of GR function and/or a downregulation of GR expression which leads to failure of the cell death-inducing effects of Gcs. Loss of GR function is attributed to mutations in the GR gene, and in some cases a dominant-negative effect on any functional GR still present. The downregulation of GR expression can be due to decreased GR promoter activation, increased GR promoter methylation or increased expression of alternative splice isoforms of GR that have decreased transcriptional activity. Understanding the mechanisms behind Gc-triggered apoptosis and the resistance to it in these cancer types will help in further refining treatment regimens for patients and will decrease the chance of relapse caused by Gc-resistant cancer phenotypes.","['Schlossmacher, George', 'Stevens, Adam', 'White, Anne']","['Schlossmacher G', 'Stevens A', 'White A']","['Endocrinology and Diabetes, Faculty of Life Sciences, Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Endocrinol,The Journal of endocrinology,0375363,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Osteosarcoma/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*physiology', 'Small Cell Lung Carcinoma/drug therapy']",2011/05/24 06:00,2011/11/09 06:00,['2011/05/24 06:00'],"['2011/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['JOE-11-0135 [pii]', '10.1530/JOE-11-0135 [doi]']",ppublish,J Endocrinol. 2011 Oct;211(1):17-25. doi: 10.1530/JOE-11-0135.

We have shown that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) and protease-mediated degradation of misfolded nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) confer resistance to unfolded protein response (UPR)-induced apoptosis in APL. These findings suggest that therapeutic inhibition of N-CoR misfolding or degradation may promote growth arrest in APL cells by sensitizing them to UPR-induced apoptosis. On the basis of this hypothesis, we tested the effects of several known protein conformation-modifying agents on the growth and survival of APL cells and identified curcumin, a natural component of turmeric, as a potent growth inhibitor of APL cells. Curcumin selectively inhibited the growth and promoted apoptosis in both primary and secondary leukemic cells derived from APL. The curcumin-induced apoptosis of APL cells was triggered by an amplification of ER stress, possibly from the accumulation of misfolded N-CoR protein in the ER. Curcumin promoted this net accumulation of aberrantly phosphorylated misfolded N-CoR protein by blocking its ERAD and protease-mediated degradation, which then led to the activation of UPR-induced apoptosis in APL cells. The activation of UPR by curcumin was manifested by phosphorylation of protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2alpha), and upregulation of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and GADD34, the principal mediators of proapoptotic UPR. These findings identify the therapeutic potential of curcumin in APL and further establish the rationale of misfolded N-CoR protein as an attractive molecular target in APL.","['Ng, Angela Ping Ping', 'Chng, Wee Joo', 'Khan, Matiullah']","['Ng AP', 'Chng WJ', 'Khan M']","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, Singapore. csimmk@nus.edu.sg']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DDIT3 protein, human)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2)', '0 (NCOR1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PERK kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPP1R15A protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Phosphatase 1/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/metabolism', 'Unfolded Protein Response/*drug effects', 'eIF-2 Kinase/metabolism']",2011/05/24 06:00,2011/11/15 06:00,['2011/05/24 06:00'],"['2011/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-10-0545 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-10-0545 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2011 Jul;9(7):878-88. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-10-0545.

METHODS: MTT assay was used to assess the cytotoxicity of apatinib in HL-60 cells. The apoptosis and cell cycle changes of the cells in response to apatinib treatment were analyzed by flow cytometry, and Western blotting was used to assay P-Akt and P-Erk1/2 expressions in the cells. RESULTS: Apatinib significantly inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells in vitro with an IC(50) of 4.96-/+0.32 micromol/L. Apatinib treatment significantly increased the apoptotic rate of the cells in a dose-dependent manner, but produced no significant effect on the cell cycle (P>0.05). Western blotting showed that the expressions of P-Akt and P-Erk1/2 decreased in HL-60 cells after a 48-h apatinib treatment. CONCLUSION: Apatinib inhibits the proliferation of HL-60 cells by inducing cell apoptosis probably through the mechanism of inhibiting the expressions of the Akt/Erk1/2 signal transduction pathway.","['Liang, Shu', 'Tong, Xiu-zhen', 'Fu, Li-wu']","['Liang S', 'Tong XZ', 'Fu LW']","['Department of Hematology, Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China.

The results of pre-ASCT FDG-PET interpreted by the international harmonization project (IHP) criteria were compared with published prognostic models for prediction of event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Overall, 3-year EFS was 62% and OS was 78%, with a median follow-up of 38 months. Pre-ASCT FDG-PET response significantly predicted 3-year EFS in FDG-PET-negative (82%) versus FDG-PET-positive (41%) patients (P = .02). A trend was observed for 3-year OS comparing FDG-PET-negative (91%) versus -positive (64%) patients (P = .08). Multivariate analysis demonstrated the independent prognostic significance of pre-ASCT FDG-PET for EFS with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.2 (confidence interval [CI] 1.1-9.0, P = .03).

Recently, much attention has been given to nanoparticle (NP) based drug delivery systems loaded with dual drugs to improve current disease therapies by overcoming toxicity and other side effects associated with high doses of single drugs. In the present study, we document to explore an approach to simultaneously deliver two drugs at target sites (i.e. Bcr-Abl oncoprotein) using poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles. Preliminary study included screening six different anticancer drugs and their nanoformulations on leukemia cells. Results confirmed superlative antileukemic activity of paclitaxel (especially in formulations) on model cell line K562, but only upon longer exposure. Thus to lower time of action of such a potent drug, different drug combination were experimented taking the advantage of synergistic action of both the drugs. Evaluation at molecular and genetic level helped to identify signaling pathways upstream and downstream of Bcr-Abl, leading to its suppression. Results helped to illustrate dynamic changes primarily involved in inducing apoptotic activities on drug exposure of leukemia cells, thereby facilitating us to integrate different drug combinations in a more specific manner in near future to study CML in clinical settings.","['Acharya, Sarbari', 'Sahoo, Sanjeeb K']","['Acharya S', 'Sahoo SK']","['Institute of Life Sciences, Laboratory for Nanomedicine, Nalco Square, Chandrasekharpur, Bhubaneswar, Orissa 751023, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biomaterials,Biomaterials,8100316,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '1SIA8062RS (Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer)', '26009-03-0 (Polyglycolic Acid)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Curcumin/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Lactic Acid/chemistry', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Polyglycolic Acid/chemistry', 'Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology']",2011/05/24 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/05/24 06:00'],"['2011/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0142-9612(11)00450-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.04.043 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomaterials. 2011 Aug;32(24):5643-62. doi: 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.04.043.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the relative effectiveness of induction treatments in AML elderly patients. METHODS: A network of multiple treatments meta-analysis was performed by combining direct and indirect evidence from published randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The complete remission (CR) was considered as the outcome of interest. We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library until September 30, 2010, to identify all RCTs published in English that compared diverse induction chemotherapies in elderly AML patients. Our search strategy focused on RCTs that included AML patients >60 years, considering, however, that age stratification was varied between countries and over time and studies were not necessarily designed to compare elderly patients. Regimens were grouped a priori into 42 different types of induction treatment. Prognostic parameters (age, performance status, unfavorable cytogenetics, antecedent malignancy), AML outcomes (median disease-free, overall survival, CR, induction deaths), and myelotoxicity parameters (median duration until neutrophil recovery [>1.0 x 10(9)/L], platelet recovery [>100 x 10(9)/L], hospitalization duration) were evaluated for each induction type. In combining direct and indirect evidence, we calculated the odds ratio (OR) for each therapy relative to the most commonly used combination of standard-dose daunorubicin (30-60 mg/m(2) for 3 days) and standard-dose cytarabine (100 mg/m(2) for 7-10 days) that was set as the reference induction treatment. RESULTS: We identified 65 RCTs (15,110 patients) that described 64 direct comparisons of induction treatments, but only 14 of them showed significant differences in CR after random effects meta-analyses. Median age of included patients was 68, 18.0% had secondary AML, 21.1 % had poor performance status, 26.7% displayed unfavorable cytogenetics, and 49.3% finally achieved CR. No significant differences were observed in the recorded induction toxicity parameters among the treatment arms. Through the network meta-analysis, the addition of all-trans retinoic acids or lomustine to the combination of idarubicin plus cytarabine showed significantly higher CR rate (OR = 1.93 [1.06-3.49] and 1.76 [1.08-2.88], respectively), whereas no treatment, clofarabine, daunorubicin plus topotecan, and the 2 different schedules of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (at 1, 3, and 5 days and at 1 and 8 days) showed a significantly lower CR rate (OR = 0.01 [0.001-0.19], 0.15 [0.04-0.58], 0.03 [0.002-0.64], 0.06 [0.01-0.51], and 0.05 [0.01-0.32], respectively) than that of the reference induction. Median overall survival showed no difference between treatments (P = 0.150) but was significantly increased during the last 30 years (P < 0.001), presumably reflecting advances in AML management. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the reference induction, significant differences were found for specific induction regimens, although most compared regimens appeared to have similar efficacy profiles. These results, however, should be interpreted with caution because the network was dominated by indirect comparisons. Data from large RCTs that make direct comparisons between treatments are needed to detect the optimal induction regimen for elderly AML patients.","['Ziogas, Dimitrios C', 'Voulgarelis, Michael', 'Zintzaras, Elias']","['Ziogas DC', 'Voulgarelis M', 'Zintzaras E']","['Department of Biomathematics, University of Thessaly School of Medicine, Larissa, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",United States,Clin Ther,Clinical therapeutics,7706726,,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/05/24 06:00,2011/09/17 06:00,['2011/05/24 06:00'],"['2011/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0149-2918(11)00186-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinthera.2011.04.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Ther. 2011 Mar;33(3):254-79. doi: 10.1016/j.clinthera.2011.04.004.,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

The Sargassum siliquastrum extract among the 14 species of brown algae exhibited profound growth inhibitory effect on HL-60 cells in the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, therefore, S. siliquastrum was selected for use in further experiments. The highest inhibitory activity of S. siliquastrum on HL-60 cells was detected in the chloroform fraction, and the active compound was identified as a kind of chromene, sargachromanol E (SE). SE treatment showed significant growth inhibitory effects on HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner by inducing apoptosis, as evidenced by the formation of apoptotic bodies, fragmented DNA ladder, and the accumulation of DNA in the sub-G(1) phase of cell cycle. SE induced apoptosis was accompanied by downregulation of Bcl-xL, upregulation of Bax, activation of caspase-3, and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Moreover, z-DEVD-fmk, a caspase-3 inhibitor, significantly inhibited cell cytotoxicity, apoptotic characteristics such as apoptotic bodies, sub-G(1) DNA content, and cleavage of PARP induced by SE. These results suggest that SE exerts its growth inhibitory effects on HL-60 cells through caspase-3-mediated induction of apoptosis. Therefore, SE offers promising chemotherapeuric potential to prevent cancers such as human leukemia.","['Heo, Soo-Jin', 'Kim, Kil-Nam', 'Yoon, Weon-Jong', 'Oh, Chulhong', 'Choi, Young-Ung', 'Affan, Abu', 'Lee, Yeon-Ju', 'Lee, Hyi-Seung', 'Kang, Do-Hyung']","['Heo SJ', 'Kim KN', 'Yoon WJ', 'Oh C', 'Choi YU', 'Affan A', 'Lee YJ', 'Lee HS', 'Kang DH']","['Marine Living Resources Research Department, Korea Ocean Research and Development Institute, Ansan 426-744, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,"['0 (Benzopyrans)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzopyrans/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans']",2011/05/24 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/05/24 06:00'],"['2011/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/06 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0278-6915(11)00199-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fct.2011.05.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2011 Sep;49(9):1998-2004. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2011.05.011.

Although hypothalamic CRH secretion may be the primary mechanism by which these cytokines activate the HPA axis, IL-1 expression is increased within the adrenal glands in models for systemic inflammation, and IL-1 may augment adrenal glucocorticoid production. Our aim was to investigate the direct effects of IL-1alpha and IL-1beta on adrenal steroidogenesis and expression of three key steroidogenic genes in human adrenocortical cells using the NCI-H295R cell line as a model. mRNAs encoding receptors for IL-1, TNF-alpha, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were detectable in the cell line (Affymetrix microarray analysis). Both IL-1alpha and IL-1beta increased cortisol, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate production, and the accumulation of mRNAs for steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR), 17alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1) and 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (HSD3B2) in these cells (P<0.05 for all). Both ILs augmented TNF-alpha- and LIF-induced STAR and CYP17A1 mRNA accumulation, and TNF-alpha-induced cortisol production (P<0.05 for all). Both ILs also increased the apoptotic index of the cells (P<0.05), which was efficiently neutralized by their specific antibodies. The IL-induced changes in the STAR, HSD3B2, and CYP17A1 protein levels were not as evident as those in the respective mRNA levels. In conclusion, the combined effect of inflammatory cytokines at the adrenal level in acute or chronic inflammatory states could significantly stimulate glucocorticoid production, and thus explain the observed discrepancy between the cortisol and ACTH concentrations sometimes seen in sepsis and chronic inflammatory states.","['Tkachenko, Irina V', 'Jaaskelainen, Tiina', 'Jaaskelainen, Jarmo', 'Palvimo, Jorma J', 'Voutilainen, Raimo']","['Tkachenko IV', 'Jaaskelainen T', 'Jaaskelainen J', 'Palvimo JJ', 'Voutilainen R']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kuopio University Hospital and University of Eastern Finland, P.O.

Previously we demonstrated that STAT3 activation by IL-6 family cytokines, such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), induces the endothelial differentiation of cardiac Sca-1+ cells. In this study, we addressed molecular mechanisms for EC differentiation of Sca-1+ cells. First, DNA array experiments were performed to search for the molecules induced by LIF. Among 134 genes that LIF upregulated by more than 4 fold, we focused on Pim-1 gene transcript, because Pim-1 is associated with the differentiation of some cell lineages. Real time RT-PCR analyses confirmed that LIF stimulation upregulated Pim-1 expression. Adenoviral transfection of dominant negative (dn) STAT3 inhibited LIF-mediated induction of Pim-1, while the overexpression of constitutively active STAT3 upregulated Pim-1 expression, suggesting that STAT3 activation is necessary and sufficient for Pim-1 induction. Moreover, in STAT3-deficient Sca-1+ cells, LIF failed to induce Pim-1 expression and EC differentiation. Importantly, the overexpression of dnPim-1 abrogated the induction of EC markers, indicating Pim kinase activity is indispensable for STAT3-mediated EC differentiation in vitro. Finally, Sca-1+ cells labeled with LacZ were transplanted into post-infarct myocardium and the transdifferentiation was estimated. The overexpression of wild-type STAT3 by adenovirus vector significantly promoted EC differentiation, while STAT3 gene ablation reduced the frequency of differentiating cells in post-infarct myocardium. Furthermore, transplanted Sca-1+ cells overexpressing dnPim-1 showed the reduced frequency of EC differentiation and capillary density. Collectively, Pim-1 kinase is upregulated by STAT3 activation in cardiac Sca-1+ cells and plays a pivotal role in EC differentiation both in vitro and in vivo.","['Iwakura, Tomohiko', 'Mohri, Tomomi', 'Hamatani, Tatsuto', 'Obana, Masanori', 'Yamashita, Tomomi', 'Maeda, Makiko', 'Katakami, Naoto', 'Kaneto, Hideaki', 'Oka, Toru', 'Komuro, Issei', 'Azuma, Junichi', 'Nakayama, Hiroyuki', 'Fujio, Yasushi']","['Iwakura T', 'Mohri T', 'Hamatani T', 'Obana M', 'Yamashita T', 'Maeda M', 'Katakami N', 'Kaneto H', 'Oka T', 'Komuro I', 'Azuma J', 'Nakayama H', 'Fujio Y']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacogenomics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, 1-6 Yamada-oka Suita City, 565-0871, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Cell Cardiol,Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology,0262322,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Ly6a protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/*metabolism', 'Cell Transdifferentiation/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Endothelial Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myocardial Infarction/genetics/metabolism/therapy', '*Myocytes, Cardiac/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism']",2011/05/24 06:00,2011/10/26 06:00,['2011/05/24 06:00'],"['2010/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/18 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-2828(11)00173-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.04.013 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Cell Cardiol. 2011 Aug;51(2):207-14. doi: 10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.04.013.

The single-molecule methylation assay (SMMA) is based on two methodologies. One methodology, FCS, estimates the translational diffusion coefficient of molecules in solution, whereas the other methodology uses the high affinity of methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) to bind specifically to methylated DNA. We studied the specific binding rates of fluorescence-labeled MBD2 and methylated DNA from biological samples using the automated FCS system. Using a standard curve with methylated control DNA, we developed the SMMA index to assess the global DNA methylation level of the biological samples. A marked decrease in the SMMA index was observed when human leukemia cell lines (U937 and K562) were cultured with DNA demethylating agents. Our findings clearly indicate the applicability of SMMA as a simple and rapid tool for quantifying global DNA methylation. SMMA may prove useful for genome-wide comparative methylation analyses of malignancies and as an indicator of the demethylation effects of epigenetic drugs.","['Umezu, Tomohiro', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma', 'Ohyashiki, Junko H']","['Umezu T', 'Ohyashiki K', 'Ohyashiki JH']","['Department of Molecular Science, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo 160-0023, Japan. t_umezu@tokyo-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,"['0 (5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine succinimidyl ester)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MBD2 protein)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA/*analysis', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics', 'Humans', 'Rhodamines/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence/*methods']",2011/05/24 06:00,2011/11/10 06:00,['2011/05/24 06:00'],"['2011/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0003-2697(11)00275-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ab.2011.04.035 [doi]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 2011 Aug 15;415(2):145-50. doi: 10.1016/j.ab.2011.04.035.

VX-680, a small-molecule Aurora kinase inhibitor, interferes with mitotic entry and formation of bipolar spindles. Here, we evaluated VX-680 as a potential agent for treatment of all-trans retinoid acid (ATRA)-resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in vitro. METHODS: CD11b expression was utilized to assess cell differentiation by flow cytometry. Immunofluorescence staining was conducted to analyze formation of cell monopolar spindle. Cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay. Sub-G1 population and Annexin V/PI staining were used to measure cell apoptosis. Hoechst 33342 staining was applied for identifying morphological changes in nucleus of apoptotic cell. Aurora-A (Aur-A) activation and the signaling pathways involved in apoptosis were detected by Western blot. JC-1 probe was employed to measure mitochondrial depolarization. RESULTS: VX-680 inhibited Aur-A by reducing autophosphorylation at the activation site, Thr288, accompanied by producing monopolar mitotic spindles in APL cell line NB4-R2 that was resistant to ATRA. In addition, we found that VX-680 inhibited cell proliferation as assessed by MTT assay. Flow cytometry showed that VX-680 led to apoptotic cell death in both dose- and time-dependent manners by either Sub-G1 or Annexin V/PI analysis. Hoechst 33342 staining represented typical apoptotic cells with nuclear fragmentation in VX-680 treated cells. Importantly, VX-680 inhibition of Aurora kinase suppressed Akt-1 activation and induced mitochondrial depolarization, which eventually resulted in apoptosis by activation of caspase pathway, as indicated by increasing proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-3 and poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) in NB4-R2 cells.

SULF1 and SULF2 are two endosulfatases able to cleave specific 6-O sulfate groups within the heparan chains. Their action can modulate signaling processes, many of which with key relevance for cancer development and expansion. SULF1 has been associated with tumor suppressor effects in various models of cancer, whereas SULF2 dysregulation was in relation with protumorigenic actions. However, other observations argue for contradictory effects of these sulfatases in cancer, suggesting the complexity of their action in the tumor microenvironment. METHODS: We compared the expression of the genes encoding SULF1, SULF2 and heparan sulfate proteoglycans in a large panel of cancer samples to their normal tissue counterparts using publicly available gene expression data, including the data obtained from two cohorts of newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma patients, the Oncomine Cancer Microarray database, the Amazonia data base and the ITTACA database. We also analysed prognosis data in relation with these databases. RESULTS: We demonstrated that SULF2 expression in primary multiple myeloma cells was associated with a poor prognosis in two independent large cohorts of patients. It remained an independent predictor when considered together with conventional multiple myeloma prognosis factors. Besides, we observed an over-representation of SULF2 gene expression in skin cancer, colorectal carcinoma, testicular teratoma and liver cancer compared to their normal tissue counterpart. We found that SULF2 was significantly over-expressed in high grade uveal melanoma compared to low grade and in patients presenting colorectal carcinoma compared to benign colon adenoma.We observed that, in addition to previous observations, SULF1 gene expression was increased in T prolymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia and in renal carcinoma compared to corresponding normal tissues. Furthermore, we found that high SULF1 expression was associated with a poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma.Finally, SULF1 and SULF2 were simultaneously overexpressed in 6 cancer types: brain, breast, head and neck, renal, skin and testicular cancers. CONCLUSIONS: SULF1 and SULF2 are overexpressed in various human cancer types and can be associated to progression and prognosis.

We intended to analyze the effects of timing of acute GVHD on leukemia relapse and mortality. METHODS: The outcomes of pre- and postengraftment GVHD were investigated in 384 patients who underwent allogeneic HCT for acute leukemia. RESULTS: Acute GVHD occurred in 100 patients, pre-engraftment in 22 and postengraftment in 78. Compared with postengraftment GVHD, pre-engraftment GVHD was more severe, as assessed by overall grade, with more frequent and more severe skin involvement and higher incidences of non-infectious fever, diarrhea, hepatic dysfunction, renal insufficiency, and weight gain. Compared with patients without acute GVHD, those with postengraftment GVHD had lower cumulative incidence of relapse [CIR; hazard ratio (HR), 0.470; P=0.006] and higher cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (CINRM; HR, 2.568; P<0.001), while those with pre-engraftment GVHD had similar CIR (HR, 0.815; P=0.059) and higher CINRM (HR, 2.872; P=0.036). Overall survival of patients with pre-engraftment GVHD was lower than that of those without acute GVHD (HR, 1.976; P=0.017), which was similar to that of those with postengraftment GVHD (HR, 0.969; P=0.878). Separate analyses of the effects of timing of acute GVHD on post-transplant outcomes in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) showed similar trends. CONCLUSION: Pre-engraftment GVHD might be a 'cytokine storm' type syndrome rather than 'real' GVHD, indicating the need for separate analyses of pre- and postengraftment GVHD in future trials.","['Lee, Jung-Hee', 'Lee, Je-Hwan', 'Kim, Dae-Young', 'Yun, Sung-Cheol', 'Kim, Sung-Doo', 'Choi, Yunsuk', 'Lee, Young-Shin', 'Kang, Young-Ah', 'Jeon, Mi Jin', 'Seol, Miee', 'Lee, Kyoo-Hyung']","['Lee JH', 'Lee JH', 'Kim DY', 'Yun SC', 'Kim SD', 'Choi Y', 'Lee YS', 'Kang YA', 'Jeon MJ', 'Seol M', 'Lee KH']","['Department of Hematology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/mortality', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Republic of Korea/epidemiology', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2011/05/24 06:00,2011/09/21 06:00,['2011/05/24 06:00'],"['2011/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01646.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2011 Aug;87(2):172-81. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01646.x.,,,,,,['(c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with HCLv were overrepresented among patients with HCL seeking relapsed/refractory trials. To compare clinical and molecular features of classic HCL (HCLc) and HCLv, 85 rearrangements expressing immunoglobulin variable heavy chain were sequenced, taken from 20 patients with HCLv and 62 with HCLc. The gene VH4-34, commonly used in autoimmune disorders, was found in eight patients (40%) with HCLv versus six (10%) with HCLc (p = 0.004). Ninety-three percent of the VH4-34 rearrangements were unmutated, defined as >98% homologous to the germline sequence. Clinical features of VH4-34+ patients that were similar to those with HCLv included higher white blood cell counts at diagnosis (p = 0.002) and lower response (p = 0.00001) and progression-free survival (p = 0.007) after first-line cladribine, and shorter overall survival from diagnosis (p < 0.0001). It was found that VH4-34 was independent from HCLv and a stronger predictor than HCLv in associating with poor prognosis. We conclude that VH4-34+ hairy cell leukemia, which only partly overlaps with HCLv, is associated with poor prognosis after single-agent cladribine.

HCL cells in MRD are always strongly CD20 + and CD22 + , and also CD25 + unless the patient has the poor-prognosis variant HCLv. To target relapsed/refractory HCL, immunotherapy has been developed using anti-CD25 and anti-CD22 recombinant immunotoxins, or the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) rituximab alone or combined with purine analogs. The recombinant immunotoxins contain an Fv fragment of a mAb fused to a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin called PE38. BL22 targeting CD22, in phase I and II testing of relapsed/refractory HCL, achieved 47-61% complete remissions (CRs), several of them ongoing after 9-10 years. A completely reversible form of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) was observed in 12% of patients, several of whom could later achieve a partial remission (PR) or CR with LMB-2 targeting CD25. A higher-affinity version of BL22, termed HA22, CAT-8015, or moxetumomab pasudotox, developed to more effectively treat other hematologic malignancies, also achieves CRs in HCL, and with only non-dose-limiting HUS. In separate randomized trials, rituximab is undergoing phase II testing with cladribine for early HCL and with bendamustine or pentostatin for multiply relapsed HCL.","['Kreitman, Robert J', 'Arons, Evgeny', 'Stetler-Stevenson, Maryalice', 'Fitzgerald, David J P', 'Wilson, Wyndham H', 'Pastan, Ira']","['Kreitman RJ', 'Arons E', 'Stetler-Stevenson M', 'Fitzgerald DJ', 'Wilson WH', 'Pastan I']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. kreitmar@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Immunotoxins)'],IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy', 'Salvage Therapy/methods']",2011/05/27 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/05/24 06:00'],"['2011/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.565843 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Jun;52 Suppl 2:82-6. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.565843.,,PMC7435070,"['Z01 BC008753/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 BC010301/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z99 CA999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS1618014'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For reasons that are not yet clear, 40% of patients responded less well. In addition, patients with other CD22-positive malignancies have not yet achieved complete remissions. In trying to understand 'resistance' to immunotoxin therapy, a number of challenging issues have been raised. These include insufficient dosing, the production of neutralizing anti-immunotoxin antibodies, poor access to malignant cells, and resistance to toxin killing. In designing immunotoxins, we employ truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin, which enzymatically inactivates protein synthesis and produces cell death in sensitive cells. To begin to address toxin resistance we have explored combination therapy with the BH3-only mimetic, ABT-737. Our results indicate that immunotoxin-ABT combinations often exhibit greater killing activity than either compound alone and in some instances overcome resistance. Expression of high levels of prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins may contribute to toxin resistance.","['Fitzgerald, David J', 'Moskatel, Elizabeth', 'Ben-Josef, Gal', 'Traini, Roberta', 'Tendler, Tara', 'Sharma, Ashima', 'Antignani, Antonella', 'Mussai, Francis', 'Wayne, Alan', 'Kreitman, Robert J', 'Pastan, Ira']","['Fitzgerald DJ', 'Moskatel E', 'Ben-Josef G', 'Traini R', 'Tendler T', 'Sharma A', 'Antignani A', 'Mussai F', 'Wayne A', 'Kreitman RJ', 'Pastan I']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, CCR, National Cancer Institute, NIH, HHS, Bethesda, MD, USA. djpf@helix.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biphenyl Compounds/therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy', 'Nitrophenols/therapeutic use', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/immunology', 'Sulfonamides/therapeutic use']",2011/05/27 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/05/24 06:00'],"['2011/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.569961 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Jun;52 Suppl 2:79-81. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.569961.,,PMC7450489,"['Z01 BC008753/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 BC010020/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS1611871'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical course of HCL-V is variable but usually more aggressive, and the median survival of patients with HCL-V is significantly shorter than that of HCL-C. The therapeutic approach to HCL-V is still debated. Various treatment approaches active in HCL-C achieve partial response (PR) or no response in HCL-V, and remission is usually shorter than in HCL-C. In addition, HCL-V seems to be resistant to therapeutic modalities usually highly effective in the treatment of HCL-C. Cladribine (2-CdA) is significantly less active in HCL-V than in HCL-C. In addition, the majority of patients with HCL-V require more than one cycle of 2-CdA to maintain PR. Patients with HCL-V treated with pentostatin also have a poorer clinical outcome and a lower response rate than those of patients with HCL-C.

Pentostatin was initially explored in patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Both pentostatin and cladribine, purine nucleoside analogs, have been utilized to successfully treat HCL. The high degree of complete and durable remission observed with either agent resulted in many believing that the treatment of this rare disease had been fully optimized. However, a considerable number of patients will relapse. While tremendous progress has been made in initial management, the issues related to optimal therapy, timing of initiation of treatment, and discovery of novel agents that may be effective in those who have relapsed are important. Investigational agents currently being explored in chronic lymphocytic leukemia may also have benefit for those patients who have relapsed or are resistant to therapy of hairy cell leukemia. Many important questions remain (e.g. importance of minimal residual disease) and will require international collaboration to fully address these unanswered questions.

From this we have been able to conclude that there is no significant difference in outcome between the two agents either at first or subsequent lines of therapy. Overall, the complete response (CR) rate is 81% and the median disease-free survival (DFS) is 16 years. After relapse or non-response patients can be successfully retreated with pentostatin or cladribine achieving a lower rate of CRs with each line of therapy, although these remain equally durable. Complete response and pretreatment counts of hemoglobin >10 g/dL together with platelets >100 x 10(9)/L are associated with the longest DFS. Importantly, for patients achieving a CR the DFS is five times as long as for those achieving a partial response (PR). Patients still in CR at 5 years have only a 25% risk of relapse by 15 years. Outcomes for patients with recurrent disease have improved with the addition of rituximab to either purine analog. Overall, only eight patients have died of HCL-related causes. Patients with HCL who achieve a CR can expect a normal lifespan.","['Dearden, Claire E', 'Else, Monica', 'Catovsky, Daniel']","['Dearden CE', 'Else M', 'Catovsky D']","['Department of Haemato-Oncology, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Sutton, Surrey, UK.

This review returns us to the earlier history of SEM, when the surface topography of normal and neoplastic cells was visualized and reported for the first time, in an era before the emergence and use of monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry, now used routinely to define cells by their immunophenotype. Surface microvilli are characteristic for normal and leukemic lymphoid cells, myelo-monocytic cells lack microvilli and show surface ruffles, while leukemic plasma and myeloma cells and megakaryocytes display large surface blebs. HCL cell surfaces are complex and typically 'hybrid' in nature, displaying both lymphoid and monocytic features with florid ruffles of varying sizes interspersed with clumps of short microvilli cytoplasm. The surface features of other leukemic cells and photomicrographs of immuno-SEM labeling of cells employing antibodies and colloidal gold, reported more than 20 years ago, are shown.","['Polliack, Aaron', 'Tadmor, Tamar']","['Polliack A', 'Tadmor T']","['Department of Hematology, Hadassah University Hospital, Hebrew University Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel. apol@cc.huji.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning/*methods', 'Surface Properties']",2011/05/27 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/05/24 06:00'],"['2011/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.565095 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Jun;52 Suppl 2:14-7. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.565095.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), an aggressive neoplasm etiologically associated with human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1), exhibits invasive tropism into various organs, resulting in disease progression and resistance to treatment. In the present study, we showed that MUC1 is overexpressed exclusively in cells of ATL among hematological malignancies. Furthermore, increased expression of MUC1 correlated with a poor prognosis, suggesting MUC1 to be a prognostic marker in ATL. Various functional analyses with knockdown experiments using a specific siRNA for MUC1 revealed that MUC1 is involved in cell growth, cell aggregation, and resistance to apoptosis. Although it has been shown that the anti-adhesive properties of MUC1 facilitate migration and metastasis of tumor cells, our findings indicated that MUC1 contributes to cell-cell adhesion. Mucins thus seem to play a role in the pathogenesis and/or progression of ATL.","['Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Komoda, Minori', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Yonezawa, Suguru', 'Tsutsumida, Hideaki', 'Nagai, Kazuhiro', 'Atogami, Sunao', 'Tsuruda, Kazuto', 'Osaka, Akemi', 'Sasaki, Daisuke', 'Yanagihara, Katsunori', 'Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Tsukasaki, Kunihiro', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Kamihira, Shimeru']","['Hasegawa H', 'Komoda M', 'Yamada Y', 'Yonezawa S', 'Tsutsumida H', 'Nagai K', 'Atogami S', 'Tsuruda K', 'Osaka A', 'Sasaki D', 'Yanagihara K', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Kamihira S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MUC1 protein, human)', '0 (Mucin-1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Aggregation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Progression', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mucin-1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'U937 Cells']",2011/05/24 06:00,2011/10/25 06:00,['2011/05/24 06:00'],"['2011/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.559671 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Jun;52(6):1108-17. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.559671.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, a novel homozygous mutation (P132A) was discovered in a patient with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia and in vivo studies demonstrated that its ectopic expression was oncogenic in a mouse xenotransplant model. This study defines a novel JAK3 mutation among patients with N-DS AML and demonstrates that normal individuals can also display germline JAK3 substitutions, previously proven to have oncogenic properties, in vitro and in vivo. The discovery of these substitutions in normal donors encourages future studies to define new risk factors among patients with MPDs.","['Riera, Ludovica', 'Lasorsa, Elena', 'Bonello, Lisa', 'Sismondi, Francesca', 'Tondat, Fabrizio', 'Di Bello, Cristiana', 'Di Celle, Paola Francia', 'Chiarle, Roberto', 'Godio, Laura', 'Pich, Achille', 'Facchetti, Fabio', 'Ponzoni, Maurilio', 'Marmont, Filippo', 'Zanon, Carlo', 'Bardelli, Alberto', 'Inghirami, Giorgio']","['Riera L', 'Lasorsa E', 'Bonello L', 'Sismondi F', 'Tondat F', 'Di Bello C', 'Di Celle PF', 'Chiarle R', 'Godio L', 'Pich A', 'Facchetti F', 'Ponzoni M', 'Marmont F', 'Zanon C', 'Bardelli A', 'Inghirami G']","['Center for Experimental Research and Medical Studies, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Order', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 3/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'NIH 3T3 Cells']",2011/05/24 06:00,2011/12/21 06:00,['2011/05/24 06:00'],"['2011/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.574757 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Sep;52(9):1742-50. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.574757.

MDR variants display enhanced invasion compared with parental cells. Results from xenografts in SCID (severe combined immunodeficiancy) mice are consistent with these in vitro observations. Furthermore, P-gp and cIAP are overexpressed and co-localize with protein kinase C-epsilon (PKC-epsilon) in MDR variants.

Inhibitors of JAK2 entered clinical trials in 2007 and ushered in an unprecedented era of trials with agents specifically designed for MPNs. Currently 10 different JAK2 inhibitors have been tested in myelofibrosis (MF) with varying degrees of specificity for the JAK2 kinase. In MF these agents have shown near universal ability to decrease pathologic splenomegaly and improve disease-associated symptoms. However, the ability of these agents to significantly impact disease-associated cytopenias, JAK2 allele burden, or bone marrow histologic features remains unclear. JAK2 inhibition in polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) for this class of agents appears promising to reduce myeloproliferations, symptoms, and perhaps prevent thrombohemorrhagic events. Alternative agents (with alternative targets), used either alone or in combination, might perhaps further augment the spectrum of efficacy and therapeutic options for MPNs.","['Tibes, Raoul', 'Mesa, Ruben A']","['Tibes R', 'Mesa RA']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ 85259, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use']",2011/05/24 06:00,2011/11/01 06:00,['2011/05/24 06:00'],"['2011/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.566952 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Jul;52(7):1178-87. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.566952.

In contrast to 2, 1 did not elicit any cytotoxic activity in A549 and BEAS-2B human lung epithelial cells and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells using a MTS assay. Compound 1 dose-dependently inhibited ovalbumin (OVA)-induced increases in total and eosinophil counts, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 levels in lavage fluid, and serum OVA-specific IgE level in a mouse asthma model. Compound 1 attenuated OVA-induced airway eosinophilia, mucus production, mast cell degranulation, pro-inflammatory biomarker expression in lung tissues, and airway hyper-responsiveness. This substance also blocked p65 nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity in the OVA-challenged lung and in TNF-alpha-stimulated human lung epithelial cells. The present findings reveal for the first time that 1 retains the anti-inflammatory activities of 2 for asthma probably through the inhibition of NF-kappaB. 14-Deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide (1) may be considered as a safer analogue of 2 for the potential treatment of asthma.","['Guan, Shou-Ping', 'Kong, Li-Ren', 'Cheng, Chang', 'Lim, Jonathan C W', 'Wong, W S Fred']","['Guan SP', 'Kong LR', 'Cheng C', 'Lim JC', 'Wong WS']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine , National University Health System, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Nat Prod,Journal of natural products,7906882,"['0 (14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '410105JHGR (andrographolide)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)']",IM,"['Andrographis/chemistry', 'Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Asthma/chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Diterpenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lung/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Ovalbumin/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",2011/05/24 06:00,2011/10/04 06:00,['2011/05/24 06:00'],"['2011/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/np2002572 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nat Prod. 2011 Jun 24;74(6):1484-90. doi: 10.1021/np2002572.

Since patients with multiple enchondromas have occasionally been reported to have these conditions, we hypothesized that the same mutations would occur in cartilaginous neoplasms. Approximately 1200 mesenchymal tumours, including 220 cartilaginous tumours, 222 osteosarcomas and another approximately 750 bone and soft tissue tumours, were screened for IDH1 R132 mutations, using Sequenom((R)) mass spectrometry. Cartilaginous tumours and chondroblastic osteosarcomas, wild-type for IDH1 R132, were analysed for IDH2 (R172, R140) mutations. Validation was performed by capillary sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion. Heterozygous somatic IDH1/IDH2 mutations, which result in the production of a potential oncometabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate, were only detected in central and periosteal cartilaginous tumours, and were found in at least 56% of these, approximately 40% of which were represented by R132C. IDH1 R132H mutations were confirmed by immunoreactivity for this mutant allele. The ratio of IDH1:IDH2 mutation was 10.6 : 1. No IDH2 R140 mutations were detected. Mutations were detected in enchondromas through to conventional central and dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas, in patients with both solitary and multiple neoplasms. No germline mutations were detected. No mutations were detected in peripheral chondrosarcomas and osteochondromas. In conclusion, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations represent the first common genetic abnormalities to be identified in conventional central and periosteal cartilaginous tumours.

This dependency has led to the development of BCR-ABL1 inhibitors, such as imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib, which have proved to be highly efficacious treatments for CML. The European LeukemiaNet guidelines have established the importance of achieving a certain depth of response at different time points during imatinib therapy for patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase. Patients who achieve a complete cytogenetic response by 12 months or a major molecular response by 18 months are classified as optimal responders and deemed to have excellent long-term outcomes. Conversely, failing to achieve such milestones is associated with an increased risk of worse long-term outcomes, such as loss of response, disease progression, or death. With ongoing treatment, patients not in complete cytogenetic response face a decreasing probability of ever achieving a complete cytogenetic response or major molecular response and increasing risk of disease progression. Available data therefore support treatment recommendations based on achieving defined levels of response within a specified duration of treatment. Recent data have shown that dasatinib and nilotinib used as frontline CML therapy result in higher response rates that are achieved at earlier time points compared with standard-dose imatinib therapy. Future analyses will need to determine whether these higher rates of deep and fast responses translate into improved long-term survival.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Cortes JE', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA. aquintas@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cytogenetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Probability', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2011/05/21 06:00,2012/01/12 06:00,['2011/05/21 06:00'],"['2011/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/25 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26196 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2011 Dec 1;117(23):5261-70. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26196.

In this study, the authors evaluated PLS natural history, patient outcomes, and commonly deregulated protein biomarkers. METHODS: Medical records from patients (n = 155) who had PLS from 1993 to 2010 were reviewed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify independent prognosticators. A PLS tissue microarray (TMA) (n = 56 patient specimens) was constructed for immunohistochemical analysis of molecular markers, and p53 gene sequencing (exons 5-9) was conducted. RESULTS: The average patient age was 57 years, and the patients presented with primary disease (n = 102), recurrent disease (n = 16), and metastatic disease (n = 37). Lower extremity was the most common disease site (40%), and the average tumor size was 11 cm. Complete follow-up data were available for 83 patients, and their median follow-up was 22.6 months. The 5-year disease-specific survival rate was 53%; and recurrent disease, unresectability, and microscopic positive margins were identified as predictors of a poor prognosis. Systemic relapse (the strongest poor prognostic determinant) developed in 35% of patients with localized PLS. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (an adipogenic marker), B-cell leukemia 2 and survivin (survival factors), vascular endothelial growth factor (an angiogenic factor), matrix metalloproteinase 2, and other biomarkers. Frequent loss of retinoblastoma protein expression and high p53 mutation rates (approximately 60%) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: PLS is an aggressive, metastasizing sarcoma. Identifying ubiquitous molecular events underlying PLS progression is crucial for progress in patient management and outcomes.","['Ghadimi, Markus P', 'Liu, Ping', 'Peng, Tingsheng', 'Bolshakov, Svetlana', 'Young, Eric D', 'Torres, Keila E', 'Colombo, Chiara', 'Hoffman, Aviad', 'Broccoli, Dominique', 'Hornick, Jason L', 'Lazar, Alexander J', 'Pisters, Peter', 'Pollock, Raphael E', 'Lev, Dina']","['Ghadimi MP', 'Liu P', 'Peng T', 'Bolshakov S', 'Young ED', 'Torres KE', 'Colombo C', 'Hoffman A', 'Broccoli D', 'Hornick JL', 'Lazar AJ', 'Pisters P', 'Pollock RE', 'Lev D']","['Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (PPAR gamma)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Female', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Liposarcoma/chemistry/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'PPAR gamma/analysis/physiology', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Tissue Array Analysis']",2011/05/21 06:00,2012/01/12 06:00,['2011/05/21 06:00'],"['2011/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26195 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2011 Dec 1;117(23):5359-69. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26195.

Serological and molecular markers of HBV, HCV and HDV viruses were analyzed for determination of the role of these hepatitis viruses in clinical outcomes of leukemia disorders. Increasing risk factors of leukemia were evaluated statistically in two studied groups by SPSS software. One of molecular and immunological markers of HBV, HDV and HCV was found in 24 of 100 (24%), 22 of 100 (22%), and 1 of 100 (1%) patients with leukemia and in 12 of 100 (12%), 6 of 100 (6%), and 2 of 100 (2%) control patients.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) identification was performed by PCR followed by DNA sequencing analysis. Bacteria and fungi identification was obtained by standard microbiological culture tests. RESULTS: HSV-1 was found in 10.37% of individual patient samples. One sample was positive for HSV-4. On D14, we found an association between the severity of mucositis and the presence of HSV (p = 0.0347) and Candida spp. (p = 0.0078). At D56, we found an association between the severity of mucositis and the presence of HSV on D14 (p < 0.0001) and HSV presence (p = 0.0317).

The reasons for the specified recommendations are explained and important issues are outlined by comprehensive examples. Particular attention is paid to the warning of the application of suboptimal methods that may lead to seriously biased results and conclusions. In the presence of a competing risk like death, Kaplan-Meier analysis should not be applied for time-to-remission endpoints. The appropriate method to estimate the probabilities of a time-to-remission endpoint is the calculation of its cumulative incidence function. However, the exact date of remission is hardly known. Detection of remission depends strongly on evaluation frequencies. Complex composite endpoints comprising many events with considerably heterogeneous severity imply difficulties with interpretation. Time-to-remission and complex composite endpoints are not recommended for primary judgment on efficacy. It is rather advisable to investigate remission status at a fixed time point as a primary endpoint, followed by progression-free and overall survival. For patients with the intended remission success at the time point of interest, relapse-free survival provides an additional primary outcome.","['Pfirrmann, M', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Lauseker, M', 'Saussele, S', 'Hehlmann, R', 'Hasford, J']","['Pfirrmann M', 'Hochhaus A', 'Lauseker M', 'Saussele S', 'Hehlmann R', 'Hasford J']","['Institut fur Medizinische Informationsverarbeitung, Biometrie und Epidemiologie-IBE, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Munchen, Germany. pfi@ibe.med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Computer Simulation', '*Endpoint Determination', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology/*mortality/therapy', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic/*standards', 'Remission Induction', 'Research Design/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', '*Statistics as Topic', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/05/21 06:00,2011/11/08 06:00,['2011/05/21 06:00'],"['2011/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011116 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.116 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Sep;25(9):1433-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.116.

In this study, we investigated whether FBW7 is regulated by microRNAs, using a screen combining bioinformatic analysis, luciferase reporters and microRNA libraries. The ubiquitous miR-27a was identified as a major suppressor of FBW7 and in line with this, miR-27a prohibited ubiquitylation and turnover of the key FBW7 substrate cyclin E. Notably, we found that miR-27a only suppresses FBW7 during specific cell cycle phases, relieving its negative impact at the G1 to S-phase transition, prior to cyclin E protein degradation. We also demonstrate that attenuation of FBW7 by miR-27a overexpression leads to improper cell cycle progression and DNA replication stress, consistent with dysregulation of cyclin E expression. Finally, in the context of human cancer, miR-27a was discovered to be generally overexpressed in pediatric B-ALL and its expression to be inversely correlated with that of FBW7 in hyperdiploid cases of B-ALL. These data provide evidence for microRNA-mediated regulation of FBW7, and highlight the role of miR-27a as a novel factor fine-tuning the periodic events regulating cell cycle progression.","['Lerner, Mikael', 'Lundgren, Josefin', 'Akhoondi, Shahab', 'Jahn, Angelina', 'Ng, Hwee-Fang', 'Akbari Moqadam, Farhad', 'Oude Vrielink, Joachim A F', 'Agami, Reuven', 'Den Boer, Monique L', 'Grander, Dan', 'Sangfelt, Olle']","['Lerner M', 'Lundgren J', 'Akhoondi S', 'Jahn A', 'Ng HF', 'Akbari Moqadam F', 'Oude Vrielink JA', 'Agami R', 'Den Boer ML', 'Grander D', 'Sangfelt O']","['Department of Oncology-Pathology; Cancer Center Karolinska (CCK), Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN27 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Cyclin E/genetics/*metabolism', 'F-Box Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/05/21 06:00,2012/03/17 06:00,['2011/05/21 06:00'],"['2011/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['16248 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.10.13.16248 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2011 Jul 1;10(13):2172-83. doi: 10.4161/cc.10.13.16248.

Valaciclovir, fluoxetine and pantoprazole were given concomitantly. A methotrexate overdosage was shown at 36 h after infusion associated with a severe renal failure. Alkaline hyperhydration, folinic acid and carboxypeptidase G2 were given. Prescription analyses by pharmacists and literature research have permitted us to suggest that a drug-drug interaction between methotrexate and proton pump inhibitors (PPI) was responsible for this renal failure. Several mechanisms of interaction were suggested and might be related to the inhibition of renal methotrexate transporters by PPI, an increase in the methotrexate efflux to the blood by an upregulation of multidrug resistance protein 3 by PPI or genetic polymorphisms. This case shows that pharmacists can help physicians to optimize patient treatment: they consensually decided on the systematic discontinuation of PPI or a switch to ranitidine when patients were treated by high-dose methotrexate.","['Ranchon, F', 'Vantard, N', 'Gouraud, A', 'Schwiertz, V', 'Franchon, E', 'Pham, B N', 'Vial, T', 'You, B', 'Bouafia, F', 'Salles, G', 'Rioufol, C']","['Ranchon F', 'Vantard N', 'Gouraud A', 'Schwiertz V', 'Franchon E', 'Pham BN', 'Vial T', 'You B', 'Bouafia F', 'Salles G', 'Rioufol C']","['Clinical Oncology, Department of Pharmacy, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre Benite, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,"['0 (2-Pyridinylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazoles)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Proton Pump Inhibitors)', '01K63SUP8D (Fluoxetine)', 'D8TST4O562 (Pantoprazole)', 'HG18B9YRS7 (Valine)', 'MZ1IW7Q79D (Valacyclovir)', 'X4HES1O11F (Acyclovir)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['2-Pyridinylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Acyclovir/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Fluoxetine/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Pantoprazole', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Renal Insufficiency/etiology', 'Valacyclovir', 'Valine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2011/05/21 06:00,2011/10/28 06:00,['2011/05/21 06:00'],"['2010/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['000327372 [pii]', '10.1159/000327372 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2011;57(3):225-9. doi: 10.1159/000327372.

We have identified that HOXA10 and PBX1 are expressed in osteoprogenitors; however, their role in osteogenesis has not been established. To determine the mechanism of HOXA10-PBX-mediated regulation of osteoblast commitment and the related gene expression, PBX1 or HOX10 were depleted (shRNA or genetic deletion, respectively) or exogenously expressed in C3H10T1/2, bone marrow stromal progenitors, and MC3T3-E1 (preosteoblast) cells. Overexpression of HOXA10 increased the expression of osteoblast-related genes, osteoblast differentiation and mineralization; expression of PBX1 impaired osteogenic commitment of pluripotent cells and the differentiation of osteoblasts. In contrast, the targeted depletion of PBX1 by shRNA increased the expression of bone marker genes (osterix, alkaline phosphatase, BSP, and osteocalcin). Chromatin-associated PBX1 and HOXA10 were present at osteoblast-related gene promoters preceding gene expression, but PBX1 was absent from promoters during the transcription of bone-related genes, including osterix (Osx). Further, PBX1 complexes were associated with histone deacetylases normally linked with chromatin inactivation. Loss of PBX1 but not of HOXA10 from the Osx promoter was associated with increases in the recruitment of histone acetylases (p300), as well as decreased H3K9 methylation, reflecting transcriptional activation. We propose PBX1 plays a central role in attenuating the activity of HOXA10 as an activator of osteoblast-related genes and functions to establish the proper timing of gene expression during osteogenesis, resulting in proper matrix maturation and mineral deposition in differentiated osteoblasts.","['Gordon, Jonathan A R', 'Hassan, Mohammad Q', 'Koss, Matthew', 'Montecino, Martin', 'Selleri, Licia', 'van Wijnen, Andre J', 'Stein, Janet L', 'Stein, Gary S', 'Lian, Jane B']","['Gordon JA', 'Hassan MQ', 'Koss M', 'Montecino M', 'Selleri L', 'van Wijnen AJ', 'Stein JL', 'Stein GS', 'Lian JB']","['Department of Cell Biology and Cancer Center, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Mass., USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Cells Tissues Organs,"Cells, tissues, organs",100883360,"['0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sp7 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sp7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '164384-16-1 (Hoxa10 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Calcification, Physiologic/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Multiprotein Complexes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Osteoblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Osteogenesis/*genetics', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Sp7 Transcription Factor', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/05/21 06:00,2011/12/28 06:00,['2011/05/21 06:00'],"['2011/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/28 06:00 [medline]']","['000324790 [pii]', '10.1159/000324790 [doi]']",ppublish,Cells Tissues Organs. 2011;194(2-4):146-50. doi: 10.1159/000324790.

Therefore, we sought to dissect this pathway by comparing the gene expression profiles of wild type and Alox5(-/-) LSCs. DNA microarray analysis revealed a small group of candidate genes that exhibited changes in the levels of transcription in the absence of Alox5 expression. In particular, we noted that the expression of the Msr1 gene was upregulated in Alox5(-/-) LSCs, suggesting that Msr1 suppresses the proliferation of LSCs. Using CML mouse model, we show that Msr1 is downregulated by BCR-ABL and this down-regulation is partially restored by Alox5 deletion, and that Msr1 deletion causes acceleration of CML development. Moreover, Msr1 deletion markedly increases LSC function through its effects on cell cycle progression and apoptosis. We also show that Msr1 affects CML development by regulating the PI3K-AKT pathway and beta-Catenin. Together, these results demonstrate that Msr1 suppresses LSCs and CML development. The enhancement of the tumor suppressor function of Msr1 may be of significance in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for CML.","['Chen, Yaoyu', 'Sullivan, Con', 'Peng, Cong', 'Shan, Yi', 'Hu, Yiguo', 'Li, Dongguang', 'Li, Shaoguang']","['Chen Y', 'Sullivan C', 'Peng C', 'Shan Y', 'Hu Y', 'Li D', 'Li S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (MSR1 protein, human)', '0 (Scavenger Receptors, Class A)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/physiology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology/physiology', 'Scavenger Receptors, Class A/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2011/05/21 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/05/21 06:00'],"['2011/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44788-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-11-316760 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jul 14;118(2):390-400. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-11-316760.

Mean age at evaluation and follow-up was 23 and 14.7 years, respectively. In the whole cohort, mean femoral Z-score was -0.19 +/- 0.08. Two factors were associated with lower femoral BMD transplantation (-0.49 +/- 0.15 vs -0.04 +/- 0.10 in the chemotherapy group; P = .006) and female sex (-0.34 +/- 0.10 vs -0.03 +/- 0.13; P = .03).

A slight reduction in lumbar BMD (mean Z-score, -0.37 +/- 0.08) was detected in the whole cohort without difference between the transplantation and chemotherapy groups. Among patients who received a transplant, younger age at transplantation was correlated with a low lumbar BMD (P = .03). We conclude that adults who had received only chemotherapy for childhood leukemia have a slight reduction in their lumbar BMD and a normal femoral BMD. Patients who received a transplant with gonadal deficiency have a reduced femoral BMD which might increase the fracture risk later in life.","['Le Meignen, Marion', 'Auquier, Pascal', 'Barlogis, Vincent', 'Sirvent, Nicolas', 'Contet, Audrey', 'Simeoni, Marie-Claude', 'Galambrun, Claire', 'Poiree, Marilyne', 'Chastagner, Pascal', 'Play, Barbara', 'Villes, Virginie', 'Berbis, Julie', 'Chambost, Herve', 'Bordigoni, Pierre', 'Michel, Gerard']","['Le Meignen M', 'Auquier P', 'Barlogis V', 'Sirvent N', 'Contet A', 'Simeoni MC', 'Galambrun C', 'Poiree M', 'Chastagner P', 'Play B', 'Villes V', 'Berbis J', 'Chambost H', 'Bordigoni P', 'Michel G']","[""Department of Paediatric Onco-hematology, Hospital L'Archet II, Nice, France. le-meignen-diop.m@pediatrie-chulenval-nice.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Bone Density', 'Child', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/therapy', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prospective Studies', '*Survivors', 'Young Adult']",2011/05/21 06:00,2011/10/19 06:00,['2011/05/21 06:00'],"['2011/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40778-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-01-332866 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Aug 11;118(6):1481-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-01-332866.

Abrogation of IL-21 signaling has recently been shown to reduce GVHD while retaining graft-versus-leukemia/lymphoma (GVL) responses. However, the mechanisms by which IL-21 may lead to a separation of GVHD and GVL remain incompletely understood. In a murine MHC-mismatched BM transplantation model, we observed that IL-21 receptor knockout (IL-21R KO) donor T cells mediate decreased systemic and gastrointestinal GVHD in recipients of a transplant. This reduction in GVHD was associated with expansion of transplanted donor regulatory T cells and with tissue-specific modulation of Th-cell function. IL-21R KO and wild-type donor T cells showed equivalent alloactivation, but IL-21R KO T cells showed decreased infiltration and inflammatory cytokine production within the mesenteric lymph nodes. However, Th-cell cytokine production was maintained peripherally, and IL-21R KO T cells mediated equivalent immunity against A20 and P815 hematopoietic tumors. In summary, abrogation of IL-21 signaling in donor T cells leads to tissue-specific modulation of immunity, such that gastrointestinal GVHD is reduced, but peripheral T-cell function and GVL capacity are retained. IL-21 is thus an exciting target for therapeutic intervention and improvement of clinical transplantation outcomes.","['Hanash, Alan M', 'Kappel, Lucy W', 'Yim, Nury L', 'Nejat, Rebecca A', 'Goldberg, Gabrielle L', 'Smith, Odette M', 'Rao, Uttam K', 'Dykstra, Lindsay', 'Na, Il-Kang', 'Holland, Amanda M', 'Dudakov, Jarrod A', 'Liu, Chen', 'Murphy, George F', 'Leonard, Warren J', 'Heller, Glenn', 'van den Brink, Marcel R M']","['Hanash AM', 'Kappel LW', 'Yim NL', 'Nejat RA', 'Goldberg GL', 'Smith OM', 'Rao UK', 'Dykstra L', 'Na IK', 'Holland AM', 'Dudakov JA', 'Liu C', 'Murphy GF', 'Leonard WJ', 'Heller G', 'van den Brink MR']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (IL21R protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-21 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Interleukins)', 'MKM3CA6LT1 (interleukin-21)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/*genetics/physiology', 'Interleukin-21 Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Interleukins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Organ Specificity/genetics/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/physiology', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Immunology']",2011/05/21 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/05/21 06:00'],"['2011/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44795-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-07-294785 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jul 14;118(2):446-55. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-07-294785.

It has become of critical importance to thoroughly evaluate their interrelationships and relative prognostic importance. Gene expression profiling was conducted in a well-characterized cohort of 439 AML patients (age < 60 years) to determine expression levels of EVI1, WT1, BCL2, ABCB1, BAALC, FLT3, CD34, INDO, ERG and MN1. A variety of AML-specific mutations were evaluated, that is, FLT3, NPM1, N-RAS, K-RAS, IDH1, IDH2, and CEBPA(DM/SM) (double/single). Univariable survival analysis shows that (1) patients with FLT3(ITD) mutations have inferior overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS), whereas CEBPA(DM) and NPM1 mutations indicate favorable OS and EFS in intermediate-risk AML, and (2) high transcript levels of BAALC, CD34, MN1, EVl1, and ERG predict inferior OS and EFS. In multivariable survival analysis, CD34, ERG, and CEBPA(DM) remain significant. Using survival tree and regression methodologies, we show that CEBPA(DM), CD34, and IDH2 mutations are capable of separating the intermediate group into 2 AML subgroups with highly distinctive survival characteristics (OS at 60 months: 51.9% vs 14.9%).

These mechanisms are orchestrated in part by transcriptional regulators. The key hematopoietic transcription factor stem cell leukemia (SCL)/TAL1 is required in early hematopoietic progenitors for specification of the megakaryocytic lineage. These early functions have, so far, prevented full investigation of its role in megakaryocyte development in loss-of-function studies. Here, we report that SCL critically controls terminal megakaryocyte maturation. In vivo deletion of Scl specifically in the megakaryocytic lineage affects all key attributes of megakaryocyte progenitors (MkPs), namely, proliferation, ploidization, cytoplasmic maturation, and platelet release. Genome-wide expression analysis reveals increased expression of the cell-cycle regulator p21 in Scl-deleted MkPs. Importantly, p21 knockdown-mediated rescue of Scl-mutant MkPs shows full restoration of cell-cycle progression and partial rescue of the nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation defects. Therefore, SCL-mediated transcriptional control of p21 is essential for terminal maturation of MkPs.

Gyp also changed one of the primary indicators of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress due to the promotion of ATF6-alpha and ATF4-alpha associated with Ca(2+) release. Gyp reduced the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax due to an increase in the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and inhibited levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.

In Belarus patients with childhood ALL are treated according to ALL-MB protocols, which do not use MRD-based risk stratification. To evaluate the prognostic significance of MRD for ALL-MB-2002/2008 protocols, MRD was quantified by RQ-PCR in 68 ALL patients at four time points: on day 15, on day 36, before and after maintenance therapy (MT). MRD positivity, as well as quantitative level of MRD were analyzed and compared between patients who stayed in remission and relapsed. Relapse-free survival revealed to be significantly associated with MRD levels at different time points. Unfavorable prognosis was shown for MRD>/=10(-3) on day 36 (p<0.001), and any positive MRD before (p<0.001) and after (p=0.001) MT. Multivariate Cox regression analysis proved MRD as independent significant prognosis factor at day 36 (p=0.005) and before MT (p=0.001).

The cytostatic activity of the QCT-loaded micelles toward different human cancer cell lines and normal cells was investigated. The results showed that the solubility of QCT entrapped in mPEG750-b-OCL micelles was substantially increased up to 1 mg/ml, which is approximately 110 times higher than that of its solubility in water (9 mug/ml). The average particle size of QCT-loaded micelles ranged from 14 to 19 nm. The QCT loading capacity of the polymeric micelles with naphthyl groups was higher than that with benzyl groups (10% and 6%, respectively). QCT-loaded, benzyl- and naphthyl-modified micelles effectively inhibited the growth of both sensitive and resistance cancer cells (human erythromyelogenous leukemia cells (K562) and small lung carcinoma cells (GLC4)). However, the benzyl-modified micelles have a good cytocompatibility (in the concentration range investigated (up to 100 mug/ml), they are well tolerated by living cells), whereas their naphthyl counterparts showed some cytotoxicity at higher concentrations (60-100 mug/ml). Flow cytometry demonstrated that the mechanism underlying the growth inhibitory effect of QCT in its free form was inducing cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. Benzyl-modified micelles loaded with QCT also exhibited this cycle arresting the effect of cancer cells. In conclusion, this paper shows the enhancement of solubility and cell cycle arrest of QCT loaded into micelles composed of mPEG750-b-OCL modified with benzyl end groups. These micelles are therefore considered to be an attractive vehicle for the (targeted) delivery of QCT to tumors.","['Khonkarn, Ruttiros', 'Mankhetkorn, Samlee', 'Hennink, Wim E', 'Okonogi, Siriporn']","['Khonkarn R', 'Mankhetkorn S', 'Hennink WE', 'Okonogi S']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Science, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharm Biopharm,European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,9109778,"['0 (Caproates)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Micelles)', '0 (Polymers)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '56RE988L1R (caprolactone)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)']",IM,"['Caproates/administration & dosage/*chemistry', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Carriers/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Drug Delivery Systems/methods', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lactones/administration & dosage/*chemistry', '*Micelles', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Particle Size', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage/*chemistry', 'Polymers/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Quercetin/*administration & dosage/*chemistry', 'Solubility']",2011/05/21 06:00,2012/04/12 06:00,['2011/05/21 06:00'],"['2011/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0939-6411(11)00153-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejpb.2011.04.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharm Biopharm. 2011 Oct;79(2):268-75. doi: 10.1016/j.ejpb.2011.04.011.

However, the precise molecular mechanisms have not been fully defined. SB extract and SB-derived polyphenols (wogonin, baicalin, and baicalein) were used to determine their anti-proliferative mechanisms. Baicalein significantly inhibited the proliferation of PaCa cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, whereas wogonin and baicalin exhibited a much less robust effect. Treatment with baicalein induced apoptosis with release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and activation of caspase-3 and -7 and PARP. The general caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk reversed baicalein-induced apoptosis, indicating a caspase-dependent mechanism. Baicalein decreased expression of Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family, presumably through a transcriptional mechanism. Genetic knockdown of Mcl-1 resulted in marked induction of apoptosis. The effect of baicalein on apoptosis was significantly attenuated by Mcl-1 over-expression, suggesting a critical role of Mcl-1 in this process.

CD34+ AML cells are 10-15-fold more resistant to daunorubicin (DNR) than CD34- AML cells. Curcumin is a major component of turmeric that has shown cytotoxic activity in multiple cancers; however, its anti-cancer activity has not been well studied in DNR-insensitive CD34+ AML cells. The aim of this study was to therefore to explore curcumin-induced cytotoxicity in DNR-insensitive CD34+ AML cell lines (KG1a, Kasumi-1), DNR-sensitive U937 AML cells, and primary CD34+ AML bone-marrow-derived cells. METHODS: Primary human CD34+ cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells or bone marrow mononuclear cells using a CD34 MicroBead kit. The growth inhibitory effects of curcumin were evaluated by MTT and colony-formation assays. Cell cycle distribution was examined by propidium iodide (PI) assay. Apoptosis was analyzed by Wright-Giemsa, Hoechst 33342 and Annexin-V/PI staining assays. The change in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was examined by JC-1 staining and flow cytometry. Expression of apoptosis-related proteins was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Short interfering RNA (siRNA) against Bcl-2 was used in CD34+ KG1a and Kasumi-1 cells incubated with/without DNR. RESULTS: Curcumin inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis and G1/S arrest in both DNR-insensitive KG1a, Kasumi-1 and DNR-sensitive U937 cells. Curcumin-induced apoptosis was associated with reduced expression of both Bcl-2 mRNA and protein, subsequent loss of MMP, and activation of caspase-3 followed by PARP degradation. Curcumin synergistically enhanced the cytotoxic effect of DNR in DNR-insensitive KG1a and Kasumi-1 cells, consistent with decreased Bcl-2 expression. Accordingly, siRNA against Bcl-2 increased the susceptibility of KG1a and Kasumi-1 cells to DNR-induced apoptosis. More importantly, curcumin suppressed Bcl-2 expression, selectively inhibited proliferation and synergistically enhanced the cytotoxicity of DNR in primary CD34+ AML cells, while showing limited lethality in normal CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors. CONCLUSION: Curcumin down-regulates Bcl-2 and induces apoptosis in DNR-insensitive CD34+ AML cell lines and primary CD34+ AML cells.","['Rao, Jia', 'Xu, Duo-Rong', 'Zheng, Fei-Meng', 'Long, Zi-Jie', 'Huang, Sheng-Shan', 'Wu, Xing', 'Zhou, Wei-Hua', 'Huang, Ren-Wei', 'Liu, Quentin']","['Rao J', 'Xu DR', 'Zheng FM', 'Long ZJ', 'Huang SS', 'Wu X', 'Zhou WH', 'Huang RW', 'Liu Q']","['Department of Hematology, Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, 600 Tianhe Road, Guangzhou, P.R.

Neutropenia can lead to life-threatening pyogenic infections, acute gingivostomatitis and chronic parodontal disease, and each successive infection may leave permanent sequelae. The risk of infection is roughly inversely proportional to the circulating polymorphonuclear neutrophil count and is particularly high at counts below 0.2 G/l.When neutropenia is detected, an attempt should be made to establish the etiology, distinguishing between acquired forms (the most frequent, including post viral neutropenia and auto immune neutropenia) and congenital forms that may either be isolated or part of a complex genetic disease.Except for ethnic neutropenia, which is a frequent but mild congenital form, probably with polygenic inheritance, all other forms of congenital neutropenia are extremely rare and have monogenic inheritance, which may be X-linked or autosomal, recessive or dominant.About half the forms of congenital neutropenia with no extra-hematopoietic manifestations and normal adaptive immunity are due to neutrophil elastase (ELANE) mutations. Some patients have severe permanent neutropenia and frequent infections early in life, while others have mild intermittent neutropenia.Congenital neutropenia may also be associated with a wide range of organ dysfunctions, as for example in Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (associated with pancreatic insufficiency) and glycogen storage disease type Ib (associated with a glycogen storage syndrome). So far, the molecular bases of 12 neutropenic disorders have been identified.Treatment of severe chronic neutropenia should focus on prevention of infections. It includes antimicrobial prophylaxis, generally with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and also granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). G-CSF has considerably improved these patients' outlook. It is usually well tolerated, but potential adverse effects include thrombocytopenia, glomerulonephritis, vasculitis and osteoporosis. Long-term treatment with G-CSF, especially at high doses, augments the spontaneous risk of leukemia in patients with congenital neutropenia.","['Donadieu, Jean', 'Fenneteau, Odile', 'Beaupain, Blandine', 'Mahlaoui, Nizar', 'Chantelot, Christine Bellanne']","['Donadieu J', 'Fenneteau O', 'Beaupain B', 'Mahlaoui N', 'Chantelot CB']","[""Service d'Hemato-Oncologie Pediatrique Registre des neutropenies congenitales, AP-HP Hopital Trousseau, 26 avenue du Dr Netter, Paris, France. jean.donadieu@trs.aphp.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Orphanet J Rare Dis,Orphanet journal of rare diseases,101266602,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neutropenia/*congenital/*etiology/genetics/therapy', 'Risk Factors']",2011/05/21 06:00,2011/10/19 06:00,['2011/05/21 06:00'],"['2010/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1750-1172-6-26 [pii]', '10.1186/1750-1172-6-26 [doi]']",epublish,Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2011 May 19;6:26. doi: 10.1186/1750-1172-6-26.,20110519,PMC3127744,['R24 AI049393/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ACTH concentrations are higher in fetal plasma than in maternal plasma and peak at mid-gestation in rats, whereas ACTH production starts in the anterior lobe of the fetal pituitary at later stages. Melanocortin receptors (MC1-5R), receptors for ACTH and alpha-, beta- and gamma-MSH, are expressed in various adult organs. The specific function of these receptors has been well examined in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis and the HPA axis-like network in the skin, and anti-inflammatory effects for white blood cells have also been investigated. MC2R and/or MC5R are also expressed in the testis, lung, kidney, adrenal, liver, pancreas, brain and blood cells at different stages in mouse and rat embryos/fetuses. Melanocortins in embryos and fetuses promote maturation of the HPA axis and also contribute to the development of lung, testis, brain and blood cells. Recently, a unique ACTH function was revealed in fetuses: placental ACTH, which is secreted by the maternal leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and induces LIF secretion from fetal nucleated red blood cells. Finally, the maternal LIF-placental ACTH-fetal LIF signal relay regulates the LIF level and promotes neurogenesis in fetuses, which suggests that ACTH acts as a signal transducer or effector for fetal development in the maternal-fetal signal pathway.","['Simamura, Eriko', 'Shimada, Hiroki', 'Shoji, Hiroki', 'Otani, Hiroki', 'Hatta, Toshihisa']","['Simamura E', 'Shimada H', 'Shoji H', 'Otani H', 'Hatta T']","['Department of Anatomy I, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Ishikawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Australia,Congenit Anom (Kyoto),Congenital anomalies,9306292,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Melanocortin)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', '9002-79-3 (Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormones)']",IM,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/blood/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fetal Development', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/blood/metabolism', 'Male', '*Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormones/blood/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neurogenesis', 'Organ Specificity', 'Placenta/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Melanocortin/blood/metabolism']",2011/05/21 06:00,2011/09/14 06:00,['2011/05/21 06:00'],"['2011/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1741-4520.2011.00316.x [doi]'],ppublish,Congenit Anom (Kyoto). 2011 Jun;51(2):47-54. doi: 10.1111/j.1741-4520.2011.00316.x.,,,,,,['(c) 2011 The Authors.

Having observed that APRIL serum (sAPRIL) levels were higher in B-CLL patients with CLL at diagnosis as compared to healthy donors (14.61+/-32.65 vs. 4.19+/-3.42 ng/mL; P<0.001), we tested the correlation existing in these patients between sAPRIL, clinical-biological parameters and disease progression. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: sAPRIL levels were measured by ELISA in 130 patients with B-CLL at diagnosis and in 25 healthy donors. RESULTS: sAPRIL levels did not correlate with gender, age, clinical stage, blood cell counts, beta2-microglobulin (beta2M) levels, ZAP-70 and CD38 expression. Using median sAPRIL natural logarithm (ln) as cutoff, we distinguished two groups of patients (APRIL(LOW) and APRIL(HIGH) ) who were comparable with regard to clinical-biological parameters and overall survival, but different with regard to time to the first treatment (TTFT; P=0.035). According to univariate analysis, high lymphocyte count, high beta2M, Binet stage B-C, ZAP-70 expression and ln(sAPRIL) above median were associated with earlier TTFT. Advanced clinical stage, high beta2M, ZAP-70 expression and ln(sAPRIL) above median remained independently predictive of shorter TTFT at multivariate analysis. Moreover, sAPRIL increased its prognostic significance when patients were stratified according to independent favorable clinical-biological characteristics (low beta2M, stage A and lack of ZAP-70 expression). CONCLUSIONS: sAPRIL is a novel indicator of shorter TTFT in B-CLL and a predictor of progression especially in patients otherwise considered at low risk according to validated prognostic factors.","['Tecchio, Cristina', 'Nichele, Ilaria', 'Mosna, Federico', 'Zampieri, Francesca', 'Leso, Antonella', 'Al-Khaffaf, Ahmad', 'Veneri, Dino', 'Andreini, Angelo', 'Pizzolo, Giovanni', 'Ambrosetti, Achille']","['Tecchio C', 'Nichele I', 'Mosna F', 'Zampieri F', 'Leso A', 'Al-Khaffaf A', 'Veneri D', 'Andreini A', 'Pizzolo G', 'Ambrosetti A']","['Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Piazzale L A Scuro 10, Verona, Italy. cristina.tecchio@univr.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (TNFSF13 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13/*blood']",2011/05/21 06:00,2011/11/09 06:00,['2011/05/21 06:00'],"['2011/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01650.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2011 Sep;87(3):228-34. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01650.x.

However, the ability of vaccine DCs to induce a type 1-polarized immune response in vivo probably relies on additional features, including their ability to induce a CXCR3-dependent recruitment of NK cells into vaccine-draining lymph nodes. Moreover, their guiding of rare tumour-specific CD8(+) T cells to sites of DC-CD4(+) T cell interactions by secretion of CCL3 and CCL4 is needed. We therefore analysed the chemokine profile and the lymphocyte-attracting ability in vitro of monocyte-derived PGE(2) DCs and alphaDC1s from patients with CLL. alphaDC1s produced much higher levels of CXCR3 ligands (CXCL9/CXCL10/CXCL11) than PGE(2) DCs. Functional studies further demonstrated that alphaDC1s were superior recruiters of both NK and NKT cells. Moreover, alphaDC1s produced higher levels of CCL3/CCL4 upon CD40 ligation. These findings suggest that functional alphaDC1s, derived from patients with CLL, produce a desirable NK-, NKT- and CD8(+) T cell-attracting chemokine profile which may favour a guided and Th1-deviated priming of CD8(+) T cells, supporting the idea that alphaDC1-based vaccines have a higher immunotherapeutic potential than PGE(2) DCs.","['Gustafsson, Karin', 'Junevik, Katarina',

Unfortunately, 2-3% of patients treated with etoposide develop treatment-related leukemias characterized by 11q23 chromosomal rearrangements. The molecular basis for etoposide-induced leukemogenesis is not understood but is associated with enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage. Etoposide is metabolized by CYP3A4 to etoposide catechol, which can be further oxidized to etoposide quinone. A CYP3A4 variant is associated with a lower risk of etoposide-related leukemias, suggesting that etoposide metabolites may be involved in leukemogenesis. Although etoposide acts at the enzyme-DNA interface, several quinones poison topoisomerase II via redox-dependent protein adduction. The effects of etoposide quinone on topoisomerase IIalpha-mediated DNA cleavage have been examined previously. Although findings suggest that the activity of the quinone is slightly greater than that of etoposide, these studies were carried out in the presence of significant levels of reducing agents (which should reduce etoposide quinone to the catechol). Therefore, we examined the ability of etoposide quinone to poison human topoisomerase IIalpha in the absence of reducing agents. Under these conditions, etoposide quinone was approximately 5-fold more active than etoposide at inducing enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage. Consistent with other redox-dependent poisons, etoposide quinone inactivated topoisomerase IIalpha when incubated with the protein prior to DNA and lost activity in the presence of dithiothreitol. Unlike etoposide, the quinone metabolite did not require ATP for maximal activity and induced a high ratio of double-stranded DNA breaks. Our results support the hypothesis that etoposide quinone contributes to etoposide-related leukemogenesis.","['Jacob, David A', 'Mercer, Susan L', 'Osheroff, Neil', 'Deweese, Joseph E']","['Jacob DA', 'Mercer SL', 'Osheroff N', 'Deweese JE']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Lipscomb University College of Pharmacy, Nashville, Tennessee 37204-3951, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Catechols)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Reducing Agents)', '3T006GV98U (quinone)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'LF3AJ089DQ (catechol)', 'T8ID5YZU6Y (Dithiothreitol)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Benzoquinones/*metabolism/*toxicity', 'Catechols/metabolism', 'DNA Adducts/drug effects/toxicity', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism/toxicity', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Dithiothreitol/toxicity', 'Enzyme Stability/drug effects', 'Etoposide/chemistry/*metabolism/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/enzymology/genetics', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Reducing Agents/pharmacology']",2011/05/21 06:00,2011/08/30 06:00,['2011/05/21 06:00'],"['2011/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bi200438m [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2011 Jun 28;50(25):5660-7. doi: 10.1021/bi200438m.

MDS occurs more frequently in older male and in individuals with prior exposure to cytotoxic therapy. DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis of MDS is based on morphological evidence of dysplasia upon visual examination of a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. Information obtained from additional studies such as karyotype, flow cytometry, or molecular genetics is complementary but not diagnostic. RISK-STRATIFICATION: Prognosis of patients with MDS can be calculated using a number of scoring systems. In general, all these scoring systems include analysis of peripheral cytopenias, percentage of blasts in the bone marrow, and cytogenetic characteristics. The most commonly used system is the International Prognostic Scoring System. This score divides patients into a lower risk subset (low and intermediate-1) and a higher risk subset (int-2 and high). Other more modern systems have been developed that allow more precise risk calculation. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: Therapy is selected based on risk, transfusion needs, percent of bone marrow blasts and more recently cytogenetic profile. Goals of therapy are different in lower risk patients than in higher risk. In lower risk, the goal is to decrease transfusion needs and transformation to higher risk disease or AML. In higher risk, the goal is to prolong survival. Current available therapies include growth factor support, lenalidomide, hypomethylating agents, intensive chemotherapy, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The use of lenalidomide has significant clinical activity in patients with lower risk disease, anemia, and a chromosome 5 alteration. 5-azacitidine and decitabine have activity in higher risk MDS. 5-azacitidine has been shown to improve survival in higher risk MDS. Additional supportive care measures may include the use of prophylactic antibiotics and iron chelation. MANAGEMENT OF PROGRESSIVE OR REFRACTORY DISEASE: At the present time, there are no approved interventions for patients with progressive or refractory disease particularly after hypomethylating based therapy. Options include cytarabine-based therapy, transplantation, and participation on a clinical trial.","['Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']",['Garcia-Manero G'],"['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. ggarciam@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment']",2011/05/20 06:00,2011/07/27 06:00,['2011/05/20 06:00'],"['2011/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.22047 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2011 Jun;86(6):490-8. doi: 10.1002/ajh.22047.,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-four patients with CML and four with ALL were enrolled in the clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy according to the eligibility criteria related to intolerance to imatinib therapy. The toxicities reported during imatinib therapy were non-hematological toxicities in 23 patients and hematological toxicities in six patients. Patients were administered dasatinib 50-70 mg BID or 100 mg QD. Cross intolerance was observed in four patients who showed hematological toxicity after dasatinib treatment. However, it was possible to successfully continue therapy with only temporary interruption. No cross intolerance in non-hematological toxicity was found with the exception of one patient who showed cross intolerance, which did not result in treatment interruption.

Survivin is overexpressed in gliomas, and overexpression of survivin is associated with the progression of gliomas and the poor prognosis of glioma patients. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is used in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia and is active in vitro in several solid tumor cell lines. In the present study, the human glioma cell line U118-MG was used to investigate the anti-cancer effect of ATO in vitro and in vivo. The molecular mechanisms of the relationship between cell death (autophagy and apoptosis) and survivin were analyzed. ATO reduced cell viability through an increase in mitotic cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The mechanisms of ATO-induced autophagy and apoptosis were mediated by the inhibition of PI3K/Akt and the activation of MAPK signaling pathways. The ATO treatment of U118-MG cells pre-treated with specific chemical inhibitors of PI3K/AKT and MAPK significantly changed the cytotoxicity and the expression of survivin, suggesting that survivin plays a pivotal role in ATO-induced cell death. When U118-MG cells were transfected with survivin shRNA, the results demonstrated a significant increase in apoptotic and autophagic cells. In in vivo studies, the ATO treatment of SCID mice showed a significant tumor growth delay time and the decreased expression of survivin in tumor tissue. An important result from the current study is the finding that survivin could suppress both autophagy and apoptosis in glioma cells. This study suggests that ATO treatment or survivin inhibition could be a novel therapeutic strategy in malignant gliomas.","['Chiu, Hui-Wen', 'Ho, Yuan-Soon', 'Wang, Ying-Jan']","['Chiu HW', 'Ho YS', 'Wang YJ']","['Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, National Cheng Kung University Medical College, 138 Sheng-Li Road, Tainan 704, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Mol Med (Berl),"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Survivin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', '*Autophagy/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Glioma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Survivin', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects']",2011/05/20 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/05/20 06:00'],"['2011/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00109-011-0763-1 [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Med (Berl). 2011 Sep;89(9):927-41. doi: 10.1007/s00109-011-0763-1.

The combination of CI-921 and cisplatin was subsequently evaluated in three in vivo model systems: intraperitoneally (TP) and intravenously (IV) implanted P388 leukemia, and advanced stage subcutaneously (SC) implanted LC-12 squamous cell carcinoma. All drug treatments were administered IP on an intermittent treatment schedule which was optimal for both agents. Combination therapy was superior to therapy with the best single agent alone, CI-921, in all three model systems. Against IP implanted P388 leukemia, combination therapy produced greater than 8 logs of net tumor cell kill with 60-day survivors (cures). This level of activity was 50-fold greater (1.7 log) than that obtained with CI-921 alone. An IV implant of P388 leukemia was used in a confirmatory study to provide a more rigorous evaluation against disseminated disease. Combination therapy against IV implanted P388 leukemia produced greater than 7.7 logs of net tumor cell kill, which was 630-fold greater (2.8 logs) than that obtained with CI-921 therapy alone. Against advanced stage LC-12 (200-1000 mg tumors at initial treatment), combination therapy improved tumor cell kill by 0.6 log (4-fold) over that obtained with CI-921 therapy alone and also produced greater numbers of 120-day survivors than did single agent therapy with CI-921. The combination of carboplatin and CI-921 was also evaluated against IV implanted P388 leukemia to determine if the enhanced therapeutic effect of CI-921 and cisplatin could be extended to include CI-921 and carboplatin. Combination therapy with CI-921 and carboplatin increased net log tumor cell kill by 0.8 and 1.5 log in two separate tests (6- and 32-fold, respectively) over that obtained with CI-921 therapy alone.

The quiescent state appears to be necessary for preserving the self-renewal of stem cells and is a critical factor in the resistance of cancer stem cells (CSCs) to chemotherapy and targeted therapies. Limited knowledge about quiescence mechanisms has prevented significant advances in targeting of drug-resistant quiescent CSCs populations in the clinic. Thus, an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms of quiescence in adult stem cells is critical for the development of molecularly targeted therapies against quiescent CSCs in different cancers. Recent studies have provided a better understanding of the intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory mechanisms that control stem cell quiescence. It is now appreciated that the p53 gene plays a critical role in regulating stem cell quiescence. Other intrinsic regulatory mechanisms include the FoxO, HIF-1alpha, and NFATc1 transcription factors and signaling through ATM and mTOR. Extrinsic microenvironmental regulatory mechanisms include angiopoietin-1, TGF-beta, bone morphogenic protein, thrombopoietin, N-cadherin, and integrin adhesion receptors; Wnt/beta-catenin signaling; and osteopontin.

Previous evidence has pointed to interleukin-7 (IL-7), a fundamental cytokine to normal T-cell development and homeostasis, as an important determinant of the viability and proliferation of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells in vitro. In this study, we report that IL-7 is also a critical determinant of T-ALL progression. T-ALL cell lines and primary T-ALL samples initiated leukemia more slowly when engrafted to immunocompromised Rag2(-/-)IL2rg(-/-) mice lacking IL-7. This effect was not related to reduced engraftment or homing of transplanted cells to the bone marrow. Instead, IL-7 deficiency diminished expansion of leukemia cells in the bone marrow and delayed leukemia-associated death of transplanted mice. Moreover, infiltration of different organs by T-ALL cells, which characterizes patients with advanced disease, was more heterogeneous and generally less efficient in IL-7-deficient mice. Leukemia progression was associated with increased Bcl-2 expression and cell viability, reduced p27(Kip1) expression, and decreased cell-cycle progression. Clinical measurements of IL-7 plasma levels and IL-7 receptor (IL-7R) expression in T-ALL patients versus healthy controls confirmed that IL-7 stimulates human leukemia cells. Our results establish that IL-7 contributes to the progression of human T-cell leukemia, and they offer preclinical validation of the concept that targeting IL-7/IL-7R signaling in the tumor microenvironment could elicit therapeutic effects in T-ALL.","['Silva, Ana', 'Laranjeira, Angelo B A', 'Martins, Leila R', 'Cardoso, Bruno A', 'Demengeot, Jocelyne', 'Yunes, J Andres', 'Seddon, Benedict', 'Barata, Joao T']","['Silva A', 'Laranjeira AB', 'Martins LR', 'Cardoso BA', 'Demengeot J', 'Yunes JA', 'Seddon B', 'Barata JT']","['Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina da Univer, Lisbon, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (IL7 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', '0 (interleukin-7 receptor, alpha chain)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-7/blood/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Microenvironment', 'Up-Regulation']",2011/05/20 06:00,2011/10/21 06:00,['2011/05/20 06:00'],"['2011/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-3606 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-3606 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Jul 15;71(14):4780-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-3606.

This is believed to be due to the ability of viruses to efficiently coordinate several steps of the retroviral life cycle at cell-cell contact sites (D. C. Johnson et al., J. Virol. 76:1-8, 2002; D. M. Phillips, AIDS 8:719-731, 1994; Q. Sattenau, Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 6:815-826, 2008). Using the murine leukemia virus (MLV) as a model retrovirus, we have previously shown that interaction between viral envelope (Env) and receptor directs viral assembly to cell-cell contact sites to promote efficient viral spreading (J. Jin et al., PLoS Biol. 7:e1000163, 2009). In addressing the underlying mechanism, we observed that Env cytoplasmic tail directs this contact-induced polarized assembly. We present here the viral determinants in the Env cytoplasmic tail and Gag that are important in this process. A tyrosine residue within the cytoplasmic tail of Env was identified, which directs polarized assembly. MLV matrix-mediated membrane targeting is required for Gag recruitment to sites of cell-cell contact. Our results suggest that MLV polarized assembly is mediated by a direct or indirect interaction between both domains, thereby coupling Gag recruitment and virus assembly to Env accumulation at the cell-cell interface. In contrast, HIV Gag that assembles outside of cell-cell interfaces can subsequently be drawn into contact zones mediated by MLV Env and receptor, a finding that is consistent with the previously observed lateral movement of HIV into the virological synapse (W. Hubner et al., Science 323:1743-1747, 2009; D. Rudnicka et al., J. Virol. 83:6234-6246, 2009). As such, we observed two distinct modes of virus cell-to-cell transmission that involve either polarized or nonpolarized assembly, but both result in virus transmission.","['Jin, Jing', 'Li, Fei', 'Mothes, Walther']","['Jin J', 'Li F', 'Mothes W']","['Microbial Pathogenesis, Yale School of Medicine, 295 Congress Ave., BCMM 335, New Haven, CT 06536, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/genetics', '*Virus Assembly']",2011/05/20 06:00,2011/09/22 06:00,['2011/05/20 06:00'],"['2011/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00409-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00409-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2011 Aug;85(15):7672-82. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00409-11.

Here we found that the HTLV-1 Tax oncoprotein induced the expression of SOCS1, an inhibitor of interferon signaling. Tax required NF-kappaB, but not CREB, to induce the expression of SOCS1 in T cells. Furthermore, Tax interacted with SOCS1 in both transfected cells and in HTLV-1-transformed cell lines. Although SOCS1 is normally a short-lived protein, in the presence of Tax, the stability of SOCS1 was greatly increased. Accordingly, Tax enhanced the replication of a heterologous virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), in a SOCS1-dependent manner. Surprisingly, Tax required SOCS1 to inhibit RIG-I-dependent antiviral signaling, but not the interferon-induced JAK/STAT pathway. Inhibition of SOCS1 by RNA-mediated interference in the HTLV-1-transformed cell line MT-2 resulted in increased IFN-beta expression accompanied by reduced HTLV-1 replication and p19(Gag) levels. Taken together, our results reveal that Tax inhibits antiviral signaling, in part, by hijacking an interferon regulatory protein.","['Charoenthongtrakul, Soratree', 'Zhou, Qinjie', 'Shembade, Noula', 'Harhaj, Nicole S', 'Harhaj, Edward W']","['Charoenthongtrakul S', 'Zhou Q', 'Shembade N', 'Harhaj NS', 'Harhaj EW']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, 1550 NW 10 Avenue, Miami, FL 33136, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/*physiology', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Virus Replication']",2011/05/20 06:00,2011/09/16 06:00,['2011/05/20 06:00'],"['2011/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00007-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00007-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2011 Jul;85(14):6955-62. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00007-11.

Genome-wide small interfering RNA screens previously identified karyopherin beta transportin-3 (TNPO3) and NPC component nucleoporin 153 (NUP153) as being important for infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The knockdown of either protein significantly inhibited HIV-1 infectivity, while infection by the gammaretrovirus Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) was unaffected. Here, we establish that primate lentiviruses are particularly sensitive to NUP153 knockdown and investigate HIV-1-encoded elements that contribute to this dependency. Mutants lacking functional Vpr or the central DNA flap remained sensitive to NUP153 depletion, while MLV/HIV-1 chimera viruses carrying MLV matrix, capsid, or integrase became less sensitive when the latter two elements were substituted. Two capsid missense mutant viruses, N74D and P90A, were largely insensitive to NUP153 depletion, as was wild-type HIV-1 when cyclophilin A was depleted simultaneously or when infection was conducted in the presence of cyclosporine A. The codepletion of NUP153 and TNPO3 yielded synergistic effects that outweighed those calculated based on individual knockdowns, indicating potential interdependent roles for these factors during HIV-1 infection. Quantitative PCR revealed normal levels of late reverse transcripts, a moderate reduction of 2-long terminal repeat (2-LTR) circles, and a relatively large reduction in integrated proviruses upon NUP153 knockdown. These results suggest that capsid, likely by the qualities of its uncoating, determines whether HIV-1 requires cellular NUP153 for PIC nuclear import.","['Matreyek, Kenneth A', 'Engelman, Alan']","['Matreyek KA', 'Engelman A']","['Department of Cancer Immunology and AIDS, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 450 Brookline Avenue, CLS-1010, Boston, MA 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (NUP153 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Capsid/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclosporine/administration & dosage', 'DNA Primers', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering']",2011/05/20 06:00,2011/09/22 06:00,['2011/05/20 06:00'],"['2011/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00325-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00325-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2011 Aug;85(15):7818-27. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00325-11.

To detect fusion genes, the current bioinformatics tools heavily rely on paired-end approaches and overlook the importance of reads that span fusion junctions. Thus there is a need to develop an efficient aligner to detect fusion events by accurate mapping of these junction-spanning single reads, particularly when the read gets longer with the improvement in sequencing technology. RESULTS: We present a novel method, FusionMap, which aligns fusion reads directly to the genome without prior knowledge of potential fusion regions. FusionMap can detect fusion events in both single- and paired-end datasets from either RNA-Seq or gDNA-Seq studies and characterize fusion junctions at base-pair resolution. We showed that FusionMap achieved high sensitivity and specificity in fusion detection on two simulated RNA-Seq datasets, which contained 75 nt paired-end reads. FusionMap achieved substantially higher sensitivity and specificity than the paired-end approach when the inner distance between read pairs was small. Using FusionMap to characterize fusion genes in K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cell line, we further demonstrated its accuracy in fusion detection in both single-end RNA-Seq and gDNA-Seq datasets. These combined results show that FusionMap provides an accurate and systematic solution to detecting fusion events through junction-spanning reads.

STUDY DESIGN: Clinical records of 48 chronic-phase CML children administered imatinib as the first-line therapy between 2001 and 2006 were analyzed retrospectively. Cumulative change in height was assessed using the height height-SDS and converted height data from age- and sex-adjusted Japanese norms. RESULTS: A decrease in height-SDS was observed in 72.9% of children, with a median maximum reduction in height-SDS of 0.61 during imatinib treatment. Median follow-up time was 34 months (range, 10-88 months). Growth impairment was seen predominantly in children who started imatinib at a prepubertal age compared with those who started at pubertal age. Growth velocity tended to recuperate in prepubertal children with growth impairment, as they reached pubertal age, suggesting that imatinib had little impact on growth during puberty. CONCLUSIONS: Growth impairment was a major adverse effect of long-term imatinib treatment in children with CML. We report the distinct inhibitory effect of imatinib on growth in prepubertal and pubertal children with CML. We should be aware of growth deceleration in children, especially in young children given imatinib before puberty and subjected to prolonged exposure.","['Shima, Haruko', 'Tokuyama, Mika', 'Tanizawa, Akihiko', 'Tono, Chikako', 'Hamamoto, Kazuko', 'Muramatsu, Hideki', 'Watanabe, Akihiro', 'Hotta, Noriko', 'Ito, Masaki', 'Kurosawa, Hidemitsu', 'Kato, Koji', 'Tsurusawa, Masahito', 'Horibe, Keizo', 'Shimada, Hiroyuki']","['Shima H', 'Tokuyama M', 'Tanizawa A', 'Tono C', 'Hamamoto K', 'Muramatsu H', 'Watanabe A', 'Hotta N', 'Ito M', 'Kurosawa H', 'Kato K', 'Tsurusawa M', 'Horibe K', 'Shimada H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Benzamides', 'Body Height', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Growth Disorders/*chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Puberty', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies']",2011/05/20 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/05/20 06:00'],"['2010/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/17 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0022-3476(11)00338-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.03.046 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 2011 Oct;159(4):676-81. doi: 10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.03.046.

(Asteraceae) is an aromatic perennial plant, widely distributed in the northern hemisphere. This species traditionally has been used in insecticides, cosmetics, balsams, dyes, medicines and preservatives. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The essential oil of T. parthenium was obtained by hydrodistillation in three developmental stages and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The antibacterial activity of the oils was investigated against four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria. The oil was tested for cytotoxicity against THP-1 cells using the Trypan blue assay. RESULTS: Twenty-nine components were identified in the essential oil; the highest amount was extracted at the flowering stage. The main component, in the flowering stage, was camphor (18.94%) and other major components were bornyl acetate (18.35%), camphene (13.74%), bornyl isovalerate (3.15%), borneol (10.93%), juniper camphor (6.23%) and beta-eudesmol (2.65%). Minimum inhibitory concentration of essential oil was evaluated from 4 microL mL(-1) against Staphylococcus subtilis to 38 microL mL(-1) against Entrobacter aerogenes. Toxicity assay showed that the oil has no significant toxicity at 5-15% v/v concentrations on THP-1 cells. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the occurrence of camphor/bornyl acetate chemotype of T. parthenium in western regions of Iran. The finding showed also the studied oils have relatively good antibacterial activity without significant toxicity, thus have great potentiality to be used as natural health product.","['Mohsenzadeh, F', 'Chehregani, A', 'Amiri, H']","['Mohsenzadeh F', 'Chehregani A', 'Amiri H']","['Laboratory of Microbiology, Department of Biology, Bu-Ali Sina University, Hamedan, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Pharm Biol,Pharmaceutical biology,9812552,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Oils, Volatile)', '0 (Plant Preparations)', '76-22-2 (Camphor)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Camphor/analysis/chemistry/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria/drug effects', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/drug therapy', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria/drug effects', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Iran', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Oils, Volatile/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Components, Aerial/chemistry/metabolism', 'Plant Preparations/analysis/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Tanacetum parthenium/*chemistry/growth & development', 'Trypan Blue/metabolism']",2011/05/20 06:00,2012/02/04 06:00,['2011/05/20 06:00'],"['2011/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/13880209.2011.556650 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Biol. 2011 Sep;49(9):920-6. doi: 10.3109/13880209.2011.556650.

The introduction of novel therapies that can improve response rates and survival outcomes in MDS remains a challenge. Clofarabine is a purine nucleoside analog that works primarily via inhibition of DNA biosynthesis and the ribonucleotide reductase enzyme with recent evidence suggesting that at low doses it may affect DNA methylation. It has been successfully used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is under investigation in MDS. AREAS COVERED: A PubMed search for articles pertaining to clofarabine was conducted and streamlined to only include data on MDS or AML that evolved from MDS. Also included were clofarabine-related response and safety data from presentations at the 52(nd) Annual American Society of Hematology Meeting in Orlando, Florida, USA. EXPERT OPINION: Clinical trials using clofarabine in MDS and MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasms have produced overall response rates of 31 - 43% including complete responders. Although myelosuppression is an important side effect, clofarabine is generally well tolerated in MDS. Clofarabine is currently available in an intravenous form with an oral formulation presently under investigation, either as a single agent or in combination therapy in MDS. Larger studies may help clarify the viability of clofarabine in the treatment of MDS patients.","['Tiu, Ramon V', 'Traina, Fabiola', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A']","['Tiu RV', 'Traina F', 'Sekeres MA']","['Taussig Cancer Institute, Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/methods', 'Clofarabine', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism']",2011/05/20 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/05/20 06:00'],"['2011/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2011.585967 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2011 Jul;20(7):1005-14. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2011.585967.

Amonafide retains cytotoxic activity even in the presence of P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-mediated multi-drug resistance (MDR), a major contributor to clinical treatment failure. AREAS COVERED: In vitro, Pgp-mediated transport (efflux) of amonafide from myeloblasts obtained from patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) was significantly less than efflux of daunorubicin. Amonafide has shown efficacy in patients with sAML, as well as in patients with poor prognostic characteristics such as older age and unfavorable cytogenetics, all associated with MDR. Improved antileukemic activity is observed when amonafide is given together with cytarabine, rather than as monotherapy, with a complete remission rate of approximately 40% in a recent Phase II trial in sAML. The efficacy of amonafide was maintained among poor-risk subsets of patients, including older patients and patients who had previous myelodysplastic syndrome or previous leukemogenic therapy. The safety profile was acceptable and manageable. EXPERT OPINION: Amonafide plus cytarabine may have clinical utility in patients with sAML and in other poor-risk subgroups of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Ongoing trials will help define the role for amonafide in the treatment of poor-risk AML.","['Allen, Steven L', 'Lundberg, Ante S']","['Allen SL', 'Lundberg AS']","['Hofstra North Shore - LIJ School of Medicine, Monter Cancer Center, Lake Success, NY 10042, USA. allen@nshs.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Naphthalimides)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '1Q8D39N37L (amonafide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/methods', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/mortality', 'Naphthalimides/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Organophosphonates', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/05/20 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/05/20 06:00'],"['2011/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2011.585756 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2011 Jul;20(7):995-1003. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2011.585756.

DATA SOURCES: The literature review was obtained through internet, journals and chapters in the relevant books. DATA SELECTION: Relevant articles and chapters on immunophenotyping of acute leukaemias were selected from respected international journals and books in the field of haematology and were reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Complete articles relevant to the topic were selected and reviewed and the necessary information extracted for this review. CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometry has been used extensively in recent years to characterise haemopoeitic malignancies and done routinely in the developed world. This technique has greatly improved the diagnosis and classification of haemopoeitic malignancies and has been recommended by World Health Organisation classification (WHO) of tumours of haemopoeitic and lymphoid tissue. Application of flow cytometry for the diagnosis of leukaemias has been recently introduced in Kenya and is currently being undertaken in research using limited but appropriate panels of monoclonal antibodies. It is hoped that findings of this research will inform the use of flow cytometry as an ancillary diagnostic technique in our resource-constrained set up.","['Pamnani, R']",['Pamnani R'],"['Haematology and Blood Transfusion Unit, Department of Human Pathology, College of Health Sciences, University of Nairobi, P.O.

It is caused by the Philadelphia chromosome resulting from the reciprocal translocation, t(9;22) between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22. This results in the production of fusion BCR-ABL transcript and chimeric protein--tyrosine kinase activity. This protein leads to increased proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and worse adhesion of CML cells. Molecular analysis are very important in the era treatment of CML by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Constant monitoring of the level of BCR-ABL transcript aimed at monitoring response to medical treatment as well as early detection of resistance to TKI therapy. The most common causes of resistance are point mutations ABL kinase domain of the BCR-ABL gene. In this aim, the biological material used (peripheral blood) derived from 58 patients of the Department of Hematology, Jagiellonian University Collegium Medicum. The isolated RNA was performed in successive stages: RT-PCR, RQ-PCR to a semi-nested PCR. In order to detect point mutations ABL kinase domain technique used direct sequencing of the product obtained in response to a semi-nested PCR. Using this technique allow in do not only a rapid detection of point mutations but also identification of its position in the ABL domain, type of mutation (e.g., T3151), as well as nucleotide and the amino acid substitution.

Most commonly magnetoplasmonic nanostructures are made by careful adaptation of metal reduction protocols which is both tedious and restrictive. Here we apply the strategy of nanoscale assemblies to prepare such systems from individual building blocks. The prepared superstructures are based on magnetic Fe(3) O(4) nanoparticles encapsulated in silica shell representing the magnetic module. The cores are surrounded in a corona-like fashion by gold nanoparticles representing the plasmonic module. As additional functionality they were also coated by poly(ethyleneglycol) chains as a cloaking agent to extend the blood circulation time. The preparation is exceptionally simple and allows one to vary the contribution of each function. Both modules can carry drugs and, in this study, they were loaded with the potential anticancer drug curcumin. A comprehensive set of microscopy, spectroscopy and biochemical methods were applied to characterize both imaging and therapeutic function of the nanoparticle assemblies against leukemia HL-60 cells. High contrast magnetic resonance images and high apoptosis rates demonstrate the success of assembly approach for the preparation of magnetoplasmonic nanoparticles. This technology allows one to easily ""dial in"" the functionalities in the clinical setting for personalized theranostic regiments.","['Chen, Wei', 'Xu, Naifeng', 'Xu, Liguang', 'Wang, Libing', 'Li, Zuokun', 'Ma, Wei', 'Zhu, Yingyue', 'Xu, Chuanlai', 'Kotov, Nicholas A']","['Chen W', 'Xu N', 'Xu L', 'Wang L', 'Li Z', 'Ma W', 'Zhu Y', 'Xu C', 'Kotov NA']","['Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 48109 Michigan, USA; School of Food Science and Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu Province, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Macromol Rapid Commun,Macromolecular rapid communications,9888239,,,,2010/01/18 00:00,2010/01/18 00:01,['2011/05/19 06:00'],"['2009/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/18 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1002/marc.200900793 [doi]'],ppublish,Macromol Rapid Commun. 2010 Jan 18;31(2):228-36. doi: 10.1002/marc.200900793.

Examples include repeated infections, recurrence of tumors, relapse of leukemia, repeated hospitalizations, recurrence of symptoms of a disease, and so on. In the analysis of recurrent event data, the proportional rates model assumes that the regression coefficients are time invariant. In reality, however, these parameters may vary over time, and the temporal covariate effects on the event process are of great interest. In this article, we formulate a class of semiparametric marginal rates models, which incorporate a mixture of time-varying and time-independent parameters, to analyze recurrent event data. For statistical inference on model parameters, an estimation procedure is developed and asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are established. In addition, we develop tests for investigating whether or not covariate effects vary with time. The finite-sample behaviors of the proposed methods are examined in simulation studies. An example of application of the proposed methodology is illustrated on a set of data from a clinic study on chronic granulomatous disease.","['Sun, Liuquan', 'Zhou, Xian', 'Guo, Shaojun']","['Sun L', 'Zhou X', 'Guo S']","[""Institute of Applied Mathematics, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,['82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)'],IM,"['Chronic Disease/*epidemiology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Granulomatous Disease, Chronic/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/therapeutic use', '*Models, Biological', '*Models, Statistical']",2011/05/19 06:00,2011/11/04 06:00,['2011/05/19 06:00'],"['2009/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/sim.4260 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2011 Aug 15;30(18):2265-77. doi: 10.1002/sim.4260.

Therefore, we attempted to clarify the transport mechanisms of 6-MP through blood-placenta barrier using rat conditionally immortalized syncytiotrophoblast cell lines (TR-TBTs). The uptake of 6-MP was time- and ATP dependent, but sodium independent in TR-TBTs. 6-MP was eliminated over 50% from the cells within 30 min. The uptake of 6-MP was saturable with Michaelis-Menten constant values of 198 muM and 250 muM in TR-TBT 18d-1 and TR-TBT 18d-2, respectively. 6-Thioguanine, azathioprine, and hypoxantine, structural analogues of 6-MP, strongly inhibited [(14) C]6-MP uptake. Equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) inhibitors, adenosine and uridine, significantly inhibited [(14) C]6-MP uptake. However, several organic anions and cations had no effect on [(14) C]6-MP uptake in TR-TBTs. These results suggest that sodium-independent transporters, ENTs, may be involved in 6-MP uptake at the placenta. In addition, multidrug resistance protein (MRP) inhibitors, methotrexate, probenecid, cefmetazole, and sulfinpyrazone, significantly increased the accumulation of [(14) C]6-MP in the cells. It is indicated that 6-MP may be eliminated across the blood-placental barrier via MRPs. TR-TBTs expressed mRNA of ENT1, ENT2, MRP4, and MRP5. These findings are important for the therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and autoimmune diseases of pregnant women, and should be useful data in elucidating teratogenicity of 6-MP during pregnancy.","['Lee, Na-young', 'Sai, Yoshimichi', 'Nakashima, Emi', 'Ohtsuki, Sumio', 'Kang, Young-sook']","['Lee NY', 'Sai Y', 'Nakashima E', 'Ohtsuki S', 'Kang YS']","[""College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul, Korea.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharm Sci,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2985195R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA Primers', 'Mercaptopurine/*pharmacokinetics', 'Rats', 'Trophoblasts/cytology/*metabolism']",2011/05/19 06:00,2011/10/28 06:00,['2011/05/19 06:00'],"['2011/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/20 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1002/jps.22631 [doi]', 'S0022-3549(15)31967-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pharm Sci. 2011 Sep;100(9):3773-82. doi: 10.1002/jps.22631.

METHODS: Expression of FBI-1/OCZF was investigated in subchondral osteoclasts in human RA and in rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) using immunostaining and in situ hybridization, respectively. Transgenic mice overexpressing OCZF (OCZF-Tg) under the control of the cathepsin K promoter were generated, and bone mineral density and bone histomorphometric features were determined by peripheral quantitative computed tomography, calcein double-labeling, and specific staining for osteoclasts and osteoblasts. LRF/OCZF expression and the consequence of LRF inhibition were assessed in vitro with RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation. RESULTS: FBI-1/OCZF was detected in the nuclei of osteoclasts in rat AIA and human RA. RANKL increased the levels of LRF messenger RNA and nuclear-localized LRF protein in primary macrophages. In OCZF-Tg mice, bone volume was significantly decreased, the number of osteoclasts, but not osteoblasts, was increased in long bones, and osteoclast survival was promoted. Conversely, inhibition of LRF expression suppressed the formation of osteoclasts from macrophages in vitro. CONCLUSION: FBI-1/OCZF/LRF regulates osteoclast formation and apoptosis in vivo, and may become a useful marker and target in treating disorders leading to reduced bone density, including chronic arthritis.","['Kukita, Akiko', 'Kukita, Toshio', 'Nagata, Kengo', 'Teramachi, Junpei', 'Li, Yin-Ji', 'Yoshida, Hiroki', 'Miyamoto, Hiroshi', 'Gay, Steffen', 'Pessler, Frank', 'Shobuike, Takeo']","['Kukita A', 'Kukita T', 'Nagata K', 'Teramachi J', 'Li YJ', 'Yoshida H', 'Miyamoto H', 'Gay S', 'Pessler F', 'Shobuike T']","['Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan. kukita@cc.saga-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RANK Ligand)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ZBTB7A protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arthritis, Experimental/genetics/*metabolism', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bone Density/*physiology', 'Bone and Bones/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Osteoblasts/metabolism', 'Osteoclasts/*metabolism', 'RANK Ligand/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/05/19 06:00,2011/11/09 06:00,['2011/05/19 06:00'],"['2011/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/art.30455 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 2011 Sep;63(9):2744-54. doi: 10.1002/art.30455.,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2011 by the American College of Rheumatology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With high doses of methotrexate (MTX) in the consolidation phase, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms could be potential modulators of the therapeutic response to antifolate chemotherapeutics in identifying a possible correlation with the outcome. This study aims to analyse the potential role of the MTHFR C677T and A1298C genetic variants in modulating the clinical toxicity and efficacy of high doses of MTX in a cohort of paediatric ALL patients (n = 151) treated with AIEOP protocols. METHODS: This work includes DNA extraction by slides and RFLP-PCR. RESULTS: The first observation relative to early toxicities (haematological and non-haematological), after the first doses of MTX in all protocols, was an association between the 677T and 1298C carriers and global toxicity. We found that in the 2 g/m(2) MTX group, patients harbouring 677TT homozygously exhibited a substantial 12-fold risk of developing toxicity. In this study, we demonstrate that the MTHFR 677TT variant is associated with an increased risk of relapse when compared to other genotypes. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the 677TT variant had a lower 7-year DFS(disease-free survival) probability compared to the 677C carrier genotype (log-rank test P = 0.003) and OS (overall survival) and also confirms the lower probability of survival for patients with the 677TT variant (log-rank test, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides further evidence of the critical role played by folate pathway enzymes in the outcome of ALL, possibly through the interference of MTX.","[""D'Angelo, Velia"", 'Ramaglia, Maria', 'Iannotta, Adriana', 'Crisci, Stefania', 'Indolfi, Paolo', 'Francese, Matteo', 'Affinita, Maria Carmen', 'Pecoraro, Giulia', 'Napolitano, Addolorata', 'Fusco, Claudia', 'Oreste, Matilde', 'Indolfi, Cristiana', 'Casale, Fiorina']","[""D'Angelo V"", 'Ramaglia M', 'Iannotta A', 'Crisci S', 'Indolfi P', 'Francese M', 'Affinita MC', 'Pecoraro G', 'Napolitano A', 'Fusco C', 'Oreste M', 'Indolfi C', 'Casale F']","['Pediatric Department, Second University of Naples, Naples, Italy. velia.dangelo@unina2.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', '*Pharmacogenetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics']",2011/05/19 06:00,2011/12/28 06:00,['2011/05/19 06:00'],"['2011/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-011-1665-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2011 Nov;68(5):1339-46. doi: 10.1007/s00280-011-1665-1.

These viral vectors are most commonly produced using stable producer cell lines in adherent monolayer culture systems. In order to obtain high transduction efficiencies and low toxicity in clinical applications, the viral preparations should be purified, concentrated, and well characterized to attain stringent quality specifications. This chapter describes currently used protocols for manufacturing retroviruses.","['Cruz, Pedro E', 'Rodrigues, Teresa', 'Carmo, Marlene', 'Wirth, Dagmar', 'Amaral, Ana I', 'Alves, Paula M', 'Coroadinha, Ana S']","['Cruz PE', 'Rodrigues T', 'Carmo M', 'Wirth D', 'Amaral AI', 'Alves PM', 'Coroadinha AS']","['Animal Cell Technology Laboratory, IBET/ITQB-UNL, Oeiras, Portugal.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Culture Techniques/instrumentation', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Liquid/methods', 'Filtration/instrumentation/methods', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Phase-Contrast/methods', 'Retroviridae/chemistry/*growth & development/isolation & purification', 'Transfection/methods', 'Ultracentrifugation/methods', 'Virion/chemistry/*growth & development/isolation & purification']",2011/05/19 06:00,2011/09/02 06:00,['2011/05/19 06:00'],"['2011/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-61779-095-9_7 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2011;737:157-82. doi: 10.1007/978-1-61779-095-9_7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the lymphoma of the older brother was nasopharyngeal in origin, he was administrated radiation therapy as the primary treatment. However, hepatic metastasis was detected and this was the cause of his death. A 9-bp deletion in exon 7 of the p53 gene was detected in the metastatic lymphoma. His younger sister developed a lymphoma of abdominal lymph node in origin. She received a half dose of the drugs used in the acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment without radiation, and twenty months after the diagnosis of her lymphoma she continues to be in complete remission and free of treatment complications. The p53 gene mutation was not detected in her lymphoma. These results suggest that radiation therapy and the radiation dose for the treatment for lymphoma in patients with BS should be carefully considered.","['Kaneko, H', 'Inoue, R', 'Yamada, Y', 'Fukao, T', 'Kondo, N']","['Kaneko H', 'Inoue R', 'Yamada Y', 'Fukao T', 'Kondo N']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,,,,1997/11/01 00:00,1997/11/01 00:01,['2011/05/19 06:00'],"['2011/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '1997/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.4.6.1281 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 1997 Nov-Dec;4(6):1281-3. doi: 10.3892/or.4.6.1281.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML cells constitutively express mRNA and produce several haematopoietic cytokines. The haematopoietic cytokines: SCF, IL-3, GM-CSF and G-CSF induce leukaemic colonies or activate DNA synthesis in about 80% of AML cases. Both M-CSF and thrombopoietin stimulated AML cell proliferation is seen in vitro in about 50% of cases. Both IL-6 and IL-11 showed little proliferative activity on primary AML cells. The combinations of these cytokines were synergistic in stimulating the proliferation of AML cells. On the other hand, the inhibitory haematopoietic cytokines: TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, IFN-gamma and IL-4 have shown multiple effects on AML blast cell proliferation. In several in vitro systems, haematopoietic cytokines have failed to induce maturation of AML blasts. Only in AML with t(8;21), G-CSF has induced granulocytic maturation of AML blasts in vitro. AML cells with chromosomal abnormalities involving the 21q22 region differentiate in vitro into eosinophils in the presence of IL-5. IL-6 and IFN-alpha have induced megakaryocytic differentiation of blast cells from acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (M7) patients. The haematopoietic cytokines: SCF, IL-3 and GMCSF have protected in vitro AML cells from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Many clinical studies have been recently reported evaluating the effect of the haematopoietic cytokines: GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-3 and PIXY321 as adjuncts to the chemotherapy of AML patients. Most studies have shown these haematopoietic cytokines to be well-tolerated and effective in augmenting neutrophil recovery in elderly AML patients when given after chemotherapy. On the other hand, considerable number of studies using these cytokines before and during chemotherapy to recruit AML cells into cell cycle and thus make them more susceptible to chemotherapy have reaveled no benefit. Several clinical trials have shown promising results after the use of IL-2 either as remission induction therapy in refractory and/or relapsed AML patients or as post-remission consolidative immunotherapy. Haematopoietic cytokines administered after chemotherapy can shorten the duration of neutropenia and hospitalisation without a significant effect on treatment outcome. On the other hand, their use before and during chemotherapy has yielded no benefit, and instead have led to delay of platelet recovery and worse survival rate in some elderly AML patients.","['Hassan, H', 'Zander, A']","['Hassan H', 'Zander A']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,,,,1997/11/01 00:00,1997/11/01 00:01,['2011/05/19 06:00'],"['2011/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '1997/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/11/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.4.6.1141 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 1997 Nov-Dec;4(6):1141-9. doi: 10.3892/or.4.6.1141.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the cure rate has increased dramatically over the past few years, the molecular and cellular biology of this disease is still not fully understood. Important factors affecting prognosis include age, leucocyte count, cytogenetic abnormalities, immunophenotype and sex. However, the role of cell kinetics, tumor associated genes and drug resistance have rarely been investigated in pediatric ALL. This preliminary study looks at these aspects in this disease. Immunocytochemical analysis of the tumor suppressor protein p53, the anti apoptotic protein bcl-2, the multidrug resistance (MDR) gene product P-glycoprotein and the proliferation marker, Ki-67 were done using appropriate monoclonal antibodies. A total of 88 previously untreated children with confirmed ALL diagnosis and 40 age matched controls were included in the study. Ki-67 was expressed in 81% and P-glycoprotein in 68% of all cases. P53 expression was observed in 68% and Bcl-2 in 50% of cases. Fifty percent of all cases also showed concomitant expression of bcl-2 and p53. Since wild-type p53 is known to negatively regulate the expression of bcl-2, the co-expression of these two proteins having contrasting functions suggests that the p53 may be of a mutant variety. In addition, the expression of p53 also correlates to the presence of the multidrug gene product P-glycoprotein. Control samples were negative for all the four markers. P53, bcl-2 and P-glycoprotein can all influence chemotherapy resistance, the first two by regulating programmed cell death and the third by influencing intracellular drug levels. All patients are now being followed up to assess treatment response and to study the prognostic significance of the analyzed markers.","['Srinivas, G', 'Kusumakumari, P', 'Nair, M', 'Panicker, K', 'Pillai, M']","['Srinivas G', 'Kusumakumari P', 'Nair M', 'Panicker K', 'Pillai M']","['REG CANC CTR,DIV LAB MED,TRIVANDRUM 695011,KERALA,INDIA.

Because of the prominent inhibitory effects of exogenous UTI on tumor cell invasive and metastatic potential, it is important to determine whether there is endogenous UTI production by these cells. Most of cell-associated UTI is located on the cell surface. Immuno-precipitates of the particulate fraction contained three different polypeptide chains including M(r) >200 kDa, 125 kDa, and a polydisperse band of M(r) 40 kDa, which is confirmed to be UTI by amino acid sequence analysis. In SMT-cc1 cells pulse-labeled with [S-35]sulfate, a polyclonal antibody against UTI precipitated labeled proteins of >200 kDa, 125 kDa, 93 kDa, 69 kDa, and 40 kDa. Upon chase, very low levels of 40 kDa band could be detected in lysates. On the other hand, although UTI was immunoprecipitated from U937 cells and the cells were immunohistochemically positive with anti-UTI antibody, UTI remained unlabeled even after long incubation of the cells with [S-35]sulfate. This suggests that SMT-cc1 cells may produce endogenous UTI, but U937 cell-associated UTI, which may not be generated by U937 cells themselves, may be taken up onto the cell surface from the serum. SMT-cc1 cells were invasive on the Matrigel in an in vitro assay. Exogenously applied UTI efficiently inhibits tumor cell invasion in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, addition of anti-UTI antibody to the cells enhanced cell-associated caseinolytic activity. Anti-UTI antibody produced biphasic, concentration-dependent changes in tumor cell invasion. Although invasion by the cells was enhanced by addition of lower concentrations (<0.5 mu g/ml) of anti-UTI antibody to the in vitro assay system, higher concentrations (>0.5 mu g/ml) of antibody blocked tumor cell invasion, suggesting that too much cell-associated proteolytic activity may cause uncontrolled matrix degradation. Our results suggest that certain tumor cells express UTI on their cell surface and that membrane-bound UTI may control proteolysis and contribute to prevent the excessive fibrinolysis in condition such as tumor invasion.","['Kobayashi, H', 'Terao, T']","['Kobayashi H', 'Terao T']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,,,,1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['2011/05/19 06:00'],"['2011/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.4.1.65 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 1997 Jan-Feb;4(1):65-72. doi: 10.3892/or.4.1.65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrated that combining ABT-869, a FLT3 inhibitor, with SAHA, a HDAC inhibitor, led to synergistic killing of the AML cells with FLT3 mutations and suppression of colony formation. We identified a core gene signature that is uniquely induced by the combination treatment in 2 different leukemia cell lines. Among these, we showed that downregulation of PTP4A3 (PRL-3) played a role in this synergism. PRL-3 is downstream of FLT3 signaling and ectopic expression of PRL-3 conferred therapeutic resistance through upregulation of STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) pathway activity and anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein. PRL-3 interacts with HDAC4 and SAHA downregulates PRL-3 via a proteasome dependent pathway. In addition, PRL-3 protein was identified in 47% of AML cases, but was absent in myeloid cells in normal bone marrows. Our results suggest such combination therapies may significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors.

We have experienced eight HTVL-I carriers with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, which is known to arise from bronchioloalveolar pneumocytes. This case-control study clarified the risk of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma in HTLV-I carriers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the past four years, 212 lung cancer patients were examined for serum anti-HTLV-I antibody. They underwent surgical treatment for lung cancer at Kumamoto University Hospital. Of these, 8 (4%) were HTLV-I carriers. As controls for this case-control study, we selected 24 HTLV-I negative-lung cancer patients (1:3 case-control ratio) matched for sex, age, and smoking status. The distributions of histological types of lung cancer were compared between the case (HTLV-I positive) and control (HTLV-I negative) groups. RESULTS: Histological types of the 8 HTLV-I carriers were bronchioloalveolar carcinoma in 6 patients and adenocarcinoma with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma component in 2.

Here, we use a hypomorphic oncogenic Nras allele and a normal oncogenic Nras allele (Nras G12D(hypo) and Nras G12D, respectively) to create a gene dose gradient ranging from 25% to 200% of endogenous Nras G12D/+. Mice expressing Nras G12D(hypo)/G12D(hypo) develop normally and are tumor-free, whereas early embryonic expression of Nras G12D/+ is lethal. Somatic expression of Nras G12D/G12D but not Nras G12D/+ leads to hyperactivation of ERK, excessive proliferation of myeloid progenitors, and consequently an acute myeloproliferative disease. Using a bone marrow transplant model, we previously showed that approximately 95% of animals receiving Nras G12D/+ bone marrow cells develop chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), while approximately 8% of recipients develop acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma [TALL] (TALL-het). Here we demonstrate that 100% of recipients transplanted with Nras G12D/G12D bone marrow cells develop TALL (TALL-homo). Although both TALL-het and -homo tumors acquire Notch1 mutations and are sensitive to a gamma-secretase inhibitor, endogenous Nras G12D/+ signaling promotes TALL through distinct genetic mechanism(s) from Nras G12D/G12D.

In this study, we investigated arginine transport activity and the expression of the related transporter genes during the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. We show here that the induction of THP-1 monocyte differentiation by PMA markedly increases the expression of SLC7A7 mRNA and of y(+)LAT1 protein and consequently, the activity of system y(+)L-mediated arginine transport. Conversely, the activity of system y(+) decreases during macrophage differentiation as a result of a reduction in CAT1 protein expression. The PMA-induced, macrophage-differentiated phenotype and the increased activity of system y(+)L through the induction of SLC7A7 gene are mediated by the specific activation of PKCbeta. SLC7A7 gene silencing causes a significant reduction of system y(+)L activity and a subsequent, marked increase of arginine and lysine cell content, thus suggesting that in macrophagic cells, system y(+)L activity is mainly directed outwardly. Differentiating agents other than PMA, i.e., VD3 and ATRA, are equally effective in the stimulation of system y(+)L transport activity through the increased expression of SLC7A7 mRNA and y(+)LAT1 protein. Moreover, we found that also during differentiation of human monocytes from peripheral blood SLC7A7 mRNA and system y(+)L activity are increased. These findings point to SLC7A7 gene as a marker of macrophage differentiation.","['Barilli, Amelia', 'Rotoli, Bianca Maria', 'Visigalli, Rossana', 'Bussolati, Ovidio', 'Gazzola, Gian C', ""Dall'Asta, Valeria""]","['Barilli A', 'Rotoli BM', 'Visigalli R', 'Bussolati O', 'Gazzola GC', ""Dall'Asta V""]","['Dipartimento di Medicina Sperimentale, Universita di Parma, Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Amino Acid Transport System y+L)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Fusion Regulatory Protein 1, Light Chains)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SLC7A7 protein, human)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Transport System y+L', 'Arginine/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Biomarkers', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fusion Regulatory Protein 1, Light Chains/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",2011/05/19 06:00,2011/10/14 06:00,['2011/05/19 06:00'],"['2011/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['jlb.0910510 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0910510 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2011 Aug;90(2):293-303. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0910510.

The U.S. Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry reports that Hispanic children have the highest incidence of ALL, however, it is unclear if this is due to genetic factors, unique environmental exposures, or both. Previous reports have shown an association between CYP1A1 variants and ALL. METHODS: To explore the contribution of CYP1A1 polymorphisms to ALL susceptibility in different ethnic groups, we conducted a case-control analysis in Caucasian, Hispanic, and African-American children. RESULTS: Increased risk of developing ALL was found in the whole sample group for homozygosity of variant alleles at CYP1A1*2C (OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.18-5.33, P = 0.016) and CYP1A1*2B (OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.43-7.34, P = 0.005). Stratified analyses showed increased risks in the Hispanic group (CYP1A1*2A, OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.27-5.74, P = 0.010; CYP1A1*2C, OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.13-5.38, P = 0.023; and CYP1A1*2B, OR 3.28, 95% CI 1.40-7.69, P = 0.006) but not for the other ethnic groups. Hispanic control subjects were significantly more likely to be carriers of variant alleles as compared to Caucasians (P < 0.0001) and African Americans (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that polymorphisms in CYP1A1 may contribute to the increased risk of ALL in Hispanic children due to both their impact on leukemia susceptibility and the increased prevalence of the at-risk alleles in the Hispanic population. IMPACT: Our study provides a novel and specific link between CYP1A1 polymorphisms and ethnic influence on ALL risk that may help explain varying susceptibilities across groups to environmental toxins.","['Swinney, Ryan M', 'Beuten, Joke', 'Collier, Anderson B 3rd', 'Chen, Tina T-L', 'Winick, Naomi J', 'Pollock, Brad H', 'Tomlinson, Gail E']","['Swinney RM', 'Beuten J', 'Collier AB 3rd', 'Chen TT', 'Winick NJ', 'Pollock BH', 'Tomlinson GE']","['Department of Pediatrics and Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,['EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)'],IM,"['African Americans/ethnology/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/*genetics', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Hispanic or Latino/ethnology/genetics', 'Humans', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*ethnology/*genetics', 'Whites/ethnology/genetics']",2011/05/19 06:00,2011/11/10 06:00,['2011/05/19 06:00'],"['2011/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-10-1265 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-10-1265 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2011 Jul;20(7):1537-42. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-10-1265.

DNA hypermethylation is a common epigenetic abnormality in cancer that may serve as a marker of disease activity. METHODS: We selected 10 novel candidate genes from the most frequently hypermethylated genes detected by DNA microarray and bisulfite pyrosequencing of bladder cancers and applied them to detect bladder cancer in urine sediments. We analyzed DNA methylation in the candidate genes by quantitative methylation-specific real-time PCR (qMSP) to detect bladder cancer in urine sediments from 128 bladder cancer patients and 110 age-matched control subjects. RESULTS: Based on a multigene predictive model, we discovered 6 methylation markers (MYO3A, CA10, SOX11, NKX6-2, PENK, and DBC1) as most promising for detecting bladder cancer. A panel of 4 genes (MYO3A, CA10, NKX6-2, and DBC1 or SOX11) had 81% sensitivity and 97% specificity, whereas a panel of 5 genes (MYO3A, CA10, NKX6-2, DBC1, and SOX11 or PENK) had 85% sensitivity and 95% specificity for detection of bladder cancer (area under curve = 0.939). By analyzing the data by cancer invasiveness, detection rate was 47 of 58 (81%) in non-muscle invasive tumors (pTa, Tis, and pT1) and 62 of 70 (90%) in muscle invasive tumors (T2, T3, and T4). CONCLUSIONS: This biomarker panel analyzed by qMSP may help the early detection of bladder tumors in urine sediments with high accuracy.

Thus, suggesting that HBZ may play a key role in cellular leukemogenesis. Herein we present evidence that interferon regulatory factor IRF-1, which is a member of IRF transcription family, interacts with HBZ. The N-terminal of HBZ interacted with IRF-1. HBZ reduced both IRF-1 DNA-binding activity and stability via a proteasome-dependent pathway. In addition, IRF-1-mediated apoptosis is significantly reduced by ectopic production of the HBZ. These results suggested that HBZ has dual suppressive effects on IRF-1 function, which may contribute to HTLV-1 related pathogenesis.","['Mukai, Risa', 'Ohshima, Takayuki']","['Mukai R', 'Ohshima T']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science at Kagawa Campus, Tokushima Bunri University, 1314-1 Shido, Sanuki, Kagawa 769-2193, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1/*metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2011/05/19 06:00,2011/08/09 06:00,['2011/05/19 06:00'],"['2011/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(11)00767-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.05.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2011 Jun 3;409(2):328-32. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.05.014.

Norovirus infection, a major cause of acute epidemic diarrhea, has been described as a cause of chronic diarrhea in patients who are immunosuppressed, including transplant recipients and the very young. CASE PRESENTATIONS: We describe two patients, a 64 year-old man and a 59 year-old woman, both suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia and hypogammaglobulinemia, who developed chronic diarrhea resistant to therapy. In both cases, after months of symptoms, persistent norovirus infection--documented by repeatedly-positive high-sensitivity stool enzyme immunoassay--was found to be the cause. Both patients died with active diarrheal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the first cases of advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia to suffer from chronic symptomatic norovirus infection. Clinicians caring for such patients, particularly those with concomitant hypogammaglobulinema, who have chronic unexplained diarrhea, should consider norovirus infection in the differential diagnosis.","['Capizzi, Todd', 'Makari-Judson, Grace', 'Steingart, Richard', 'Mertens, Wilson C']","['Capizzi T', 'Makari-Judson G', 'Steingart R', 'Mertens WC']","['Baystate Regional Cancer Program/Tufts University School of Medicine, Springfield, MA 01107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Diarrhea/etiology/immunology/*virology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Norovirus/isolation & purification/*physiology', '*Virus Shedding']",2011/05/19 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/05/19 06:00'],"['2010/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['1471-2334-11-131 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2334-11-131 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2011 May 17;11:131. doi: 10.1186/1471-2334-11-131.,20110517,PMC3118142,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between January 2007 and December 2009, a total of 19 adult Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory CD33-positive AML (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia) were enrolled. All registered patients received a standard dose of cytarabine (Ara-C) (100 mg/m(2) x 7 days), combined with either idarubicin (IDR) (10-12 mg/m(2) x 3 days) or daunorubicin (DNR) (50 mg/m(2) x 3-5 days), and then GO (3-5 mg/m(2) ), which was administered 1 day after the last infusion of IDR (IAG regimen) or DNR (DAG regimen). While doses of both GO and IDR and the administration period of only DNR were increased, the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was assessed. Among 19 patients (nine in the IAG regimen, 10 in the DAG regimen), the median age was 59 years (range 33-64), and the relapsed/refractory ratio was 13/6. In the therapy using 3 mg/m(2) GO in the IAG or DAG regimen, grade 3/4 leukopenia and neutropenia were observed in all patients, but none had grade 3/4 non-hematological toxicities, except febrile neutropenia. Three patients in the IAG regimen who were administered 5 mg/m(2) GO showed DLT. No patients had veno-occlusive disease or sinusoidal obstructive syndrome. In conclusion, 3 mg/m(2) GO combined with Ara-C and IDR or DNR can be safely administered, and phase II trials should be conducted to investigate the clinical efficacy of the combination therapy.","['Usui, Noriko', 'Takeshita, Akihiro', 'Nakaseko, Chiaki', 'Dobashi, Nobuaki', 'Fujita, Hiroyuki', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Kobayashi, Yukio', 'Sakura, Toru', 'Yahagi, Yuichi', 'Shigeno, Kazuyuki', 'Ohwada, Chikako', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Ohtake, Shigeki', 'Miyawaki, Shuichi', 'Naoe, Tomoki', 'Ohnishi, Kazunori']","['Usui N', 'Takeshita A', 'Nakaseko C', 'Dobashi N', 'Fujita H', 'Kiyoi H', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Sakura T', 'Yahagi Y', 'Shigeno K', 'Ohwada C', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Ohtake S', 'Miyawaki S', 'Naoe T', 'Ohnishi K']","['Division of Clinical Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. usuin@jikei.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aminoglycosides/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",2011/05/19 06:00,2011/08/30 06:00,['2011/05/19 06:00'],"['2011/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.01957.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2011 Jul;102(7):1358-65. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.01957.x.

Lung transplantation (LTX) is the only viable treatment for patients with end-stage pulmonary disease, but LTX after BMT is an uncommon event given the medical candidacy of the potential recipients. We sought to evaluate the short- and long-term outcomes of LTX in BMT recipients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective evaluation of our institution's longitudinal LTX and BMT databases. Demographic and outcomes variables were collected. RESULTS: We identified 639 LTX from January 1, 1988, through December 31, 2009, and 5525 BMT from program inception, March 21, 1974, through December 31, 2009. From the cross-referenced cohort, we identified four patients who had BMT followed by LTX. Our series was composed of two men and two women, with a mean age of 32.3 yr (range, 20-59 yr). Single LTX were performed in two recipients (50%). All patients had significant and expected morbidities related to their transplant immunosuppression. Three patients (75%) required cardiopulmonary bypass at the time of LTX. The two recipients who underwent bilateral LTX required open chest management and subsequent tracheostomy. All patients are still alive at follow-up (range, 19-119 months, median 39.5). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that LTX in the setting of BMT is a high-risk operation with the potential for a tumultuous perioperative course. Despite this, good outcomes and survival are obtainable in carefully selected patients. Selection factors include clinically stable patients without active sepsis and preoperative optimization of nutrition in anticipation of a prolonged recovery. An experienced multidisciplinary team approach and a protocol-driven management plan are paramount for successful outcomes in this challenging population.","['Whitson, Bryan A', 'Shelstad, Ryan C', 'Hertz, Marshall I', 'Kelly, Rosemary F', ""D'Cunha, Jonathan"", 'Shumway, Sara J']","['Whitson BA', 'Shelstad RC', 'Hertz MI', 'Kelly RF', ""D'Cunha J"", 'Shumway SJ']","['Division of Thoracic and Foregut Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Denmark,Clin Transplant,Clinical transplantation,8710240,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/complications/surgery', '*Lung Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Lymphoma/complications/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/complications/surgery', 'Young Adult']",2011/05/19 06:00,2012/08/10 06:00,['2011/05/19 06:00'],"['2011/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1399-0012.2011.01482.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Transplant. 2012 Mar-Apr;26(2):254-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0012.2011.01482.x.

Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) has been shown to have an important role during muscle regeneration. The regenerative capacity of muscles after contusion injury in LIF-knockout mice is impaired compared with that of wild-type mice. 2. To clarify whether LIF modulates muscle regeneration by regulating myogenic precursor cell activity, we studied LIF expression and myogenic precursor cell activity in gastrocnemius muscles from Wistar rats at various times after contusion injury using immunohistochemistry and the direct effect of LIF on a rat myoblast cell line (L6). 3. After contusion injury, transient upregulation of the mRNA expression of LIF, LIF receptors and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, downstream of LIF and involved in enhanced cell proliferation, was observed. A marked increase in LIF protein in the cytosol of damaged myofibres was strongly correlated with a significant increase in the number of myogenic precursor cells (MyoD-positive cells) by 12 h after contusion. In addition, coexpression of LIF and MyoD protein in control and injured muscles after contusion injury from 3 h to 7 days was evident. 4. Treatment of L6 cells with LIF (1 ng/mL) in serum-free medium enhanced proliferation (bromodeoxyuridine incorporation) by 24 h. This was accompanied by increased expression of c-Myc protein within 12 h and was abolished by short interference RNA against c-Myc mRNA. 5. Together, the results of the present study suggest that LIF acts via paracrine and autocrine actions to regulate myogenic precursor cell activity during muscle regeneration after contusion injury and that the proliferative effect of LIF on L6 cells occurs via c-Myc signalling.","['Srikuea, Ratchakrit', 'Esser, Karyn A', 'Pholpramool, Chumpol']","['Srikuea R', 'Esser KA', 'Pholpramool C']","['Faculty of Science, Department of Physiology, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol,Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology,0425076,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Control Groups', 'Contusions/metabolism', 'Genes, myc/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Muscle, Skeletal/injuries/*physiology', 'Myoblasts/metabolism/physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/analysis/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Up-Regulation']",2011/05/19 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2011/05/19 06:00'],"['2011/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1681.2011.05537.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol. 2011 Aug;38(8):501-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1681.2011.05537.x.,,PMC4550807,"['R01 AR043349/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR055246/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 AR043349/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR43349/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS716290'],,"['(c) 2011 The Authors.

Children with hypoglycemia in CGM examination had a lower median body mass index standard deviation score (BMI Z-score) (-0.65 [-0.94 to -0.27] vs. -0.14 [-0.29 to 0.35]; p = 0.05) and shorter duration of MT (6.5 [4-15] vs. 22.5 [16.5-28] weeks; p = 0.004). Glucose variability parameters were strongly correlated with BMI Z-score and liver function enzymes. Hypoglycemia, particularly at night-time, may develop as a complication of MT in children with ALL. The risk factors for low glucose level are low BMI Z-score and initiation of MT.","['Trelinska, Joanna', 'Fendler, Wojciech', 'Szadkowska, Agnieszka', 'Czerwoniuk, Dorota', 'Mianowska, Beata', 'Wegner, Olga', 'Mlynarski, Wojciech']","['Trelinska J', 'Fendler W', 'Szadkowska A', 'Czerwoniuk D', 'Mianowska B', 'Wegner O', 'Mlynarski W']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Blood Glucose)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blood Glucose', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypoglycemia/*etiology', '*Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Risk Factors']",2011/05/19 06:00,2011/12/21 06:00,['2011/05/19 06:00'],"['2011/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.580024 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Sep;52(9):1704-10. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.580024.

METHODS: A total of 40 Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into normal control, AD model, EA and olfactory nerve transaction(ONT) + EA groups, with 10 rats in each. AD model was established by injection of beta-amyloid (Abeta)(1-40) (2 microL containing 10 microg) into the hippocampus (Bregma: 3.5 mm, L: 2.0 mm, H: -2.8 mm below dura), and the ON was sectioned by using a fine needle. EA (80-100 Hz, 1-3 mA) was applied to bilateral LI 20 and EX-HN 3 for 10 min, once daily (except Saturdays and Sundays) for 6 weeks. The expression of Bcl-2 and Bax of hippocampus was measured by immunohisto-chemistry. RESULTS: Compared with the normal control group, the expression of Bcl-2 of hippocampus was significantly lower in the AD model group (P<0.05), and that of Bax in AD model group was much higher (P<0.01). In comparison with the model group, the expression of hippocampal Bcl-2 was up-regulated significantly (P<0.01), and that of hippocampal Bax protein downregulated considerably in the EA group (P<0.01). No significant differences were found between AD model and ONT + EA groups in the expression of hippocampal Bcl-2 and Bax proteins (P>0.05), suggesting a necessary premise condition for EA in regulating hippocampal Bcl-2 and Bax expression. CONCLUSION: ""Xiusanzhen"" can regulate the expression of hippocampal Bcl-2 and Bax proteins in AD rats, which may contribute to its clinical effect in relieving AD, and the therapeutic effect depends on the integrity of the olfactory nerve pathway.","['Liu, Zhi-bin', 'Niu, Wen-min', 'Yang, Xiao-bang', 'Niu, Xiao-mei', 'Yuan, Wang']","['Liu ZB', 'Niu WM', 'Yang XB', 'Niu XM', 'Yuan W']","['Department of Acu-moxibustion and Tuina, Shaanxi College of Chinese Medicine, Xianyang 712046, China. lzb210396@163.com']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhen Ci Yan Jiu,Zhen ci yan jiu = Acupuncture research,8507710,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Acupuncture Points', 'Alzheimer Disease/*genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Electroacupuncture', 'Hippocampus/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Random Allocation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*genetics/metabolism']",2011/05/19 06:00,2011/07/13 06:00,['2011/05/19 06:00'],"['2011/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhen Ci Yan Jiu. 2011 Feb;36(1):7-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GSK923295A is an allosteric inhibitor of CENP-E that is undergoing clinical evaluation. PROCEDURES: GSK923295A was evaluated against the 23 cell lines in the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) in vitro panel using 96 hr exposures to concentrations ranging from 1.0 nM to 10.0 microM. GSK923295A was also tested in vivo against the PPTP acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and solid tumor xenograft panels using a days 1-3 and 8-10 schedule that was repeated at day 21. The agent was administered via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route at a daily dose of 125 mg/kg. RESULTS: The median IC(50) for all PPTP cell lines was 27 nM, with the median IC(50) for the ALL panel being the lowest (18 nM) and for the neuroblastoma panel the highest (39 nM). Excessive toxicity was observed for each of the 8 xenografts of the ALL panel in NOD/SCID mice. Thirty-five solid tumor xenograft models were considered evaluable. GSK923295A induced significant differences in event-free survival distribution compared to controls in 32 of 35 evaluable solid tumor xenografts tested. Objective responses were noted in 13 of 35 solid tumor xenografts, including 9 with maintained complete responses, and 3 with complete response (CR). CONCLUSIONS: GSK923295A demonstrated significant antitumor activity against solid tumor models, inducing CRs in Ewing sarcoma, rhabdoid, and rhabdomyosarcoma xenografts. These results suggest that CENP-E may be a valuable therapeutic target in pediatric cancer.","['Lock, Richard B', 'Carol, Hernan', 'Morton, Christopher L', 'Keir, Stephen T', 'Reynolds, C Patrick', 'Kang, Min H', 'Maris, John M', 'Wozniak, Amy W', 'Gorlick, Richard', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'Houghton, Peter J', 'Smith, Malcolm A']","['Lock RB', 'Carol H', 'Morton CL', 'Keir ST', 'Reynolds CP', 'Kang MH', 'Maris JM', 'Wozniak AW', 'Gorlick R', 'Kolb EA', 'Houghton PJ', 'Smith MA']","['Lowy Cancer Research Centre, Randwick, NSW, Australia. rlock@ccia.unsw.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (GSK923295)', '0 (centromere protein E)', 'Z711V88R5F (Sarcosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Sarcosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2011/05/18 06:00,2012/05/17 06:00,['2011/05/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23176 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Jun;58(6):916-23. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23176.

The aim of the present prospective study is to compare the safety and efficacy of propofol-ketamine versus propofol alone, managed by trained pediatricians, in children with cancer undergoing painful procedures. PROCEDURES: Data on 121 children with acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL) undergoing procedural sedations (lumbar punctures and bone marrow aspirations) were prospectively collected and included drug doses, side effects, pain assessment, and sedation degree. Children were randomly assigned to one of the two groups: P (n = 62) receiving propofol alone and K (n = 59) in whom a ketamine-propofol combination was used. RESULTS: In group K, the total dose of propofol required was significantly lower than in group P (3.9 +/- 3.6 mg/kg vs. 5.1 +/- 3.6 mg/kg; P < 0.001). The incidence of hypotension was also significantly lower (11% vs. 39%; P < 0.001). Major O(2) desaturations (defined as SatO(2) < 88%) occurred principally in group P (7 vs. 1; P = 0.05). Both best analgesia and shorter recovery time were obtained with the propofol-ketamine association. No differences were observed in the degree of sedation and in the awakening quality score between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of propofol and ketamine produced statistically significant clinical advantages combined with a higher profile of safety in children with cancer undergoing painful procedures.","['Chiaretti, Antonio', 'Ruggiero, Antonio', 'Barbi, Egidio', 'Pierri, Filomena', 'Maurizi, Palma', 'Fantacci, Claudia', 'Bersani, Giulia', 'Riccardi, Riccardo']","['Chiaretti A', 'Ruggiero A', 'Barbi E', 'Pierri F', 'Maurizi P', 'Fantacci C', 'Bersani G', 'Riccardi R']","['Department of Pediatric Sciences, Catholic University Medical School, Rome, Italy. achiaretti@yahoo.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Hypnotics and Sedatives)', '690G0D6V8H (Ketamine)', 'YI7VU623SF (Propofol)']",IM,"['Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Child', 'Conscious Sedation/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypnotics and Sedatives/*therapeutic use', 'Ketamine/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*surgery', 'Pediatrics/*methods', 'Physicians', 'Propofol/*therapeutic use', 'Spinal Puncture/methods']",2011/05/18 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/05/18 06:00'],"['2010/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23170 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Dec 15;57(7):1163-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23170.

The aim of this study is to provocatively assess the role of purified autologous transplantation compared with best chemotherapy results in the same setting. PROCEDURE: We reported a series of 30 pediatric patients who underwent purified peripheral blood autologous transplantation for ALL in CR2, after isolated extramedullary (7), or late medullary (23) relapse from January 1997 and March 2004. Among 246 patients treated with chemotherapy within Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster relapse protocols during the same period, we found 103 controls who matched our 30 cases, according to site of relapse, CR1 duration, time elapsed in CR2, and period of relapse. RESULTS: Event-free survival and survival at 5 years after relapse were 73.3% (SE 8.1) and 86.5% (SE 8.2) for auto-transplanted cases and 40.0% (SE 9.7) and 62.5%(SE 9.6) for chemotherapy-treated controls (P-values: 0.012 and 0.025, respectively). The risk of relapse after auto-transplantation at 1 and 4 years was approximately half and one-fifth, respectively, of the same risk obtained with chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This matched analysis showed an advantage of purified autologous transplantation compared with chemotherapy in low-risk relapsed ALL, possibly explained by the single-center effect, the myeloablation of total body irradiation, the documented low tumor burden at mobilization and the stem cell isolation procedure.","['Balduzzi, Adriana', 'Galimberti, Stefania', 'Valsecchi, Maria G', 'Bonanomi, Sonia', 'Conter, Valentino', 'Barth, Andrea', 'Rovelli, Attilio', 'Henze, Gunter', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'von Stackelberg, Arend']","['Balduzzi A', 'Galimberti S', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Bonanomi S', 'Conter V', 'Barth A', 'Rovelli A', 'Henze G', 'Biondi A', 'von Stackelberg A']","['Clinica Pediatrica, Ospedale San Gerardo, Universita degli Studi di Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy. a.balduzzi@hsgerardo.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2011/05/18 06:00,2011/10/14 06:00,['2011/05/18 06:00'],"['2010/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23169 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Oct;57(4):654-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23169.

The FLAMSA-RIC protocol for high-risk patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome has shown promising results in refractory disease as well as in first complete remission. Still, the RIC protocol containing 4 Gy TBI/cyclophosphamide/anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) implicates acute toxicity mainly due to TBI preventing its usage in patients with advanced age and/or severe co-morbidities. To increase feasibility and safety of the conditioning, we substituted TBI with treosulfan. Seventeen patients with relapsed or high-risk AML and either advanced age or concomitant disease were treated within a preparative regimen containing a 4-day course of chemotherapy (FLAMSA) followed by RIC comprising of treosulfan, cyclophosphamide, and ATG. After median follow-up of 12 months, the estimated incidences of relapse and non-relapse mortality were 25% and 20%, respectively. One-year overall survival was 62%. In conclusion, FLAMSA-treosulfan/cyclophosphamide/ATG is an intermediate intensity conditioning regimen with acceptable non-relapse mortality for patients with relapsed or high-risk AML. Substituting TBI with treosulfan provides an alternative to treat elderly patients or patients with severe co-morbidities when TBI appears not feasible due to the potential of increased toxicity.","['Chemnitz, Jens Marcus', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal, Marie', 'Holtick, Udo', 'Theurich, Sebastian', 'Shimabukuro-Vornhagen, Alexander', 'Krause, Anke', 'Brossart, Peter', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Scheid, Christof']","['Chemnitz JM', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal M', 'Holtick U', 'Theurich S', 'Shimabukuro-Vornhagen A', 'Krause A', 'Brossart P', 'Hallek M', 'Scheid C']","['BMT Program, Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Kerpener Strasse 62, 50924 Koln, Germany. jens.chemnitz@uk-koeln.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'CO61ER3EPI (treosulfan)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",2011/05/18 06:00,2012/02/24 06:00,['2011/05/18 06:00'],"['2010/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-011-1253-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2012 Jan;91(1):47-55. doi: 10.1007/s00277-011-1253-9.

We have examined the immunoglobulin sequence of several NZB B-1 malignant clones and found these clones to have several common characteristics. The B-1 malignant clones all use unmuated VH genes and DFL16.1, a D region gene which pre-dominates during fetal B cell development. In addition, no N base insertions were observed in the clones. A continually passaged line of murine CLL-like cells was examined in more detail. This line used a germline S107 VH gene that showed no evidence of accumulated somatic mutation over the course of five years of in vivo passage. The D gene (DFL16.1) was also unmutated with no evidence of non-germline diversity at the junction sites. The non-mutated state was maintained despite a continued transformation of the CLL-like cells into a more aggressive large cell lymphoma known as Richter's syndrome. Several years after the development of Richter's syndrome, the usage of a completely new VH gene family was detected. This second B-1 clone employing a new VH gene was expressed with similar characteristics as the initial B-1 clone, both employing DFL16.1 with no N base insertions at the junction sites. This demonstrates that B-1 cells which are destined to clonally expand have unique characteristics in the expression of surface immunoglobulin. Therefore, B-1 (CD5+ B) cells which undergo transformation in CLL are not randomly derived from the normal B-1 cell population but instead come from a subpopulation of B-1 cells which display these specific features of immunoglobulin expression.","['Mahboudi, F', 'Phillips, J', 'Raveche, E']","['Mahboudi F', 'Phillips J', 'Raveche E']","['UNIV MED & DENT NEW JERSEY,NEW JERSEY MED SCH,DEPT LAB MED & PATHOL,NEWARK,NJ 07103.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,,,,1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['2011/05/18 06:00'],"['2011/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.1.4.459 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1992 Sep;1(4):459-65. doi: 10.3892/ijo.1.4.459.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, to assess the safety and efficacy of GI endoscopy as a means of diagnosis, we analyzed the records of 16 patients undergoing 27 endoscopies a mean (+/-S.D.) of 18.4 +/- 11.9 days post chemotherapy. There were 6 procedures performed in patients with acute lymphocytic, 18 with acute myelogenous, including 3 with acute promyelocytic and 3 with blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia. 10/27 procedures were performed in patients with less than 1000 WBC/mm3 and 19/27 had less than 100,000 platelets. 15 patients had 25 upper endoscopies done for: bleeding (twenty-one), abdominal pain (two), and persistent vomiting (two). The principal bleeding sources were: esophagitis (eleven), Mallory Weiss tear (one), gastritis (three), gastric ulcer (one), duodenal ulcer (five). In the non-bleeding cases 2 exams were normal and the others had gastritis (one) and esophagitis (one). 15/25 procedures (64%) resulted in new diagnosis and 20/25 (80%) in additional therapies. 47% of patients undergoing upper GI endoscopy received specific new therapies as a result of that procedure. Nd: YAG laser photocoagulation was effective in stopping bleeding lesions in 4/6 cases. 10/12 bleeding patients had persistent or recurrent bleeding and 2 died from bleeding. None had surgery. Two patients underwent colonoscopy, both for colonic distention. One patient, who had been recently treated for Cl. difficile had submucosal petechiae. The other had non-specific colitis. No biopsies were done and both cases were successfully decompressed..No complications occurred from any GI endoscopy. We conclude that GI endoscopy can be safely performed in patients with acute leukemia, resulting in specific diagnoses and therapies. Esophagitis is a principal cause of GI bleeding in these patients. The role of therapeutic endoscopy in controlling bleeding is promising but requires further evaluation.","['Dworkin, B', 'Winzelberg, N', 'Ahmed, T', 'Lebovics, E', 'Heier, S', 'Feldman, E', 'Stein, B', 'Casellas, A', 'Arlin, Z']","['Dworkin B', 'Winzelberg N', 'Ahmed T', 'Lebovics E', 'Heier S', 'Feldman E', 'Stein B', 'Casellas A', 'Arlin Z']","['NEW YORK MED COLL,DEPT MED,DIV NEOPLAST DIS,VALHALLA,NY 10595.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,,,,1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['2011/05/18 06:00'],"['2011/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.1.4.439 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1992 Sep;1(4):439-42. doi: 10.3892/ijo.1.4.439.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This fusion protein has been implicated in epigenetic silencing, recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) and DNA methyltransferases to target promoters. Previously, we have identified a novel in vivo AML1/ETO target gene, LAT2 (NTAL/LAB/WBSCR5), which is involved in FcvarepsilonR I, c-Kit, B-cell and T-cell receptor signalling. We have now addressed the molecular mechanisms of AML1/ETO-mediated LAT2 repression. In Kasumi-1 cells, where AML1/ETO bound to the LAT2 gene, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated AML1/ETO depletion caused upregulation of LAT2, suggesting a possible direct mechanism of repression. Expression of AML1/ETO was associated with a decrease in acetylation of histones H3, H3K9 and H4, and an increase in H3K9 and H3K27 trimethylation. The class I-specific HDAC inhibitors entinostat (MS-275) and mocetinostat (MGCD0103) induced LAT2 expression specifically in AML1/ETO-expressing cells, resulting in induction of several activating histone marks on the LAT2 gene, including trimethylation of histone H3K4. The combination of entinostat and decitabine increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4, as well as LAT2 mRNA expression, in an at least additive fashion. In conclusion, several repressive histone modifications mark the LAT2 gene in the presence of AML1/ETO, and LAT2 gene derepression is achieved by pharmacological inhibition of HDACs.","['Duque-Afonso, J', 'Yalcin, A', 'Berg, T', 'Abdelkarim, M', 'Heidenreich, O', 'Lubbert, M']","['Duque-Afonso J', 'Yalcin A', 'Berg T', 'Abdelkarim M', 'Heidenreich O', 'Lubbert M']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Freiburg, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (LAT2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '1ZNY4FKK9H (entinostat)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*physiology', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Silencing', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology']",2011/05/18 06:00,2011/09/16 06:00,['2011/05/18 06:00'],"['2011/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['onc201132 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2011.32 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2011 Jul 7;30(27):3062-72. doi: 10.1038/onc.2011.32.

Cutaneous manifestations may be primary or secondary to an underlying malignancy. Skin lesions may appear prior to the onset of systemic malignancy or they may occur concurrently or following an established diagnosis.

The primary focus of this review will be cutaneous features of leukemias, lymphomas, neuroblastoma, some sarcomas, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. RECENT FINDINGS: A wide range of cutaneous manifestations have been reported in systemic malignancies of children. In addition to providing a description of more typical features of skin lesions associated with these conditions, this review will summarize a few recent case reports of pediatric malignancies with unusual cutaneous presentations.

Here we summarize the studies that have shed light on the hematopoietic-specific roles of MSI2 and PROX1 and give an overview of the molecular mechanisms underlying their function. RECENT FINDINGS: In addition to a likely role in cell cycle restraint, the hematopoietic stem cell agonist MSI2 is essential for the maintenance of primitive cell fate through ensuring appropriate balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Overexpression of Msi2 can contribute to the progression of murine myeloid leukemia and in the human setting is associated with poor prognosis. Regulatory control imposed by MSI2 may be achieved partly through regulation of the Notch signaling pathway. Prox1 behaves in an opposing manner to Msi2, resulting in elevated stem cell numbers when depleted. It has a potential role in cell cycle control and may act at the level of primitive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells as it does in other systems by directly promoting commitment and differentiation. PROX1 functions as a tumor suppressor in numerous tissue types and has been found mutated in hematopoietic cell lines and primary blood malignancies. SUMMARY: Deciphering the molecular mechanisms through which MSI2 and PROX1 affect primitive hematopoietic cell fate will provide insight into the regulation of normal hematopoiesis and facilitate better understanding of the leukemic transformation process. This will be directly applicable to the development of effective regenerative therapies and targeted leukemia treatments.","['Hope, Kristin J', 'Sauvageau, Guy']","['Hope KJ', 'Sauvageau G']","['Molecular Genetics of Stem Cells Laboratory, Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MSI2 protein, human)', '0 (Msi2h protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (prospero-related homeobox 1 protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/05/18 06:00,2011/10/28 06:00,['2011/05/18 06:00'],"['2011/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e328347888a [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2011 Jul;18(4):203-7. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e328347888a.,,,['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this review is to highlight these new findings and provide a conceptual framework for understanding how epigenetic modifications might contribute to lymphomagenesis. RECENT FINDINGS: Somatic mutations affecting histone methyltransferases such as enhancer of zeste 2 and mixed lineage leukemia 2, histone demethylases including ubiquitously transcribed X chromosome tetratricopeptide repeat and Jumonji domain-containing 2C, and histone acetyltransferases including CBP and p300 are recurrent and common in lymphomas. These mutations result in disruption of chromatin structure and functions of other proteins, ultimately causing aberrant transcriptional programming affecting multiple gene networks. Widespread perturbation of cytosine methylation patterning now appears to be a hallmark of B-cell lymphomas and occurs in specific patterns that can distinguish disease subtypes. Therapeutic targeting strategies can overcome abnormal epigenetic mechanisms and potently kill lymphoma cells. SUMMARY: Newly discovered epigenetic lesions may provide critical insights into the genesis of B-cell lymphomas, but further studies are required to understand how they affect biological mechanism. Epigenetic lesions offer tremendous opportunities for the development of improved biomarkers and treatments.","['Shaknovich, Rita', 'Melnick, Ari']","['Shaknovich R', 'Melnick A']","['Department of Pathology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology']",2011/05/18 06:00,2011/10/28 06:00,['2011/05/18 06:00'],"['2011/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e32834788cf [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2011 Jul;18(4):293-9. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e32834788cf.,,PMC3260081,"['R01 CA 104348/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA155226/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA143032-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA127353/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA104348-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA155226-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA104348/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA143032/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS313360'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Aerosolized liposomal amphotericin B (lipAmB) was evaluated as an antifungal prophylaxis in patients with an expected neutropenia of more than 10 days due to intensive chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation, in a prospective phase II trial. RESULTS: 98 treatment episodes were included in the study and compared to 105 historical control patients. Inhalation was performed between 0 and 103 days. No severe side effects of therapy occurred. 40 patients considered inhalations as unpleasant, 2 as very unpleasant, mostly due to bad taste or cough. Few cases of definite or probable IFI were recorded, whereas a large number of patients were treated with systemic antifungal therapy for pneumonia or fever of unknown origin without a significant difference between study patients and controls. In a predefined subgroup analysis of 48 patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), significantly more patients survived for 1 year in the AmB prophylaxis than in the control group (80% vs. 54%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Inhalations of lipAmB are feasible and safe. Results in the subgroup of patients with AML together with data from other trials suggest further evaluation of effectiveness.","['Hullard-Pulstinger, Annette', 'Holler, Ernst', 'Hahn, Joachim', 'Andreesen, Reinhard', 'Krause, Stefan W']","['Hullard-Pulstinger A', 'Holler E', 'Hahn J', 'Andreesen R', 'Krause SW']","['Abteilung fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinikum der Universitat Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (liposomal amphotericin B)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Amphotericin B/*administration & dosage', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/*etiology/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/05/18 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/05/18 06:00'],"['2011/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['000327802 [pii]', '10.1159/000327802 [doi]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2011;34(5):254-8. doi: 10.1159/000327802.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received 1 cycle of subcutaneous (SC) azacitidine (75 mg/m2) on the first 7 days of cycle 1, followed by oral azacitidine daily (120 to 600 mg) on the first 7 days of each additional 28-day cycle. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles were evaluated during cycles 1 and 2. Adverse events and hematologic responses were recorded. Cross-over to SC azacitidine was permitted for nonresponders who received >/= 6 cycles of oral azacitidine. RESULTS: Overall, 41 patients received SC and oral azacitidine (MDSs, n = 29; CMML, n = 4; AML, n = 8). Dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3/4 diarrhea) occurred at the 600-mg dose and MTD was 480 mg. Most common grade 3/4 adverse events were diarrhea (12.2%), nausea (7.3%), vomiting (7.3%), febrile neutropenia (19.5%), and fatigue (9.8%). Azacitidine exposure increased with escalating oral doses. Mean relative oral bioavailability ranged from 6.3% to 20%. Oral and SC azacitidine decreased DNA methylation in blood, with maximum effect at day 15 of each cycle. Hematologic responses occurred in patients with MDSs and CMML. Overall response rate (i.e., complete remission, hematologic improvement, or RBC or platelet transfusion independence) was 35% in previously treated patients and 73% in previously untreated patients.

In Sweden, the drug was approved in November 2001. We report relative survival (RS) of patients with CML diagnosed during a 36-year period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using data from the population-based Swedish Cancer Registry and population life tables, we estimated RS for all patients diagnosed with CML from 1973 to 2008 (n = 3173; 1796 males and 1377 females; median age, 62 years). Patients were categorized into five age groups and five calendar periods, the last being 2001 to 2008. Information on use of upfront IM was collected from the Swedish CML registry. RESULTS: Relative survival improved with each calendar period, with the greatest improvement between 1994-2000 and 2001-2008. Five-year cumulative relative survival ratios (95% CIs) were 0.21 (0.17 to 0.24) for patients diagnosed 1973-1979, 0.54 (0.50 to 0.58) for 1994-2000, and 0.80 (0.75 to 0.83) for 2001-2008. This improvement was confined to patients younger than 79 years of age. Five-year RSRs for patients diagnosed from 2001 to 2008 were 0.91 (95% CI, 0.85 to 0.94) and 0.25 (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.47) for patients younger than 50 and older than 79 years, respectively. Men had inferior outcome. Upfront overall use of IM increased from 40% (2002) to 84% (2006). Only 18% of patients older than 80 years of age received IM as first-line therapy. CONCLUSION: This large population-based study shows a major improvement in outcome of patients with CML up to 79 years of age diagnosed from 2001 to 2008, mainly caused by an increasing use of IM. The elderly still have poorer outcome, partly because of a limited use of IM.","['Bjorkholm, Magnus', 'Ohm, Lotta', 'Eloranta, Sandra', 'Derolf, Asa', 'Hultcrantz, Malin', 'Sjoberg, Jan', 'Andersson, Therese', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Richter, Johan', 'Landgren, Ola', 'Kristinsson, Sigurdur Y', 'Dickman, Paul W']","['Bjorkholm M', 'Ohm L', 'Eloranta S', 'Derolf A', 'Hultcrantz M', 'Sjoberg J', 'Andersson T', 'Hoglund M', 'Richter J', 'Landgren O', 'Kristinsson SY', 'Dickman PW']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden. magnus.bjorkholm@karolinska.se']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/mortality/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mortality/trends', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Sex Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2011/05/18 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2011/05/18 06:00'],"['2011/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.34.7146 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.34.7146 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Jun 20;29(18):2514-20. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.34.7146.

In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), persistence or relapse of minimal residual disease (MRD) after chemotherapy indicates resistance to chemotherapy and results in hematologic relapse. A phase II clinical study was conducted to determine the efficacy of blinatumomab in MRD-positive B-lineage ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with MRD persistence or relapse after induction and consolidation therapy were included. MRD was assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for either rearrangements of immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor genes, or specific genetic aberrations. Blinatumomab was administered as a 4-week continuous intravenous infusion at a dose of 15 mug/m2/24 hours. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were treated, of whom 16 patients became MRD negative. One patient was not evaluable due to a grade 3 adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation. Among the 16 responders, 12 patients had been molecularly refractory to previous chemotherapy. Probability for relapse-free survival is 78% at a median follow-up of 405 days. The most frequent grade 3 and 4 adverse event was lymphopenia, which was completely reversible like most other adverse events. CONCLUSION: Blinatumomab is an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment in patients with MRD-positive B-lineage ALL after intensive chemotherapy. T cells engaged by blinatumomab seem capable of eradicating chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells that otherwise cause clinical relapse.","['Topp, Max S', 'Kufer, Peter', 'Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Goebeler, Mariele', 'Klinger, Matthias', 'Neumann, Svenja', 'Horst, Heinz-A', 'Raff, Thorsten', 'Viardot, Andreas', 'Schmid, Mathias', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Schaich, Markus', 'Degenhard, Evelyn', 'Kohne-Volland, Rudolf', 'Bruggemann, Monika', 'Ottmann, Oliver', 'Pfeifer, Heike', 'Burmeister, Thomas', 'Nagorsen, Dirk', 'Schmidt, Margit', 'Lutterbuese, Ralf', 'Reinhardt, Carsten', 'Baeuerle, Patrick A', 'Kneba, Michael', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Riethmuller, Gert', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Zugmaier, Gerhard', 'Bargou, Ralf C']","['Topp MS', 'Kufer P', 'Gokbuget N', 'Goebeler M', 'Klinger M', 'Neumann S', 'Horst HA', 'Raff T', 'Viardot A', 'Schmid M', 'Stelljes M', 'Schaich M', 'Degenhard E', 'Kohne-Volland R', 'Bruggemann M', 'Ottmann O', 'Pfeifer H', 'Burmeister T', 'Nagorsen D', 'Schmidt M', 'Lutterbuese R', 'Reinhardt C', 'Baeuerle PA', 'Kneba M', 'Einsele H', 'Riethmuller G', 'Hoelzer D', 'Zugmaier G', 'Bargou RC']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken, University Wuerzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Agammaglobulinemia/chemically induced', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphopenia/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity/drug effects/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*drug effects/immunology', 'Young Adult']",2011/05/18 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2011/05/18 06:00'],"['2011/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.32.7270 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.32.7270 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Jun 20;29(18):2493-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.32.7270.

PATIENTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS: Overall, 193 patients with MDS and 65 healthy volunteers were examined for ASXL1 mutations by direct sequencing and for expression levels of ASXL1. The prognostic impact of ASXL1 mutation and expression levels was evaluated in the context of other clinical and molecular prognostic markers. RESULTS: Mutations in ASXL1 occurred with a frequency of 20.7% in MDS (n = 40 of 193) with 70% (n = 28) of mutations being frameshift mutations and 30% (n = 12) being heterozygous point mutations leading to translational changes. ASXL1 mutations were correlated with an intermediate-risk karyotype (P = .002) but not with other clinical parameters. The presence of ASXL1 mutations was associated with a shorter overall survival for frameshift and point mutations combined (hazard ratio [HR], 1.744; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.82; P = .024) and for frameshift mutations only (HR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.21 to 3.50; P = .008). ASXL1 frameshift mutations were associated with a reduced time to progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML; HR 2.35; 95% CI, 1.17 to 4.74; P = .017). In multivariate analysis, when considering karyotype, transfusion dependence, and IDH1 mutation status, ASXL1 frameshift mutations remained an independent prognostic marker in MDS (overall survival: HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.34; P = .040; time to AML progression: HR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.12 to 5.09; P = .024). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ASXL1 mutations are frequent molecular aberrations in MDS that predict an adverse prognostic outcome. Screening of patients for ASXL1 mutations might be useful for clinical risk stratification and treatment decisions in the future.","['Thol, Felicitas', 'Friesen, Inna', 'Damm, Frederik', 'Yun, Haiyang', 'Weissinger, Eva M', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Wagner, Katharina', 'Chaturvedi, Anuhar', 'Sharma, Amit', 'Wichmann, Martin', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Schumann, Christiane', 'Bug, Gesine', 'Ottmann, Oliver', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Heuser, Michael', 'Ganser, Arnold']","['Thol F', 'Friesen I', 'Damm F', 'Yun H', 'Weissinger EM', 'Krauter J', 'Wagner K', 'Chaturvedi A', 'Sharma A', 'Wichmann M', 'Gohring G', 'Schumann C', 'Bug G', 'Ottmann O', 'Hofmann WK', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Heuser M', 'Ganser A']","['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg Str. 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany. thol.felicitas@mh-hannover.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antilymphocyte Serum', 'Biomarkers', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Frameshift Mutation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, MHC Class II', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/mortality/therapy', '*Point Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Repressor Proteins/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Risk']",2011/05/18 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2011/05/18 06:00'],"['2011/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.33.4938 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.33.4938 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Jun 20;29(18):2499-506. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.33.4938.

Leukemia cells were incubated with cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide with or without 10(-5) M and 10(-3) M concentrations of MLT. Cytotoxicity was measured by detecting apoptosis using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Overall, co-incubation with melatonin did not alter the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs in cell lines and patient samples except one. In a patient sample with acute myeloid leukemia, etoposide treatment in combination either concentrations of MLT resulted in increased elimination of the leukemia cells.

They can be proposed in two pediatric populations. First, solid tumors or hematological malignancies remaining unresponsive to the reference strategies according to best practices in pediatrics. Second, in children presenting malignancies for which allografting is the only recognized curative indication but is contraindicated with myeloablative conditioning regimens.

Together, these findings suggest that Pgp may be associated with the reversal of drug resistance in BCR-ABL-positive leukemia patients and cell lines by the inhibition of NHE1 though MAPK pathways.","['Jin, Weina', 'Li, Qinghua', 'Lin, Yani', 'Lu, Ying', 'Li, Huawen', 'Wang, Lihong', 'Hu, Ronghua', 'Ma, Li', 'Wang, Jianxiang', 'Pang, Tianxiang']","['Jin W', 'Li Q', 'Lin Y', 'Lu Y', 'Li H', 'Wang L', 'Hu R', 'Ma L', 'Wang J', 'Pang T']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Guanidines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers)', '0 (Sulfones)', '7E3392891K (cariporide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Guanidines/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Sulfones/pharmacology', 'Young Adult']",2011/05/18 06:00,2011/09/21 06:00,['2011/05/18 06:00'],"['2011/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(11)00238-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2011.04.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2011 Sep 1;308(1):81-90. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2011.04.016.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have retrospectively audited 19 patients with myeloma or primary plasma cell leukemia who received allogeneic transplantation with a uniform alemtuzumab-based reduced-intensity conditioning protocol. These patients had not been treated with bortezomib or lenalidomide before transplantation. RESULTS: The treatment-related mortality at 1 year was (4/19) 21% with low incidence of graft-versus-host disease (6%) and 2-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates of 35% and 42%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Progression-free survival in this cohort of patients is comparable to previously published data of reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic transplantation in myeloma. However, there is no plateau observed on the survival curves with a significant transplant-related mortality of 21%. Therefore, alemtuzumab-based allogeneic transplantation cannot be recommended as standard practice outside of clinical trials for treatment of myeloma.","['Ramasamy, Karthik', 'Mahmood, Shameem', 'Lim, Ziyi', 'Corderoy, Sophie', 'Devereux, Stephen', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Pagliuca, Antonio', 'Schey, Stephen']","['Ramasamy K', 'Mahmood S', 'Lim Z', 'Corderoy S', 'Devereux S', 'Mufti GJ', 'Pagliuca A', 'Schey S']","['Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, England. karthik.ramasamy@kcl.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/mortality/*therapy', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/05/18 06:00,2011/09/16 06:00,['2011/05/18 06:00'],"['2010/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2010/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(11)00005-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2011.03.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2011 Apr;11(2):242-5. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2011.03.004.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 2517 patients with MDS referred to our institution since 1993 were analyzed, with a specific focus on the incidence and associations of thrombocytopenia. RESULTS: The median age of the study group was 66 years. The median survival was 13 months. Platelet counts <100 x 10(9)/L were noted in 65%, and platelets counts <30 x 10(9)/L in 26%. Each platelets count drop below the range of 200 x 10(9)/L has shown a larger magnitude change in terms of worsening effect on survival. Therefore, smaller ranges of platelet counts of <200 x 10(9)/L were studied. Platelet cutoffs of 30, 50, and 200 x 10(9)/L thus were identified to have significant associations with differences in survival. Significant thrombocytopenia was associated with poor performance, other cytopenias, adverse karyotype, and advanced MDS phases. Thrombocytopenia was associated with worse prognosis; it also was predicted for worse outcome within each of the International Prognostic Scoring System risk groups.

In this nationwide survey, representative hematologic/oncologic centers monitored current treatment strategies in indolent lymphoma in general practice. METHODS: Four hundred ninety-five centers involved in the treatment of indolent lymphoma including university hospitals, community hospitals, and oncologists in practice were identified and contacted. Thirteen percent of centers provided information on 741 patients, which corresponds to 10% of the expected national prevalence. Detailed data on 576 unselected patients from 46 representative centers (2 university hospitals, 25 community hospitals, and 19 oncologists in practice) for whom a treatment decision took place in the fourth quarter of 2006 (start, change, or end of therapy) were included in this analysis. Data were verified by monitoring the pseudonymized patient documents. RESULTS: Median age was 67 years (range, 17 to 95 years) and 65% of patients were 60 years of age or older. Concomitant disease was frequent with cardiac disease (29%), hypertension (28%), diabetes (11%), and renal impairment (7%) being the most typical combinations. Histologies included 39% follicular lymphoma, 26% chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 10% marginal zone, 9% mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and 16% other. Only 10% of the overall patient population were treated within these studies. The aim of initial therapy was curative in 35%, and physicians aimed at improved survival in 62% and palliation only in 54% of patients. Radiation (10%), antibody monotherapy (4%), chemotherapy (33%), and combined immunochemotherapy (31%) were the most frequent approaches. Applied chemotherapies included cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) (46%), fludarabine combinations (F/FC/FCM: 15%), chlorambucil (14%), CVP/COP (9%) and bendamustin (4%). Maintenance was used in 12% and autologous/allogeneic stem cell consolidation were rarely applied (both in 3% of patients). At first relapse, combined approaches including immunochemotherapy (49%), maintenance therapy (16%), and autologous/allogeneic transplantation (14%/4%) were more frequently administered. As expected, different treatment strategies and response rates were observed in follicular lymphoma (FL), MCL, and CLL. Interestingly, supportive measures including antibiotics (34%), erythrocyte transfusions (32%), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (22%), immunoglobulines (19%), antifungal drugs (13%), and erythropoetin (10%) were frequently applied even in first-line therapy. Overall response was 83% (FL: 97%, MCL: 95%, CLL: 74%) with a 39% complete response (FL 63%, MCL 54%, CLL 15%) rate. DISCUSSION: In this population-based survey, patients characteristics differed significantly from published study cohorts as did clinical strategies and therapeutic approaches. Thus, clinically more relevant studies in medically compromised patients are urgently warranted.","['Schmidt, Christian', 'Fetscher, Sebastian', 'Gorg, Christian', 'Kornek, Peter', 'Nusch, Arnd', 'Kegel, Thomas', 'Kellermann, Lenka', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Fingerle-Rowson, Guenter', 'Dreyling, Martin']","['Schmidt C', 'Fetscher S', 'Gorg C', 'Kornek P', 'Nusch A', 'Kegel T', 'Kellermann L', 'Hiddemann W', 'Fingerle-Rowson G', 'Dreyling M']","['University Hospital Grosshaden/LMU, Munchen, Germany. christian_schmidt@med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2011/05/18 06:00,2011/09/16 06:00,['2011/05/18 06:00'],"['2010/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(11)00002-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2011.03.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2011 Apr;11(2):204-11. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2011.03.001.

The treatment of choice, stem cell transplantation, is a potentially curative option, but it is available only for a minority of patients and is associated with significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Although imatinib is largely effective, a substantial proportion of patients become resistant or intolerant to it. The activity of imatinib may be enhanced by coadministration with chemotherapy; such treatment is effective in many patients. Dasatinib is established as a second-line treatment in patients with resistance to or intolerance of imatinib. Recent data suggest that dasatinib, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, has utility as first-line therapy. Dasatinib is more potent than imatinib, is less susceptible to drug-resistance mechanisms, and has been shown to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, making it potentially effective for treating central nervous system disease. Patients who relapse during treatment with dasatinib frequently carry the T315I mutation of BCR-ABL. Future regimens combining dasatinib with an agent able to inhibit this mutation may further improve outcome.","['Ravandi, Farhad']",['Ravandi F'],"['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. fravandi@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use']",2011/05/18 06:00,2011/09/16 06:00,['2011/05/18 06:00'],"['2010/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(11)00003-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2011.03.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2011 Apr;11(2):198-203. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2011.03.002.

We investigate the mechanisms by which ETS fusions mediate their effects, and find that the product of the predominant ETS gene fusion, TMPRSS2:ERG, interacts in a DNA-independent manner with the enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and the catalytic subunit of DNA protein kinase (DNA-PKcs). ETS gene-mediated transcription and cell invasion require PARP1 and DNA-PKcs expression and activity.

On various cell types, 7-ketocholesterol has often been shown to induce a complex mode of cell death by apoptosis associated with phospholipidosis. On 158N murine oligodendrocytes treated with 7-ketocholesterol (20 mug/mL corresponding to 50 muM, 24-48 h), the induction of a mode of cell death by apoptosis characterised by the occurrence of cells with condensed and/or fragmented nuclei, caspase activation (including caspase-3) and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was observed. It was associated with a loss of transmembrane mitochondrial potential (DeltaPsim) measured with JC-1, with a dephosphorylation of Akt and GSK3 (especially GSK3beta), and with degradation of Mcl-1. With alpha-tocopherol (400 muM), which was capable of counteracting 7-ketocholesterol-induced apoptosis, Akt and GSK3beta dephosphorylation were inhibited as well as Mcl-1 degradation. These data underline that the potential protective effects of alpha-tocopherol against 7-ketocholesterol-induced apoptosis do not depend on the cell line considered, and that the cascade of events (Akt/GSK3beta/Mcl-1) constitutes a link between 7-ketocholesterol-induced cytoplasmic membrane dysfunctions and mitochondrial depolarisation leading to apoptosis.","['Ragot, Kevin', 'Delmas, Dominique', 'Athias, Anne', 'Nury, Thomas', 'Baarine, Mauhamad', 'Lizard, Gerard']","['Ragot K', 'Delmas D', 'Athias A', 'Nury T', 'Baarine M', 'Lizard G']","['Centre de Recherche INSERM 866 (Lipides, Nutrition, Cancer)-Equipe Biochimie Metabolique et Nutritionnelle, Universite de Bourgogne, Dijon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Chem Phys Lipids,Chemistry and physics of lipids,0067206,"['0 (Ketocholesterols)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Gsk3b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'H4N855PNZ1 (alpha-Tocopherol)', 'O7676FE78M (7-ketocholesterol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Ketocholesterols/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Membrane Microdomains/drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Oligodendroglia/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'alpha-Tocopherol/*pharmacology']",2011/05/18 06:00,2012/01/19 06:00,['2011/05/18 06:00'],"['2011/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/27 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-3084(11)00063-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2011.04.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Phys Lipids. 2011 Sep;164(6):469-78. doi: 10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2011.04.014.

METHODS: Bone marrow mononuclear cells from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were obtained and cultured in low serum medium. The immunophenotypes were assessed by FACS and immunol histochemistry. The levels of cytokines were evaluated by enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). T-cell suppression ability was evaluated by Transwell chamber assay. Moreover, the immunoregulatory ability of AML- and ALL-derived MSC was detected by mixed lymphocyte culture assay. RESULTS: ALL-derived MSC showed a typical fibroblast-like morphology. They were positive for CD29, CD44 and CD105, the positive rate were 98.81%, 99.25% and 90.52%, respectively, while negative for CD31, CD45 and CD34. Moreover, ALL- and AML-derived MSC didn't express HLA-DR and co-stirnulatory molecules (CD40, CD80 and CD86). ALL and AML derived MSC could secret several cytokines, such as TGF-beta1 (567.58 +/- 52.64 and 357.15 +/- 33.52), HGF (647.27 +/- 102.54 and 219.67 +/- 62.37), IL-6 (59.67 +/- 15.69 and 54.35 +/- 12.31) and IL-11 (102.58 +/- 23.54 and 78.21 +/- 9.67), the level of secretion of TGF-beta1 and HGF were higher in ALL bone marrow derived MSC than that of in AML bone marrow derived MSC. ALL and AML derived MSC significantly suppressed T lymphocyte proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, the counts per minute (CPM) were (3.58 +/- 0.54) x 10(4), (2.87 +/- 0.33) x 10(4), (1.78 +/- 0.51) x 10(4) and (1.15 +/- 0.15) x 10(4) for AML derived MSC, and CPM were (1.96 +/- 0.31) x 10(4), (1.57 +/- 0.28) x 10(4), (0.91 +/- 0.41) x 10(4) and (0.22 +/- 0.11) x 10(4) for ALL derived MSC when MSC were 0.5 x 10(4), 1 x 10(4), 2 x 10(4) and 5 x 10(4). In addition, the CPM was (4.01 +/- 0.72) x 10(4) in control group. The immunosuppressive ability was different between MSCs derived from AML and ALL. The immunosuppressive effect of ALL derived MSC could be reversed by anti-TGF-beta1 and anti-HGF antibody. CONCLUSION: ALL-derived MSC show immunoregulatory effect in vitro and this effect is achieved through cytokines. But MSCs derived from AML display abnormal changes in T-cell suppression ability.","['Zhao, Zhi-gang', 'Sun, Li', 'Wang, Xiao-fang', 'Zhang, Yi-zhuo', 'Yu, Yong', 'Yang, Hong-liang', 'Zou, Ping']","['Zhao ZG', 'Sun L', 'Wang XF', 'Zhang YZ', 'Yu Y', 'Yang HL', 'Zou P']","['Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],7910681,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-11/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/metabolism']",2011/05/18 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2011/05/18 06:00'],"['2011/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2011 Feb;33(2):105-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: From April 2005 to April 2008, 206 children with de novo BCP-ALL were admitted. We firstly analyzed the effect of clearance of leukemic cells during induction of remission therapy on relapse-free survival (RFS). Four indexes were used to assess the clearance of leukemic cells including prednisone response on day 8 (d8-PR), percentage of lymphoblast in bone marrow on day 22 (d22-BM) and day 33 (d33-BM), and bone marrow (BM) minimal residual disease (MRD) detection on day 33 (d33-MRD). Then the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the four indexes to assess their ability to predict relapse were analyzed. Finally, the consistency between two of the four indexes to explore the relationships among them were analyzed. RESULT: There were significant differences between RFS of the sub-groups divided according to d8-PR, d22-BM, d33-BM, d33-MRD (P < 0.01); Cox proportional hazard model analysis showed that d33-MRD >/= 10(-3) and positive BCR/ABL fusion gene were the independent prognostic factors. Sensitivity of d33-MRD was higher than that of morphology detection (d22-BM, d33-BM and d8-PR) in prediction of relapse, and positive predictive value of morphology detection was higher than that of d33-MRD. Sensitivity could be greatly increased by combination with clinical and biological characteristics. Consistency could not be found between d8-PR and d22-BM, d33-BM, d33-MRD, as well as between d22-BM, d33-BM, and d33-MRD. However, all cases of d22-BM, d33-BM M2/M3 were d33-MRD >/= 10(-3), while the same phenomenon could not be found for patients with poor d8-PR. CONCLUSION: Clearance of leukemic cell during induction of remission therapy in children with BCP-ALL had important clinical value. Sensitivity of MRD detection after induction of remission therapy was higher than that of morphological analysis to predict relapse. Morphological analysis could only identify a few patients with very high risk of relapse and the sensitivity could be increased by combination with clinical biological characteristics.

To further characterize the molecular mechanism, a global gene expression profile of BCL11B-siRNA -treated Molt-4 cells was established. The expression profiles of several genes were further validated in the BCL11B-siRNA -treated Molt-4 cells and primary T-ALL cells. RESULTS: 142 genes were found to be upregulated and 109 genes downregulated in the BCL11B-siRNA -treated Molt-4 cells by microarray analysis. Among apoptosis-related genes, three pro-apoptotic genes, TNFSF10, BIK, BNIP3, were upregulated and one anti-apoptotic gene, BCL2L1 was downregulated. Moreover, the expression of SPP1 and CREBBP genes involved in the transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) pathway was down 16-fold. Expression levels of TNFSF10, BCL2L1, SPP1, and CREBBP were also examined by real-time PCR. A similar expression pattern of TNFSF10, BCL2L1, and SPP1 was identified. However, CREBBP was not downregulated in the BLC11B-siRNA -treated Molt-4 cells. CONCLUSION: BCL11B-siRNA treatment altered expression profiles of TNFSF10, BCL2L1, and SPP1 in both Molt-4 T cell line and primary T-ALL cells.","['Huang, Xin', 'Shen, Qi', 'Chen, Si', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Weng, Jianyu', 'Du, Xin', 'Grabarczyk, Piotr', 'Przybylski, Grzegorz K', 'Schmidt, Christian A', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Huang X', 'Shen Q', 'Chen S', 'Chen S', 'Yang L', 'Weng J', 'Du X', 'Grabarczyk P', 'Przybylski GK', 'Schmidt CA', 'Li Y']","['Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, PR China. yangqiuli@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (BCL11B protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'CREB-Binding Protein/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/administration & dosage/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation', 'bcl-X Protein/biosynthesis/genetics']",2011/05/18 06:00,2011/11/04 06:00,['2011/05/18 06:00'],"['2011/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-4-23 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-4-23 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2011 May 15;4:23. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-4-23.,20110515,PMC3113752,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AF4 is a transcriptional activator that is involved in transcriptional elongation. Although AF4 has been implicated in MLL (mixed-lineage leukaemia)-related leukaemogenesis, AF4-dependent physiological mechanisms have not been clearly defined. Proteins that interact with AF4 may also play important roles in mediating oncogenesis, and are potential targets for novel therapies. Using a functional proteomic approach involving tandem MS and bioinformatics, we identified 51 AF4-interacting proteins of various Gene Ontology categories. Approximately 60% participate in transcription regulatory mechanisms, including the Mediator complex in eukaryotic cells. In the present paper we report one of the first extensive proteomic studies aimed at elucidating AF4 protein cross-talk. Moreover, we found that the AF4 residues Thr(220) and Ser(212) are phosphorylated, which suggests that AF4 function depends on phosphorylation mechanisms. We also mapped the AF4-interaction site with CDK9 (cyclin-dependent kinase 9), which is a direct interactor crucial for the function and regulation of the protein. The findings of the present study significantly expand the number of putative members of the multiprotein complex formed by AF4, which is instrumental in promoting the transcription/elongation of specific genes in human cells.","['Esposito, Gabriella', 'Cevenini, Armando', 'Cuomo, Alessandro', 'de Falco, Francesca', 'Sabbatino, Dario', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Ruoppolo, Margherita', 'Salvatore, Francesco']","['Esposito G', 'Cevenini A', 'Cuomo A', 'de Falco F', 'Sabbatino D', 'Pane F', 'Ruoppolo M', 'Salvatore F']","['CEINGE-Biotecnologie Avanzate, s.c.a r.l., Via G.

Due to the types of agents used, patients with Hodgkin's disease often develop secondary leukemias. The alkylating agents included in the MOPP scheme were the first drugs associated with the development of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML); both entities are the result of the clonal selection of cells with accumulated genomic lesions induced by antineoplastic therapy. In patients who developed t-MDS and t-AML, eight alternative routes with specific cytogenetic and molecular changes have been identified, and the routes are related to the type of therapy, alkylating agents or DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors. At the cytogenetic level, patients treated with alkylating agents show deletion 5q/monosomy 5 and deletion 7q/monosomy 7; in contrast, those who were treated with topoisomerase II inhibitors show 11q23 translocations involving the MLL gene. At the molecular level, there are two types of mutations: Class I, which alter the RAS-BRAF signal transduction pathways and increase cell proliferation; Class II, which disrupt genes that encode transcription factors and NPM1 that are involved in cell differentiation, and the inactivation of p53 tumor suppressor gene. Knowledge of the genetic alterations in these conditions is important for the classification, treatment and prognosis of patients as well as essential for increasing the knowledge of the biology of these diseases, which leads to identifying potential therapeutic targets.","['Salas, Consuelo', 'Perez-Vera, Patricia', 'Frias, Sara']","['Salas C', 'Perez-Vera P', 'Frias S']","['Departamento de Investigacion en Genetica Humana, Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Mexico, DF.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Mexico,Rev Invest Clin,Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion,9421552,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/adverse effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*chemically induced', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/adverse effects']",2011/05/18 06:00,2011/06/07 06:00,['2011/05/18 06:00'],"['2011/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rev Invest Clin. 2011 Jan-Feb;63(1):53-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flow cytometry is one of the basic methods for evaluation of MRD in precursor B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PBLALL). The so-called simplified three-color analysis using the combination of CD19/CD10/CD34 antibodies has been proposed to detect MRD in the midcourse of induction therapy. Four-to-nine-color is presently used to identify MRD. One hundred and thirty-four bone marrow samples taken at different stages of therapy in 55 children with PBLALL were examined to estimate the possibility of using the flow cytometry technique using the 3-color simplified approach to determining MRD. The results of the simplified and standard approaches were compared in the samples stained with 6-8 monoclonal antibodies in the combinations that always included CD19, Cd10 and CD34. The comparison revealed that MRD had been incorrectly identified by the simplified method in 8.0, 17.6, and 75.8% of the patients on therapy days 15, 36, and 85, respectively. In addition, the content of residual tumor cells with respect to the threshold values more frequently proposed to stratify patients was found to be incorrectly calculated in some true positive samples. Thus, when the simplified approach was applied using the results of MRD detection to stratify the patients into risk groups, 16.0, 27.4, and 81.8% of the samples would yield incorrect information on therapy days 15, 36, and 85, respectively. Thus, the simplified approach to identifying MRD is most applicable on day 15 of therapy; however, there may be mistakes in this point of observation.

HTLV-I protease is an aspartic retropepsin involved in HTLV-I replication and its inhibition could treatHTLV-I infection. A recombinant L40I mutant HTLV-I protease was designed and obtained from Escherichia coli, self-processingand purification by ion-exchange chromatography. The protease was refolded by a one-step dialysis and recovered activity. The cleavage efficiency of the [Ile(4)(0)]HTLV-I protease was at least 300 times higher for a fluorescent substratethan that of our previously reported recombinant His-tagged non-mutated HTLV-I protease. In addition, we designed and synthesized a substrate containing a highly fluorescent Mca moiety in the fragment before the scissile bond, and a chromogenic p-nitrophenylalanine moiety after the scissile bond that greatly amplified spectrometry detection and improved the HTLV-I protease inhibition potency assay. The HTLV-I protease inhibition assay with the [Ile(4)(0)]HTLV-I protease and fluorogenic substrate requires distinctively less protease, substrate, inhibitor and assay time than our previous methods. This means our new assay is more cost-effective and more time-efficient while being reproducible and less labor-intensive.","['Kumada, Henri-Obadja', 'Nguyen, Jeffrey-Tri', 'Kakizawa, Taeko', 'Hidaka, Koushi', 'Kimura, Tooru', 'Hayashi, Yoshio', 'Kiso, Yoshiaki']","['Kumada HO', 'Nguyen JT', 'Kakizawa T', 'Hidaka K', 'Kimura T', 'Hayashi Y', 'Kiso Y']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Center for Frontier Research in Medicinal Science, Kyoto Pharmaceutical University, Yamashina-ku, Kyoto 607-8412, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pept Sci,Journal of peptide science : an official publication of the European Peptide Society,9506309,"['0 (Chromogenic Compounds)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '04Y7590D77 (Isoleucine)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (HTLV-1 protease)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Chromogenic Compounds/*analysis/chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'Enzyme Assays/economics/*methods', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*analysis/chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Isoleucine/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Structure', 'Protease Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity']",2011/05/17 06:00,2012/02/22 06:00,['2011/05/17 06:00'],"['2011/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/09 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/psc.1375 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pept Sci. 2011 Aug;17(8):569-75. doi: 10.1002/psc.1375.

Prompt leukoreduction is considered imperative to reduce the high mortality rate in this condition. Leukapheresis, usually associated with chemotherapy, is an established approach to diminish blast cell counts. We report a single center experience in managing leukostasis with leukapheresis. Fifteen patients with leukostasis of 187 patients with AML (8.02%) followed at our institution were treated with leukapheresis associated with chemotherapy. The procedures were scheduled to be performed on a daily basis until clinical improvement was achieved and WBC counts were significantly reduced. Overall and early mortalities, defined as that occurred in the first 7 days from diagnosis, were reported. A high proportion of our patients with leukostasis (46.66%) had a monocytic subtype AML (M4/M5, according to French-American-British classification). The median overall survival was 10 days, despite a significant WBC reduction after the first apheresis procedure (from 200.7 x 10(9)/L to 150.3 x 10(9)/L). Almost half of patients (7/15) had an early death. Therapeutic leukapheresis, associated or not to chemotherapy, is an effective approach to reduce WBC counts in patients with AML and leukostasis; however, this therapeutic procedure does not appear to change significantly the sombre prognosis observed in the majority of patients with this complication.

The impact of anti-leukemic therapy on BM-MSCs remains unknown. Cytogenetic studies of BM-MSCs from 15 leukemic patients with documented cytogenetic abnormalities of BM-HCs were investigated. To see the influence of anti-leukemic therapy on BM-MSCs, cytogenetic studies were carried out in seven of them after the completion of anti-leukemic therapy, including anthracycline/Ara-C-based chemotherapy in two patients, high-dose busulfan/cyclophosphamide-based allogeneic transplantation in two patients, and total body irradiation (TBI)-based allogeneic transplantation in three patients. To simulate the effect of TBI in vitro, three BM-MSCs from one leukemic patient and two normal adults were irradiated using the same dosage and dosing schedule of TBI and cytogenetics were re-examined after irradiation. At the diagnosis of leukemia, two BM-MSCs had cytogenetic aberration, which were completely different to their BM-HCs counterpart. After the completion of anti-leukemic therapy, cytogenetic aberration was no longer detectable in one patient. Unexpectedly, BM-MSCs from three patients receiving TBI-based allogeneic transplantation acquired new, clonal cytogenetic abnormalities after transplantation. Similarly, complex cytogenetic abnormalities were found in all the three BM-MSCs exposed to in vitro irradiation. In conclusion, anti-leukemic treatments induce not only ""cytogenetic remission"" but also new cytogenetic abnormalities of BM-MSCs. TBI especially exerts detrimental effect on the chromosomal integrity of BM-MSCs and highlights the equal importance of investigating long-term adverse effect of anti-leukemic therapy on BM-MSCs as opposed to beneficial effect on BM-HCs.","['Yeh, Su-Peng', 'Lo, Wen-Jyi', 'Lin, Chiao-Lin', 'Liao, Yu-Min', 'Lin, Chen-Yuan', 'Bai, Li-Yuan', 'Liang, Ji-An', 'Chiu, Chang-Fang']","['Yeh SP', 'Lo WJ', 'Lin CL', 'Liao YM', 'Lin CY', 'Bai LY', 'Liang JA', 'Chiu CF']","['Stem Cell Research Lab., Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, 2 Yuh Der Road, Taichung, 404, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', '*Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/radiation effects', '*Chromosome Aberrations/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cytogenetics/methods', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*adverse effects', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",2011/05/17 06:00,2012/02/24 06:00,['2011/05/17 06:00'],"['2011/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-011-1254-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2012 Feb;91(2):163-72. doi: 10.1007/s00277-011-1254-8.

NOD2 polymorphism screening has been recommended for donor selection and risk assessment at bone marrow transplantation. To investigate whether NOD2 plays a role in the pathogenesis of GVHD in a Japanese population, we examined DNA from 142 bone marrow transplant patient/donor pairs to detect genetic variation in the NOD2 gene. No genetic variants of NOD2 were associated with the severity of acute GVHD in our patients. However, a weak association between a single nucleotide polymorphism in the NOD2 gene (R471C) and acute myeloid leukemia in the bone marrow patients (p = 0.029, odds ratio 4.08, 95% CI 1.22-13.67) was detected. This polymorphism was not prevalent in 479 Crohn's disease (CD) patients in Japan.

In 5 of 5 CLL patients, the distribution of malignant B lymphocytes was similar across the gradient when blood and bone marrow were compared, but different from the distribution of cells from healthy volunteers. In 10 patients, B cell colony formation was measured in vitro from peripheral blood cells after gradient fractionation. Although most of the cells in all patients were found in fraction 4, the majority of B-lymphocyte colonies were found in light density fractions (1+2, 3) in patients with more advanced disease (Rai stages 3 or 4), and in heavier fractions (4, bottom) in patients with less advanced disease (Rai stages 0, 1 or 2). The density of CLL cells might provide a new prognostic marker in this disease.","['Gordon, L', 'Shapiro, G', 'Rosen, S', 'Kies, M', 'Prachand, S', 'Vriesendorp, H']","['Gordon L', 'Shapiro G', 'Rosen S', 'Kies M', 'Prachand S', 'Vriesendorp H']","['LAKESIDE VET ADM MED CTR,CHICAGO,IL 60611.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,,,,1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['2011/05/17 06:00'],"['2011/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2.6.981 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1993 Jun;2(6):981-4. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2.6.981.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The characteristics of the mechanism of cytotoxicity were shown to correspond to those of apoptotic cell death.

The role of apoptosis as a mechanism for the lethal effects of certain cytotoxic agents is discussed. Perturbations of a number of different metabolic pathways appear to be able to trigger apoptosis-like cell death depending on, among other factors, cell lineage. While the HL 60 in vitro model may be particularly sensitive to apoptotic cell death by virtue of increased c-myc expression this propensity may well make it a suitable model for the development of clinical treatment regimens for patients with a number of hematologic malignancies which are characterized by increased c-myc expression in vivo.","['Bezwoda, W', 'Mansoor, N', 'Seymour, L']","['Bezwoda W', 'Mansoor N', 'Seymour L']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,,,,1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['2011/05/17 06:00'],"['2011/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2.3.463 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1993 Mar;2(3):463-7. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2.3.463.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These mutations are clustered in highly conserved domains spanning from exon 4 to 9 of the gene. A very precise method of detecting p53 mutations is to sequence these domains. However, 2 to 3 overlapping PCR-amplifications were needed to span the whole mutation-prone region. We used a very rapid non radioactive solid-phase DNA sequencing method starting from mRNA to sequence the p53 domains in both directions with T7 DNA-polymerase allowing detection of the heterozygous state, where one allele shows the wild-type sequence, the other a mutated one. First we sequenced four colon carcinoma cell lines with known p53 mutations and one T-cell-leukemia cell line with a heterozygous situation to validate our method. Using this method we sequenced the p53 gene (exons four to nine) from 16 primary colon carcinomas. Seven of these 16 (44%) carcinomas showed mutations in the p53 gene resulting in amino acid exchanges. One showed a silent mutation, another one showed two point mutations in the highly conserved domain of the p53 gene. These colorectal carcinomas have been examined for overexpression of the p53 protein using a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against p53 (PAb1801, PAb240, PAb421, PAb1620) by immunohistochemical analysis and immunoblotting. Furthermore, four colorectal cancer cell lines were examined by indirect immunofluorescence technique with the same mAb PAb1801 as used in histological staining. Analysis of 6 out of 15 (40%) tumor specimens revealed markedly positive p53 nuclear staining patterns using monoclonal antibody PAb1801. These data suggest that there is quite a good correlation between point mutation of the p53 gene and nuclear staining with monoclonal antibody PAb1801 detecting overexpressed p53 protein. Moreover, there is no convincing evidence that wild-type protein can be detected using the monoclonal antibodies PAb 1801 and PAb 1620.","['Lang, P', 'Maurer, J', 'Hoher, D', 'Bornhoft, G', 'Montenarh, M', 'Berdel, W', 'Thiel, E', 'Kreuser, E']","['Lang P', 'Maurer J', 'Hoher D', 'Bornhoft G', 'Montenarh M', 'Berdel W', 'Thiel E', 'Kreuser E']","['FREE UNIV BERLIN,KLINIKUM STEGLITZ,DEPT HEMATOL & ONCOL,W-1000 BERLIN 45,GERMANY.

The effect of H7 on mitogen stimulation (G0 to G1 transition) of normal human lymphocytes and on their subsequent progression through the cell cycle was investigated and compared with the effect of this inhibitor on proliferation of human lymphocytic leukemic MOLT-4 cells. At H7 concentrations of 10 and 50 muM, the transition of G0 lymphocytes to the cell cycle was suppressed by 45 and 98%, respectively. The cell cycle progression of stimulated lymphocytes was unaffected at 10 muM H7, whereas, at 50 muM, the overall rate of progression was reduced by 50% with no evidence of cell arrest at a specific phase of the cycle. Similar concentrations of H7 (45 muM) suppressed proliferation of MOLT-4 cells by 50%, though, in the latter case, cells underwent transition to higher DNA ploidy, most likely via endoreduplication. Thus, the G0 to G1 transition appears to be the event most sensitive to H7. Exposure of MOLT-4 cells to 100 muM H7 for 24 h induced extensive apoptosis: activation of an endogenous nuclease with preference to internucleosomal linker DNA sections resulted in DNA degradation (revealed by agarose gel electrophoresis and loss of DNA measured by flow cytometry), which was paralleled by intracellular proteolysis, while the integrity of the plasma membrane, mitochondria and lysosomes was preserved. Morphological examination of these apoptotic cells confirmed DNA degradation. However, the perinuclear and fine-granular localization of the remaining DNA and lack of typical chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation differed from the classical pattern of apoptosis observed in other cell systems, suggesting that some events of apoptosis (nuclear fragmentation) may be affected by H7. The observed effects are consistent with the possible role of H7 in inhibition of PKC or its direct effect on the ATP-binding domain of DNA topoisomerase II, which shares homology with the H7 binding sites on PKC and the cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases.","['Traganos, F', 'Knuttihotz, J', 'Hotz, M', 'Gorczyca, W', 'Ardelt, B', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Traganos F', 'Knuttihotz J', 'Hotz M', 'Gorczyca W', 'Ardelt B', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,,,,1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['2011/05/17 06:00'],"['2011/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2.1.47 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1993 Jan;2(1):47-59. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2.1.47.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The potential for cure in this group of patients necessitates aggressive treatment that can result in life-threatening complications. A medical, ethical and financial dilemma arises when aggressive therapy and intensive support is balanced with actual survival, meaningful survival and the financial burden to society and the patient's family. We collected complete financial information on 64 leukemia and lymphoma patients admitted for the first time to the intensive care unit (I.C.U.) at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute between 7/1/88 and 6/30/90. The charges were calculated from actual itemized statements and included all inpatient and out-patient charges. Survival was addressed by individually evaluating candidate variables with parametric and non-parametric analysis. Survival after I.C.U. admission and hospital discharge were studied as dependent variables in a stepwise multiple regression analysis. The nadir of the platelet count and albumin level prior to and during the I.C.U. admission significantly affected survival. During the I.C.U. admission, the BUN, serum creatinine and the need for mechanical ventilation significantly affected survival. Seventy-eight percent of patients survived less than five months and spent less than two and one half months at home. Fifty percent of patients expired during the I.C.U. admission. Only 3.2% of patients who had received two or more chemotherapeutic regimens had survived more than one year. The cost per year of life gained for the entire group of patients was $189,339. The results of this study show that the majority of leukemia and lymphoma patients who are admitted to the I.C.U. expire prior to discharge or spend a minimal amount of time at home prior to expiring. This study suggests that the cost of meaningful survival must be borne in mind by physicians and should encourage them to discuss treatment options, potential outcomes, risks and benefits so that a reasonable strategy can be planned by the physician, patient and family prior to treatment.","['Schapira, D', 'Studnicki, J', 'Bradham, D', 'Wolff, P', 'Jarrett, A', 'Aziz, N']","['Schapira D', 'Studnicki J', 'Bradham D', 'Wolff P', 'Jarrett A', 'Aziz N']","['UNIV S FLORIDA,COLL MED,COLL PUBL HLTH,DEPT INTERNAL MED,TAMPA,FL 33612.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,,,,1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['2011/05/17 06:00'],"['2011/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.3.5.987 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1993 Nov;3(5):987-93. doi: 10.3892/ijo.3.5.987.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cell lines were further studied in their clonal growth in methylcellulose under the influence of rhuPA (rhpro-uPA). The growth of Raji cells was not influenced by rhuPA. Colony and cluster formation of HL-60 was not reproducibly affected by rhuPA in concentrations between 1-100 ng/ml. In some experiments however, there were higher numbers of colonies in the HL-60 cultures incubated with rhuPA which was due to a cluster-to-colony shift. Furthermore, the HL-60 colonies in the rhuPA incubated plates always showed morphological alterations including an adherent basis indicating functional differentiation. This assumption was further supported by the observation that the secondary plating efficiency (PE2) of HL-60 cells taken from single colonies of uPA-incubated plates decreased significantly when compared with PE2 of cells from colonies grown without the presence of uPA. In conclusion, the intact uPA molecule functions like an autocrine cytokine for a human leukemic cell line, which in addition to its effects in tumor invasion makes it an interesting target molecule for further studies on tumor suppression.","['Berdel, W', 'Wilhelm, O', 'Schmitt, M', 'Maurer, J', 'Reufi, B', 'Vonmarschall, Z', 'Oberberg, D', 'Graeff, H', 'Thiel, E']","['Berdel W', 'Wilhelm O', 'Schmitt M', 'Maurer J', 'Reufi B', 'Vonmarschall Z', 'Oberberg D', 'Graeff H', 'Thiel E']","['TECH UNIV MUENCHEN,DEPT GYNECOL & OBSTET,MUNICH,GERMANY.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,,,,1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['2011/05/17 06:00'],"['2011/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.3.4.607 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1993 Oct;3(4):607-13. doi: 10.3892/ijo.3.4.607.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even after high-dose MTX treatment, however, some cells escape the drug effect and this heterogeneity in response may play a major role in therapeutic outcome. We investigated heterogeneity in the response of K562 human leukemia cells, which exhibited population characteristics of unbalanced growth when treated with MTX, including a concentration-dependent increase in average-cell size and a block in S-phase of the cell cycle that correlated with growth inhibition. To investigate for the first time the response to MTX at the individual cell level, an individual colony formation assay (iCFA) was used. The iCFA revealed marked heterogeneity in both untreated K562 cells and their response to MTX treatment, as well as distinctive features of the response. Colonies of untreated K562 cells grew logarithmically with modal doubling times of 21.9 h (compared to 18.8+/-1.1 h in suspension culture), but there was over a 2-fold range of doubling times for individual cells. In addition, there was heterogeneity in the size of individual untreated K562 cells. Following MTX treatment, the iCFA detected shifts in the growth rate that were not detected in suspension culture and also drug-induced increased heterogeneity in growth rates at relatively nontoxic MTX concentrations. More importantly, the iCFA demonstrated that at a MTX concentration where no cells reproduced sufficiently to reach the threshold necessary to be counted as a colony, continued slow, logarithmic growth of a number of individual cells was observed. Thus, in addition to cytotoxicity, growth slow-down was a major effect exhibited in K562 cells treated with MTX. There was no correlation between MTX-induced unbalanced growth (as indicated by an increase in individual cell size) and the proliferative capacity of each cell. At cytotoxic MTX concentrations, there were individual cells that showed dramatically increased cell size but continued to proliferate, while other cells did not enlarge, but were still killed. These data show directly for the first time that the increase in cell size following MTX treatment is not likely to be the primary mechanism of cell kill. Similar changes were observed with gamma-fluoromethotrexate (FMTX), an MTX analog which is deficient in polyglutamylation. Since FMTX caused similar effects to MTX, we conclude that under these conditions poly(gamma-glutamate) synthesis is not the most significant factor in producing the observed effects in K562 cells. These results point out the utility of this approach as an alternative to the plating efficiency assay in order to identify approaches to arrest the growth of cells escaping primary drug effects.","['Raymakers, R', 'McGuire, J', 'Russell, C', 'Slocum, H', 'Malmberg, M', 'Rustum, Y']","['Raymakers R', 'McGuire J', 'Russell C', 'Slocum H', 'Malmberg M', 'Rustum Y']","['NEW YORK STATE DEPT HLTH,ROSWELL PK MEM INST,GRACE CANC DRUG CTR,ELM & CARLTON ST,BUFFALO,NY 14263.

Thus, these tumor cells were 5 to 50 times more sensitive to Taxotere(R) than normal GM-CFU-C.

The differentiation inducing capacity of Taxotere(R) was inversely related to the loss of proliferation potential and occurred at concentrations that did not significantly affect cell viability; hence a direct cytotoxic killing effect may be precluded. Thus, the antiproliferative activity of Taxotere(R) may be attributed not only to its spindle poison like action, but also to its differentiation inducing capacity.

It is unclear if differences in the diagnostic testing, disease severity, geography, or other factors account for the discordant results. We report here the prevalence of XMRV in a population with well-defined prostate cancers and RNase L polymorphism. We used broadly reactive PCR and Western blot (WB) assays to detect infection with XMRV and related murine leukemia viruses (MLV). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We studied specimens from 162 US patients diagnosed with prostate cancer with a intermediate to advanced stage (Gleason Scores of 5-10; moderate (46%) poorly differentiated tumors (54%)). Prostate tissue DNA was tested by PCR assays that detect XMRV and MLV variants. To exclude contamination with mouse DNA, we also designed and used a mouse-specific DNA PCR test. Detailed phylogenetic analysis was used to infer evolutionary relationships. RNase L typing showed that 9.3% were homozygous (QQ) for the R462Q RNase L mutation, while 45.6% and 45.1% were homozygous or heterozygous, respectively. Serologic testing was performed by a WB test. Three of 162 (1.9%) prostate tissue DNA were PCR-positive for XMRV and had undetectable mouse DNA. None was homozygous for the QQ mutation. Plasma from all three persons was negative for viral RNA by RT-PCR. All 162 patients were WB negative. Phylogenetic analysis inferred a distinct XMRV. CONCLUSIONS AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE: We found a very low prevalence of XMRV in prostate cancer patients. Infection was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis and absence of contaminating mouse DNA. The finding of undetectable antibodies and viremia in all three patients may reflect latent infection. Our results do not support an association of XMRV or MLV variants with prostate cancer.","['Switzer, William M', 'Jia, Hongwei', 'Zheng, Haoqiang', 'Tang, Shaohua', 'Heneine, Walid']","['Switzer WM', 'Jia H', 'Zheng H', 'Tang S', 'Heneine W']","['Laboratory Branch, Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America. bis3@cdc.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.26.- (2-5A-dependent ribonuclease)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blotting, Western', 'DNA, Mitochondrial', 'Endoribonucleases/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*etiology/genetics/metabolism/*virology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/genetics/*pathogenicity']",2011/05/17 06:00,2011/10/25 06:00,['2011/05/17 06:00'],"['2011/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0019065 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-02915 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2011 May 4;6(5):e19065. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0019065.,20110504,PMC3087753,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the different platforms for SNP genotyping, Luminex is one of the less exploited mainly due to the lack of a robust (semi-automated and replicable) freely available genotype calling software. Here we describe a clustering algorithm that provides automated SNP calls for Luminex genotyping assays. We genotyped 3 SNPs in a cohort of 330 childhood leukemia patients, 200 parents of patient and 325 healthy individuals and used the Automated Luminex Genotyping (ALG) algorithm for SNP calling. ALG genotypes were called twice to test for reproducibility and were compared to sequencing data to test for accuracy. Globally, this analysis demonstrates the accuracy (99.6%) of the method, its reproducibility (99.8%) and the low level of no genotyping calls (3.4%). The high efficiency of the method proves that ALG is a suitable alternative to the current commercial software. ALG is semi-automated, and provides numerical measures of confidence for each SNP called, as well as an effective graphical plot. Moreover ALG can be used either through a graphical user interface, requiring no specific informatics knowledge, or through command line with access to the open source code. The ALG software has been implemented in R and is freely available for non-commercial use either at http://alg.sourceforge.net or by request to mathieu.bourgey@umontreal.ca.","['Bourgey, Mathieu', 'Lariviere, Mathieu', 'Richer, Chantal', 'Sinnett, Daniel']","['Bourgey M', 'Lariviere M', 'Richer C', 'Sinnett D']","['Sainte-Justine Hospital Research Center, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. mathieu.bourgey@umontreal.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Biological Assay/*methods', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics']",2011/05/17 06:00,2011/10/25 06:00,['2011/05/17 06:00'],"['2010/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0019368 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-00167 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2011 May 6;6(5):e19368. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0019368.,20110506,PMC3089621,['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The observed data are assumed to be independently generated conditional on an underlying and unknown two-state hidden model. We propose an asymptotically valid data-driven procedure to find critical values for rejection regions controlling k-family wise error rate (k-FWER), false discovery rate (FDR) and the tail probability of false discovery proportion (FDTP) by using one-sample and two-sample t-statistics. We only require finite fourth moment plus some very general conditions on the mean and variance of the population by virtue of the moderate deviations properties of t-statistics. A new consistent estimator for the proportion of alternative hypotheses is developed. Simulation studies support our theoretical results and demonstrate that the power of a multiple testing procedure can be substantially improved by using critical values directly as opposed to the conventional p-value approach. Our method is applied in an analysis of the microarray data from a leukemia cancer study that involves testing a large number of hypotheses simultaneously.","['Cao, Hongyuan', 'Kosorok, Michael R']","['Cao H', 'Kosorok MR']","['Department of Statistics and Operations Research, 318 Hanes Hall, CB 3260, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bernoulli (Andover),Bernoulli : official journal of the Bernoulli Society for Mathematical Statistics and Probability,101515657,,,,2011/05/17 06:00,2011/05/17 06:01,['2011/05/17 06:00'],"['2011/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3150/10-BEJ272 [doi]'],ppublish,Bernoulli (Andover). 2011 Feb;17(1):347-394. doi: 10.3150/10-BEJ272.,,PMC3092179,"['R29 CA075142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA075142-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA142538-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA075142-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA075142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA075142-09A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA142538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS195777'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that the risk that fludarabine imparts to stem cell mobilization and t-MDS/AML would be affected by dose or timing. All patients with FL treated at Cleveland Clinic from 1991 to 2007 with autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation were evaluated. Recursive partitioning analysis was used to explore associations of fludarabine and mitoxantrone dose and timing with poor stem cell harvest and t-MDS/AML. We identified 171 patients, of whom 52 previously received fludarabine. Patients exposed to fludarabine prior to auto-HCT were more likely to require >5 days of leukapheresis (P<0.001) and second stem cell mobilization (P<0.001), especially at a cumulative dose >150 mg/m(2). Univariable risk factors for t-MDS/AML included the number of chemotherapy regimens before auto-HCT, the need for >5 days of leukapheresis to collect CD34+ cells and fludarabine exposure in a dose-dependent manner, particularly when >500 mg/m(2). A cumulative dose of fludarabine >150 mg/m(2) increases the risk for poor stem cell harvests and any exposure increases the risk of t-MDS/AML, with the greatest risk being at doses >500 mg/m(2).","['Waterman, J', 'Rybicki, L', 'Bolwell, B', 'Copelan, E', 'Pohlman, B', 'Sweetenham, J', 'Dean, R', 'Sobecks, R', 'Andresen, S', 'Kalaycio, M']","['Waterman J', 'Rybicki L', 'Bolwell B', 'Copelan E', 'Pohlman B', 'Sweetenham J', 'Dean R', 'Sobecks R', 'Andresen S', 'Kalaycio M']","['Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis/methods', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes', '*Neoplasms, Second Primary', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives']",2011/05/17 06:00,2012/07/31 06:00,['2011/05/17 06:00'],"['2011/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2011109 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2011.109 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2012 Apr;47(4):488-93. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2011.109.

Phospho-specific flow cytometry using anti-phosphorylated STAT5 antibody is a new method recently reported to detect GM-CSF hypersensitivity of cells. However, colony assays using methylcellulose medium to measure GM-CSF-hypersensitivity remain as the current gold standard. Interestingly, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in infancy often presents with a variety of clinical symptoms that mimic JMML, with CMV giving a positive result by colony assay. We wanted to determine whether aberrant STAT5 activation occurs in CMV infection by using phospho-specific flow cytometry, and to ascertain whether this method is effective at discriminating CMV infection from JMML. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with JMML and CMV infection displayed an elevated proportion of p-STAT5 cells after low-dose GM-CSF stimulation when compared with cells from normal individuals. However, we found no significant differences in the percentage of p-STAT5 positive cells from patients with CMV infection and JMML at any doses of the GM-CSF doses used. We conclude that patients with CMV infection cannot be discriminated from patients with JMML by this new diagnostic method.","['Nishio, Nobuhiro', 'Takahashi, Yoshiyuki', 'Tanaka, Makito', 'Xu, Yinyan', 'Yoshida, Nao', 'Sakaguchi, Hirotoshi', 'Doisaki, Sayoko', 'Hama, Asahito', 'Muramatsu, Hideki', 'Shimada, Akira', 'Kojima, Seiji']","['Nishio N', 'Takahashi Y', 'Tanaka M', 'Xu Y', 'Yoshida N', 'Sakaguchi H', 'Doisaki S', 'Hama A', 'Muramatsu H', 'Shimada A', 'Kojima S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Shouwa-ku, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/blood/congenital/*diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Efficiency', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/blood/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/blood/*diagnosis/metabolism', 'Male', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/blood/*metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2011/05/17 06:00,2011/11/09 06:00,['2011/05/17 06:00'],"['2010/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(11)00203-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2011.04.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2011 Sep;35(9):1261-4. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2011.04.014.

Statistical analysis of the 17,263 regions bound by at least one factor demonstrated that simultaneous binding by all five factors was the most enriched pattern and often occurred near known hematopoietic regulators. Eight genes not previously appreciated to function in hematopoiesis that were bound by all five factors were shown to be essential for thrombocyte and/or erythroid development in zebrafish. Moreover, one of these genes encoding the PDZK1IP1 protein shared transcriptional enhancer elements with the blood stem cell regulator TAL1/SCL.

Early detection of MS may be possible via blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests based on disease pathology. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a neurotrophic cytokine, has previously been shown to limit autoimmune demyelination and oligodendrocyte loss in a murine model of MS. Given its potential role in neural cell death and survival, in the present study we measured expression of LIF in serum and CSF from patients with relapsing-remitting MS (n=46) and control subjects (n=42). We used western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), to study LIF expression. Western blot analysis revealed that LIF was present in all CSF samples, and densitometric analysis showed that relative expression was significantly higher in CSF from patients with MS than in controls (p<0.001). ELISA analysis showed that the concentrations of LIF in both the serum (87.5 +/- 11.46 ng/mL) and CSF (56 +/- 10.72 ng/mL) of MS patients were significantly higher than those in control subjects (52 +/- 8.23 ng/mL, 7.8 +/- 3.76 ng/mL, respectively; p<0.0001 for both serum and CSF), despite there being no significant difference in total protein concentration between the two groups (p=0.52 for serum, p=0.2 for CSF). Our data suggest that serum and CSF concentrations of LIF may provide additional useful information during the differential diagnosis of MS.

Anti-p53 autoantibodies were detected in over half of the patients with a 17p deletion but in very few of the others. There was no correlation between the levels of anti-p53 antibodies and the percentage of cells with 17p abnormalities. The levels of the anti-p53 autoantibodies remained stable for most patients with serial samples. Increased levels of antibodies that bound to two peptide fragments of p53 were also seen in patients with 17p deletions. At least on case with high levels of anti-p53 autoantibodies had a heterozygotic mutation known to result in a dominant negative phenotype, suggesting that aberrant expression of p53 may contribute to the development of autoantibodies and suggests that these autoantibodies may reflect biological features relevant to prognosis.","['Messmer, Bradley T', 'Nour-Omid, Talia S', 'Ghia, Emanuela', 'Sanchez, Ana B', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Messmer BT', 'Nour-Omid TS', 'Ghia E', 'Sanchez AB', 'Kipps TJ']","['Moores Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, 3855 Health Sciences Dr, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093-0815, USA. bmessmer@ucsd.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Autoantibodies/*immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*genetics', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*genetics/*immunology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/*immunology']",2011/05/17 06:00,2011/08/19 06:00,['2011/05/17 06:00'],"['2010/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/06 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(11)00196-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2011.04.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2011 Jul;35(7):965-7. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2011.04.009.

Whereas CD and viscosity measurements indicate that the polypyridyl ligands of 4 and 5 intercalate into CT DNA, this is not the case for the analogous pyridine-2-thiolate complexes 6 and 7. Complexes 3-7 all exhibit a high antiproliferative activity towards MCF-7 and HT-29 cells, with IC(50) values in the range 0.055-0.285 muM. As established by online monitoring with a cell-based sensor chip, the highly cytostatic complex 6 (IC(50)=0.059 and 0.078 muM) invokes an immediate concentration-dependent reduction of MCF-7 cell respiration and a time-delayed decrease in cellular impedance, which can be ascribed to the induction of cell death. Annexin V/PI assays demonstrated that 6 also has a pronounced antiproliferative activity towards Jurkat cells and that it invokes extensive apoptosis and high concentrations of reactive oxygen species in these leukemia cells. The observation of a dose-dependent inhibition of the oxygen consumption of isolated mice mitochondria indicates the involvement of an intrinsic mitochondrial pathway in this process.","['Hackenberg, Frauke', 'Oehninger, Luciano', 'Alborzinia, Hamed', 'Can, Suzan', 'Kitanovic, Igor', 'Geldmacher, Yvonne', 'Kokoschka, Malte', 'Wolfl, Stefan', 'Ott, Ingo', 'Sheldrick, William S']","['Hackenberg F', 'Oehninger L', 'Alborzinia H', 'Can S', 'Kitanovic I', 'Geldmacher Y', 'Kokoschka M', 'Wolfl S', 'Ott I', 'Sheldrick WS']","['Fakultat fur Chemie und Biochemie, Ruhr-Universitat Bochum, Bochum, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Inorg Biochem,Journal of inorganic biochemistry,7905788,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Coordination Complexes)', '0 (Dimethyldithiocarbamate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '91080-16-9 (calf thymus DNA)', 'DMK383DSAC (Rhodium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Coordination Complexes/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'DNA/chemistry', 'Dimethyldithiocarbamate/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fourier Analysis', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitochondria, Liver/drug effects/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects', 'Rhodium/*chemistry', 'Transition Temperature']",2011/05/17 06:00,2011/10/04 06:00,['2011/05/17 06:00'],"['2011/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/14 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0162-0134(11)00093-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2011.04.006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Inorg Biochem. 2011 Jul;105(7):991-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2011.04.006.

There was no significant difference in PAS-positive detection between MDS and MegA (46.3%), or MDS and IDA (40.8%) (P = 0.310, 0.052, respectively). Erythroblasts PAS-positive rate (Median, M = 1%) and PAS-positive scores (M' = 2) was significantly lower in MDS than in AEL (M = 8%; M' = 17), and significantly higher than in NSAA (M = 0%; M' = 0), ITP (M = 0%; M' = 0), PNH (M = 0%; M' = 0), MegA (M = 0%; M' = 0), and IDA (M = 0%; M' = 0) (all P < 0.05). The cut-off value of PAS-positive rate and score for distinguishing MDS from the other groups except AEL were 0.5% and 0.5, with a sensitivity and specificity of 60.8% and 74.4%, respectively. For MDS patients, the percentage of BM erythroid cells was significantly higher in PAS-positive group than in PAS-negative group (P < 0.05), and so were megakaryocyte count, lymphocyte-like micromegakaryocytes count and percentage of micromegakaryocyte (P = 0.002, 0.000, 0.000, respectively). HGB, MCV, MCH and MCHC were significantly lower in PAS-positive group (all P < 0.05), and so was the neutrophil alkaling phosphatase (NALP) (P = 0.000). PAS-positive detection rate, positive rate and score were higher in MDS patients with abnormal karyotype than with normal karyotype, and were also higher in IPSS high/intermediate-risk 2 group than in low/intermidiate-risk 1 group. CONCLUSION: The positive reaction of erythroblasts PAS stain is an indicator of dyserythropoiesis. It is helpful to the diagnosis of MDS patients.","['Liu, Liu', 'Cui, Wen', 'Zhang, Hong-li', 'Xu, Ze-feng', 'Zhang, Feng-kui', 'Zheng, Yi-zhou', 'Zhang, Yue', 'Qin, Tie-jun', 'Xiao, Zhi-jian']","['Liu L', 'Cui W', 'Zhang HL', 'Xu ZF', 'Zhang FK', 'Zheng YZ', 'Zhang Y', 'Qin TJ', 'Xiao ZJ']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, The State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', '*Erythroblasts', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis', '*Periodic Acid-Schiff Reaction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Young Adult']",2011/05/17 06:00,2012/04/03 06:00,['2011/05/17 06:00'],"['2011/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/03 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2011 Apr;32(4):259-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Bone marrow samples were collected from 18 MM and 2 plasma cell leukemia (PCL) patients. Probes targeting IgH and MMSET were prepared using a Nick Translation Kit from Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones. The immunophenotyping was achieved via the CD138 tyramide signal amplification (TSA)-mediated immunofluorescence, followed by FISH with the prepared probes \[t(4;14), t(11;14), t(14;16)\] and the commercial deletion probes (13q and p53) to detect common genetic aberrations in MM. RESULTS: All the 20 samples were assayed with the probes mentioned above, and revealed 4 cases with t(4;14), 6 with t(11;14), 1 with t(14;16), 3 with p53 deletion; and 8 with 13q deletion. The remaining 4 cases had none of the 5 aberrations.

The multiple versions of PCDA models from repeated double cross-validation were aggregated, and the final classification was performed by majority voting. The performance of this approach was evaluated by simulation, genomics, proteomics and metabolomics data sets.

An unusual multicentric lymphoma of non-T-cell origin was observed in natural and experimental infection with FeLV-945. Previous studies implicated the FeLV-945 surface glycoprotein (SU) as a determinant of disease outcome by an as yet unknown mechanism. The present studies demonstrate that FeLV-945 SU confers distinctive properties of binding to the cell surface receptor. RESULTS: Virions bearing the FeLV-945 Env protein were observed to bind the cell surface receptor with significantly increased efficiency, as was soluble FeLV-945 SU protein, as compared to the corresponding virions or soluble protein from a prototype FeLV-A isolate. SU proteins cloned from other cohort isolates exhibited increased binding efficiency comparable to or greater than FeLV-945 SU. Mutational analysis implicated a domain containing variable region B (VRB) to be the major determinant of increased receptor binding, and identified a single residue, valine 186, to be responsible for the effect. CONCLUSIONS: The FeLV-945 SU protein binds its cell surface receptor, feTHTR1, with significantly greater efficiency than does that of prototype FeLV-A (FeLV-A/61E) when present on the surface of virus particles or in soluble form, demonstrating a 2-fold difference in the relative dissociation constant. The results implicate a single residue, valine 186, as the major determinant of increased binding affinity. Computational modeling suggests a molecular mechanism by which residue 186 interacts with the receptor-binding domain through residue glutamine 110 to effect increased binding affinity. Through its increased receptor binding affinity, FeLV-945 SU might function in pathogenesis by increasing the rate of virus entry and spread in vivo, or by facilitating entry into a novel target cell with a low receptor density.","['Bolin, Lisa L', 'Chandhasin, Chandtip', 'Lobelle-Rich, Patricia A', 'Albritton, Lorraine M', 'Levy, Laura S']","['Bolin LL', 'Chandhasin C', 'Lobelle-Rich PA', 'Albritton LM', 'Levy LS']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Tulane Cancer Center, Tulane University School of Medicine, 1430 Tulane Avenue SL-38, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (feline leukemia virus receptor)', '0 (glycoprotein gp70, Feline leukemia virus)', 'HG18B9YRS7 (Valine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution/genetics', 'Animals', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*pathogenicity', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*metabolism', 'Valine/genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*metabolism', '*Viral Tropism', '*Virus Attachment']",2011/05/17 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/05/17 06:00'],"['2010/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-8-35 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-8-35 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2011 May 13;8:35. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-8-35.,20110513,PMC3113301,"['R01AI033410/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA083823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WBCs isolated from whole human blood were suspended in PBS and introduced into the anode compartment of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell. The cathode compartment contained a 50 mM potassium ferricyanide solution. Average current densities between 0.9 and 1.6 muA cm-2 and open circuit potentials (Voc) between 83 and 102 mV were obtained, which were both higher than control values. Cyclic voltammetry was used to investigate the electrochemical activity of the activated WBCs in an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of electron transfer between the cells and electrode.

An oxidation peak at about 363 mV vs. SCE for the PMA (phorbol ester) activated primary cells, with a notable absence of a reduction peak was observed. Oxidation peaks were not observed for the BLCL, K562 or Jurkat cell lines. HPLC confirmed the release of serotonin (5-HT) from the PMA activated primary cells.

Although the increasing use of varicella-vaccines in the general population and rapid initiation of VZV-immunoglobulins and acyclovir in case of exposure has been beneficial for some patients, immunocompromised individuals are still at risk for unfavourable courses. METHODS: In this single center, 6-year analysis we review incidence, hospitalization and complication rates of VZV-infections in our center and compare them to published data. Furthermore, we report three instructive cases. RESULTS: Hospitalization rate of referred children with VZV-infections was 45%, among these 17% with malignancies and 9% under immunosuppressive therapy. Rate of complications was not elevated in these two high-risk cohorts, but one ALL-patient died due to VZV-related complications. We report one 4-year old boy with initial diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia who showed a rapidly fatal outcome of his simultaneous varicella-infection, one 1.8-year old boy with an identical situation but a mild course of his disease, and an 8.5-year old boy with a steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome. This boy developed severe hepatic involvement during his varicella-infection but responded to immediate withdrawl of steroids and administration of acyclovir plus single-dose cidofovir after nonresponse to acyclovir after 48 h. CONCLUSION: Our data show that patients with malignant diseases or immunosuppressive therapy should be hospitalized and treated immediately with antiviral agents. Despite these measures the course of VZV-infections can be highly variable in these patients. We discuss aids to individual decision-making for these difficult situations.","['Wiegering, Verena', 'Schick, Judith', 'Beer, Meinrad', 'Weissbrich, Benedikt', 'Gattenlohner, Stefan', 'Girschick, Hermann J', 'Liese, Johannes', 'Schlegel, Paul G', 'Eyrich, Matthias']","['Wiegering V', 'Schick J', 'Beer M', 'Weissbrich B', 'Gattenlohner S', 'Girschick HJ', 'Liese J', 'Schlegel PG', 'Eyrich M']","[""Dept, of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Pediatric Stem Cell Transplantation Program, University Children's Hospital Wuerzburg, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Pediatr,BMC pediatrics,100967804,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'JIL713Q00N (Cidofovir)', 'X4HES1O11F (Acyclovir)']",IM,"['Acyclovir/therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Chickenpox/diagnosis/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cidofovir', 'Cytosine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Herpes Zoster/diagnosis/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Herpesvirus 3, Human/drug effects/*immunology', '*Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host/drug effects/*immunology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Organophosphonates/therapeutic use', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic']",2011/05/17 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/05/17 06:00'],"['2010/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['1471-2431-11-31 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2431-11-31 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Pediatr. 2011 May 10;11:31. doi: 10.1186/1471-2431-11-31.,20110510,PMC3115870,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chimeric antibody, MOv18 IgE, against the human ovarian carcinoma antigen, folate receptor alpha (FRalpha), is more effective than its IgG1 counterpart in xenograft models of ovarian cancer. Although MOv18 IgE binds to a single epitope on FRalpha and cannot cross-link IgE receptors on basophils, there remains a risk that components in the circulation of ovarian cancer patients might cross-link FRalpha-MOv18-IgE-receptor-FcvarepsilonRI complexes on basophils to cause type I hypersensitivity. OBJECTIVE: To assess the propensity for MOv18 used in a therapeutic setting to cause FcvarepsilonRI-mediated type I hypersensitivity. METHODS: As validated readouts of the potential for MOv18 to cause FcvarepsilonRI-mediated type I hypersensitivity we measured release of a granule-stored mediator from a rat basophilic leukaemia cell line RBL SX-38 stably transfected with human tetrameric (alphabetagamma2) FcvarepsilonRI, and induction of CD63 on blood basophils from patients with ovarian carcinoma and healthy controls ex vivo. RESULTS: Serum FRalpha levels were increased in ovarian cancer patients compared with healthy controls. MOv18 IgE alone, or in the presence of its antigen recombinant human FRalpha, or of healthy volunteer (n=14) or ovarian carcinoma patient (n=32) sera, did not induce RBL SX-38 cell degranulation. Exposure to FRalpha-expressing ovarian tumour cells at target-to-effector ratios expected within tumours induced degranulation. MOv18 IgE did not induce expression of CD63 in blood basophils from either healthy volunteers (n=6), or cancer patients, despite detectable levels of circulating FRalpha (n=5). CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These encouraging data are compatible with the hypothesis that, when ovarian carcinoma patients are treated with MOv18, FcvarepsilonRI-mediated activation of effector cells occurs within the tumour mass but not in the circulation mandating, with due caution, further pre-clinical studies.","['Rudman, S M', 'Josephs, D H', 'Cambrook, H', 'Karagiannis, P', 'Gilbert, A E', 'Dodev, T', 'Hunt, J', 'Koers, A', 'Montes, A', 'Taams, L', 'Canevari, S', 'Figini, M', 'Blower, P J', 'Beavil, A J', 'Nicodemus, C F', 'Corrigan, C', 'Kaye, S B', 'Nestle, F O', 'Gould, H J', 'Spicer, J F', 'Karagiannis, S N']","['Rudman SM', 'Josephs DH', 'Cambrook H', 'Karagiannis P', 'Gilbert AE', 'Dodev T', 'Hunt J', 'Koers A', 'Montes A', 'Taams L', 'Canevari S', 'Figini M', 'Blower PJ', 'Beavil AJ', 'Nicodemus CF', 'Corrigan C', 'Kaye SB', 'Nestle FO', 'Gould HJ', 'Spicer JF', 'Karagiannis SN']","[""NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Guy's and St Thomas's Hospitals and King's College London, Cutaneous Medicine & Immunotherapy Unit, St John's Institute of Dermatology, Division of Genetics & Molecular Medicine, King's College London School of Medicine, Guy's Hospital, King's College London, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Allergy,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,8906443,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD63 protein, human)', '0 (Folate Receptor 1)', '0 (MOv18 monoclonal antibody)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Tetraspanin 30)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*adverse effects/genetics/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Basophils/*immunology', 'Carcinoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Cell Degranulation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Folate Receptor 1/blood/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity, Immediate/*etiology/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin E/genetics/immunology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Protein Engineering', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*immunology', 'Tetraspanin 30/metabolism']",2011/05/17 06:00,2012/03/16 06:00,['2011/05/17 06:00'],"['2011/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2222.2011.03770.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Allergy. 2011 Oct;41(10):1400-13. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2222.2011.03770.x.

In this study, we assessed the role of MECOM locus protein EVI1 in the transcriptional regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in the leukaemic phenotype. For this, we profiled expression of 366 miRNAs in 38 MECOM-rearranged patient samples, normal bone marrow controls and MECOM (EVI1) knock down/re-expression models. Cross-comparison of these miRNA expression profiling data showed that MECOM rearranged leukaemias are characterized by down regulation of MIR449A. Reconstitution of MIR449A expression in MECOM-rearranged cell line models induced apoptosis resulting in a strong decrease in cell viability. These effects might be mediated in part by MIR449A regulation of NOTCH1 and BCL2, which are shown here to be bona fide MIR449A targets. Finally, we confirmed that MIR449A repression is mediated through direct promoter occupation of the EVI1 transcriptional repressor. In conclusion, this study reveals MIR449A as a crucial direct target of the MECOM locus protein EVI1 involved in the pathogenesis of MECOM-rearranged leukaemias and unravels NOTCH1 and BCL2 as important novel targets of MIR449A. This EVI1-MIR449A-NOTCH1/BCL2 regulatory axis might open new possibilities for the development of therapeutic strategies in this poor prognostic leukaemia subgroup.","['De Weer, An', 'Van der Meulen, Joni', 'Rondou, Pieter', 'Taghon, Tom', 'Konrad, Torsten A', 'De Preter, Katleen', 'Mestdagh, Pieter', 'Van Maerken, Tom', 'Van Roy, Nadine', 'Jeison, Marta', 'Yaniv, Isaac', 'Cauwelier, Barbara', 'Noens, Lucien', 'Poirel, Helene-Antoine', 'Vandenberghe, Peter', 'Lambert, Frederic', 'De Paepe, Anne', 'Sanchez, Maria Garcia', 'Odero, Maria', 'Verhasselt, Bruno', 'Philippe, Jan', 'Vandesompele, Joke', 'Wieser, Rotraud', 'Dastugue, Nicole', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter', 'Poppe, Bruce', 'Speleman, Frank']","['De Weer A', 'Van der Meulen J', 'Rondou P', 'Taghon T', 'Konrad TA', 'De Preter K', 'Mestdagh P', 'Van Maerken T', 'Van Roy N', 'Jeison M', 'Yaniv I', 'Cauwelier B', 'Noens L', 'Poirel HA', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Lambert F', 'De Paepe A', 'Sanchez MG', 'Odero M', 'Verhasselt B', 'Philippe J', 'Vandesompele J', 'Wieser R', 'Dastugue N', 'Van Vlierberghe P', 'Poppe B', 'Speleman F']","['Centre for Medical Genetics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (MIRN449 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Down-Regulation/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*physiology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2011/05/17 06:00,2011/09/10 06:00,['2011/05/17 06:00'],"['2011/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08737.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Aug;154(3):337-48. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08737.x.

Clinical article.,268-72,10.3171/2011.4.JNS101784 [doi],"OBJECT: Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a frequent complication found in leukemia patients with thrombocytopenia. At the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, when a leukemia patient is found to have ICH, a platelet transfusion is generally recommended until 50,000/mul is reached. The authors examine the feasibility and outcome of their intervention strategy in this study. METHODS: Records were reviewed from 76 consecutive leukemia patients with newly diagnosed ICH at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2009. Variables of interest included age, platelet count at presentation, leukemia subtype, history of trauma, Glasgow Coma Scale score at presentation, whether the 50,000/mul goal was reached after transfusion, and whether the patient was a transfusion responder (platelet count increase > 2000/mul/unit transfused). Outcome parameters were mortality rates at 72 hours and 30 days and imaging-documented hemorrhage progression. RESULTS: Thrombocytopenia was prevalent at the time of presentation (68 of 76 patients had platelet levels < 50,000/mul at presentation). Despite an aggressive transfusion protocol, only 24 patients reached the 50,000/mul target after an average of 16 units of transfusion. Death due to ICH occurred in 15 patients within the first 72 hours (mortality rate 19.7%). Death correlated with the presenting Glasgow Coma Scale score (p = 0.0075) but not with other transfusion-related parameters. A significant mortality rate was again observed after 30 days (32.7%). The 30-day mortality rate, however, was largely attributable to non-ICH related causes and correlated with patient age (p = 0.032) and whether the patient was a transfusion responder (p = 0.022). Reaching and maintaining a platelet count > 50,000/mul did not positively correlate with the 30-day mortality rate (p = 0.392 and 0.475, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Platelet transfusion in the setting of ICH in leukemia patients is undoubtedly necessary, but whether the transfusion threshold should be 50,000/mul remains unclear. Factors other than thrombocytopenia likely contribute to the overall poor prognosis.","['Chern, Joshua J', 'Tsung, Andrew J', 'Humphries, William', 'Sawaya, Raymond', 'Lang, Frederick F']","['Chern JJ', 'Tsung AJ', 'Humphries W', 'Sawaya R', 'Lang FF']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Neurosurg,Journal of neurosurgery,0253357,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Humans', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages/etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombocytopenia/*complications', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/05/17 06:00,2011/11/01 06:00,['2011/05/17 06:00'],"['2011/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3171/2011.4.JNS101784 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosurg. 2011 Aug;115(2):268-72. doi: 10.3171/2011.4.JNS101784.

The aim of this paper was to underline the importance of oral manifestations in children with acute leukaemia. The disease and its treatment can directly or indirectly affect oral health. Oral manifestations are gingival inflammation and enlargement. Leukaemic cells are capable of infiltrating the gingiva and the deeper periodontal tissues which leads to ulceration and infection of oral tissues. Gingival bleeding is a common sign in patients with leukaemia. Symptoms include local lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane Petechiae and ecchymoses. Cytotoxic drugs have direct effects like mucositis, involving atrophy, desquamation and ulceration of the mucosa, with increasing the risk for local and systemic infections. Leukaemia can directly influence dental care and dental treatment, while oral lesions may have life-threatening consequences. Knowledge and skills among dentists may also not be adequate to treat children with acute leukaemia. It is therefore imperative that all stomatologists be aware of dental problems that occur in leukaemia in order to be able to effectively carry out appropriate measures to mitigate these problems.","['Ivanovic, Mirjana', 'Jovcic, Olivera', 'Mandic, Jelena', 'Bogetic, Dusko', 'Maddalone, Marcello']","['Ivanovic M', 'Jovcic O', 'Mandic J', 'Bogetic D', 'Maddalone M']",,['srp'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Serbia,Srp Arh Celok Lek,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,0027440,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Mouth Diseases/*complications']",2011/05/17 06:00,2011/06/23 06:00,['2011/05/17 06:00'],"['2011/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2298/sarh1102103i [doi]'],ppublish,Srp Arh Celok Lek. 2011 Jan-Feb;139(1-2):103-6. doi: 10.2298/sarh1102103i.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A forward genetic approach revealed that latexin is involved in homeostasis of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in mice; however, little is known about the mechanisms by which latexin negatively affects the numbers of HSCs. In this study, we found that latexin is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, and is co-localized with the molecules responsible for the interaction of HSCs with a bone marrow niche, such as N-cadherin, Tie2, and Roundabout 4. Latexin-knockout young female mice showed an increase in the numbers of KSL (c-Kit(+)/Sca-1(+)/linegae marker-negative) cells, which may be attributable to enhanced self-renewal because latexin-deficient KSL cells formed more colonies than their wild-type counterparts in methylcellulose culture. Proteomic analysis of Sca-1(+) bone marrow cells demonstrated that latexin ablation reduced the abundance of multiple cellular proteins, including N-cadherin, Tie2, and Roundabout 4. Finally, we found that latexin expression was lost or greatly reduced in approximately 50% of human leukemia/lymphoma cell lines. These results imply that latexin inhibits the self-renewal of HSCs by facilitating the lodgment of HSCs within a bone marrow niche to maintain HSC homeostasis.","['Mitsunaga, Kanae', 'Kikuchi, Jiro', 'Wada, Taeko', 'Furukawa, Yusuke']","['Mitsunaga K', 'Kikuchi J', 'Wada T', 'Furukawa Y']","['Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical University School of Medicine, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Lxn protein, rat)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/genetics/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Homeostasis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout']",2011/05/14 06:00,2012/04/26 06:00,['2011/05/14 06:00'],"['2011/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.22834 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2012 Mar;227(3):1138-47. doi: 10.1002/jcp.22834.,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism underlying the clearance of infiltrated APL cells has not been investigated in detail. Lipoxin A(4) (LXA(4)) is an important anti-inflammatory mediator during the resolution of inflammation. In this study, the role of LXA(4) in the cell-cell interaction between alveolar macrophages (AMphi; NR8383 cells) and APL NB4 cells was investigated and found that conditioned medium (CM) harvested from ATRA-treated NR8383 (ATRA-NR8383) cells was able to induce the transmigration of ATRA-NB4 cells. However, the pro-migratory activity of CM was attenuated progressively when ATRA-NR8383 cells were co-cultured with increased cell dosages of apoptotic NB4 cells. A significantly higher amount of LXA(4) was released into the CM by ATRA-NR8383 cells when they were co-cultured with apoptotic ATRA-NB4 cells. Expression of a receptor for LXA(4) (ALX/FPR2) was enhanced in both ATRA-NB4 cells and ATRA-NR8383 cells. Exogenous LXA(4) treatment was able to inhibit the transmigration of ATRA-NB4 cells and induce the phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells by ATRA-NR8383 cells.

METHODS: The occurrence of sMDS/AML was investigated prospectively in 53 elderly patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who underwent an autograft after high-dose radioimmunotherapy (HD-RIT) myeloablative conditioning with (9)(0)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan. Bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic progenitors and telomere length (TL) also were investigated. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 49 months, 4 patients developed sMDS/AML at 6 months, 12 months, 27 months, and 36 months after HD-RIT, and the 5-year cumulative incidence of sMDS/AML was 8.29%. A significant but transient decrease in BM granulocyte-macrophage progenitors was observed; whereas multilineage, erythroid, and fibroblast progenitors were unaffected. A significant and persistent shortening of BM TL also was detected. A matched-pair analysis comparing the study patients with 55 NHL patients who underwent autografts after chemotherapy-based myeloablative conditioning demonstrated a 8.05% 5-year cumulative incidence of sMDS/AML. CONCLUSIONS: HD-RIT for patients with NHL was associated with 1) limited toxicity on hematopoietic progenitors, 2) accelerated TL shortening, and 3) non-negligible incidence of sMDS/AML, which nevertheless was comparable to the incidence observed in a matched group of patients who received chemotherapy-based conditioning. Thus, in the current series of elderly patients with NHL, the development of sMDS/AML was not influenced substantially by HD-RIT.","['Guidetti, Anna', 'Carlo-Stella, Carmelo', 'Ruella, Marco', 'Miceli, Rosalba', 'Devizzi, Lilli', 'Locatelli, Silvia L', 'Giacomini, Arianna', 'Testi, Adele', 'Buttiglieri, Stefano', 'Risso, Alessandra', 'Mariani, Luigi', 'Di Nicola, Massimo', 'Passera, Roberto', 'Tarella, Corrado', 'Gianni, Alessandro M']","['Guidetti A', 'Carlo-Stella C', 'Ruella M', 'Miceli R', 'Devizzi L', 'Locatelli SL', 'Giacomini A', 'Testi A', 'Buttiglieri S', 'Risso A', 'Mariani L', 'Di Nicola M', 'Passera R', 'Tarella C', 'Gianni AM']","['Medical Oncology 3, National Cancer Institute, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Yttrium Radioisotopes)', '4Q52C550XK (ibritumomab tiuxetan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology/radiation effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Progenitor Cells/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Radioimmunotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Risk', 'Telomere/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Yttrium Radioisotopes/*adverse effects/therapeutic use']",2011/05/14 06:00,2012/01/10 06:00,['2011/05/14 06:00'],"['2011/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26182 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2011 Nov 15;117(22):5074-84. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26182.

Using Western blot, real-time qRT-PCR and flow cytometry, we investigated the expression of survivin, Smac/DIABLO and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) in patients with CML. Survivin overexpression has been associated with cancer progression, multidrug resistance, poor prognosis and short survival in several types of neoplasms including hematological malignancies. In this work, survivin expression was significantly elevated in late, in contrast to early, chronic phase CML (p=0.044). Patients with high or intermediate prognostic Sokal score presented higher survivin levels (p=0.012), as well as Smac/DIABLO levels (p=0.009) compared to low Sokal score. The strong correlation between survivin and Pgp expression in late (p=0.018), but not in early (p=0.5) chronic phase of CML, suggests that this association may play a biological role in late CML phase and may offer an important target for the development of new therapies.","['Reis, Flaviana R S', 'Vasconcelos, Flavia C', 'Pereira, Debora L', 'Moellman-Coelho, Arthur', 'Silva, Karina L', 'Maia, Raquel C']","['Reis FR', 'Vasconcelos FC', 'Pereira DL', 'Moellman-Coelho A', 'Silva KL', 'Maia RC']","['Laboratorio de Hemato-Oncologia Celular e Molecular, Programa de Pesquisa em Hemato-Oncologia Molecular, Instituto Nacional de Cancer Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Survivin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Blotting, Western', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survivin', 'Young Adult']",2011/05/14 06:00,2011/11/04 06:00,['2011/05/14 06:00'],"['2010/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2011.1296 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2011 Aug;26(2):471-8. doi: 10.3892/or.2011.1296.

The cells which grew out from the thymus tissue were initially dependent on WEHI-3B conditioned medium as a source of exogenous growth factor, but progressed in culture to become growth factor independent. Flow cytometric analysis using lineage-specific surface markers demonstrated that the initial growth factor dependent cells co-expressed myeloid and B lymphoid antigens, while the derived growth factor independent cells expressed only antigens specific to the B lymphoid lineage. This result indicates a mixed lymphoid/myeloid phenotype in this cell line and subsequent lineage specialisation during in vitro tumor progression.","['Miller, M', 'Symonds, G']","['Miller M', 'Symonds G']","['ST VINCENTS HOSP,DEPT CLIN PHARMACOL & TOXICOL,SYDNEY,NSW 2027,AUSTRALIA.

The median age of onset of disease was 13 years lower in the offspring than in the parents when comparing all 51 pairs (P < 0.001). This difference was mainly caused by a significantly lower age at onset in offspring with parental nonCLL (P < 0.001) where paternal disease was transferred especially to sons, while affected offspring to parents with CLL have the same age at debut of disease than their parents (P = 0.130) and a nearly equal transfer to sons and daughters. The low-malignant follicular small B-cell lymphoma was the predominant diagnosis within nonCLL.

The expanded DNT cells expressed similar or higher levels of interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha and Granzyme B as that seen in bulk activated CD8T cells from the same patient but significantly higher levels of perforin. The expanded DNT cells could effectively kill both allogeneic and autologous primary CD34(+) leukemic blasts isolated from PB of AML patients in a perforin-dependant manner. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that DNT cells from AML patients can be expanded ex vivo even after intensive chemotherapy, and are effective at killing both allogeneic and autologous primary leukemic blasts.

We tested these populations in both in vitro culture assays and in vivo for growth and leukemia development in immune-deficient mice. We found LIC activity in CD7(+) cells only as CD34(+)CD7(-) cells contained normal human progenitors and hematopoietic stem cells that differentiated into T, B lymphoid and myeloid cells.

Historically, HSCs are among the most thoroughly characterized tissue-specific stem cells. Despite this, the regulation of fate options, such as self-renewal and differentiation, has remained elusive, partly because of the expansive plethora of factors and signaling cues that govern HSC behavior in vivo. In the BM, HSCs are housed in specialized niches that dovetail the behavior of HSCs with the need of the organism. The Smad-signaling pathway, which operates downstream of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of ligands, regulates a diverse set of biological processes, including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, in many different organ systems. Much of the function of Smad signaling in hematopoiesis has remained nebulous due to early embryonic lethality of most knockout mouse models. However, recently new data have been uncovered, suggesting that the Smad-signaling circuitry is intimately linked to HSC regulation. In this review, we bring the Smad-signaling pathway into focus, chronicling key concepts and recent advances with respect to TGF-beta-superfamily signaling in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis.","['Blank, U', 'Karlsson, S']","['Blank U', 'Karlsson S']","['Division of Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Laboratory Medicine, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. ulrika.blank@med.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Smad Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Hematology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Signal Transduction', 'Smad Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism']",2011/05/14 06:00,2011/11/08 06:00,['2011/05/14 06:00'],"['2011/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201195 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.95 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Sep;25(9):1379-88. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.95.

The histone protein H2AX has an important role in the DNA damage response (DDR) and the presence of phospho-H2AX (gammaH2AX) nuclear foci is the hallmark of DSBs. We hypothesize that ongoing DNA damage provides a mechanism by which chromosomal abnormalities and intratumor heterogeneity are acquired in malignant plasma cells (PCs) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Therefore, we assessed PCs from patients with the premalignant condition, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and MM, as well as human MM cell lines (HMCLs) for evidence of DSBs. gammaH2AX foci were detected in 2/5 MGUS samples, 37/40 MM samples and 6/6 HMCLs. Notably, the DSB response protein 53BP1 colocalized with gammaH2AX in both MM patient samples and HMCLs. Treatment with wortmannin decreased phosphorylation of H2AX and suggests phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinases and/or PI3-kinase-like family members underlie the presence of gammaH2AX foci in MM cells. Taken together, these data imply that ongoing DNA damage intensifies across the disease spectrum of MGUS to MM and may provide a mechanism whereby clonal evolution occurs in the monoclonal gammopathies.","['Walters, D K', 'Wu, X', 'Tschumper, R C', 'Arendt, B K', 'Huddleston, P M', 'Henderson, K J', 'Dispenzieri, A', 'Jelinek, D F']","['Walters DK', 'Wu X', 'Tschumper RC', 'Arendt BK', 'Huddleston PM', 'Henderson KJ', 'Dispenzieri A', 'Jelinek DF']","['Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, College of Medicine, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', '*DNA Damage', 'Genes, p53', 'Histones/analysis/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/physiology']",2011/05/14 06:00,2011/10/12 06:00,['2011/05/14 06:00'],"['2011/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201194 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.94 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Aug;25(8):1344-53. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.94.

Abnormalities within the p53 pathway identify a subset of patients with a poor prognosis. This review describes recent advances in understanding the mechanisms that regulate p53 levels and the role of p53 in the control of the cell cycle and of apoptosis. The classical model of p53-mediated apoptosis emphasizes the transcriptional activation of proapoptotic genes. In contrast, a novel model emphasizes p53's non-transcriptional actions as the major route of apoptosis induction, whereas its transcriptional arm predominantly upregulates antiapoptotic genes, thus providing a negative feedback mechanism that limits apoptosis. Further studies have identified the Notch pathway as a candidate p53-induced antiapoptotic mechanism. In contrast to the classical model, the novel model predicts that pharmacological inhibition of p53's transcriptional function or of the Notch signaling pathway will augment apoptosis induction by cytotoxic agents. Therapeutic strategies based on the novel model, which we review here for the first time, may significantly augment the antitumor actions of cytotoxic agents in CLL and in other malignancies.","['Wickremasinghe, R G', 'Prentice, A G', 'Steele, A J']","['Wickremasinghe RG', 'Prentice AG', 'Steele AJ']","['Department of Haematology, Cancer Institute, University College Hospital Medical School, London, UK. r.wickremasinghe@medsch.ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/05/14 06:00,2011/11/08 06:00,['2011/05/14 06:00'],"['2011/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011103 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.103 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Sep;25(9):1400-7. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.103.

Here, we investigated the contribution of APN/CD13 to the regulation of growth and survival processes in AML cells in vitro. Anti-CD13 monoclonal antibodies MY7 and SJ1D1 (which do not inhibit APN activity) and WM15 (an APN-blocking antibody) inhibited the growth of the AML cell line U937 and induced apoptosis, as evidenced by cell accumulation in the sub-G(1) phase, DNA fragmentation, and phosphatidylserine externalization. Isotype-matched IgG1 and the APN/CD13 enzymatic inhibitors bestatin and 2',3-dinitroflavone-8-acetic acid, were ineffective. Internalization of CD13-MY7 complex into cells was followed by mitochondrial membrane depolarization, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 down-regulation, Bax up-regulation, caspase-9, caspase-8, and caspase-3 activation, and cleavage of the caspase substrate PARP-1. The broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk and the caspase-9- and caspase-8-specific inhibitors significantly attenuated apoptosis. CD13 ligation also induced apoptosis and PARP-1 cleavage in primary AML blasts, whereas normal blood cells were not affected. Overall, these data provide new evidence that CD13 can serve as a target for inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis in AML (independently of its APN activity). These findings may have implications for tumor biology and treatment.","['Piedfer, Marion', 'Dauzonne, Daniel', 'Tang, Ruoping', ""N'Guyen, Juliette"", 'Billard, Christian', 'Bauvois, Brigitte']","['Piedfer M', 'Dauzonne D', 'Tang R', ""N'Guyen J"", 'Billard C', 'Bauvois B']","['Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U872, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'CD13 Antigens/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/physiology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/*pathology/therapy', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'Young Adult', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2011/05/14 06:00,2011/10/15 06:00,['2011/05/14 06:00'],"['2011/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['fj.11-181396 [pii]', '10.1096/fj.11-181396 [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2011 Aug;25(8):2831-42. doi: 10.1096/fj.11-181396.

Therefore, the ability of a defined gamma9delta2TCR to redirect alphabetaT cells selectively against tumor cells was tested and its molecular interaction with a variety of targets investigated. Functional analysis revealed that a gamma9delta2TCR efficiently reprograms both CD4(+) and CD8(+) alphabetaT cells against a broad panel of cancer cells while ignoring normal cells, and substantially reduces but does not completely abrogate alloreactivity. gamma9delta2TCR-transduced alphabetaT cells reduced colony formation of progenitor cells of primary acute myeloid leukemia blasts and inhibited leukemia growth in a humanized mouse model. Thereby, metabolites of a dysregulated mevalonate pathway are targeted and the additional application of widely used biphosphonates is crucial for in vivo efficacy most likely because of its modulating effect on cytokine secretion of gamma9delta2TCR-transduced alphabetaT cells. Expression of NKG2D ligands and F1-ATPase contributed to the activity of gamma9delta2TCR-transduced alphabetaT cells but were not mandatory. In summary, gamma9delta2 TCRs are an attractive alternative to broadly redirect alphabetaT cells against cancer cells with both an improved efficacy and safety profile compared with currently used alphabetaTCRs.","['Marcu-Malina, Victoria', 'Heijhuurs, Sabine', 'van Buuren, Marit', 'Hartkamp, Linda', 'Strand, Susanne', 'Sebestyen, Zsolt', 'Scholten, Kirsten', 'Martens, Anton', 'Kuball, Jurgen']","['Marcu-Malina V', 'Heijhuurs S', 'van Buuren M', 'Hartkamp L', 'Strand S', 'Sebestyen Z', 'Scholten K', 'Martens A', 'Kuball J']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center (UMC) Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer/*methods', 'Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/transplantation', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/transplantation', 'Cell Communication/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics/immunology']",2011/05/14 06:00,2011/09/02 06:00,['2011/05/14 06:00'],"['2011/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44815-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-12-325993 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jul 7;118(1):50-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-12-325993.

YHO-13177 potentiated the cytotoxicity of SN-38, mitoxantrone, and topotecan in both BCRP-transduced human colon cancer HCT116 (HCT116/BCRP) cells and SN-38-resistant human lung cancer A549 (A549/SN4) cells that express BCRP, but had little effect in the parental cells. In addition, YHO-13177 potentiated the cytotoxicity of SN-38 in human lung cancer NCI-H460 and NCI-H23, myeloma RPMI-8226, and pancreatic cancer AsPC-1 cells that intrinsically expressed BCRP. In contrast, it had no effect on P-glycoprotein-mediated paclitaxel resistance in MDR1-transduced human leukemia K562 cells and multidrug resistance-related protein 1-mediated doxorubicin resistance in MRP1-transfected human epidermoid cancer KB-3-1 cells. YHO-13177 increased the intracellular accumulation of Hoechst 33342, a substrate of BCRP, at 30 minutes and partially suppressed the expression of BCRP protein at more than 24 hours after its treatment in both HCT116/BCRP and A549/SN4 cells. In mice, YHO-13351 was rapidly converted into YHO-13177 after its oral or intravenous administration. Coadministration of irinotecan with YHO-13351 significantly increased the survival time of mice inoculated with BCRP-transduced murine leukemia P388 cells and suppressed the tumor growth in an HCT116/BCRP xenograft model, whereas irinotecan alone had little effect in these tumor models.

Nicotinamide is the main NAD(+) precursor and a direct inhibitor of four classes of enzymes, including the sirtuins. SIRT1, the main member of the sirtuin family, inactivates p53 by deacetylating a critical lysine residue. In this study, we showed that CLL cells express high levels of functional SIRT1, which is inhibited by exogenous nicotinamide. This agent blocks proliferation and promotes apoptosis selectively in leukemic cells that express wild-type (wt) p53. Nicotinamide modulates the p53-dependent genes p21, NOXA, BAX, and Mcl-1, indicating an activation of the p53 pathway and of caspase-3. DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics, such as etoposide, activate a functional loop linking SIRT1 and p53 through the induction of miR-34a. When leukemic cells are simultaneously exposed to nicotinamide and etoposide, we observe a significant increase in miR-34a levels with a concomitant inhibition of SIRT1. Furthermore, p53 acetylation levels are higher than with either agent used alone. Overall, treatment with both nicotinamde and etoposide shows strongly synergistic effects in the induction of apoptosis. We therefore concluded that nicotinamide has the dual property of inhibiting SIRT1 through a noncompetitive enzymatic block (p53 independent) and at the same time through miR-34a induction (p53 dependent). These observations suggested the therapeutic potential of nicotinamide, a novel, safe, and inexpensive drug, to be used in addition to chemotherapy for CLL patients with wt p53.","['Audrito, Valentina', 'Vaisitti, Tiziana', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Gottardi, Daniela', ""D'Arena, Giovanni"", 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Malavasi, Fabio', 'Deaglio, Silvia']","['Audrito V', 'Vaisitti T', 'Rossi D', 'Gottardi D', ""D'Arena G"", 'Laurenti L', 'Gaidano G', 'Malavasi F', 'Deaglio S']","['Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Genetics, Biology and Biochemistry, University of Turin, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (MIRN34 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Niacinamide/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Sirtuin 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/05/14 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/05/14 06:00'],"['2011/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-4452 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-4452 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Jul 1;71(13):4473-83. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-4452.

Overall, both dasatinib and nilotinib have shown superior efficacy compared with imatinib during the first year of treatment and longer-term follow-up is needed to confirm that this superiority is maintained over time. Both agents have also shown favorable tolerability profiles, although distinct patterns of adverse events are seen with each agent.

All the molecules were designed on the basis of hydrogen bond acceptors, carbonyl, fluoro groups with precise spatial separation and structural features of lipophilicity, positive charge at neutral pH and presence of aromatic rings. The in vitro cytotoxic effects in comparison with reference drugs doxorubicin (DX) and C(1311) against cancer cell lines SW 1573, SW 1573 2R 160 (Pg-P expressing) which are non-small cell lung cancer cells, human embryo kidney cells HEK 293, HEK 293 MRP4, HEK 293 MRP5i, human promyelocytic leukemia sensitive cell line HL-60, including its multidrug cross-resistant of two main (P-gp and MRP) phenotype sublines vincristine resistant HL-60/VINC and doxorubicin resistant HL-60/DX cancer cell lines are presented. Compounds 14, 15 and 16 exhibited highest cytotoxicity among the derivatives. On the other hand, the in vitro cytotoxic activity of compound 14 (with butyl side-chain and tertiary amino group beta-hydroxy ethyl piperizine) against resistant cancer cell lines indicate that it might be a promising new hit for further development as an anti-MDR agent. The non-covalent interaction of these molecules with DNA duplexes have been investigated by ESI-MS technique. The results indicate, these acridone derivatives interact with duplex DNA by intercalation, possesses higher affinity to GC than AT base pairs of the DNA and they could not interact non-covalently with the minor grooves of the DNA. The ability of acridones to inhibit calmodulin dependent cAMP phosphodiesterase has been determined. The results suggest that acridones inhibit the Ca(2+)/calmodulin stimulated cAMP-phosphodiesterase activity and have no direct effects on the enzyme itself and a strong correlation between calmodulin inhibition and cytotoxicity against HL-60/VINC and HL-60/DX MDR cancer cell lines.","['Rajendra Prasad, V V S', 'Peters, G J', 'Lemos, Clara', 'Kathmann, Ietje', 'Mayur, Y C']","['Rajendra Prasad VV', 'Peters GJ', 'Lemos C', 'Kathmann I', 'Mayur YC']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Sitha Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hyderabad, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Eur J Pharm Sci,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,9317982,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Acridones)', '0 (Aminoacridines)', '0 (Calmodulin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', ""EC 3.1.4.17 (3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases)"", 'MZ4Y5H4OAB (C 1311)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"[""3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism"", 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Acridones/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Aminoacridines/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calmodulin/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2011/05/14 06:00,2011/11/08 06:00,['2011/05/14 06:00'],"['2011/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0928-0987(11)00105-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejps.2011.04.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharm Sci. 2011 Jul 17;43(4):217-24. doi: 10.1016/j.ejps.2011.04.010.

However, little effort has been devoted to the study of this colorant as a potentially useful medicinal agent. METHODS: We investigated the daily light-induced photocytotoxicity of PhB in two human leukemia cells, HL-60 and Jurkat, and its underlying mechanisms by in vitro experiments using antioxidants. REUSLTS AND CONCLUSIONS: PhB inhibited cell proliferation more preferentially to HL-60 cells than to Jurkat cells. Co-treatment of catalase completely blocked the photocytotoxicity by PhB in HL-60 cells, whereas the effect of histidine was only partial, suggesting that hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), rather than singlet oxygen, might be a prerequisite for the PhB-induced HL-60 cell death. Actually, PhB produced a significant amount of H(2)O(2) in the media as well as in the cells in concentration- and light-dependent manners. Furthermore, methionine, a hypochlorous acid (HOCl) scavenger, also significantly attenuated the cytotoxicity in HL-60 cells, but not in Jurkat cells, indicating the involvement of myeloperoxidase (MPO)-dependent hypohalous acid formation during the photocytotoxicity. In vitro experiments revealed that halogenated tyrosine was generated from the reaction of bovine serum albumin with PhB and HL-60 cell lysate. The present findings suggested that PhB induced a differential photodynamic action in the MPO-containing leukemia cells through an H(2)O(2)-dependent mechanism. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the PhB-induced apoptosis and also evaluated PhB as a promising PDT agent.","['Qi, Hang', 'Takano, Hiroshi', 'Kato, Yoji', 'Wu, Qian', 'Ogata, Chiharu', 'Zhu, Beiwei', 'Murata, Yoshiyuki', 'Nakamura, Yoshimasa']","['Qi H', 'Takano H', 'Kato Y', 'Wu Q', 'Ogata C', 'Zhu B', 'Murata Y', 'Nakamura Y']","['Department of Biofunctional Chemistry, Division of Bioscience, Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, Okayama 700-8530, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Food Coloring Agents)', '0 (PHB protein, human)', '0 (Prohibitins)', '0 (Xanthenes)', '712K4CDC10 (Hypochlorous Acid)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'OMS4XQD1T0 (Eosine I Bluish)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Eosine I Bluish/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Dyes/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Food Coloring Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Hypochlorous Acid/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Light', 'Molecular Structure', 'Prohibitins', 'Xanthenes/chemistry']",2011/05/14 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2011/05/14 06:00'],"['2011/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-4165(11)00092-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbagen.2011.04.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2011 Jul;1810(7):704-12. doi: 10.1016/j.bbagen.2011.04.010.

Conversely, arsenic trioxide (AsTO) has successfully been employed in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). It has been shown that AsTO efficiently induces apoptosis in the malignant cells of APL in vitro. Although the mechanisms underlying AsTO-induced apoptosis in certain types of cancer cells, such as APL cells, have been delineated, the mechanism underlying AsTO-induced cell death in non-cancer cells remains unknown. In the present study, we examined AsTO-provoked cytotoxicity and cell death mechanism(s) in TM4 Sertoli cells. Exposure of these cells to AsTO generates reactive oxygen species and alters mitochondrial apoptosis, inducing cell death via both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways. AsTO-induced apoptosis was concomitant with the downregulation of p53, phosphorylation of p53 at serine residues, and G2/M cell cycle arrest. Particularly, the interaction of p21 with caspase-3 proteins during AsTO treatment suggested an antiapoptotic role of p21 against genotoxic stresses in TM4 Sertoli cells. However, clinically relevant concentrations of AsTO failed to induce cell death in TM4 Sertoli cells, indicating that these cells could be resistant to cancer treatment. The results presented herein may not represent the actual effect of AsTO on Sertoli cells in vivo. Thus, further studies on the exposure effects of AsTO on the morphology and function of Sertoli cells in animal experiments will provide a more precise knowledge of AsTO cytotoxicity on male reproduction.","['Kim, Yoon-Jae', 'Chung, Jin-Yong', 'Lee, Seung Gee', 'Kim, Ji Young', 'Park, Ji-Eun', 'Kim, Won Rok', 'Joo, Bo Sun', 'Han, Seong Ho', 'Yoo, Ki Soo', 'Yoo, Young Hyun', 'Kim, Jong-Min']","['Kim YJ', 'Chung JY', 'Lee SG', 'Kim JY', 'Park JE', 'Kim WR', 'Joo BS', 'Han SH', 'Yoo KS', 'Yoo YH', 'Kim JM']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, College of Medicine, Dong-A University, Busan, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Toxicology,Toxicology,0361055,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Oncogene Protein p21(ras))', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oncogene Protein p21(ras)/*biosynthesis', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sertoli Cells/*drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/drug effects/*metabolism']",2011/05/14 06:00,2011/08/17 06:00,['2011/05/14 06:00'],"['2011/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0300-483X(11)00163-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tox.2011.04.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicology. 2011 Jul 29;285(3):142-51. doi: 10.1016/j.tox.2011.04.013.

Strong evidence indicates that precursor B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (Pre-B ALL) is a genetic disease originating in utero. Environmental exposures in two concurrent, childhood leukemia clusters have been profiled and compared with geographically similar control communities. The unique exposures, shared in common by the leukemia clusters, have been modeled in C57BL/6 mice utilizing prenatal exposures. This previous investigation has suggested in utero exposure to sodium tungstate (Na2WO4) may result in hematological/immunological disease through genes associated with viral defense. The working hypothesis is (1) in addition to spontaneously and/or chemically generated genetic lesions forming pre-leukemic clones, in utero exposure to Na2WO4 increases genetic susceptibility to viral influence(s); (2) postnatal exposure to a virus possessing the 1FXXKXFXXA/V9 peptide motif will cause an unnatural immune response encouraging proliferation in the B-cell precursor compartment. This study reports the results of exposing C57BL/6J mice to Na2WO4 in utero via water (15 ppm, ad libetum) and inhalation (mean concentration PM5 3.33 mg/m3) and to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) within 2 weeks of weaning. Inoculation of C57BL/6J mice with RSV was associated with a neutrophil shift in 56% of 5-month old mice. When the RSV inoculation was combined with Na2WO4-exposure, significant splenomegaly resulted (p=0.0406, 0.0184, 0.0108 for control, Na2WO4-only and RSV-only, respectively) in addition to other hematological pathologies which were not significant. Exposure to Na2WO4 and RSV resulted in hematological/immunological disease, the nature of which is currently inconclusive. Further research is needed to characterize this potential leukemia mouse model.","['Fastje, Cynthia D', 'Harper, Kevin', 'Terry, Chad', 'Sheppard, Paul R', 'Witten, Mark L']","['Fastje CD', 'Harper K', 'Terry C', 'Sheppard PR', 'Witten ML']","[""Steele Children's Research Center, PO Box 245073, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724-5073, USA. cfastje@email.arizona.edu""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Tungsten Compounds)', '64LRH4405G (sodium tungstate(VI))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced/*etiology/virology', 'Immune System Diseases/chemically induced/*etiology/virology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Pregnancy', 'Random Allocation', 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/*complications/virology', 'Respiratory Syncytial Viruses/*physiology', 'Spleen/immunology/virology', 'Tungsten Compounds/*toxicity']",2011/05/14 06:00,2012/06/13 06:00,['2011/05/14 06:00'],"['2010/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(11)00184-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2011.04.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2012 Apr 5;196(3):89-95. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2011.04.008.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of an EBV-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of the hypopharynx. METHODOLOGY: A 63-year-old male patient suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with swallowing disorders and a sore throat. Panendoscopy with laser surgical resection of tissue specimens was performed. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical and molecular genetic diagnostics, including EBV-encoded small RNA in situ hybridization, confirmed the diagnosis of an EBV-associated DLBCL of the hypopharynx. Ten weeks after the diagnosis, the patient died of disease related to multiple complications. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that the EBV infection was triggered by long-term immunosuppressive therapy that led secondarily to the development of a DLBCL. Otorhinolaryngologists should keep in mind that lymphomas might develop in the entire pharynx.","['Cordes, C', 'Tiemann, M', 'Tiemann, K', 'Knappe, D', 'Hoffmann, M', 'Gottschlich, S']","['Cordes C', 'Tiemann M', 'Tiemann K', 'Knappe D', 'Hoffmann M', 'Gottschlich S']","['Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Germany. ccordes@hno.uni-kiel.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Belgium,B-ENT,B-ENT,101247842,,IM,"['Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*complications/epidemiology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Hypopharyngeal Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/*virology', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pyriform Sinus/virology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2011/05/14 06:00,2011/06/17 06:00,['2011/05/14 06:00'],"['2011/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,B-ENT. 2011;7(1):43-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although CLL with 13q deletion as the sole cytogenetic abnormality (del13q-only) usually have good prognosis, more aggressive clinical courses are documented for del13q-only CLL carrying higher percentages of 13q deleted nuclei. Moreover, deletion at 13q of different sizes have been described, whose prognostic significance is still unknown. In a multi-institutional cohort of 342 del13q-only cases and in a consecutive unselected cohort of 265 CLL, we investigated the prognostic significance of 13q deletion, using the 13q FISH probes locus-specific identifier (LSI)-D13S319 and LSI-RB1 that detect the DLEU2/MIR15A/MIR16-1 and RB1 loci, respectively. Results indicated that both percentage of deleted nuclei and presence of larger deletions involving the RB1 locus cooperated to refine the prognosis of del13q-only cases. In particular, CLL carrying <70% of 13q deleted nuclei with deletions not comprising the RB1 locus were characterized by particularly long time-to-treatment. Conversely, CLL with 13q deletion in <70% of nuclei but involving the RB1 locus, or CLL carrying 13q deletion in >/=70% of nuclei, with or without RB1 deletions, collectively experienced shorter time-to-treatment. A revised flowchart for the prognostic FISH assessment of del13q-only CLL, implying the usage of both 13q probes, is proposed.","['Dal Bo, Michele', 'Rossi, Francesca Maria', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Deambrogi, Clara', 'Bertoni, Francesco', 'Del Giudice, Ilaria', 'Palumbo, Giuseppe', 'Nanni, Mauro', 'Rinaldi, Andrea', 'Kwee, Ivo', 'Tissino, Erika', 'Corradini, Giorgia', 'Gozzetti, Alessandro', 'Cencini, Emanuele', 'Ladetto, Marco', 'Coletta, Angela Maria', 'Luciano, Fabrizio', 'Bulian, Pietro', 'Pozzato, Gabriele', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Marasca, Roberto', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Foa, Robin', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Gattei, Valter']","['Dal Bo M', 'Rossi FM', 'Rossi D', 'Deambrogi C', 'Bertoni F', 'Del Giudice I', 'Palumbo G', 'Nanni M', 'Rinaldi A', 'Kwee I', 'Tissino E', 'Corradini G', 'Gozzetti A', 'Cencini E', 'Ladetto M', 'Coletta AM', 'Luciano F', 'Bulian P', 'Pozzato G', 'Laurenti L', 'Forconi F', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Marasca R', 'Del Poeta G', 'Gaidano G', 'Foa R', 'Guarini A', 'Gattei V']","['Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, IRCCS, Aviano (PN), Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (DLEU2 lncRNA, human)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.- (Transferases)', '13q deletion syndrome']",IM,"['Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Disorders/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transferases', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics']",2011/05/13 06:00,2011/11/08 06:00,['2011/05/13 06:00'],"['2011/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/25 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20885 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2011 Aug;50(8):633-43. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20885.

In this study, the expression of human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (hGM-CSF), which is known to be toxic to its host, was enhanced many folds using a combination of genetic and bioprocess strategies in Escherichia coli. The N terminus attachment of endoxylanase and asparaginase signal sequences from Bacillus subtilis and E. coli, respectively, in combination with and without His-tag, considerably improved expression levels. Induction and media optimization studies in shake flask cultures resulted in a maximal hGM-CSF concentration of 365 mg/L in the form of inclusion bodies (IBs) with a specific product yield (Y (P/X)) of 120 mg/g dry cell weight in case of the asparaginase signal. Culturing the cells in nutrient rich Terrific broth maintained the specific product yields (Y (P/X)) while a 6.6-fold higher volumetric concentration of both product and biomass was obtained. The purification and refolding steps were optimized resulting in a 95% pure protein with a fairly high refolding yield of 45%. The biological activity of the refolded protein was confirmed by a cell proliferation assay on hGM-CSF dependent human erythroleukemia TF-1 cells.

However, integration of provirus has been associated with epigenetic repercussions that may influence the expression of both the transgene and cellular genes close to vector integration loci. The exploitation of genetic insulator elements may overcome both issues through their ability to act as barriers that limit transgene silencing and/or as enhancer-blockers preventing the activation of endogenous genes by the vector enhancer. We established quantitative plasmid-based assay systems to screen enhancer-blocker and barrier genetic elements. Short synthetic insulators that bind to nuclear factor-I protein family transcription factors were identified to exert both enhancer-blocker and barrier functions, and were compared to binding sites for the insulator protein CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor). Gamma-retroviral vectors enclosing these insulator elements were produced at titers similar to their non-insulated counterparts and proved to be less genotoxic in an in vitro immortalization assay, yielding lower activation of Evi1 oncogene expression and reduced clonal expansion of bone marrow cells.","['Gaussin, A', 'Modlich, U', 'Bauche, C', 'Niederlander, N J', 'Schambach, A', 'Duros, C', 'Artus, A', 'Baum, C', 'Cohen-Haguenauer, O', 'Mermod, N']","['Gaussin A', 'Modlich U', 'Bauche C', 'Niederlander NJ', 'Schambach A', 'Duros C', 'Artus A', 'Baum C', 'Cohen-Haguenauer O', 'Mermod N']","['Institute of Biotechnology, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (CCCTC-Binding Factor)', '0 (CTCF protein, human)', '0 (CTF-1 transcription factor)', '0 (Ctcf protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (NFI Transcription Factors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Silencing', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', '*Insulator Elements', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'NFI Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Plasmids/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Transgenes', 'Virus Integration']",2011/05/13 06:00,2012/04/26 06:00,['2011/05/13 06:00'],"['2011/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['gt201170 [pii]', '10.1038/gt.2011.70 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2012 Jan;19(1):15-24. doi: 10.1038/gt.2011.70.

Its activity is controlled by the multi-subunit gamma-secretase (gammaSE) complex. Although Notch signalling can play both oncogenic and tumour-suppressor roles in solid tumours, in the haematopoietic system it is exclusively oncogenic, notably in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a disease characterized by Notch1-activating mutations. Here we identify novel somatic-inactivating Notch pathway mutations in a fraction of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). Inactivation of Notch signalling in mouse haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) results in an aberrant accumulation of granulocyte/monocyte progenitors (GMPs), extramedullary haematopoieisis and the induction of CMML-like disease. Transcriptome analysis revealed that Notch signalling regulates an extensive myelomonocytic-specific gene signature, through the direct suppression of gene transcription by the Notch target Hes1.

Using 23 AML-patient samples, 39% demonstrated no detectable engraftment in NOD/SCID and were categorized as AMLs devoid of LICs. However, 33% of AML patients lacking AML-LICs were capable of engrafting NSG recipients, but produced a monoclonal T-cell proliferative disorder similar to T-ALL. These grafts demonstrated self-renewal capacity as measured by in vivo serial passage and were restricted to CD34-positive fraction, and were defined as LICs. Molecular analysis for translocations in MLL genes indicated that these AML patient-derived LICs all expressed the MLL-AFX1 fusion product. Our results reveal that the in vivo human versus xenograft host microenvironment dictates the developmental capacity of human LICs residing in a small subset of patients diagnosed with AML harboring MLL mutations. These findings have implications both for the basic biology of CSC function, and for the use of in vivo models of the leukemogenic process in preclinical or diagnostic studies.","['Risueno, Ruth M', 'Campbell, Clinton J V', 'Dingwall, Steve', 'Levadoux-Martin, Marilyne', 'Leber, Brian', 'Xenocostas, Anargyros', 'Bhatia, Mickie']","['Risueno RM', 'Campbell CJ', 'Dingwall S', 'Levadoux-Martin M', 'Leber B', 'Xenocostas A', 'Bhatia M']","['Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (IL2RG protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLL-AFX protein, human)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells/metabolism', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Graft Survival', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/genetics/metabolism']",2011/05/13 06:00,2011/09/21 06:00,['2011/05/13 06:00'],"['2011/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44852-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-01-329078 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jun 30;117(26):7112-20. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-01-329078.

The role of apoptotic pathways in platelet turnover and in the apoptotic-like changes seen after platelet activation is poorly understood. ABT-263 (Navitoclax), a specific inhibitor of antiapoptotic BCL2 proteins, which is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of leukemia and other malignancies, induces a dose-limiting thrombocytopenia. In this study, the relationship between BCL2/BCL-X(L) inhibition, apoptosis, and platelet activation was investigated. Exposure to ABT-263 induced apoptosis but repressed platelet activation by physiologic agonists. Notably, ABT-263 induced an immediate calcium response in platelets and the depletion of intracellular calcium stores, indicating that on BCL2/BCL-X(L) inhibition platelet activation is abrogated because of a diminished calcium signaling. By comparing the effects of ABT-263 and its analog ABT-737 on platelets and leukemia cells from the same donor, we show, for the first time, that these BCL2/BCL-X(L) inhibitors do not offer any selective toxicity but induce apoptosis at similar concentrations in leukemia cells and platelets. However, reticulated platelets are less sensitive to apoptosis, supporting the hypothesis that treatment with ABT-263 induces a selective loss of older platelets and providing an explanation for the transient thrombocytopenia observed on ABT-263 treatment.","['Vogler, Meike', 'Hamali, Hassan A', 'Sun, Xiao-Ming', 'Bampton, Edward T W', 'Dinsdale, David', 'Snowden, Roger T', 'Dyer, Martin J S', 'Goodall, Alison H', 'Cohen, Gerald M']","['Vogler M', 'Hamali HA', 'Sun XM', 'Bampton ET', 'Dinsdale D', 'Snowden RT', 'Dyer MJ', 'Goodall AH', 'Cohen GM']","['Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Biphenyl Compounds/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Blood Platelets/*drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Calcium Signaling/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression', 'Homeostasis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Nitrophenols/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Platelet Activation/*drug effects', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Thrombopoiesis', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2011/05/13 06:00,2011/09/21 06:00,['2011/05/13 06:00'],"['2011/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)44856-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-03-344812 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jun 30;117(26):7145-54. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-03-344812.

Based on a critical review of the literature and, whenever necessary, on panelists' experience, key issues were identified and discussed concerning: (1) when to perform mutation analysis, (2) how to perform it, and (3) how to translate results into clinical practice. In chronic phase patients receiving imatinib first-line, mutation analysis is recommended only in case of failure or suboptimal response according to the ELN criteria. In imatinib-resistant patients receiving an alternative TKI, mutation analysis is recommended in case of hematologic or cytogenetic failure as provisionally defined by the ELN. The recommended methodology is direct sequencing, although it may be preceded by screening with other techniques, such as denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography. In all the cases outlined within this abstract, a positive result is an indication for therapeutic change.

This led to the suggestion that open chromatin was favorable for integration. More recent deep sequencing experiments confirmed that gammaretroviral integration sites and DNase I cleavage sites are associated in genome-wide surveys. Paradoxically, in vitro studies of integration show that nucleosomal DNA is actually favored over naked DNA, raising the question of whether integration target DNA in chromosomes is wrapped in nucleosomes or nucleosome free. In this study we examined gammaretroviral integration by infecting primary human CD4(+) T lymphocytes with a murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based retroviral vector or xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV), and isolated 32,585 unique integration sites using ligation-mediated PCR and 454 pyrosequencing. CD4(+) T lymphocytes were chosen for study because of the particularly dense genome-wide mapping of chromatin features available for comparison. Analysis relative to predicted nucleosome positions showed that gammaretroviruses direct integration into outward-facing major grooves on nucleosome-wrapped DNA, similar to the integration pattern of HIV. Also, a suite of histone modifications correlated with gene activity are positively associated with integration by both MLV and XMRV. Thus, we conclude that favored integration near DNase I-hypersensitive sites does not imply that integration takes place exclusively in nucleosome-free regions.","['Roth, Shoshannah L', 'Malani, Nirav', 'Bushman, Frederic D']","['Roth SL', 'Malani N', 'Bushman FD']","['University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology, 3610 Hamilton Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6076, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nucleosomes)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Gammaretrovirus/*genetics', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Nucleosomes/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', '*Virus Integration']",2011/05/13 06:00,2011/09/16 06:00,['2011/05/13 06:00'],"['2011/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00635-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00635-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2011 Jul;85(14):7393-401. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00635-11.

They exert a broad variety of different biological activities. This review attempts to critically summarise the knowledge on the anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activity of SLs, with a special focus on parthenolide and helenalin. Recent advances on their molecular modes of action, allergic potential and also QSAR studies with SLs are presented. Therapeutic areas are highlighted in which SLs may play a role in the future. Thus, SLs may possess therapeutic relevance as single components for the local treatment of inflammation, such as rheumatoid complaints. In cancer therapy, SLs may be favourable in dual therapy or in the inhibition of leukaemia cell growth. In each case, native SLs serve as leads that have to be optimised in terms of their specificity, pharmacokinetics and absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (=ADME) properties. Finally, appropriate in vivo studies will decide whether SLs will become therapeutics or remain interesting research compounds.","['Merfort, Irmgard']",['Merfort I'],"['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology and Biotechnology, University of Freiburg, Germany. irmgard.merfort@pharmazie.uni-freiburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,"['0 (Lactones)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Inflammation/*drug therapy', 'Lactones/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Models, Molecular', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sesquiterpenes/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2011/05/13 06:00,2012/01/19 06:00,['2011/05/13 06:00'],"['2010/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [medline]']","['BSP/CDT/E-Pub/00300 [pii]', '10.2174/138945011798109437 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2011 Oct;12(11):1560-73. doi: 10.2174/138945011798109437.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As an enzyme, it catalyzes the production of Ca2+ active metabolites, predominantly cADPR and ADPR. As a receptor, it regulates the activation of an intracellular signaling pathway, generally linked to lymphocyte activation and proliferation in physiological conditions. The finding that CD38 behaves as an independent negative prognostic factor in CLL patients was the starting point for investigations into the functional role of the molecule in the neoplastic context. Data accumulating in over a decade concur to define a model where CD38 is a central element of a large supramolecular complex that includes surface signaling receptors, chemokine receptors, adhesion molecules and matrix metalloproteases. Expression of CD38 within this supramolecular complex makes signal transduction as well as chemotaxis and homing more efficient, suggesting that the molecule is an integrator of proliferative and migratory signals. These data indicate that CD38 is not only a reliable disease marker but also a functional molecule in the CLL context. The next decade will likely tell whether it can also be a useful therapeutic target.","['Deaglio, S', 'Vaisitti, T', 'Serra, S', 'Audrito, V', 'Bologna, C', ""D'Arena, G"", 'Laurenti, L', 'Gottardi, D', 'Malavasi, F']","['Deaglio S', 'Vaisitti T', 'Serra S', 'Audrito V', 'Bologna C', ""D'Arena G"", 'Laurenti L', 'Gottardi D', 'Malavasi F']","['Human Genetics Foundation (HuGeF), University of Torino Medical School, 10126 Torino, Italy. silvia.deaglio@unito.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mini Rev Med Chem,Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,101094212,"['EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'EC 3.4.- (Metalloproteases)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/chemistry/*metabolism/physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Metalloproteases/metabolism']",2011/05/13 06:00,2011/10/28 06:00,['2011/05/13 06:00'],"['2010/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['BSP/MRMC/ Epub/215 [pii]', '10.2174/138955711795843338 [doi]']",ppublish,Mini Rev Med Chem. 2011 Jun;11(6):503-7. doi: 10.2174/138955711795843338.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of cytokines on induction of apoptosis in acute leukemic cell lines; HL-60, MV4-11, K-562 and Molt-4 and in addition, to study the involvement of nitric oxide (NO) in apoptotic pathways. METHODS: Leukemic cell lines were incubated with cytokines; interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma in various concentrations and for variable periods of time. The percent apoptosis and caspase 3 activation were examined by flow cytometry. Moreover, NO production and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA were measured by using Griess method and Real-time PCR, respectively. RESULTS: Cytokines caused a time and dose-dependent induction of apoptosis in leukemic cell lines. The highest cell apoptosis was found in K-562 treated with 40 U/ml interferon-gamma for 48 hours; this correlated with the result of cell growth inhibition and caspase 3 activation. NO and iNOS mRNA were increased in cytokines treated cells. Moreover, apoptosis was reduced by SMT, an iNOS inhibitor, which confirms the possible involvement of NO in the apoptotic pathway. CONCLUSION: Cytokines especially interferon-y induced apoptosis in acute leukemia via NO and caspase 3 pathway.","['Siripin, Darin', 'Fucharoen, Suthat', 'Tanyong, Dalina I']","['Siripin D', 'Fucharoen S', 'Tanyong DI']","['Department of Clinical Microscopy, Faculty of Medical Technology, Mahidol University, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Thailand,Asian Pac J Allergy Immunol,Asian Pacific journal of allergy and immunology,8402034,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2011/05/13 06:00,2011/10/07 06:00,['2011/05/13 06:00'],"['2011/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Allergy Immunol. 2011 Mar;29(1):102-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated acute neurobehavioral side effects of corticosteroid therapy in preschool versus school-age children by obtaining structured reports weekly for 1 month. PROCEDURE: Parents of 62 children (2-17 years) treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) ALL Consortium Protocol 00-01 participated during the continuation phase of treatment. Patients received cyclical twice-daily 5-day courses of prednisone (PRED; 40 mg/m(2) /day) or dexamethasone (DEX; 6 mg/m(2) /day). Parents completed behavior rating scales about their child weekly during one steroid cycle [baseline (Day 0), active steroid (Day 7), post-steroid (Days 14 and 21)]. RESULTS: Behavioral side effects increased significantly (P < 0.001) during the steroid week for preschool children (<6 years) on measures of emotional control, mood, behavior regulation, and executive functions, returning to baseline during the two ""off-steroid"" weeks. In contrast, school-age children (>/= 6 years) did not demonstrate an increase in side effects during the steroid week. Steroid type (PRED vs. DEX) was not a significant predictor of neurobehavioral side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Preschool children are at greater risk for neurobehavioral side effects during active steroid treatment for ALL than school-age children and adolescents. DEX was not associated with more neurobehavioral side effects than PRED. Counseling of families about side-effects should be adapted according to age. The observed effects, moreover, were transient, reducing concerns about longer-term neurobehavioral toxicities.","['Mrakotsky, Christine M', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Dahlberg, Suzanne E', 'Alyman, M Cheryl A', 'Sands, Stephen A', 'Queally, Jennifer T', 'Miller, Tamara P', 'Cranston, Amy', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Waber, Deborah P']","['Mrakotsky CM', 'Silverman LB', 'Dahlberg SE', 'Alyman MC', 'Sands SA', 'Queally JT', 'Miller TP', 'Cranston A', 'Neuberg DS', 'Sallan SE', 'Waber DP']","[""Department of Psychiatry, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, MA, USA. christine.mrakotsky@childrens.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/*adverse effects', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Behavior/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Data Collection', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Family Health', 'Humans', 'Parents', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Time Factors']",2011/05/12 06:00,2011/10/15 06:00,['2011/05/12 06:00'],"['2010/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23060 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Sep;57(3):492-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23060.

Infection of a new host species can manifest as a distinct disease. In this respect, the use of non-human viruses in clinical therapy may be a cause for concern. It could provide the opportunity for the viruses to adapt to the new host and be transferred to the recipient's relatives or medical caretakers, or even to the normal host species. Such environmental impact is evidently undesirable. To forecast future clinical use of non-human viruses, a literature study was performed to identify the viruses that are being considered for application as therapeutic agents for use in humans. Twenty-seven non-human virus species were identified that are in (pre)clinical development, mainly as oncolytic agents. For risk management, it is essential that the potential environmental consequences are assessed before initiating clinical use, even if the virus is not formally classified as a genetically modified organism. To aid such assessment, each of these viruses was classified in one of five relative environmental risk categories, ranging from ""Negligible"" to ""Very High"". Canary pox virus and the Autographa californica baculovirus were assigned a ""Negligible"" classification, and Seneca Valley virus, murine leukemia virus, and Maraba virus to the ""High"" category. A complicating factor in the classification is the scarcity of publicly available information on key aspects of virus biology in some species. In such cases the relative environmental risk score was increased as a precaution.","['Koppers-Lalic, Danijela', 'Hoeben, Rob C']","['Koppers-Lalic D', 'Hoeben RC']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Rev Med Virol,Reviews in medical virology,9112448,,IM,"['Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/pathogenicity', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Oncolytic Virotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Oncolytic Viruses/*pathogenicity', 'Picornaviridae/pathogenicity', 'Rhabdoviridae/pathogenicity', 'Virus Diseases/transmission']",2011/05/12 06:00,2011/10/25 06:00,['2011/05/12 06:00'],"['2011/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/rmv.694 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Med Virol. 2011 Jul;21(4):227-39. doi: 10.1002/rmv.694.

In a risk-oriented design, we adopted a flexible treatment program in which (1) patients with persistent mediastinal abnormality, evaluated by post-induction computed chest tomography, received mediastinal irradiation; and (2) those with persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD), evaluated by MRD analysis of the bone marrow, underwent SCT. Twenty-eight out of 30 patients (T-lineage, n = 24; B-lineage, n = 6) achieved a complete response. Of 21 patients with mediastinal mass, 13 (62%) achieved a complete response after chemotherapy alone, while 6 (28.5%) required additional irradiation. Eleven patients were evaluated for MRD: 6 were negative and 5 positive. On the basis of MRD findings and clinical risk characteristics, 14 patients underwent SCT, 13 received maintenance chemotherapy, and 1 had local radiotherapy. Five patients relapsed. Among the 14 non-irradiated patients with T-LL, the mediastinal recurrence rate was only 7%. After a median follow-up of 3.9 years, 21 patients who responded were alive without recurrence (75%). The projected 5-year survival, disease-free survival, and relapse rate were 72%, 77%, and 18%, respectively. This program induced high remission and survival rates, indicating the feasibility and the benefits potentially associated with a selective, response-oriented policy of mediastinal irradiation and a concurrent MRD-based strategy to assign adult LL patients to SCT.","['Cortelazzo, Sergio', 'Intermesoli, Tamara', 'Oldani, Elena', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Rossi, Giuseppe', 'Pogliani, Enrico M', 'Mattei, Daniele', 'Romani, Claudio', 'Cortelezzi, Agostino', 'Borlenghi, Erika', 'Corti, Consuelo', 'Peruta, Barbara', 'Spinelli, Orietta', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Bassan, Renato']","['Cortelazzo S', 'Intermesoli T', 'Oldani E', 'Ciceri F', 'Rossi G', 'Pogliani EM', 'Mattei D', 'Romani C', 'Cortelezzi A', 'Borlenghi E', 'Corti C', 'Peruta B', 'Spinelli O', 'Rambaldi A', 'Bassan R']","['Division of Hematology, Ospedale Civile, Bolzano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mediastinum/pathology/*radiation effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/drug therapy/pathology/surgery', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Radiotherapy, Image-Guided/*methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2011/05/12 06:00,2012/02/24 06:00,['2011/05/12 06:00'],"['2011/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-011-1252-x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2012 Jan;91(1):73-82. doi: 10.1007/s00277-011-1252-x.

It has been suggested that HTLV-I is responsible for the immortalization of infected cells, but transformation is dependent on secondary events. To investigate this hypothesis, we have isolated an HTLV-I infected T cell line that is dependent on IL-2 for growth in tissue culture. Further, a subclone of this cell line that is able to grow in the absence of IL-2 has been isolated. Both cell lines have identical TCR chain rearrangements and cell surface markers. Each,cell line produces viral mRNAs and proteins. Finally, both of these cell lines are sensitive to rapamycin and cyclosporin A regardless of the presence of IL-2.
