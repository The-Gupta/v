The differentiating cells simultaneously acquired monocyte antigen, membrane complement receptors, phagocytic function, and monocyte/macrophage morphology. The maturation-inducing activity is dose-dependent, with more inducer causing the development of more mature cells in a shorter time period. The maturation inducer was shown to be stable after pH 2 treatment, independent of interleukin 2 and colony-stimulating factor, devoid of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-interferon, and not affected by antibody to interferon.

B plus null cells, chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, and an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell line possess CR1, CR2, and gp45-70. On T cells and T-cell lines gp45-70 is the predominant or, in some cases, the only C3-binding protein isolated. gp45-70 is structurally characterized as a broad band or doublet with a mean Mr that is slightly different for each cell population. gp45-70 binds iC3, C3b, and C4b, but not C3d, indicating that the binding region is probably within the C3c portion of C3b. A polyclonal antibody to CR1 and monoclonal antibodies to CR1 and CR2 do not immunoprecipitate gp45-70. While gp45-70 has not been previously characterized on human cells, a C3b-binding glycoprotein of similar Mr is present on rabbit alveolar macrophages.

This indicated that H-Y antigen is involved in B6RV2 rejection by syngeneic female recipient mice. In the case of another leukemia, BALB.RL male 1, and Ir gene, probably identical to the Rgv-1 gene, is responsible for RL male 1 rejection. Thus, F1 hybrids of BALB/c with certain other strains of mice can reject RL male 1. Using these two different systems of tumor rejection, we investigated the effects of in vivo administration of Lyt and Thy-1 monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Results showed that Lyt-2 and -3 mAb blocked both B6RV2 rejection by B6 female mice and BALB.RL male 1 rejection by CB6F1 mice. The specificity of blocking was confirmed by use of Lyt-2 and -3 mAb to reciprocal alleles and mice from B6 Lyt-congeneic stocks. No blocking was observed with Lyt-1 and Thy-1 mAb. The Lyt phenotype of T cells in lymphoid tissues from mice treated with mAb was then studied. Blocking of the Lyt-2+3+ population was observed in the lymph node and spleen, but not in the thymus. These results indicate the involvement of Lyt-2+3+ cells (or Lyt-2,3 antigen) in tumor rejection. The precise mechanism of blocking is unknown, but it was observed after even a single injection of Lyt-2,3 mAb on day 9 after tumor transplantation, suggesting that effector cells were functionally blocked, rather than that the generation of these cells was inhibited.","['Nakayama, E', 'Uenaka, A']","['Nakayama E', 'Uenaka A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/physiology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, Ly/*genetics', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/administration & dosage/physiology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Female', '*Graft Rejection', 'Isoantibodies/*administration & dosage/physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phenotype', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*classification']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.161.2.345 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1985 Feb 1;161(2):345-55. doi: 10.1084/jem.161.2.345.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Isoantibodies)', '0 (Lyt antibodies)']",,,PMC2187571,,

Phorbol esters, including PMA and phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu), were potent inhibitors of BCL-1 IgM secretion induced by either LPS or lymphokines; half-maximal inhibition was obtained with 0.1 nM PMA and 0.8 nm PDBu. The inhibitory action of PDBu on BCL-1 cells was reversible for over 1 hr, but after 5 hr 70% of the inhibition was irreversible. Irreversible inhibition could be blocked by cycloheximide, suggesting a requirement for protein synthesis. The specificity of PDBu inhibition was examined by comparing the patterns of protein synthesis in PDBu-treated and control BCL-1 cells. Total incorporation of [35S]methionine into protein by BCL-1 cells cultured in the presence of PDBu was similar to that of untreated cells. Analysis of radiolabeled proteins by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography revealed no consistent changes in the pattern of protein synthesis except at those positions corresponding to the heavy and light chains of IgM. Immunoprecipitation with an affinity-purified anti-IgM indicated that PDBu inhibited the increased synthesis of heavy and light chain that follows stimulation by lymphokine but did not diminish control IgM synthesis.

One B lymphoma cell line (T27A) was found to stimulate IL 2 release from some alloreactive T cell clones without stimulating any significant T cell proliferation response. The same B lymphoma cells are capable of stimulating IL 2 release and proliferative responses from other T cell clones. Evidence is presented suggesting that B lymphoma cell stimulation of these T cell clones is largely IL 1 independent and that at least some T cell clones may require activation signals other than Ia, antigen, and IL 1. The addition of exogenous, purified IL 1 to the T cell activation assays was found to have a wide range of stimulatory effects on the proliferative responses of different T cell clones.

The therapeutic potential of araC has been assessed in patients with AML, ALL, and T lymphoblastic lymphoma by measuring the conversion of araC to its active metabolite, the 5'-triphosphate of araC (araCTP), in purified blasts from patients as well as in normal polymorphs and lymphocytes. In all leukemias, araCTP was the major intracellular metabolite of araC. The highest araCTP formation was in blasts from T lymphoblastic lymphoma, which formed threefold more nucleotide than myeloblasts, and in turn myeloblasts formed twofold more araCTP than lymphoblasts from ALL. The mean araCTP formation in myeloblasts was sixfold greater than polymorphs, but in contrast, lymphoblasts and lymphocytes formed low and similar amounts of this nucleotide. Reasons for the sixfold range in araCTP accumulation in the various leukemic blasts were studied. The mean size of myeloblasts was 35-70% larger than lymphoblasts when compared on the basis of protein or intracellular water content, but T lymphoblastic lymphoma blasts and lymphoblasts were the same size. Activities of deoxycytidine kinase, deoxycytidylate deaminase, and pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphate kinase were not different between any of the leukemic cell types. The number of nucleoside transport sites on blasts was estimated by measuring the equilibrium binding of [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR), which binds with high affinity to the transporter. Scatchard analysis yielded mean values of 27,500 sites/cell for T lymphoblastic lymphoma blasts, 10,000 sites/cell for myeloblasts, and 2,300 sites/cell for lymphoblasts. Our previous work has shown that araC influx correlates with the maximum number of 3H-NBMPR binding sites in leukemic and normal white cells. A strong correlation was observed between the number of nucleoside transport sites per leukemic blast cell and the accumulation of intracellular araCTP from extracellular araC at 1 microM. Membrane transport of araC at the low concentrations (approximately 1 microM), which are achieved therapeutically, is a major rate-limiting step in its conversion to araCTP by leukemic blast cells. Myeloblasts form more araCTP than lymphoblasts because of both higher nucleoside transport capacity and larger cell size. The highest nucleoside transport capacity and largest conversion of araC to araCTP is in T lymphoblastic lymphoma, which suggests that araC may be effective in the treatment of this disease.","['Wiley, J S', 'Taupin, J', 'Jamieson, G P', 'Snook, M', 'Sawyer, W H', 'Finch, L R']","['Wiley JS', 'Taupin J', 'Jamieson GP', 'Snook M', 'Sawyer WH', 'Finch LR']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Biotransformation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/*blood/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*blood/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*blood/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI111741 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1985 Feb;75(2):632-42. doi: 10.1172/JCI111741.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)']",,,PMC423544,,

Specifically, three-week-old Balb/c By mice were injected with murine sarcoma virus-murine leukemia virus-Moloney (MSV-MuLV-M), which resulted 6-8 months later in the development of immunoblastic T-cell sarcomas with a leukemic phase. Splenic T cells from either normal or tumor-bearing mice were assessed for their relative ability to modulate erythroid differentiation. Quantitatively, T cells, Ly1 or Ly 2,3 T-cell subsets isolated from tumor-bearing animals significantly enhanced erythropoiesis when compared with comparable normal T-cell subsets. These data suggest that the compensatory shift of erythropoiesis from the bone marrow to the spleen observed during leukemogenesis was facilitated by splenic T cells.

In the conventional 51Cr-release assay, the cytotoxic potential of lymphocytes pretreated with P(Bu)2 for a short time was reduced while after prolonged treatment their function was increased. The peak of lytic potential was attained after 15 hr of exposure. Comparison of the cytotoxic results obtained in suspension and immobilized conjugate assays suggested that P(Bu)2 treatment causes an impairment of the recycling capacity of lymphocytes. After prolonged exposure, the lytic machinery became activated as reflected by the reduced time elapsing after contact between effectors and targets and the delivery of lethal hit. The activation was also observed in the immobilized agarose assay. It was reflected by the elevated proportion of damaged targets that were bound to the treated lymphocytes. The P(Bu)2- and interferon-induced augmentation of lytic potential is achieved through different mechanisms.

Additional treatment with the chemically defined biological response modifier maleic anhydride divinyl ether copolymer (MVE-2) was able to ameliorate the myelosuppressive effects of CY and to restore normal bone marrow cellularity. The stimulatory effects on myelopoiesis, however, could only be obtained by administering MVE-2 at greater than or equal to 3 days after CY, which correlated with an MVE-2-induced simultaneous increase in granulocyte and/or macrophage colony-stimulating factor secretion by bone marrow cells or M phi. Injection of MBL-2 tumor-bearing mice with MVE-2, at 3 days after Cy treatment, caused a decrease in tumor burden and a significant increase in median survival time as compared to treatment with CY alone. At the same time, MVE-2 induced an increase in the number of cytotoxic M phi and a complete restoration within the myelopoietic lineage, which might prevent delayed side effects of CY, such as secondary infections, and might permit more intensive chemotherapeutic treatment. Treatment of MBL-2 tumor-bearing mice with MVE-2, at 6 days after CY, induced a significant increase in M phi cytotoxicity but did not prolong median survival time, probably due to a rapid regrowth of tumor after treatment with CY. Our studies thus show that successful combined therapy with the primary cytotoxic agent CY and the biological response modifier MVE-2 depends on precise timing of the drug regimen and is influenced by the extent and reversibility of CY-induced immunosuppression, as well as by the kinetics of recruitment of new effector cells from bone marrow and by the tumor burden present at the time of treatment.","['Schlick, E', 'Ruffmann, R', 'Chirigos, M A', 'Welker, R D', 'Herberman, R B']","['Schlick E', 'Ruffmann R', 'Chirigos MA', 'Welker RD', 'Herberman RB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/physiology', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/metabolism', 'Cyclophosphamide/*toxicity', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Female', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/physiopathology', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Polymers/*pharmacology', 'Pyran Copolymer/*pharmacology']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Mar;45(3):1108-14.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Polymers)', '27100-68-1 (Pyran Copolymer)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,,,

The donor or recipient origin of T-cell lymphomas arising in the host animal was identified by the sex chromosome marker. Spleen and bone marrow of athymic BALB-nu/nu mice contain cells with the potential to develop into T-cell lymphomas upon transfer to thymus-bearing BALB/c recipients. Such lymphomas arise from at least two subsets of T-cells, one terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) positive and the other 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase positive. The enzyme-negative precursor T-cells from the BALB-nu/nu spleen and bone marrow can thus mature to enzyme-positive cells and give rise to lymphoma in the thymus-bearing recipient. Preleukemic spleen and bone marrow, but not thymus, from CBA and BALB/c mice regularly contained cells with the potential to develop lymphoma. The subset of T-cell involved was influenced by the genotype since lymphomas arising after the transfer of CBA and BALB/c spleens were TdT positive and 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase positive, respectively. In thymus-bearing mice, but not in nude mice, the transfer of preleukemic spleen cells gave lymphomas earlier than did transfer of bone marrow cells. This suggests that the more mature lymphoid cell population in the spleen of thymus-bearing mice may allow leukemic transformation to occur more rapidly than do the less mature cells in the bone marrow. In one-third of the cases, the virus produced by the preleukemic cells transferred induced new lymphomas involving recipient host cells. These de novo-induced lymphomas were all TdT positive. We suggest that leukemic transformation of TdT-positive cells may occur through a different mechanism than does transformation of cells bearing the 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase marker.","['Asjo, B', 'Skoog, L', 'Palminger, I', 'Wiener, F', 'Isaak, D', 'Cerny, J', 'Fenyo, E M']","['Asjo B', 'Skoog L', 'Palminger I', 'Wiener F', 'Isaak D', 'Cerny J', 'Fenyo EM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['20-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/analysis', 'Animals', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', 'Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Preleukemia/*immunology/microbiology', 'Species Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/*classification', 'Thymus Gland/*immunology']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Mar;45(3):1040-5.,"['EC 1.1.1.- (20-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",,,,,

These tumors were shown to be of B lineage because they strongly expressed the B cell-restricted antigens B1 and B4 and lacked T cell- and monocyte-restricted antigens. Moreover, the strong expression of the plasma cell-associated PCA-1 antigen on the majority of hairy cells suggested that these tumors correspond to later stages of B cell ontogeny. Dual fluorescence experiments further confirmed that HCL splenocytes that coexpressed B1 and PCA-1 demonstrated both the morphology and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase positivity of hairy cells. The observation that some hairy cells either spontaneously produce immunoglobulin (Ig) or could be induced to proliferate and secrete Ig provides complementary support for the view that HCL is a pre-plasma cell tumor.

It was found that leukemogenic radiation treatment resulted in a sustained depression of the level of thymic cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors (CTLp) and of mixed lymphocyte reactivity of thymus cells when assessed between 1 and 4 mo after irradiation, in spite of the fact that the total number of thymocytes was restored to the normal level within 2 mo and continued to increase thereafter. In vitro mixing studies of normal thymocytes with thymus cells from split-dose irradiated mice provided no evidence for active suppression as a mechanism for this depressed activity. The ability of bone marrow cells from split-dose irradiated mice to regenerate the thymus and to differentiate into functional CTLp was examined by use of supralethally irradiated Thy-1 congenic recipients. Reconstitution of supralethally irradiated B10.BR Thy-1.2 mice with normal bone marrow from B10.BR Thy-1.1 mice resulted in the complete repopulation of host-thymus with donor-derived cells when assessed at 4 wk after reconstitution. Lymphocytes from the regenerating thymus of these animals were shown to contain high levels of CTLp which were donor-derived. On the other hand, when the recipient mice were reconstituted with bone marrow cells from donor mice which had been split-dose irradiated 1 mo earlier, regeneration of the recipient thymus was severely depressed when assessed at 4 wk to 3 mo after reconstitution. Although variable but small numbers of donor-derived Thy-1+ cells were detected, CTL activity for alloantigen could not be induced in these donor-derived cells. The results suggest that T cell precursors derived from split-dose irradiated donor mice were unable to undergo active proliferation and differentiation into functional CTLp. The significance of these findings on radiation-induced thymic leukemogenesis is discussed.","['Muto, M', 'Kubo, E', 'Sado, T']","['Muto M', 'Kubo E', 'Sado T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*immunology/mortality', 'Lymphoma/etiology/*immunology/mortality', 'Mice', 'Organ Size/radiation effects', 'Regeneration', 'Stem Cells/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology', 'Thymus Gland/*pathology/physiology']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Mar;134(3):2026-31.,,,,,,

None of the subclones that were obtained produced IL 2 constitutively, and only a low level of IL 2 was produced by the stimulation of these subclones with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) alone. High levels of IL 2 production (greater than 300 U/ml) were observed in several clones when stimulated with a cocktail of PHA and IL 1. Among them, HSB.2-A7-D2, A7-D9, or C5-B2 subclones, which were selected after cloning twice, were most effective in IL 1-dependent IL 2 production. HSB.2 subclones exhibited IL 1-dependent production of a variety of lymphokines other than IL 2, e.g., interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), B cell growth factor (BCGF), and colony-stimulating factor (CSF). We observed that subclones with high IL 2-producing capacity tended to produce high levels of IFN-gamma or BCGF as well, while the capacity of CSF production was not parallel to these properties. Although several subclones were found to produce IFN-gamma and BCGF simultaneously with minimal IL 2 activity, no subclones with an exclusive BCGF production were obtained. Furthermore, when supernatants from the stimulated A7-D9 subclone were applied to an Ultro-gel AcA54 gel chromatography, it was revealed that IL 2 activity (m.w. 17K to 18K) and IFN-gamma (40K to 45K) were clearly separated, whereas two peaks of BCGF activity coincided with each peak of IL 2 and IFN-gamma, respectively. On the other hand, CSF activity was eluted at a different peak (30K to 35K). These data indicate that IL 2, IFN-gamma, and CSF activities are based on distinct molecules, whereas BCGF activities are indistinguishable from IL 2 and IFN-gamma. The HSB.2 subclones thus selected will provide a useful model for delineating the mechanism of IL 1-dependent lymphokine(s) production, and are a promising candidate for better lymphokine(s) producers.","['Kasahara, T', 'Mukaida, N', 'Hatake, K', 'Motoyoshi, K', 'Kawai, T', 'Shiori-Nakano, K']","['Kasahara T', 'Mukaida N', 'Hatake K', 'Motoyoshi K', 'Kawai T', 'Shiori-Nakano K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Clone Cells/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*physiology', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Mar;134(3):1682-9.,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)']",,,,,

These ""early"" cells are negative with a number of other reagents, anti-IgD, RFB4 (CD22), RFB6 (CD21), and RFA-2, which on the other hand recognize peripheral B cells.

In fetal lymph nodes, primary nodules develop around the follicular dendritic (FD) cells from 17 wk onward, and contain a virtually pure population of B cells; B1+,BA1+,RFB4+,RFB6+,RFA-2+, which simultaneously express IgM,IgD together with T1 (CD5), a T cell-associated antigen. A sizeable subpopulation of these IgM+,T1+ cells are also positive for Tu-33, another T cell-associated marker. In the spleen, the B cells of the IgM+,IgD+,T1+ type appear in smaller numbers and only relatively late around wk 22. These cells are diffusely distributed at first, and start accumulating around the small FD cell clusters as soon as these emerge about the 23rd gestational wk. At that time, the IgM+,T1+B cells can also be washed out from the peritoneal and pleural cavities. The T1+,IgM+B cells may represent the normal equivalent cells of B chronic lymphoid leukemia and centrocytic lymphoma, and appear to be the counterpart of Ly-1+,IgM+B cells in the mouse.","['Bofill, M', 'Janossy, G', 'Janossa, M', 'Burford, G D', 'Seymour, G J', 'Wernet, P', 'Kelemen, E']","['Bofill M', 'Janossy G', 'Janossa M', 'Burford GD', 'Seymour GJ', 'Wernet P', 'Kelemen E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'B-Lymphocytes/*classification/cytology/physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Female', 'Fetus/*cytology', 'Gestational Age', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Liver/cytology', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology', 'Middle Aged', 'Palatine Tonsil/cytology', 'Peritoneal Cavity/cytology', 'Phenotype', 'Pleura/cytology', 'Pregnancy', 'Spleen/cytology']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Mar;134(3):1531-8.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",,,,,

The two-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis (nonreducing followed by reducing conditions) of the DSS and BSOCOES cross-linked products revealed the specifically cross-linked bands to have Mr 40,000 and Mr 28,000.

None of 11 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients receiving the T101 monoclonal antibody demonstrated an antiglobulin response, whereas all four of the cutaneous T-cell lymphoma patients receiving the same antibody developed increased levels of antiglobulins. Three of nine malignant melanoma patients receiving the 9.2.27 monoclonal antibody showed an increase in antiglobulin titers. In patients developing antiglobulin responses, the response was rapid, typically being detectable within 2 weeks. The antiglobulins were primarily immunoglobulin G and, with the exception of a single melanoma patient in whom the response appeared to have a substantial 9.2.27-specific component (i.e., antiidiotype), were cross-reactive with most murine immunoglobulin G preparations tested. This pattern of results suggested that the antiglobulin was a secondary immune reaction with elevation of the levels of preexisting antiglobulin which was cross-reactive with the mouse antibody administered.

In all these cases, chromosome abnormalities were observed in 5-day PHA-stimulated cultures. Four cases had characteristic marker chromosomes; two were due to a balanced translocation, t(9;21), and two to a simple deletion, 5p-. The other four cases, however, had rather complicated chromosome abnormalities, e.g., 1q+, 2q+, 5q+, 6q-, 14q+, 10p-. When chromosome abnormalities were analyzed in previously reported cases, the abnormalities were mostly distributed among chromosomes #1, #2, #5, #6, #14, and #21. These findings suggest that the abnormalities involving #1, #2, #5, #6, #14, and #21 are intimately related to ATL. The SCE frequency was in the normal range in ATL cells. Cell cycle analysis revealed that the duration of two cell cycles in cells labeled with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) required approximately 80 hr in ATL cells, whereas the time of two cell cycles in normal cells is 40 hr. These findings indicate that the ATL cell cycle time is about 40 hr, about double that of normal cells (20 hr), in PHA-stimulated cultures. ATL has been known to be a mature T cell leukemia and to respond poorly to chemotherapy. The latter may be due to the elongated cell cycle or to the mature characteristics of the leukemic cells.

[3H]Triamcinolone acetonide (TA)-receptor complexes were purified (approx. 30-fold) from DEAE-cellulose columns by salt elution which allowed receptor activation only in the absence of molybdate. Addition of 10 mM molybdate completely blocked salt activation. The binding pattern of the activated [3H]TA-receptor complexes to chromatin-cellulose extracted with 0-8 M guanidine hydrochloride revealed three regions of increased binding activity (acceptor sites), at 2, 5 and 7 M guanidine hydrochloride. Acceptor site binding was markedly reduced for chromatin extracted with 3, 6 and 8 M guanidine hydrochloride. Non-activated receptor complexes demonstrated very low binding to deproteinized chromatin. It was also shown that chromatin binding required glucocorticoid receptors and that free ligand or ligand bound to other proteins did not bind significantly to chromatin. In addition, binding of [3H]TA-receptor complexes to partially deproteinized chromatin was competable by unlabeled TA-receptor complexes. Scatchard analysis demonstrated that chromatin from non-differentiating BCL1 cells possesses multiple, high-affinity binding sites which differ in their affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor. Partially deproteinized chromatin from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BCL1 cells demonstrated a different pattern of receptor binding, i.e., receptor binding was significantly greater to chromatin previously extracted with 6-8 M guanidine hydrochloride. These results suggest that differentiation alters the state of chromatin and the interaction of non-histone protein/DNA acceptor sites with glucocorticoid receptors. These alterations may play a role in the acquisition of hormone resistance.","['Ruh, M F', 'Singh, R K', 'Bellone, C J', 'Ruh, T S']","['Ruh MF', 'Singh RK', 'Bellone CJ', 'Ruh TS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Molybdenum/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Steroid/*metabolism', 'Triamcinolone Acetonide/*metabolism']",1985/01/18 00:00,1985/01/18 00:01,['1985/01/18 00:00'],"['1985/01/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/18 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(85)90229-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(85)90229-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1985 Jan 18;844(1):24-33. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(85)90229-0.,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '81AH48963U (Molybdenum)', 'F446C597KA (Triamcinolone Acetonide)']",,,,,

Sensitization of control mice with irradiated semisyngeneic B16 melanoma cells (H-2b) resulted in protection against subsequent challenge with viable B16 cells, in contrast to sensitization of either W/Wv or Sl/Sld mice. The involvement of serotonin in antitumor resistance was studied by employing 2 serotonin active drugs: reserpine, that depletes mast cells of serotonin; and methysergide, a serotonin antagonist. Sensitization of BDF1 mice with irradiated B16 cells and sensitization of DBA/2 mice (H-2d) with irradiated SL2 cells (H-2d) resulted in protection against subsequent challenge with viable B16 cells and viable SL2 cells, respectively. Treatment with either reserpine or methysergide resulted in a decreased protection. Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) footpad responses to allogeneic L5178Y (H-2d) tumor cells in C57BL/6 mice showed a biphasic reaction pattern, similar to that found in DTH responses to simple reactive haptens, such as picryl chloride. Moreover, the early swelling responses were also dependent on T cells and on mast cells. BDF1 mice carrying a semisyngeneic L5178Y tumor on the chest showed an early swelling response after footpad challenge but no late response, possibly indicating that selective down regulation of the late component of DTH was associated with progressive tumor growth in these animals. The biphasic patterns of DTH to both tumor cells and picryl chloride and the T cell and mast cell dependence of both antitumor resistance and DTH to tumor cells suggest that T cell-dependent activation of mast cells to allow entry of mononuclear leukocytes into sites of tumor growth is similar to the mechanism that occurs in DTH.","['Van Loveren, H', 'Den Otter, W', 'Meade, R', 'Terheggen, P M', 'Askenase, P W']","['Van Loveren H', 'Den Otter W', 'Meade R', 'Terheggen PM', 'Askenase PW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics', 'Hypersensitivity, Delayed/genetics/immunology/physiopathology', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L5178/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*physiology', 'Melanoma/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Serotonin/*physiology', 'Species Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Feb;134(2):1292-9.,"['0 (H-2 Antigens)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)']",,"['AI-11077/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-12211/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-17555/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,

The predominant feature of the malignant bone marrow cells was strong reactivity with antibody 3A1, which stains the majority of normal T-cells and is apparently present on all T-ALL cells. In addition, a less intense binding was observed with antibody 4F2, which reacts with activated or rapidly dividing cells, and antibody 10.2, which reacts with all thymocytes and most peripheral T-cells. Most other antibodies with a wide variety of specificities were not reactive or, in the case of a few anti-T-cell antibodies showed, by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis only weak staining on some cells. Sequential bone marrow studies in one patient, before and during treatment with chemotherapy, revealed a reduction of 3A1-positive cells, concordant with a decrease of malignant cells in the marrow. When involved lymph nodes, peripheral blood, or marrow were studied, similar reactivity patterns were found in all locations.

Under normal conditions, AIF suppresses colony and cluster formation by an Ia-antigen-positive cycling subpopulation of mouse granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (CFU-GM). Under the same conditions, the release of AIF-inhibitory activity and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulatory factors (GM-CSF) from an Ia-antigen-positive subpopulation of monocytes and macrophages is suppressed by LF. Within one to two days after inoculation in vivo with Friend virus complex or helper virus, mouse CFU-GM become insensitive in vitro to suppression by purified human AIF as well as crude mouse AIF, and by four days, bone marrow, spleen, and thymus cells of these mice release much greater quantities of AIF-inhibitory activity than the cells from mice injected with control medium. The Friend virus complex itself has no influence in vitro on CFU-GM from normal mice. In addition, the release of AIF-inhibitory activity from bone marrow, spleen, and resident peritoneal cells and the release of GM-CSF from resident peritoneal cells of mice infected with Friend virus complex are not suppressed by LF. The inability of AIF to suppress colony formation by bone marrow and spleen CFU-GM from mice infected with Friend virus complex is associated with the loss of Ia (I-A subregion) antigens from CFU-GM, even though CFU-GM are in cycle. The nonresponsiveness of bone marrow, spleen, and peritoneal cells from these mice to LF suppression of AIF release and the inability of LF to influence GM-CSF release from peritoneal cells is associated with loss of Ia antigens from these cells. The above abnormalities are similar to the defects noted using cells from patients with leukemia. These results suggest that mice infected with Friend virus complex can serve as a model for investigating abnormalities in cell regulation and their relationships to disease progression.","['Lu, L', 'Broxmeyer, H E', 'Moore, M A', 'Sheridan, A P', 'Gentile, P']","['Lu L', 'Broxmeyer HE', 'Moore MA', 'Sheridan AP', 'Gentile P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Ferritins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*analysis', 'Lactoferrin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Lactoglobulins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*pathology', 'Lipoproteins/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', '*Proteins']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83727-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1985 Jan;65(1):91-9.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Lactoglobulins)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '77538-12-6 (colony inhibiting factor)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)']",,"['CA-23528/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,

Double-fluorescent staining for the myeloid-specific antigens VIM-2 and VIM-D5 in combination with specific antiserum for TdT suggested a mixed leukemic cell population consisting of a morphologically, cytochemically, and immunologically promyelocytic component (80%) and a lymphoid, TdT+ component (20%) that was myelomonocytic in morphology but otherwise without any evidence of nonlymphoid nature. Fluorescent-activated cell analysis revealed that a greater number of cells reacted with monoclonal anti-T antibodies (OKT3, OKT6, and OKT11) than could be identified as lymphoid by TdT expression. As confirmed by double-staining fluorescence microscopy, a large fraction of the promyelocytic leukemia cells were biphenotypic, expressing both myeloid and lymphoid markers (50% positive for VIM-D5 and OKT6, 30% positive for VIM-D5 and OKT3). Subsequently, in vitro differentiation experiments were performed. While treatment of the cells with GCT-conditioned medium favored proliferation, with only a weak and delayed promotion of the cells towards maturation as reflected by enhanced expression of the mature T-marker T3 but persistent expression of the thymocyte antigen, exposure to all-trans and 13-cis retinoic acid resulted in marked differentiation of both the myeloid and the lymphoid cell characteristics. Retinoid treatment resulted in the loss of TdT, a partial disappearance of the T6-antigen, and the expression of the late T cell antigen T3 by almost 70% of the cells. In addition, myeloid maturation was obvious from the morphologic appearance of the cells, as well as from the expression of the OKM1-associated antigen by a majority of the cells. This report concerns a unique case of APL in which, for the first time, a coexistence of promyelocytic and lymphoid elements was detected, with exposure of the cultured leukemic cells to retinoic acid inducing maturation along both the myeloid and the lymphoid lineage.","['Paietta, E', 'Dutcher, J P', 'Wiernik, P H']","['Paietta E', 'Dutcher JP', 'Wiernik PH']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Culture Media', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*metabolism', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/pathology', 'Granulocytes/*pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83729-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1985 Jan;65(1):107-14.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Culture Media)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",,['P30 CA13330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,

One was B cell growth factor (BCGF), which activated antigen-stimulated B cells to proliferation and clonal expansion, and the other was its inhibitory factor, arbitrarily named B cell growth inhibitory factor (BIF). This BIF inhibited the effect of BCGF on anti-mu-stimulated B cells or the monoclonal mature B cell line (CLL-T.H.) obtained from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of B cell-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, which were activated only with BCGF and without adding other proliferating stimuli (e.g., anti-mu). BIF activity was detected in the 24 hr culture supernatants of Con A-activated human PBM in FCS containing medium and also in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. This substance with BIF activity could not be derived from FCS. Con A-induced BIF (m.w. of 80,000 and an isoelectric point of pH 5.4) was analyzed by Sephadex G-200 gel filtration and chromatofocusing. BIF was stable at pH 2.0 and at 56 degrees C for 30 min. Partially purified BIF had no effect on cell viability and almost no interferon activity (less than 1 IU/ml). BIF with high titer had a slight but significant inhibition on TCGF-dependent T cell growth and on PHA or Con A responses, but the extent of these inhibitions was far less than that of BCGF-dependent B cell growth. Absorption of BIF with Con A blasts made its inhibition on T cell growth even less. On the other hand, BIF activity could not be absorbed with Con A blasts but was almost absorbed with large numbers of CLL-T.H. cells. BIF had almost no inhibitory effect on the proliferation of a mouse fibroblast cell line (NIH 3T3), a mouse myeloma cell line (NS-1), human lymphoid cell lines (MOLT-4, HSB-2, and Daudi), or a human myeloid cell line (K-562). BIF-producing cells were estimated to be T cells and were identified as T8+ T cells. On the other hand, Con A-induced BCGF was demonstrated to be produced predominantly by T4+ T cells. These results show that human B cell proliferation is regulated by interaction between T4+ and T8+ cells via soluble factors, namely BCGF and BIF, respectively.","['Kawano, M', 'Iwato, K', 'Kuramoto, A']","['Kawano M', 'Iwato K', 'Kuramoto A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Concanavalin A', 'Growth Substances/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphokines/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/immunology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Jan;134(1):375-81.,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,,

Only a narrow cell dose range was effective. Injection of larger cell numbers not only failed to induce immune reconstitution but also resulted in the development of resistance to subsequent treatments. Only mature T cells, but not thymocytes, could induce nude mouse T cell development. Lymphoblasts from one patient with acute T cell leukemia consistently immune-reconstituted nude recipients. These cells were completely unable to produce IL 2 in vitro. In contrast, the IL 2-producing T cell line Jurkat was ineffective, indicating that the abilities to produce IL 2 and to induce nude mouse T cell development are independent. In an extension of earlier models of the nude mouse immune defect, two distinct T precursor cell pools are proposed as the major components of an extrathymic differentiation pathway. As an adequate trigger of differentiation, interaction with thymus-processed T cells guides the development of precursors in the first cell pool towards populating the second IL 2-responsive pool of T precursor cells.","['Dosch, H M', 'White, D', 'Grant, C']","['Dosch HM', 'White D', 'Grant C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Interleukin-2/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude/*immunology', 'Palatine Tonsil/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/radiation effects/transplantation', 'Thymus Gland/immunology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Jan;134(1):336-42.,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",,,,,

Inhibition required intact granulocytes, was proportional to the number of granulocytes present, and was independent of granulocyte adherence, phagocytic function, and viability. Equivalent numbers of enriched normal or leukemic peripheral T lymphocytes did not cause inhibition of 51Cr release, and preincubation of granulocytes with effectors did not significantly alter viability or cytotoxic function.

Inhibition of leukemic colony formation was produced by FC from normal subjects and patients with acute leukemia. While the degree of inhibition by FC from patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia was almost the same as that by those from the normal subjects, that by FC from patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia was lower than that by those from normal individuals. Both conditioned media obtained from FC and contact of their FC with LCF-C in dishes for four hr inhibited leukemic colony formation.

The group as a whole functioned poorly on tasks involving speeded performances and long-term memory. The age at diagnosis, the duration of the illness, the cranial irradiation and/or intrathecal-chemotherapy did not show any negative effects on the intellectual performance. Psycho-social adaptation was satisfactory: our patients do not show neurotic or psychotic disorders, but only affective disturbances (insecurity, irritability, poor self-perception, instability and depression). Familial adaptation was disturbed in 60% of the children and difficulty in socializing with peers was present in 57% of cases: the latter, in our experience, is related to poor self perception, present in 75% of our patients. We have found a more inadequate psycho-social adaptation in children who have not received any communication of their illness.

The incidence of leukemia in inoculated animals was approximately 100% and mean survival time was 10.9 +/- 2.1 days. The L801 is of myelocytic type which has been determined by cytological, cytochemical, pathological and ultrastructural observations. Its karyotype was hypodiploid, characterized by modal number of 39, loss of Y chromosome and an abnormal huge marker chromosome. The cell cycle duration of the L801 was 16 h. C-type viral particles were observed under the electron-microscope. The L801 was sensitive, to varying extents, to various anti-tumor agents.

Proliferation of the cells was triggered by medium conditioned by acute myelocytic leukemic cells exposed to 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA). The medium was designated as TPA-treated cell conditioned medium (TPACCM). The cycle of events in fetal bone marrow cell culture began with a sharp decrease in the total number of cells. At this juncture a predominance of primitive macrophage-like cells positive for macrophage markers was present in the culture. The process of multiplication began with rapid proliferation of promyelocytes. Simultaneous proliferation of granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colony forming cells (CFC) indicated that at least some of the promyelocytes might act like CFC. The absolute number of committed CFC then increased 5-11 fold, the number that approximated a total multiplication of FBM cells. The proliferation continued with the culture containing some blast cells and showing simultaneous differentiation of the cells into mature granulocytes and macrophages. The cells with macrophage markers persisted throughout the culture period. To determine more precise definition of the role of primitive macrophages and promyelocytes in FBM cell multiplication, experiments with purified fractions of these cells have to be done. TPACCM purification and isolation of active substances is also suggested.

The 105 cases were classified into the groups M1-M6 according to the FAB proposals. The NaF-sensitive isoenzyme was not detected in cases of FAB groups M1/2 (acute myeloblastic leukemia without or with maturation), group M3 (acute promyelocytic leukemia) or group M6 (erythroleukemia). Thirty-one out of 33 cases in the FAB group M4 (acute myelomonocytic leukemia) and 9/9 cases in FAB group M5 (acute monocytic leukemia) expressed the NaF-sensitive isoenzyme. The NaF-sensitive isoenzyme was found at different staining intensities; all M5 cases showed the isoenzyme at strong or very strong intensity, whereas most of the M4 cases displayed the isoenzyme at weak, medium or strong staining intensity. The data presented are further evidence that the presence of the NaF-sensitive esterase isoenzyme indicates monocytic involvement or differentiation in cases of myeloid leukemias.

It appears from this information that it is possible to detect somatic, cytogenetic, and genetic effects resulting from exposures at 33 to 100 times the mpc's for HTO. Similar effects also result from exposure to external gamma rays at an equivalent dose. The reduction in bone marrow cells in animals maintaining normal total cellularity is of interest since it demonstrates both the presence of an effect at the primitive cell level and the animal's ability to compensate for this effect by recruiting stem cells from the G0 resting state. This evidence of damage together with the observed cytogenetic changes leads one to contemplate the possible importance of radiation exposures at these levels for the induction of leukemia or other blood dyscrasias. Studies to investigate this question are now under way. As predicted on the basis of established principles of radiobiology, exposure to tritium beta rays from HTO ingestion results in measurable effects on several animal systems. The importance of position of incorporation of H into molecules of biological importance has not been well defined, nor have the low-dose portions of the dose-response curve for several effects of interest. Experiments designed to address these questions and measure H turnover as a means for analysis of cell kinetics in several systems are now under way.","['Carsten, A L']",['Carsten AL'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/radiation effects', 'Cell Nucleus/radiation effects', 'Growth/radiation effects', 'Liver Regeneration/radiation effects', 'Longevity/radiation effects', 'Maximum Allowable Concentration', 'Mice', 'Mutation/radiation effects', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Reproduction/radiation effects', 'Sister Chromatid Exchange/radiation effects', 'Tritium/metabolism/*toxicity']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1985.tb20834.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1985;459:258-68. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1985.tb20834.x.,['10028-17-8 (Tritium)'],,,,,

A retrospective clinical study is presented, including 159 patients treated in 11 French institutions and 1 German institution (AML: 99 patients; MDS: 38 patients). The study confirms the efficacy of low dose AraC, especially in elderly patients with hypoplastic AML. Although, less severe than with high dose chemotherapy, toxicity needs regular monitoring. The mechanism of action cannot be ascertained by this clinical study, however half of the complete remissions were obtained with no bone marrow aplasia.

A higher frequency of more mature myeloid cells was noted with increasing concentrations of the inducing agents up to the optimal dose limits for cell viability, and with longer post-induction incubation periods. The highest percentage of polymorphs was obtained at 8 days post-induction with 1.25% DMSO and after 6 and 8 days exposure to 90 mM DMF. A proportion of polymorphs showed non-sex specific drumstick-like nuclear appendages, which were morphologically similar to the sex-specific drumsticks found in polymorphs from normal females in vivo. The correlation between the nuclear lobe counts and the frequencies of drumstick-like appendages in polymorphs was also similar to that reported for drumsticks in blood cells in vivo. The various stages of terminal differentiation and nuclear appendage formation in polymorphs under induced differentiation were similar to those occurring in vivo. Chromosomal analyses of this cell line indicated that individual cells had lost one X chromosome, and no portion of the missing X was detected in any of the rearranged chromosomes. Since no truly sex-specific drumsticks appeared to be present in the polymorphs of this cell line containing only one X chromosome, the study supports the accepted notion that there is a correlation between drumstick frequency and the presence of one versus two X chromosomes.","['Mukherjee, A B', 'Czirbik, R J', 'Parsa, N Z', 'Testa, J R']","['Mukherjee AB', 'Czirbik RJ', 'Parsa NZ', 'Testa JR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytobios,Cytobios,0207227,IM,"['*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*pathology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/pathology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Dimethylformamide/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Time Factors', 'X Chromosome/pathology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cytobios. 1985;44(176):109-18.,"['8696NH0Y2X (Dimethylformamide)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,

The tumors studied were blood cell malignancies induced by Friend leukemia virus in SJL/J mice, spontaneous mammary neoplasms in RIII/Imr and C3H/OuJ mice, and spontaneous lymphocytic leukemia in AKR/J mice. A transplantable tumor, Lewis lung carcinoma, in C57BL/6J mice was used as a nonvirally induced control model. The nor-MDP was dissolved in saline and made into an emulsion with an equal volume of squalene-Arlacel A and injected subcutaneously at 1- to 2-month intervals. Test and control mice were challenged with exogenous virus or tumor transplant 2 weeks after a second injection of nor-MDP. Administration was started at around 2 months of age in mice that develop spontaneous neoplasms. Electron microscopy studies were done on neoplastic tissues of selected test and control mice. This administration of nor-MDP prevented erythroleukemia in SJL/J mice caused by low doses of Friend leukemia virus (although erythroleukemia survivors were not protected from a late-developing lymphoma) and also delayed (possibly prevented) the development of a spontaneous mammary neoplasm in RIII/Imr mice. No antitumor effects were observed on the spontaneous neoplasms of C3H/OuJ and AKR/J mice or on the Lewis lung carcinoma implanted into C57BL/6J mice. Electron microscopic examinations of the various neoplastic tissues indicated that nor-MDP administration eliminated or reduced extracellular viruses.

These cells express HLA-DR molecules but the HLA-DQ antigens are undetectable. In this paper we study the expression of HLA-DR and HLA-DQ antigens, using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), on normal cells of the myelomonocytic lineage: the common myelomonocytic progenitor (CFU-GM) and the monocytes, by techniques of inhibition of CFU-GM growth and double immunofluoroscence, respectively. The results show that HLA-DR and HLA-DQ antigens are differentially expressed on normal myelomonocytic cells. While HLA-DR molecules are expressed on CFU-GM and on the majority of peripheral blood monocytes, HLA-DQ antigens are not expressed on CFU-GM and only present on a subpopulation of monocytes. This data further confirms that HLA-DR and HLA-DQ molecules are coded by different genes with independent regulation of the gene expression not only on myeloid leukaemias but also on normal cells of the myelomonocytic lineage.","['Alonso, M C', 'Navarrete, C', 'Solana, R', 'Torres, A', 'Pena, J', 'Festenstein, H']","['Alonso MC', 'Navarrete C', 'Solana R', 'Torres A', 'Pena J', 'Festenstein H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Tissue Antigens,Tissue antigens,0331072,IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'HLA-DQ Antigens', 'HLA-DR Antigens', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', '*Histocompatibility Antigens Class II', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/*immunology']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1399-0039.1985.tb02229.x [doi]'],ppublish,Tissue Antigens. 1985 Nov;26(5):310-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0039.1985.tb02229.x.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA-DQ Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",,,,,

M4 and M5B leukaemia cells had chemotactic responsiveness to zymosan-activated serum comparable to that of normal monocytes, but M5A cells were different from them in lacking apparent chemotactic responsiveness to the factor. Lymphadenopathy and leucocytosis were more prominent in the patients whose leukaemia cells were capable of migration than in those not having such cells.

Current aggressive treatment protocols have improved patient survival but produce extended periods of profound neutropenia during which the patients are particularly susceptible to opportunistic infections. Candida and Aspergillus species are the most common of the fungi causing invasive infections in these patients. In a group of 77 previously untreated children with acute myelogenous leukemia begun on treatment from March 1976 to June 1984, four patients developed localized fungal infections of the lung. These initially appeared as pulmonary infiltrates on chest roentgenograms during periods of severe neutropenia (three during remission induction and one after intensive consolidation therapy). Endobronchial cultures failed to identify the infectious organism in all cases. Computerized axial tomography best defined the cavitary nature of the lesions in 2 patients. All four patients underwent surgical resection, both to establish a diagnosis (three patients) and as part of therapy. There was no operative morbidity. The organisms involved were Aspergillus (2), Torulopsis (1), and Penicillium (1). Three patients were cured of their fungal infections. The fourth patient failed to enter remission and died of a cerebral fungal abscess that developed shortly after thoracotomy. We report these cases to encourage early surgical intervention in leukemics with a localized pulmonary process consistent with a fungal infection. Resection of the primary focus obviates the risk of life threatening pulmonary hemorrhage or dissemination of the fungus and allows for early reinstitution of chemotherapy which is vital to these patients' survival.","['Shamberger, R C', 'Weinstein, H J', 'Grier, H E', 'Levey, R H']","['Shamberger RC', 'Weinstein HJ', 'Grier HE', 'Levey RH']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aspergillosis/surgery', 'Candidiasis/surgery', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/mortality', 'Leukopenia/complications', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/complications/mortality/*surgery', 'Male', 'Penicillium', 'Pneumonectomy']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022346885001300 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3468(85)80052-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 1985 Dec;20(6):840-4. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3468(85)80052-x.,,,,,,

The binding of human recombinant interferon IFN-alpha A to the undifferentiated and differentiated HL-60 cells was investigated. Within 2 days after the addition of DMSO or retinoic acid to growing HL-60 cells, the binding of IFN-alpha A to treated cells increases significantly relative to its binding to untreated cells. The difference in binding of IFN-alpha A between the treated and untreated cells continues to increase for at least 3 days. Analysis of binding curves of IFN-alpha A to neutrophil-like and promyelocytic HL-60 cells leads to the conclusion that the increased binding of [125I]IFN-alpha A to neutrophil-like cells is primarily the result of an increase in the number of binding sites on these cells.","['Langer, J A', 'Pestka, S']","['Langer JA', 'Pestka S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Interferon Res,Journal of interferon research,8100396,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neutrophils/metabolism/pathology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jir.1985.5.637 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Res. 1985 Fall;5(4):637-49. doi: 10.1089/jir.1985.5.637.,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,

The results indicate that the disturbance of intellectual functioning is produced in ALL children irradiated after 5 years of age. In order to check on a possible delayed intellectual deterioration, all ALL children were also tested twice, with one year interval between the two tests.

In both cell lines, the lectin induces agglutination (measured by counting the number of aggregates as well as the number of cells in each aggregate) and decrease of growth (measured by counting the number of cells and the incorporation of tritiated thymidine into TCA-precipitable material per 10(6) cells). The agglutination and the decrease of growth are produced at the doses of 0.5 and 1 microgram/ml of culture medium and after 4 h of exposure of cells to the lectin, respectively. These effects increase progressively with higher doses of lectin and continues throughout the culture. However, the REH line is less sensitive than the LHN13 line to the effects of lectin. Both agglutination and growth decrease of REH as well as LHN13 cell lines by the lectin are reversible; this is confirmed by the fact that the monospecific anti-Robinia lectin serum suppresses these effects.","['Sharif, A', 'Driancourt, C', 'Billard, M', 'Rosenfeld, C', 'Goussault, Y', 'Bourrillon, R']","['Sharif A', 'Driancourt C', 'Billard M', 'Rosenfeld C', 'Goussault Y', 'Bourrillon R']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Cancer Biochem Biophys,Cancer biochemistry biophysics,7506524,IM,"['Agglutination', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lectins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Plant Lectins', 'Reference Values', 'Seeds/analysis', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Biochem Biophys. 1985 Dec;8(2):143-52.,"['0 (Lectins)', '0 (Plant Lectins)', '0 (Robinia lectin)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,

Replacement of the 3-hydroxyl of T-2 with hydrogen caused a 24-fold decrease in activity, whereas acetylation resulted in a 500-to 1,000-fold decrease. Protection of the 3-hydroxyl with a tetrahydropyranyl moiety gave an analog that was 37-fold more inhibitory to Vero than to mouse erythroleukemia cells; with the other analogs a similar effect on protein synthesis was found for both types of cells. The analogs obtained after alkaline hydrolysis were much less potent than the parent trichothecenes. The 3-tetrahydropyranyl-modified analog was equivalent in potency to T-2 tetraol, while the deoxygenated species was at least threefold less potent. All T-2 analogs caused some degree of polysome ""runoff,"" thereby demonstrating that these species inhibit protein synthesis at the chain initiation stage when added at their 50% infective dose concentrations or lower. From these results, we suggest that the 3-hydroxyl moiety is essential for T-2 to exhibit such high activity on eucaryotic cell protein synthesis and that modification at the C-3 position decreases but does not eliminate this activity.","['Ehrlich, K C', 'Daigle, K W']","['Ehrlich KC', 'Daigle KW']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Appl Environ Microbiol,Applied and environmental microbiology,7605801,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Kidney', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Polyribosomes/drug effects', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'T-2 Toxin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",1985/10/01 00:00,1985/10/01 00:01,['1985/10/01 00:00'],"['1985/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/aem.50.4.914-918.1985 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Environ Microbiol. 1985 Oct;50(4):914-8. doi: 10.1128/aem.50.4.914-918.1985.,"['0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '34114-99-3 (T-2 tetraol)', 'I3FL5NM3MO (T-2 Toxin)']",,,PMC291768,,

To assess the role of the long terminal repeats (LTRs) in influencing the neurological disease, we constructed another chimeric MuLV (pNEMO-1)m harboring the gag-pol-env from Cas-BR-E MuLV and the LTR region from the strongly T-cell tropic Moloney MuLV. Although the Cas-BR-E MuLV induced mainly nonthymic leukemia, pNEMO-1 MuLV induced a thymic form of leukemia, as the parental Moloney MuLV. The pNEMO-1 MuLV induced neurological diseases less frequently than Cas-BR-E MuLV when inoculated intraperitoneally into NIH/Swiss, SIM.S, and SWR/J mice. However, it induced neurological disorders more frequently and with a shorter latency than Cas-BR-E MuLV when inoculated intrathymically. Most mice with a neurological disorder induced with pNEMO-1 MuLV showed a new clinical syndrome not usually seen with the parental Cas-BR-E MuLV: They had no lower limb paralysis but were excessively tremulous, spastic, and immobile. The topographical distribution of the spongiform degeneration in the brain of mice with this new syndrome was different from that seen in mice with lower limb paralysis induced by Cas-BR-E MuLV. These results indicate that the 1.0-kilobase-pair Cla I-Pvu I LTR-containing fragment harbors sequences influencing the incidence and the clinical manifestation of the neurological disease and suggest a specificity of LTR sequences for a new tissue (brain).","['DesGroseillers, L', 'Rassart, E', 'Robitaille, Y', 'Jolicoeur, P']","['DesGroseillers L', 'Rassart E', 'Robitaille Y', 'Jolicoeur P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Brain Diseases/genetics/*microbiology/pathology', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Paralysis/genetics/*microbiology/pathology', 'Plasmids', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.24.8818 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Dec;82(24):8818-22. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.24.8818.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,PMC391529,,

The breakpoint on chromosome 9, q34, appears to be cytogenetically identical in both malignancies and is the site of the cellular oncogene c-abl. We investigated the role of c-abl in cells from two patients with the t(6;9) using in situ chromosomal hybridization, Southern hybridization, and in vitro phosphorylation. We showed that c-abl is not translocated from chromosome 9, resulting in a breakpoint that is on the 3' side of this gene. The t(6;9) translocation does not appear to result in the production of an aberrantly sized protein product or in the acquisition of in vitro tyrosine kinase activity. This is in direct contrast to the findings in chronic myelogenous leukemia, in which c-abl is translocated, leading to the production of a structurally altered c-abl protein with activated tyrosine kinase. Lastly, we demonstrated that the cells of one patient contain sequences from chromosome 9 inserted at the junction of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 4 and 10 on the 4q+ chromosome. This insertion, which is at least 100 kilobase pairs in length, represents a duplication and translocation of the protein coding region of c-abl.","['Westbrook, C A', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Diaz, M O', 'Groffen, J', 'Rowley, J D']","['Westbrook CA', 'Le Beau MM', 'Diaz MO', 'Groffen J', 'Rowley JD']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, 4-5', '*Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.24.8742 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Dec;82(24):8742-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.24.8742.,['EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)'],,['CA 16910/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC391513,,

The identification of the reaction product as LTC4 was confirmed by its identical retention time on reverse-phase HPLC to that of synthetic LTC4, the incorporation of [3H]glutathione into the product, its reactivity in a radioimmunoassay, and its UV absorption spectrum. In contrast, glutathione S-transferase activity, measured spectrophotometrically with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, was detected predominantly in the 105,000 X g supernatant (89%) and also in the microsomes (7%). The microsomal glutathione S-transferase and LTC4 synthetase were solubilized with 0.4% Triton X-102 and separated by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography; the former appeared in the effluent and the latter in the eluate after the addition of 0.16 M NaCl to the equilibration buffer. Solubilized, microsomal glutathione S-transferase was inhibited by S-hexylglutathione with an IC50 of 36 microM and was stable at 40 degrees C for 5 min, whereas LTC4 synthetase was only slightly inhibited (IC50, 2.3 mM) by S-hexylglutathione and retained no activity after incubation at 40 degrees C for 5 min. The partially purified LTC4 synthetase showed a specific activity of 1.34 +/- 0.51 nmol of LTC4 per 10 min per mg of protein (mean +/- SD, n = 9), representing a 10-fold purification from the sonicate and catalyzed the dose- and time-dependent production of LTC4 from LTA4 and glutathione. The apparent Km values for LTA4 and glutathione were estimated by Lineweaver-Burk plots to be 5-10 microM and 3-6 mM, respectively. These results indicate that the conjugation of LTA4 with glutathione to form LTC4 is catalyzed by a unique microsomal enzyme.","['Yoshimoto, T', 'Soberman, R J', 'Lewis, R A', 'Austen, K F']","['Yoshimoto T', 'Soberman RJ', 'Lewis RA', 'Austen KF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/enzymology', 'Cell Line', 'Glutathione Transferase/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Microsomes/enzymology', 'Rats', 'Solubility']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.24.8399 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Dec;82(24):8399-403. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.24.8399.,"['EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 4.4.1.20 (leukotriene-C4 synthase)']",,"['AI-22531/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-22563/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-31193/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC390923,,

It is shown that the presence of either of these antigens in the diffusion chambers can induce differentiation in MGI+D+ mouse and human myeloid leukemic cells, and that pre-immunization with antigen enhanced this in-vivo differentiation.

In order to ascertain the significance of this finding, we studied by the same methods normal human erythroblasts harvested from methylcellulose cultures of fetal liver and adult blood, and murine and human erythroleukemic cells (MEL and HEL) as well as K562, cultured with and without chemical inducers of erythrodifferentiation. Three band patterns recognizable as similar to that of K562, but distinctive from those of myeloid and lymphoid cells, were noted of cells of erythroblastic origin. Both HEL and MEL, as well as the normal erythroblasts, exhibited heaviest labeling of band a in contrast to K562, which exhibited heaviest labelling of band d. Relative labelling of band b and d of HEL and MEL increased following treatment with 50 mu hemin or 4 mM hexamethylenebisacetamide (HMBA), respectively. Treatment of K562 with hemin, however, resulted in increased band a. Thus, among hemopoietic cells, an isozymic cAMP binding protein pattern has been identified which is characteristic of the erythroid lineage.

Both models were mimicking the pattern of leptomeningeal infiltration observed in the respective human leukemias. These animal models provide reproducible systems in which the determinants of metastatic capacity and their therapeutic implications for ALL and AML can be studied.","['Hoogerbrugge, P M', 'Hagenbeek, A']","['Hoogerbrugge PM', 'Hagenbeek A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Animals', 'Central Nervous System/*pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Meninges/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(85)90128-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(85)90128-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1985;9(11):1397-404. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(85)90128-6.,,,,,,

Vitamin A derivatives demonstrate differentiation-inducing activity both in vitro and in vivo on promyelocytic leukemic cells. We tested the ability of 13-cis retinoic acid to reduce proliferation and induce differentiation in 10 samples from patients with acute non-promyelocytic leukemia. DNA synthesis and leukemia colony formation were affected to varying degrees by a prolonged exposure to the vitamin A compound. Morphologically and cytochemically no differentiation was determined either after 48 h in suspension cultures or 7 additional days in semi-solid cultures. Alkaline leukocyte phosphatase, a biochemical marker of differentiation, was significantly increased in five samples. DNA synthesis in these samples was significantly reduced as compared to samples failing to express alkaline leukocyte phosphatase following 13-cis retinoic acid treatment. DNA synthesis of these same 5 samples was also strongly inhibited by Ara-C. Expression of alkaline leukocyte phosphatase following 13-cis retinoic acid exposure may be a useful indicator for cells amenable to 13-cis retinoic acid or Ara-C treatment.","['Hofmann, V', 'Berens, M E', 'Moreillon, M C', 'Cogoli, M', 'Fruh, U', 'Merchant, R E', 'Kistler, G']","['Hofmann V', 'Berens ME', 'Moreillon MC', 'Cogoli M', 'Fruh U', 'Merchant RE', 'Kistler G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/blood', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Isotretinoin', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukocytes/enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tritium']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(85)90124-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(85)90124-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1985;9(11):1367-71. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(85)90124-9.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'EH28UP18IF (Isotretinoin)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,

The antigen was not detected on normal blood or bone marrow cells, or on any of the eleven haemopoietic cell lines tested.

In contrast, the antigen was not detected on cells in any of the 32 lymphoid leukaemic specimens tested, or on cells from four patients with chronic granulocytic leukaemia in accelerated chronic phase. In the ANLL group, expression of the antigen usually occurred on cells from types M1 or M2 according to the F.A.B. classification, and appeared to be associated with an unfavourable response to chemotherapy. The antigen was removed from the cell surface by digestion with pronase, and was re-expressed after 24 h in culture. Re-expression was prevented by the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, but not by tunicamycin which inhibits glycosylation.

The disease began as a subtype M4 with atypical eosinophils according to the French-American-British (FAB)-classification. At the time of the first relapse, the phenotype had converted into an M2-subtype, while the second relapse presented the picture of an M1-type of acute myeloid leukemia with non-granulated peroxidase-positive blasts. When the third relapse occurred, the diagnosis was again an M4-type of acute myeloid leukemia. The observed changes of the phenotype can be interpreted as an expression of tumor cell heterogeneity, even though the observed emergence of new leukemic clones would be attributed entirely or in part to effects of the applied cytostatic drugs, because tumor cell heterogeneity concerns also the response to therapy, which may result in a growth advantage for certain leukemic subpopulations. In so far, AML behaves like all other human malignant neoplasias. In addition, morphological changes in leukemias such as are reported here, have been observed long before the introduction of cytostatic drugs. Also, the validity of the FAB-classification is discussed in the light of the presented observation. It is concluded that the FAB-classification is not a classification in a strict sense, but merely a crude and simplistic list of subtypes of acute myeloproliferative diseases that is difficult to reproduce and that disregards major aspects of this group of diseases, for instance tumor cell heterogeneity.","['Mlynek, M L', 'Mahmoud, H K', 'Leder, L D']","['Mlynek ML', 'Mahmoud HK', 'Leder LD']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Wochenschr,Klinische Wochenschrift,2985205R,IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*genetics', 'Male', 'Phenotype']",1985/11/04 00:00,1985/11/04 00:01,['1985/11/04 00:00'],"['1985/11/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/04 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02291095 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Wochenschr. 1985 Nov 4;63(21):1129-33. doi: 10.1007/BF02291095.,,,,,,

It was shown that sensitive cells of c-WRT-7 cells changed remarkably into macrophage-like cells, which lost the growth potential by LPS-treatment, whereas such change and growth inhibition in insensitive cells of c-WRT-7 were not so remarkable by LPS-treatment. Although the sensitive cells were extremely malignant in vivo, the sensitive cells treated with LPS in vitro lost the transplantability into the syngeneic rats. The sensitive cells by injections of LPS developed morphologically into macrophage-like cells in diffusion chamber i.p. in syngeneic rat. Injections of LPS inhibited the progression of leukemia in 60% of the rats which had been inoculated with the sensitive cells, whereas the leukemia-development was inhibited in only 20% of the rats which had been inoculated with the insensitive cells and i.p. treated with LPS. Daunomycin, Aclacinomycin A and Vincristine induced phagocytic activities in c-WRT-7 cells, whereas Actinomycin D and Cycloheximide showed no such effects. Daunomycin in combination with LPS increased the number of phagocytic cells, whereas cycloheximide inhibited the LPS induced phagocytosis. Injections of LPS in combination with Daunomycin inhibited doubtlessly the leukemia-development in rats which had been i.p. inoculated with the sensitive cells, compared to the injections of LPS or Daunomycin alone. In conclusion, it is suggested that the effects of LPS and Daunomycin on the inhibition of the leukemia-development could be associated in part with their differentiation-inducing activities.","['Fujii, Y']",['Fujii Y'],['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi,[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science,17410290R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*administration & dosage', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi. 1985 Sep;60(5):735-47.,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,

K562 cells were treated with the mutagen methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and, to select for resistant mutants, rabbit anti-idiotypic (anti-id) antibodies were used. This anti-id was raised to a monoclonal antibody 9.1C3 which itself blocked lysis by NK cells by binding to the effector cells; the anti-id inhibited killing by binding to the K562 targets, presumably to a cell surface protein relevant to a secondary event in the NK lytic pathway. MMS-derived mutants showed a heterogeneity of staining with the anti-id, allowing the antibody to be used with flow cytometry to select a population of K562 cells relatively negative in antigen expression. The degree of reactivity of K562 cultures with the anti-id antiserum and the resistance to lysis by NK cells were inversely related. Cultures of NK-resistant K562 cells with low expression of the anti-id structure were cloned by limiting dilution: 96 clones were analyzed and one subclone, C9/2, which was six-to sevenfold less sensitive to lysis than the parental K562 cell line, was used in further studies by cold target inhibition and single cell binding assays. The increased resistance to lysis of C9/2 was not due to a reduced expression of target recognition structures, and resistance could not be overcome by prolonging the time allowed for lysis to 18 hr nor by adding exogenous recombinant leukocyte interferon. Killing of the NK-resistant variant was inhibited by mannose-6-phosphate but not by the monoclonal antibody against which the anti-id antibody was raised. It is therefore suggested that the structure on the K562 cells recognized by the anti-id antibodies is a novel secondary receptor which is important in the later stages of the NK cell cytolytic cascade.","['Werkmeister, J A', 'Triglia, T', 'Burns, G F']","['Werkmeister JA', 'Triglia T', 'Burns GF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*physiology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Separation', 'Clone Cells/immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', '*Mutation']",1985/04/15 00:00,1985/04/15 00:01,['1985/04/15 00:00'],"['1985/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(85)90070-X [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(85)90070-x [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1985 Apr 15;92(1):123-33. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(85)90070-x.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)']",,,,,

No other responses were found in the remaining patients, which included eight with refractory anemia with excess blasts. In six patients drug toxicity necessitated termination of the trial. Four patients had unexpected drug-induced thrombocytopenia; three of these had low platelet counts before treatment. Two of the six patients had other toxic effects. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the effectiveness of 13-cis-retinoic acid in patients with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. At moderate doses significant toxic effects, including thrombocytopenia, are not uncommon.","['Greenberg, B R', 'Durie, B G', 'Barnett, T C', 'Meyskens, F L Jr']","['Greenberg BR', 'Durie BG', 'Barnett TC', 'Meyskens FL Jr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,IM,"['Anemia, Refractory/drug therapy', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Isotretinoin', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",1985/12/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1985 Dec;69(12):1369-74.,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EH28UP18IF (Isotretinoin)']",,['CA-27502/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,

They are cytotoxic in vitro with a high selectivity for neoplastic cells which, in contrast to normal cells, lack an alkyl-cleavage enzyme to degrade the adsorbed ALP molecules. As ALP accumulates, it interferes with normal membrane phospholipid turnover and eventually causes disruption of membrane integrity. To evaluate the potential value of ALP in eliminating leukemic cells from remission marrows prior to autologous transplantation, we tested the effect of various ALPs on the clongenicity of normal human marrow cells and on promyelocytic leukemia HL-60. A remarkable difference in the dose response to ALP of normal marrow cells an HL-60 was observed. After an incubation period of 24 h, the same inhibition of clonogenicity in HL-60 occurred at ALP concentrations 4 times lower than in normal marrow cells. Reducing the exposure time to 6 h enhanced the selectivity further: whereas HL-60 colonies were nearly completely inhibited at 16 micrograms ALP/ml, more than 50% of normal CFU-c and BFU-E were recovered after incubation with 48 micrograms/ml. No further increase in selectivity was achieved by changing the incubation temperature. Both thioether- and alkyl-analogues were active and no difference was observed between methoxy- and acylamino-substituted ALPs. We conclude that this selective cytotoxicity makes ALP compounds worth further study as purging agents in autologous bone marrow transplantation programs.","['Dulisch, I', 'Neumann, H A', 'Lohr, G W', 'Andreesen, R']","['Dulisch I', 'Neumann HA', 'Lohr GW', 'Andreesen R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Lysophosphatidylcholines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Lysophospholipids', 'Mice', '*Phospholipid Ethers', 'Phospholipids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00320725 [doi]'],ppublish,Blut. 1985 Dec;51(6):393-9. doi: 10.1007/BF00320725.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lysophosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)']",,,,,

Individual neutral glycosphingolipids containing one to four sugars were purified by a combination of the following methods: diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex column chromatography, acetylation-Florisil column chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography using an Iatrobead column. Compounds with one sugar were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography on borate plates. This analysis showed that HL-60 cells synthesize only glucosylceramide, whereas K562 and KG1 cells synthesize predominately glucosylceramide, but also a small amount of galactosylceramide. Compounds with two to four sugars were characterized by treatment with exo- and endoglycosidases. The results showed that K562 and KG1 cells are similar to cells from patients with acute leukemia in expressing two series (globo and neolacto) of natural glycosphingolipids, whereas the HL-60 cells are similar to mature human myeloid cells in expressing only one series (neolacto).

The precision of the irradiation technique is of vital importance, i.e. the occurrence of recurrences on the central nervous system during complete remission after skull irradiation are preponderantly due to a defective irradiation technique. The important factors are a daily reproducible positioning and fixation of the head in an irradiation mask and the adjustment within three dimensions by means of a laser light system. Only cobalt-60 gamma radiation or the ultrahard photons of a linear accelerator with an energy of 4 to 6 MV should be applied. The irradiation is performed with laterally opposite, coplanar and coaxial fields in an isocentric adjustment. The field shape is regulated by individual absorbers adjusted under visual control in a defined position to the patient on a plexiglas plate at the therapy simulator. In order to guarantee an homogeneic dose also to the meninges situated at the field borders and to prevent a ""geographic miss"", the field borders should exceed the cranial calotte by 1 to 2 cm at the frontal, vertical and occipital side. At the base of the skull, special consideration must be given to a sufficient irradiation of the retrobulbar spaces, the frontal meninges situated in the region of the lamina cribrosa and the temporal meninges situated in the region of the deep inner cranial fossae. The dose specification is made in the central ray in the center of the skull. Generally single doses of 2 Gy and weekly doses of 10 Gy are applied. The total dose depends on age, risk group, and treatment aim. Recent studies indicate that in case of simultaneous intrathecal administration of methotrexate, the single dose can be reduced from 1.8-2.0 Gy to 1.2-1.5 Gy and the total dose from 24 Gy to 18 Gy without any unfavorable effect on the rate of recurrences at the central nervous system and the survival rate. Within the scope of an aggressive combination therapy, this self-restraint of the radio-therapeutist is of great importance with regard to acute and chronic complications in the brain and the growing skeleton.","['Thiel, H J']",['Thiel HJ'],['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Strahlentherapie,Strahlentherapie,1260024,IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Skull']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Strahlentherapie. 1985 Nov;161(11):653-62.,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],Methodik der Strahlenbehandlung des kindlichen Gehirnschadels bei Leukosen.,,,,

Although one nucleotide change was found in V beta X MT1-1, the possibility of polymorphism was not excluded. These results indicate that the frequency of somatic mutation in the V beta gene of the T-cell receptor is 1/10th or less than that in the immunoglobulin gene. Both alleles of the rearranged T-cell receptor gene were analyzed for ATL12 and MT-1. In both, only one of the two rearranged J beta alleles was an active variable-diversity-joining (V-D-J) complex.

Prediction of phenotype of acute phase transformation.,1093-8,"Thirty-nine patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph1) chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) were monitored using cytofluorometry and cytogenetics. During chronic phase, abnormal populations could be detected using commercially available monoclonal antibodies. Most of these abnormal populations had either an HLA.DR+ or an OKM1+ HLA.DR- phenotype. Thirteen patients progressed to acute phase disease. Five patients with HLA-DR+ abnormal cells during chronic phase showed no clonal evolution detectable using standard cytogenetic techniques and underwent lymphoid transformation. Seven patients with OKM1+-HLA.DR- abnormal cells exhibited chromosomal abnormalities in addition to the Ph1 and progressed to a myeloblastic acute phase. One patient with HLA.DR+ OKM1+ 63D3+ abnormal cells in chronic phase showed clonal evolution and progressed to a myelomonocytic acute phase. These results suggest that cell surface markers on chronic phase cells can be used in conjunction with cytogenetic monitoring to predict the phenotype of cells involved in the acute transformation of CML. B cells (6, 13), but not T cells (18), bearing the Ph1 have been isolated from chronic phase CML patients. Thus cells other than those of myeloid lineage may be involved. Periodic cytogenetic monitoring has been shown to detect clonal evolution (i.e. genetic changes in addition to the PH1) in as many as 75% of patients prior to the acute phase (14, 37). However, neither cytogenetic changes nor morphologic analysis appear to predict the lymphoblastic type of transformation (14). Since fluorescence analysis of cell surface markers has shown reduced numbers of normal cells (28), the identity of the 'abnormal' cells was probed with antibodies recognizing a variety of markers on immature and mature lymphoid and myeloid cells. Not only were significant numbers of abnormal cells detected in the peripheral blood of chronic phase patients, but the phenotype of the abnormal population, in combination with cytogenetic analyses, predicted the type of blasts involved in acute phase disease.","['Ligler, F S', 'Brodsky, I', 'Schlam, M L', 'Fuscaldo, K E']","['Ligler FS', 'Brodsky I', 'Schlam ML', 'Fuscaldo KE']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(85)90097-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1985;9(9):1093-8. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(85)90097-9.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",,,,,

Among 234 consecutive patients with a leukocyte count of 100 X 10(9)/L or greater at diagnosis, the frequency of early death was significantly higher in those with ANLL (23% v 5% for patients with ALL, P less than .001). The risk of early death increased with increasing leukocyte count, especially when it exceeded 300 X 10(9)/L in patients with ANLL (P less than .001). Intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in eight (11%) of the ANLL patients and accounted for six of the 17 early deaths; in all but two instances, the complication was associated with coagulopathy. Respiratory failure, presumably from pulmonary leukostasis, resulted in six other early deaths in ANLL patients. By contrast, intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in only two of the ALL patients (1.2%); both had normal coagulation studies, but leukocyte counts greater than 400 X 10(9)/L. Severe metabolic derangements from blast cell lysis accounted for three of the eight early deaths among patients with ALL. Leukapheresis or exchange transfusion effectively lowered the leukocyte counts of all 15 patients who received the procedures.

Human peripheral blood lymphocytes depleted of adherent cells were incubated for 4 hr with unlabeled K562 cells at an effector cell (EC) to TC ratio of 2:1. After incubation, the EC were separated from the TC via centrifugation over a single-step Percoll gradient. K562-treated and separated EC were subsequently shown to be unable to lyse fresh K562 TC when retested in the standard chromium-release assay. Kinetic studies revealed that greater than 90% inactivation of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) could be achieved within 2 hr. Inactivation of NK-CMC by K562 was not caused by a specific loss of NK cells, as detected by changes in the expression of two NK cell-associated markers, Leu-7 and Leu-11, or to alterations in EC viability and target binding cell capacity. Interestingly, NK inactivation also occurred in medium devoid of extracellular calcium, although parallel testing of NK-CMC in the same medium resulted in no chromium release. NK inactivation, however, was significantly prevented when the EC and TC were co-incubated at 4 degrees C, or in medium without magnesium. Additional studies revealed that inactivation of NK-CMC could be achieved with another NK-sensitive, but not with an NK-resistant TC. Overall, we demonstrated that NK cells rapidly lost their lytic potential after direct interaction with a sensitive TC, although the cells remained viable, expressed the same percentage of Leu-7 and Leu-11, and could still bind the TC; and NK inactivation occurred in the absence of extracellular calcium, but not when EC and TC were incubated in medium without magnesium. These latter results provide evidence for an early event in the activation of human NK cells that is binding dependent, temperature sensitive, and independent of extracellular calcium.","['Brahmi, Z', 'Bray, R A', 'Abrams, S I']","['Brahmi Z', 'Bray RA', 'Abrams SI']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Calcium/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cold Temperature', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Dec;135(6):4108-13.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,

Busulfan treatment resulted in only a limited effect, mainly consisting in a reduction of the number of nucleated cells in the peripheral blood. Even under busulfan treatment, however, the relative blast count in marrow and peripheral blood increased, indicating that most blast cells were not susceptible to the action of busulfan. The total survival time of the dog was 94 days, including 24 days from hospitalization and diagnosis until euthanasia in a moribund state. Based on the assessment of morphological abnormalities in leukaemic cells and of mitotic indices in bone marrow smears, it is tentatively concluded that the acute myeloblastic leukaemia in this dog arose in the pluripotent haematopoietic stem cell compartment giving rise to the formation of erythrocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils and monocytes as well as megakaryocytes and that the proliferation rate of cells of the myeloblastic clone was decreased, although an increase in the size of the potentially dividing compartment might have occurred.","['Keller, P', 'Sager, P', 'Freudiger, U', 'Speck, B']","['Keller P', 'Sager P', 'Freudiger U', 'Speck B']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,J Comp Pathol,Journal of comparative pathology,0102444,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Dog Diseases/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Dogs', 'Erythrocytes/cytology', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/pathology/*veterinary', 'Reference Values']",1985/10/01 00:00,1985/10/01 00:01,['1985/10/01 00:00'],"['1985/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0021-9975(85)90031-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0021-9975(85)90031-3 [doi]']",ppublish,J Comp Pathol. 1985 Oct;95(4):619-32. doi: 10.1016/0021-9975(85)90031-3.,,,,,,

The method is based on a symmetry of self-renewal exhibited by sister cells of the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line -HL60-. This permits the use of one of the sister cells to measure the potential for self renewal of the other. Using a system of sequential daughter cell transfers in semisolid medium, we have analysed self-renewal and differentiation in individual clones exposed to all-trans retinoic acid or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). We find that in clones exposed to chemical inducers of differentiation commitment occurs as an all-or-none event which is preceded by coordinated but reversible losses of self-renewal potential.

In four cases marrow aspiration was inadequate and in five cases it was unsatisfactory. In two other cases hypoplastic AML was diagnosed, the aspirate in one suggested hypercellularity and in another it was unsatisfactory. Trephine biopsy was superior to aspiration for the evaluation of fat and marrow cellularity, pattern and extent of blast cell infiltration, homogeneity of the leukaemic infiltrate, frequency of mitoses, residual haemopoietic activity and presence of inflammatory cells. Of the various features studied in the sections, the presence of an increased number of plasma cells and considerable myelodysplasia (MD) appeared to be unfavourable prognostic features. We conclude that trephine biopsies are essential for the diagnosis of hypoplastic AML and are most useful when marrow aspiration is either inadequate or unsatisfactory.

The distributions per cell were significantly different among these 3 groups (P less than 0.0001). The 15 patients with B-cell disease had a median of 3.2 X 10(3) sites per cell. At the time of analysis, remission induction data are available for most of these patients. Within the early pre-B- group 291 patients with a median receptor number of 9.9 X 10(3) achieved remission, while 13 with a median receptor number of 4.8 X 10(3) did not. These distributions were significantly different (P = 0.034). Within the pre-B- and T-cell groups the distributions of receptor numbers for responders and non-responders were not significantly different.

This preparation increased tritiated thymidine incorporation into DNA of HL-60 cells markedly, an effect which was found to be attributable in large part to greater thymidine accumulation in the intracellular nucleotide triphosphate pool. A modestly expanded population of DNA synthetic phase cells was also demonstrated by flow cytometry. Similar effects were noted of the K562 and KG-1 cell lines and were also demonstrable with giant cell tumor-conditioned medium. These effects were not demonstrable with a purified preparation of granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulated factor. Because of the altered pattern of nucleotide metabolism noted, the effect of the conditioned medium concentrate upon 5-fluorouracil sensitivity was tested. Following continuous 24-h exposure to 5-fluorouracil at 5 X 10(-6) M, tritiated thymidine incorporation of HL-60 cells increased in parallel with depletion of endogenous thymidylate. Conditioned medium concentrate markedly sensitized cells to this effect of 5-fluorouracil and also increased growth retardation, cytotoxicity, and cell cycle arrest as assessed by flow cytometry. These studies thus demonstrated marked effects of a factor in conditioned medium on deoxynucleotide uptake and metabolism of the HL-60 line. These effects occurred in conjunction with, but were relatively more marked than, effects upon cell cycle distribution and were found to influence chemotherapy sensitivity.","['Elias, L', 'Wood, A', 'Crissman, H A', 'Ratliff, R']","['Elias L', 'Wood A', 'Crissman HA', 'Ratliff R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorouracil/*pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Monocytes/*physiology']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Dec;45(12 Pt 1):6301-7.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Growth Substances)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",,['P41-RR01315-01A1/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,

Two neutral GSLs, ceramide monohexoside and ceramide dihexoside, and two molecular species of gangliosides, one being the ganglio-series ganglioside NeuAc(alpha 2-3)Gal(beta 1-4)Glc-Cer (GM3) and the other being the lacto-series sialosylparagloboside, were predominant in the granulocytic cells at an early maturation stage. During the granulocytic differentiation of CML cells, the contents of ceramide dihexoside and paragloboside increased strikingly with a concomitant decrease in ceramide monohexoside, and the total amount of neutral GSLs increased to about three times as much as that of the most immature granulocytic cells, myeloblasts. On the other hand, lacto-series gangliosides, with longer sugar moieties increased with a concomitant decrease in ganglio-series ganglioside GM3, and the ganglioside profile became more complex. The total content of ganglioside increased in parallel with the complexity of the ganglioside profile. Similar differentiation-associated changes were also found in GSL composition during the in vitro granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. However, a marked difference between the differentiation-dependent change in the GSL composition of CML cells and that of HL-60 cells was observed for a ganglioside species which was found to be one of the major gangliosides in normal neutrophils: in the former, the ganglioside level increased up to the level in normal mature granulocytes as the cells differentiated; in contrast, it decreased significantly during granulocytic differentiation of the latter cells. When the GSL composition of the neutrophils obtained from CML cells, which were apparently normal as to morphology, stimulus-induced membrane potential changes, and superoxide-producing capacity, was compared with that of normal neutrophils, an obvious difference was observed between them, especially with regard to ganglioside GM3; the amount of ganglioside GM3 in the former was about one-sixth of that in the latter.

The other clinically studied analogue, idarubicin (4-demethoxydaunorubicin), has shown clinical activity in leukemias and in breast tumors also when given p.o.

The first is represented by the irreversible DNA binding derivatives and is exemplified by the highly potent cyanomorpholino analogues. The second is based on the finding that certain structural modifications, such as in the 6-deoxy derivatives, are accompanied by resistance to enzymic reductive deglycosidation, a reaction that converts the anthracyclines to inactive compounds in hypoxic conditions. The third line of investigation deals with the very lipophilic doxorubicin analogues, among which 4'-deoxy-4'-iododoxorubicin has been selected for further preclinical development because of the extended spectrum of activity also after p.o. administration and of the cytotoxicity exhibited on doxorubicin-resistant murine leukemia cells.","['Arcamone, F']",['Arcamone F'],['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['*Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Epirubicin', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin', 'Kinetics', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Naphthacenes', 'Solubility', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tissue Distribution']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Dec;45(12 Pt 1):5995-9.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'RMC41L2WQ3 (esorubicin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,

Intensive chemotherapy was given to 97 patients, and 78 underwent an early elective splenectomy. The overall median survival time, dated from hospital admission, was 39 months. Patient characteristics associated with shortened survival were age 60 years or older, black race, the presence of hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, symptoms, weight loss, and poor performance status. Adverse blood and bone marrow parameters were anemia, thrombocytosis or thrombocytopenia, a high proportion of peripheral blasts plus promyelocytes or of basophils, a high proportion of marrow blasts or basophils, decreased marrow megakaryocytes, and cytogenetic abnormalities in addition to the Philadelphia chromosome. Several of these factors were interrelated. A multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that the combination blood basophilia, race, additional cytogenetic abnormalities, age and marrow basophilia had the strongest predictive relationship to survival time. This resulted in a model segregating patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, with median survivals of 53, 39, and 25 months, respectively. Another model was derived that did not include the marrow features and identified splenomegaly and platelet counts as adding to the prognosis prediction by blood basophilia, race, and age. Evaluation of the effect of therapy, after adjusting for differences in prognostic characteristics, showed that intensive chemotherapy was associated with survival prolongation among patients at intermediate and high risk of death. We conclude that a combination of pretreatment factors identifies different risk subcategories in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and is helpful in assessing overall prognosis and treatment effect.","['Kantarjian, H M', 'Smith, T L', 'McCredie, K B', 'Keating, M J', 'Walters, R S', 'Talpaz, M', 'Hester, J P', 'Bligham, G', 'Gehan, E', 'Freireich, E J']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Smith TL', 'McCredie KB', 'Keating MJ', 'Walters RS', 'Talpaz M', 'Hester JP', 'Bligham G', 'Gehan E', 'Freireich EJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Basophils', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Body Weight', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Drug Combinations/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Risk', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)80967-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1985 Dec;66(6):1326-35.,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'COAP protocol', 'ROAP protocol']",,['CA 28153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,

Leukemic meningitis was present in one of these patients and later developed in four others. However, three patients with small numbers of lymphoblasts present but with low proportions of CALLA-positive CSF cells (less than 5%) subsequently had normal CSF examinations.

Lysosomal acid hydrolases, specially the unspecific acid esterase (EC 3.1.1.6) have been widely used to characterize and recognize this cell system. It was the aim of this study to further clarify the heterogeneity of the mononuclear phagocyte system using acid hydrolases and related typical intracytoplasmic structures, the lysosomes, as biochemical as well as immunological markers. The following results were obtained: 1. Human blood monocytes and their macrophage derivatives are characterized by an extraordinary isoelectric focusing pattern of the unspecific acid esterase, which could not be observed in all other normal human blood cells. 2. The monocyte specific isoelectric focusing pattern of unspecific acid esterase is also observable under neoplastic conditions: The typical pattern can be recognized in monocytic leukemias as well as in the permanent monocytic cell line U-937. 3. The isoenzymes of monocytic acid esterase as well as lysosomes of stimulated U-937 cell line are cell specific antigens: Polyclonal antisera raised against these structures recognize physiological functional forms, pathologic reaction forms, as well as neoplastic variants of the mononuclear phagocyte system applying immunohistochemistry. 4. The broad reactivity spectrum of polyclonal antibodies raised against lysosomes can be subdivided in different reactivity patterns by monoclonal antibodies. With the latter reagents it could be shown that monocytes not only differentiate in phagocytes but also in two populations of immune accessory cells thus mirroring the bipolarity of immune response as shown by T and B lymphocytes. The established biochemical as well as immunohistochemical markers open the possibility to characterize the different neoplasias originating from the mononuclear phagocyte system. Furthermore, it is hoped that the morphological as well as immunohistochemical heterogeneity is also paralleled by special functions expressed by the recognized subcohorts.","['Radzun, H J']",['Radzun HJ'],['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Veroff Pathol,Veroffentlichungen aus der Pathologie,7504167,IM,"['Acetylesterase/*analysis', 'Aged', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Isoenzymes/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology', 'Lysosomes/immunology', 'Macrophages/*enzymology/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*enzymology/immunology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Veroff Pathol. 1985;124:1-112.,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 3.1.1.6 (Acetylesterase)']",Immunhistochemie des menschlichen Mononuklear-Phagozytischen Systems.,,,,

The myeloid lineage of these cells was confirmed by the myeloperoxidase (MPO) reaction at electron microscopic level. The patient entered complete remission but relapsed one year later with blasts showing negative Sudan Black and MPO reactions. These cells were still TdT+ but J5 was now positive. This case points to the existence of a clonogenic leukaemic cell with potential for evolution in both myeloid and lymphoid lineages. This is also suggested by the reactivity of both types of blast cells with the McAb 3C5 which recognises an antigen present both on early myeloid and lymphoid precursors.

Many pathogens present initially with similar, nonspecific pulmonary findings. Air crescent formation has been reported to be highly suggestive of IPA in the appropriate clinical setting, but this is a late sign in an otherwise rapidly fatal infection. The authors reviewed the available chest computed tomography (CT) scans of nine patients with acute leukemia and documented IPA, including four patients with serial scans obtained during the course of infection. Typical CT findings of IPA were multiple inflammatory nodules, often with one large dominant mass, or a single peripheral masslike infiltrate. Cavitation or air crescent formation occurred late in the course of infection, usually at the time of bone marrow recovery from chemotherapy. CT scans obtained early in the course of infection in two patients demonstrated a distinctive feature of one or more pulmonary masslike infiltrates surrounded by a halo of low attenuation. These lesions subsequently progressed to cavitation or air crescent formation typical of IPA. While this CT halo sign may not be pathognomonic for Aspergillus, seen in the appropriate host, it may suggest early on the possibility of IPA.","['Kuhlman, J E', 'Fishman, E K', 'Siegelman, S S']","['Kuhlman JE', 'Fishman EK', 'Siegelman SS']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Radiology,Radiology,0401260,IM,"['Adult', 'Aspergillosis/complications/diagnosis/*diagnostic imaging', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Lung/*diagnostic imaging', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/complications/diagnosis/*diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1148/radiology.157.3.3864189 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiology. 1985 Dec;157(3):611-4. doi: 10.1148/radiology.157.3.3864189.,,,,,,

In recent studies, we obtained data that strongly suggested the involvement of an oncogene, c-abl, in this type of leukemia. This oncogene, normally located on chromosome 9, is translocated to chromosome 22 as a result of the Ph1 translocation. In addition, we identified a region on chromosome 22, the breakpoint cluster region (bcr), which contains the chromosomal breakpoint in all patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia who are positive for Ph1. Recent studies have suggested that the bcr is part of a gene that is truncated as a consequence of the Ph1 translocation. The deleted part of this gene could be replaced by c-abl sequences; to test this hypothesis we analyzed the RNA of five patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia.

Both the rates of globin RNA synthesis and the presence of DNase I-hypersensitive sites in hemin treated and untreated F-265 cells were investigated to identify the levels at which globin gene expression is controlled.","['Brewer, G', 'Hnilica, L S', 'Briggs, R C']","['Brewer G', 'Hnilica LS', 'Briggs RC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', '*Genes', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Heme/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Leukocytes', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00219384 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 1985 Sep;68(1):11-22. doi: 10.1007/BF00219384.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",,"['CA 37097/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM 07319/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,

The plasma pharmacokinetic and CSF influx of MTX and VDS were assayed after high dose systemic MTX with an intravenous bolus of VDS administered in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The MTX concentration was determined by enzymatic assay and VDS by radio immunoassay. No interrelation between these drugs was found.

Analyses of these data were adjusted for interlaboratory variability, time-related trends, and supplier effects. Two biologically significant effects were found: Male F344/N control rats receiving corn oil by gavage showed a higher (P less than .05) incidence of pancreatic acinar cell adenoma and a lower (P less than .001) incidence of leukemia (primarily mononuclear cell leukemia) than did the corresponding untreated controls. The increased incidences of pancreatic acinar cell adenoma seen in male rats administered corn oil by gavage were associated with elevated body weights observed in these animals relative to untreated controls. Female F344 rats and male and female B6C3F1 mice showed little or no evidence of a difference in tumor incidence between corn oil gavage-treated and untreated controls. A review of nearly 300 carcinogenesis studies done by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the NTP revealed that there were no corn oil gavage studies in which increased incidences of pancreatic acinar cell tumors or leukemia in male F344/N rats were the sole evidence of the carcinogenicity of a test chemical. Thus use of corn oil appears to have little impact on the interpretation of NCI-NTP carcinogenicity studies.","['Haseman, J K', 'Huff, J E', 'Rao, G N', 'Arnold, J E', 'Boorman, G A', 'McConnell, E E']","['Haseman JK', 'Huff JE', 'Rao GN', 'Arnold JE', 'Boorman GA', 'McConnell EE']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Corn Oil', 'Female', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*chemically induced', 'Oils/*toxicity', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Pharmaceutical Vehicles', 'Pituitary Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Sex Factors', 'Species Specificity']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/75.5.975 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1985 Nov;75(5):975-84. doi: 10.1093/jnci/75.5.975.,"['0 (Oils)', '0 (Pharmaceutical Vehicles)', '8001-30-7 (Corn Oil)']",,,,,

Treatment with a single ip dose of taumustine (40 mg/kg) resulted in a 130% increase in life-span for mice bearing P388 (intraperitoneal), a 93% increase for mice bearing L1210 (intraperitoneal), and an approximately 80% increase for mice bearing B16 melanoma (intraperitoneal). Repeated low doses (10 mg/kg) of taumustine promoted a 250% increase in life-span for mice bearing P388 (intraperitoneal), the absence of ascitic fluid from day 4 onward, and the presence of pulmonary emboli from day 5 onward. The inclusion of taurine (5 mM) in the culture medium of P388 cells in primary culture for 45 hours did not alter the cytotoxicity of taumustine, and pretreatment of the tumor-bearing host with taurine (250 mg/kg) in daily treatments with taumustine for up to 8 days did not interfere with antitumor activity (140-160% increased life-span). However, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with taurine abrogated neurotoxicity, intestinal necrosis, pulmonary emboli formation, and tail vein necrosis due to the administration of taumustine. The modulation by taurine of taumustine activity suggests that the combination of these agents offers an advantage of selectivity and host protection during chemotherapy.","['Pierson, H F', 'Fisher, J M', 'Rabinovitz, M']","['Pierson HF', 'Fisher JM', 'Rabinovitz M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Melanoma/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Taurine/*pharmacology']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/75.5.905 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1985 Nov;75(5):905-9. doi: 10.1093/jnci/75.5.905.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '1EQV5MLY3D (Taurine)', '98277-87-3 (taumustine)']",,,,,

Occurrence of second primary malignancies is serious late effect of cancer therapy. Concerning this problem two factors are important in children. Firstly, children with heritable embryonal cancers are predisposed to develop additional malignancies related and unrelated to therapy. Secondly, proportion of different parts of body of children is different from one of adults and normal tissues distant from the primary radiation field may receive surprisingly large dose of irradiation.

In comparison to the 4,392 children older than 1 year, entered on the same studies, infants had a significantly (P = .0001) increased incidence of leukocytosis, hepatosplenomegaly, meningeal leukemia at presentation, hypogammaglobulinemia, and failure to achieve complete remission (CR) status by day 14 of induction therapy.

Identical disease-free survival rates for infants were observed in each of the individual studies reviewed. Excessive toxicity resulting in limitation of therapy delivered was not a causative factor for the disappointing outcome of these patients. Rather, early disease recurrence, characterized by bone marrow relapse (55%) and CNS (22%) relapse, was the major factor responsible for the extremely poor prognosis of this patient group. Identical CNS relapse rates were observed in those patients who received cranial irradiation as part of CNS prophylaxis (21.8%) and in those patients who did not receive cranial radiotherapy (24%). Results of salvage therapy for patients who experienced systemic or extramedullary relapse were dismal. Debilitating neuropsychologic sequellae, presumably related to CNS irradiation, have been observed in 50% of the small number of long-term survivors.

The fact that this gene controls the replication of mink cell focus-inducing (MCF) viruses strengthens the case for these viruses playing a crucial role in the development of erythroleukemia, since failure to replicate MCF viruses results in resistance to early erythroleukemia. The expression of the Rmcfr gene is correlated with the constitutive expression of an MCF virus-related envelope glycoprotein that apparently blocks the receptor for MCF viruses, preventing their spread. Thus, the Rmcfr gene is either a structural gene for this unique protein, which can block the receptor for MCF viruses, or is a regulatory gene that controls expression of such a structural gene. Although the Rmcfr gene is clearly involved in resistance to the early erythroleukemia induced by F-MuLV, it appears to have no effect on the late myeloid, lymphoid or erythroid diseases that appear in DBA/2 and other strains of mice after injection of F-MuLV, consistent with data indicating that replication of MCF viruses is not required for the development of these late diseases. Our studies with congenic and backcross mice also indicate that, in addition to the Rmcfr gene, other genes of DBA/2 origin may contribute to resistance to F-MuLV-induced early erythroleukemia by mechanisms other than blocking the replication of MCF viruses.","['Ruscetti, S', 'Matthai, R', 'Potter, M']","['Ruscetti S', 'Matthai R', 'Potter M']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', '*Crosses, Genetic', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*microbiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C/*genetics', 'Mice, Inbred DBA/*genetics', 'Species Specificity']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.162.5.1579 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1985 Nov 1;162(5):1579-87. doi: 10.1084/jem.162.5.1579.,,,,PMC2187935,,

Second, the cell density must be maintained at 10(6) blasts/ml; this may be achieved by adding irradiated cells to smaller numbers of intact blasts. We are concerned with the mechanism of the feeding function. We present evidence that (a) cell-cell contact is required. (b) Blasts are heterogeneous in respect to their capacity to support growth. (c) Fractions containing membranes from blast cells will substitute for intact cells in promoting the generation of new blast progenitors in culture. (d) This membrane function may be specific for AML blasts, since membranes from blasts of lymphoblastic leukemia or normal marrow cells were inactive.","['Nara, N', 'McCulloch, E A']","['Nara N', 'McCulloch EA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Membrane/radiation effects/ultrastructure', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.162.5.1435 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1985 Nov 1;162(5):1435-43. doi: 10.1084/jem.162.5.1435.,,,,PMC2187933,,

We describe 6 adult patients with typhlitis and review the salient features of this condition. In typhlitis, a necrotizing process of multifactorial origin involves the right colon alone or the right colon and other areas of the intestine as well. Secondary colonization of mucosal ulcers by colonic flora commonly leads to septicemia and pyrexia. Typhlitis may be associated with a variety of clinical and radiographic findings. However, a high index of suspicion and certain constellations of clinical and radiographic findings may lead to an accurate presumptive diagnosis of typhlitis, followed by the institution of appropriate therapy. Notwithstanding, the short-term prognosis for typhlitis remains poor.","['Taylor, A J', 'Dodds, W J', 'Gonyo, J E', 'Komorowski, R A']","['Taylor AJ', 'Dodds WJ', 'Gonyo JE', 'Komorowski RA']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Gastrointest Radiol,Gastrointestinal radiology,7611134,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/complications', 'Colon/pathology', 'Enterocolitis, Pseudomembranous/complications/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiography', 'Thalassemia/complications']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01893133 [doi]'],ppublish,Gastrointest Radiol. 1985;10(4):363-9. doi: 10.1007/BF01893133.,,,,,,

The present study was undertaken to determine whether c3Ado would similarly inhibit MEL differentiation. The results demonstrate that c3Ado inhibits induction of MEL differentiation by dimethyl sulfoxide, hexamethylene bisacetamide, butyric acid, and diazapam. c3Ado blocks the appearance of the differentiated MEL phenotype by inhibiting both MEL heme synthesis and transcription of alpha- and beta-globin RNA. The inhibitory effect of c3Ado on MEL differentiation is concentration dependent, reversible, and potentiated by L-homocysteine thiolactone. Furthermore the AdoHcy/AdoMet ratio increases nearly 3.5-fold after 24 h of treatment with 50 microM c3Ado. In contrast, this c3Ado effect is not associated with polyamine depletion or cytostasis. These findings indicate that c3Ado blocks the induction of MEL differentiation at a transcriptional level and that this effect may be related to inhibition of AdoHcy hydrolase.","['Sherman, M L', 'Shafman, T D', 'Spriggs, D R', 'Kufe, D W']","['Sherman ML', 'Shafman TD', 'Spriggs DR', 'Kufe DW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adenosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/metabolism', '*Deoxyadenosines', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'S-Adenosylhomocysteine/analysis', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/analysis', 'Thionucleosides/pharmacology', 'Tubercidin/*pharmacology']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Nov;45(11 Pt 2):5830-4.,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '0 (Thionucleosides)', '037V4520IY (3-deazaadenosine)', ""634Z2VK3UQ (5'-methylthioadenosine)"", '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '979-92-0 (S-Adenosylhomocysteine)', 'EC 4.1.1.50 (Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'M351LCX45Y (Tubercidin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,

During continuous exposures of 48 h, vincristine and vinblastine were equitoxic with drug concentrations that inhibited proliferation rates by 50% of 7.6 and 8.1 nM, respectively. When cells were subjected to 4-h exposures and transferred to drug-free medium, the drug concentration of vinblastine that inhibited proliferation rates by 50% (1.1 microM) was significantly greater than that of vincristine (41 nM). Analysis by flow cytometry of the effects of equitoxic drug exposures on cell-cycle progression suggested that vincristine and vinblastine acted by the same mechanism (G2-M phase inhibition). [3H]Vincristine and [3H]vinblastine were bound to serum proteins in growth medium to the same extent (25%) over a wide range of concentrations, and the amounts of ""free"" extracellular drug did not decrease during prolonged exposures. Analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography of extracts of cultures incubated with growth-inhibitory concentrations of [3H]vincristine or [3H]vinblastine indicated little, if any, metabolism of either drug by cells or culture fluids; after 24 h, 85-95% of radioactivity was recovered from cells or growth medium as unchanged vincristine or vinblastine. At concentrations from 6 nM to 6 microM, vinblastine entered cells rapidly, reaching maximum levels within 0.5-2 h, and the relationship between maximal cell-associated drug and extracellular free vinblastine was linear. Although uptake of vincristine was slower than that of vinblastine, the cellular content of vincristine reached that of vinblastine during prolonged (12-24 h) exposures, and the amounts of cell-associated drug, relative to extracellular drug concentrations, indicated considerable ""concentrative"" accumulation (intra: extracellular ratios, greater than 100). When drug exposures were ended by transfer of cells to drug-free medium, vinblastine was released from cells more rapidly and to a greater extent than vincristine, independent of whether exposures were 4 or 24 h. Rates of uptake and release of vinblastine (50 nM) were unaffected by depletion of cellular adenosine triphosphate, suggesting that rapid release was not mediated by an energy-dependent efflux system.","['Ferguson, P J', 'Cass, C E']","['Ferguson PJ', 'Cass CE']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/analysis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Tritium', 'Vinblastine/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/*metabolism/pharmacology']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Nov;45(11 Pt 1):5480-8.,"['10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,

The ML-1 cells and in vitro normal mouse bone marrow cells were analyzed to determine if there was a differential sensitivity to X-ray-induced chromosome aberrations in G1 cells and/or differences in postirradiation cell cycle progression. Cells identified as being in G1 at the time of irradiation by their staining pattern after replication in 5-bromodeoxyuridine were analyzed for all types of chromosomal aberrations following X-ray doses of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 Gy. ML-1 cells showed a greater sensitivity to the induction of both chromosome-type aberrations (dicentrics and terminal deletions) and chromatid-type aberrations (exchanges and deletions) compared to normal mouse bone marrow cells, which only contained chromosome-type aberrations. The presence of chromatid-type aberrations in the ML-1 cells and not normal bone marrow cells suggested a differential progression through the cell cycle for the two cell types after irradiation. Mitotic index and flow cytometric analyses were performed and showed that both cell types have a delay in progression from G2 into mitosis, but only the normal mouse bone marrow cells have a delay in progression from G1 into S, as well as delayed progression through the S phase following X-irradiation. These results indicate that the ML-1 leukemia cells have an increased radiosensitivity. This may be due to a defect in their ability to respond to DNA damage as evidenced by their lack of a G1- and S-phase delay which allows normal cells an increased time to repair DNA damage before replication. These same characteristics have been observed in ataxia telangiectasia cells and may well represent a general feature of cells with increased radiosensitivity.","['Aardema, M J', 'Au, W W', 'Hand, R E Jr', 'Preston, R J']","['Aardema MJ', 'Au WW', 'Hand RE Jr', 'Preston RJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*radiation effects/ultrastructure', 'Cell Cycle/radiation effects', 'Cell Line', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/radiation effects']",1985/11/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Nov;45(11 Pt 1):5321-7.,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],,['NIH-GM 7438/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,

Both of these patients had an additional translocation involving chromosomes #9: t(7;9)(q22;q34) and t(9;17)(q34;q21), respectively.

A review of the chromosomal breakpoints involved in this series and in 185 cases of variant Ph translocations previously reported in the literature reveals that a disproportionately large number of breakpoints are located in light-staining regions of G-banded chromosomes. Furthermore, the breakpoints in simple variant translocations are more often located in terminal chromosomal regions, whereas, the breakpoints in complex translocations typically affect nonterminal bands. No obvious correlation was detected between variant Ph translocation breakpoints and either fragile sites, oncogene locations, or consistent chromosome breakpoints in other malignancies.","['Heim, S', 'Billstrom, R', 'Kristoffersson, U', 'Mandahl, N', 'Strombeck, B', 'Mitelman, F']","['Heim S', 'Billstrom R', 'Kristoffersson U', 'Mandahl N', 'Strombeck B', 'Mitelman F']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Fragile Sites', 'Chromosome Fragility', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogenes', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(85)90086-X [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(85)90086-x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1985 Nov;18(3):215-27. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(85)90086-x.,,,,,,

The combined analysis of the initial laboratory features and qualitative haematological abnormalities readily allowed the distinction between the different subgroups. Thirty-two of 79 cases (40.5%) evolved towards other diseases, frequently acute leukaemia (24/79, 30%), or transformed into other MDS (7/79, 9%). In five cases, initially classified as refractory anaemia (RA) or refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts (RAS), a transitory change to another type of MDS--two chronic myelomonocytic leukaemias (CMML), two refractory anaemias with excess of blasts (RAEB) and one refractory anaemia with excess of blasts 'in transformation' (RAEB-t)--was observed before the evolution towards acute leukaemia. This provides a new link between all these syndromes and increases the number of transitions to other MDS. Overall prognosis was very poor, with differences between subgroups. RA had the best prognosis whereas RAEB-t had the worst one. This study shows that the FAB classification is readily usable and defines well-characterized subgroups of MDS, although there are frequent transitional forms, and as the natural history of the MDS unfolds they may convert into another.

The mean phagocytic index of granulocytes from CML patients was similar to the normal value. NADPH activity decreased as the disease progressed. Thus, the amount of formazan produced was lower in granulocytes from patients in stage II (P less than 0.05) and stage III (P less than 0.01) than that produced by normal granulocytes.

Experiments were performed on inbred mice, genetically opposite to the disease induction, namely on highly sensitive BALB/c, resistant C57BL/6 and moderately sensitive BDFI animals. It is shown that RVE resistance is an immunologic phenomenon that results from the functioning of the antileukemic immune defence (ALID) aimed against the tumor-specific antigenic complex. Suppression of the ALID stems from autosuppression of the H-2 complex of the histocompatibility antigen system of T suppressors, which leads to the development of the onco-specific complex of autoimmune responses (OSCAR) and to the obligate development of RVE. The recovery of the ALID with OSCAR suppression and RVE regression is a consequence of the development of strictly specific antiidiotypic immune responses (antibodies AIT-anti-OSCAR).

In the human erythroleukemic cell line K562, TPA causes inhibition of cell growth, attachment to plastic dishes and a flat, irregular cell morphology. Accompanying these changes is a reduction in the expression of two cell surface glycoproteins, Gp-105 and glycophorin, which are specific to intermediate and late stages of erythroid cell development (Fukuda 1981). In this study, we found that TPA treatment leads to a reduction in the incorporation of [35S]-methionine into glycophorin which suggests that regulation occurs at the level of de novo biosynthesis. We also examined the effect of TPA on the biosynthesis of other cellular proteins. We found that TPA treatment leads to a de novo induction of two cytoskeletal proteins, vimentin and actin. To further examine the mechanism of action of TPA, we isolated RNA from K562 cells, translated it in vitro, and examined the products by immunoprecipitation. TPA was found to rapidly reduce the level of glycophorin mRNA activity; a 5-fold reduction was noted as early as 1 hour after TPA treatment. Concurrently, the level of vimentin mRNA activity increased. By hybridization of a human actin cDNA probe to K562 RNA, we also found that TPA treatment leads to a rapid induction of actin mRNA. These results suggest that some of the effects of TPA, including possibly tumor promotion, may be due to both positive and negative transcriptional regulation of specific genes.","['Siebert, P D', 'Fukuda, M']","['Siebert PD', 'Fukuda M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,IM,"['Actins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Glycophorins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Vimentin/biosynthesis/genetics']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1985;191:233-48.,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vimentin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,"['CA33895/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 33000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,

Cells were cultured for 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 days with inducer and then plated in medium containing methylcellulose without inducer. Daily following plating, hemoglobin content was scored by benzidine staining and growth was assessed by estimating cell number per colony. With all inducers used, three types of colonies were found, those containing only benzidine positive cells, those containing only benzidine negative cells, and those containing both benzidine positive and benzidine negative cells (mixed colonies). Thymidine produced a progressive increase in the percentage of positive and mixed colonies and a progressive fall in the percentage of negative colonies. Whereas negative colonies grew at an exponential rate with a generation time of about 20 hours, positive colonies reached an average maximum size of 16 cells, representing a total of four divisions. Butyrate had a similar effect except that the rise was greater for mixed colonies than for positive colonies and the plateau in positive colony size was less evident. In contrast, CO2 depletion or hemin treatment induced an increase in the fraction of cells staining benzidine positive which was lost rapidly upon removal of the inducing condition. Thus, of the four conditions, thymidine and butyrate caused commitment whereas hemin and CO2 depletion did not. Thus K562 cells, like Friend cells, demonstrate commitment, but, unlike Friend cells, demonstrate a significant rate of commitment in the absence of inducer and hence form a significant percentage of mixed colonies with or without inducer.","['Rowley, P T', 'Ohlsson-Wilhelm, B M']","['Rowley PT', 'Ohlsson-Wilhelm BM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,IM,"['Benzidines/metabolism', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1985;191:217-31.,"['0 (Benzidines)', '0 (Butyrates)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '2X02101HVF (benzidine)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,

In vitro studies revealed that catalytic activity requires the presence of calcium and phospholipids with a preference for phosphatidylserine. Diacylglycerol and tumour promoters such as phorbol esters bind to the enzyme, leading to its activation while sharply increasing its affinity for Ca2+ and phospholipid. Addition of diacylglycerol analogues or phorbol esters to intact cells results in the phosphorylation of specific polypeptides. Several cellular processes, including hormone and neurotransmitter release and receptor down-regulation, are modulated by the activation of protein kinase C, while phorbol ester-induced stimulation of the enzyme in whole cells has been associated with its translocation from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. Moreover, the use of Ca2+ ionophores has revealed an apparent synergism between Ca2+ mobilization and protein kinase C activation. This synergism has recently also been found to apply to receptor down-regulation (ref. 23 and accompanying paper). Here we describe a reconstitution system in which intracellular translocation of protein kinase C and the synergism between Ca2+ and enzyme activators can be studied. The results suggest a rationale for concomitant Ca2+ mobilization and diacylglycerol formation in response to some hormones, neurotransmitters and growth factors.","['Wolf, M', 'LeVine, H 3rd', 'May, W S Jr', 'Cuatrecasas, P', 'Sahyoun, N']","['Wolf M', 'LeVine H 3rd', 'May WS Jr', 'Cuatrecasas P', 'Sahyoun N']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Calcium/*pharmacology', 'Diglycerides/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Magnesium Chloride', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Synaptosomes/enzymology', 'Time Factors']",1985/10/10 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1985/10/10 00:00'],"['1985/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1985/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/317546a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1985 Oct 10-16;317(6037):546-9. doi: 10.1038/317546a0.,"['0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '02F3473H9O (Magnesium Chloride)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,

In group I (11 patients with ALL studied prospectively), VEP latency was increased in ten after cranial radiation (CR) as compared with previous values. Group II (18 patients with ALL in maintenance) and group III (16 patients with ALL off therapy) were studied retrospectively and VEP latency was found above normal limits in 33 and 31%, respectively. In group IV (four patients with solid tumors and six with leukemia, all of whom received no CR), VEP latency was normal despite periodical intrathecal methotrexate administrations to five of them.

Selections were made by step-wise augmentation to final drug concentrations of 10(-3)mM RA, 169mM (1.2%) DMSO and 0.12mM (20 micrograms ml-1) 6TG. In addition to growth resistance, cells in each sub-line displayed variable cytodifferentiation resistance to each of the 3 selective agents, which was quantitated as the ratio of the concentration of drug required to induce differentiation in 50% of the cells in each resistant sub-line versus comparably-passaged wild-type HL-60 cells. The levels of resistance/cross-resistance were as follows: RA-resistant (res) sub-line greater than 2700-fold to RA, 1.3-fold to DMSO and greater than 1.5-fold to hypoxanthine (HXN; the noncytotoxic purine base inducer analogue of 6TG); DMSO-res sub-line 2.5-fold to DMSO, 137-fold to RA and greater than 1.5-fold to HXN; and 6TG-res sub-line greater than 1.5-fold to HXN, 9-fold to RA and 1.6-fold to DMSO. These sub-lines were not cross-resistant to sodium butyrate (NaBut), a monocyte inducer, or to 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), a macrophage inducer. HL-60 sub-lines selected by exposure to a single high concentration of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BUdR; 3.3 X 10(-2)mM) or oubain (Ou; 5 X 10(-3)mM) were not or were slightly cross-resistant to either granulocyte or monocyte inducers. Although some variations in line/sub-line phenotype were observed, this was minor compared to the quantitative variations in response to individual inducing agents. The RA-res and 6TG-res sub-lines contained numerous double minute chromosomes (indicators of amplified genes) which were either absent or present in much smaller numbers in the parental wild-type cells or in the other drug-resistant sub-lines. There was little change or a decrease in the amplification level of the known amplified oncogene c-myc in the various drug-resistant sub-lines compared to wild-type HL-60 cells. These results (a) confirm that the neutrophilic granulocytic and monocytic/macrophagic differentiation programs in HL-60 cells are mechanistically different and separable; (b) suggest that both agent-specific and common quantitative alterations contribute to the mechanism(s) for resistance to granulocyte differentiation; and (c) suggest that the latter quantitative defects could be related to amplification of genes other than c-myc.","['Gallagher, R E', 'Bilello, P A', 'Ferrari, A C', 'Chang, C S', 'Yen, R W', 'Nickols, W A', 'Muly, E C 3rd']","['Gallagher RE', 'Bilello PA', 'Ferrari AC', 'Chang CS', 'Yen RW', 'Nickols WA', 'Muly EC 3rd']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine', 'Hypoxanthines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Oncogenes', 'Ouabain/pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thioguanine/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(85)90067-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1985;9(8):967-86. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(85)90067-0.,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Hypoxanthines)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '5ACL011P69 (Ouabain)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,['R01-CA34793/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,

Correlation with CFU-C and CFU-D.,1059-67,"This study describes changes in bone marrow stroma in murine acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The AML was induced in C57B1 mice by intravenous (i.v.) transfusion of C4198 myelogenous leukemic cells. In untreated leukemic mice, the colony-forming unit fibroblasts (CFU-F) were severely inhibited. In leukemic mice treated by three chemotherapy protocols of cytosine-arabinoside (Ara-C) and adriamycin there was a 200% increase in the life span as compared to untreated leukemic animals and marked reduction of marrow leukemic load. In these mice the stromal inhibition was temporarily relieved, expressed by peaks of CFU-F2-3 days following each protocol. In between the peaks, CFU-F decreased to subnormal levels, remaining low to the end of the disease. In normal mice administered a similar chemotherapy regimen, there were peaks of CFU-F activation after each protocol and normal levels in between the peaks. Granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (CFU-C) of leukemic-treated and normal-treated mice showed increased levels following each chemotherapy protocol. Whereas CFU-C decreased below normal levels in leukemic mice towards the end of the disease, the level of these progenitors remained high in normal mice receiving Ara-C and adriamycin. Colony-forming units in diffusion chamber (CFU-D) showed mild fluctuations in both leukemic and normal mice receiving three protocols of Ara-C and adriamycin. It is possible that despite treatment, the bone marrow stroma in leukemia becomes irreversibly deficient towards the end of the disease and cannot support the residual normal hematopoiesis.","['Ben-Ishay, Z', 'Prindull, G', 'Sharon, S', 'Borenstein, A']","['Ben-Ishay Z', 'Prindull G', 'Sharon S', 'Borenstein A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Diffusion', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Time Factors']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(85)90077-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1985;9(8):1059-67. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(85)90077-3.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,

The absolute rates for both processes were determined by simultaneously measuring incorporation into globin-specific transcripts and into the cellular nucleotide pool. The latter measurements provide a determination of the absolute rate of total RNA synthesis which declines during differentiation. Transcription from the beta major and beta minor globin genes was measured separately by hybridization to cloned DNA sequences from a region of the second intron which is highly divergent in the two genes. The results show that, during dimethyl sulfoxide-stimulated differentiation, transcription of alpha and beta major globin increases 15-25-fold, whereas beta minor globin transcription is not increased. Furthermore, in both undifferentiated and differentiated cells, the absolute rates of globin transcription are about equal to the rate of appearance of mature mRNA transcripts in the cytoplasm, indicating highly efficient processing of nuclear globin transcripts to mature mRNA before and after differentiation. The results indicate that dimethyl sulfoxide-induced accumulation of globin mRNA during differentiation is controlled almost entirely at the transcriptional level.","['Ganguly, S', 'Skoultchi, A I']","['Ganguly S', 'Skoultchi AI']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', '*Genes', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Uridine/metabolism']",1985/10/05 00:00,1985/10/05 00:01,['1985/10/05 00:00'],"['1985/10/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/05 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)39002-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1985 Oct 5;260(22):12167-73.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",,"['CA13330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16368/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,

In preliminary experiments, a brief exposure of leukemic marrow cells to IFN alpha resulted in a sharp increase in the IFN-induced enzyme 2-5A synthetase, indicating the expression of IFN cell receptors as well as the ability of leukemia cells to respond metabolically. Dose-response studies showed a dose-dependent suppression of myeloblast colony formation in all experiments using concentrations of 10(2)-10(5) U/ml of the three IFN subtypes. In self-renewal assays derived from the primary cultures that initially contained IFN alpha 2, a ""carryover"" antiproliferative effect was observed with a dose-dependent decline in secondary growth. In comparison studies of IFN alpha-A and IFN alpha-C, the suppressive effect on primary myeloblast growth was much more pronounced with IFN alpha-C at concentrations of 10(3) U/ml and higher; in self-renewal assays, the antiproliferative effect of IFN alpha-C on secondary growth was no longer observed, whereas that of IFN alpha-A persisted.

On the other hand, the erythroid differentiation could be linearly enhanced by increasing dosage of FCS, reaching a maximum after four days in culture. The wild-type K562 cells were also slightly stimulated to synthesize hemoglobin by adding FCS (30% final concentration). The enhancing effect of 30% FCS on the erythroid differentiation in the clone cells was greater than that of 12.5 microM hemin, while in the wild-type cells the relationship was reversed. There were no effects of erythropoietin (Epo) on the hemoglobin synthesis in either the clone cells or the wild-type cells. When various kinds of sera were added to the standard culture of the clone cells, only FCS had the enhancing effect.

Report of 64 cases].,1599-606,"64 second neoplasms, occurring after therapy of malignant tumors or leukaemia in childhood, came to light in the course of a collaborative group investigation. Most frequent initial diseases were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n = 19), Morbus Hodgkin (n = 9), and retinoblastoma (n = 8), whereas osteosarcoma (n = 13), cancer of the thyroid (n = 10) and acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia (n = 8) were predominant among the second malignant neoplasms. In 36 of 50 irradiated children there was a clear relationship between the localisation of the second neoplasm and the earlier irradiated zone. In other cases, in particular in children with retinoblastoma as initial disease or neurofibromatosis, genetic influences on the origin of the second neoplasms come into question. The preponderance of Morbus Hodgkin after acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n = 7) must be regarded as extraordinary; in 6 of the 7 children the second neoplasm appeared after a very short interval. A distinct effect of previous treatment with cytostatics on the occurrence of second neoplasms was not seen. The differing time intervals between the occurrence of the first and the second neoplasms in the separate subgroups point toward heterogenous causes being involved in the development of second neoplasms.","['Gutjahr, P']",['Gutjahr P'],['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),0006723,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/epidemiology/pathology/therapy', '*Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Osteosarcoma/epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Retinoblastoma/epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/epidemiology/pathology/therapy']",1985/10/18 00:00,1985/10/18 00:01,['1985/10/18 00:00'],"['1985/10/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/18 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1069053 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 1985 Oct 18;110(42):1599-606. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1069053.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],Zweitmalignome nach Tumor- und Leukamiebehandlung im Kindesalter.

Unfortunately, when 30 CML patients were studied simultaneously by DNA histogram analysis and LI studies, the correlation coefficient between the two results was only r = 0.611. A comparison of three different mathematical programs for DNA histogram analysis showed that none was completely satisfactory.

A modification of the FAB system was used in which individual lymphoblast cells were scored and designated as either L1 or L2 on the basis of distinctive morphologic characteristics. L1 ALL was defined as less than 10% L2 cells and greater than 90% L1 cells; L2 ALL was defined as greater than or equal to 10% L2 cells and less than 90% L1 cells. FAB morphology was an independent predictor of overall survival (P = 0.02) in CCSG-141 and a highly significant predictor of successful induction of complete remission and event-free survival in the CCSG-160 series (P = 0.00001). These studies involved nearly 3900 patients. Two concordance studies have been performed. In the first (1981) study, overall concordance between the FAB reference laboratory and member institutions was 76% using a two-category system (L1, non-L1), 86% for L1 cases, and 47% for non-L1 cases. In the second (1984) concordance study, the use of more stringent, semiquantitative definitions of L1 and L2 lymphoblasts did not improve overall (75%), L1 (89%), or non-L1 (46%) concordance. The results of reference laboratory classification more powerfully predicted event-free survival than did member institutions (P = 0.016 vs P = 0.125). Quality control factors (slide preparation, cellularity, staining quality, and discipline of the reviewer) did not influence concordance. These results justify the continued assignment of patients to protocols of the CCSG-100 series on the basis of the modified FAB classification.

These correlations suggest that alterations in the electrostatic properties of the mitochondrial membrane, due directly or indirectly to the effects of imidazole, interfere with heme synthesis but not with other aspects of the maturation process in these developing erythroid cells.","['Wong, W', 'Robinson, S H', 'Tsiftsoglou, A S']","['Wong W', 'Robinson SH', 'Tsiftsoglou AS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hemoglobins/*biosynthesis', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Membranes/physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/physiology']",1985/10/01 00:00,1985/10/01 00:01,['1985/10/01 00:00'],"['1985/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85062-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1985 Oct;66(4):999-1001.,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '7GBN705NH1 (imidazole)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,"['AM17148/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,

In contrast, both A and B G6PD in ratios similar to those found in skin were observed in morphologically normal blood cells from the same patients. The leukemic cells of three patients were examined at both diagnosis and relapse; in each instance the same G6PD type was found, consistent with regrowth of the original leukemic clone at relapse.

These polyanionic carbohydrates are believed to play an important role in leukocyte maturation and function. To study the effect of altered chondroitin sulfate metabolism on human promyelocytic leukemia cells, we have treated HL-60 cells with 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-xyloside. beta-D-Xylosides initiate the synthesis of free chondroitin sulfate chains. Cytochemical studies of treated cells demonstrated a marked increase in cytoplasmic granules stained with cationic dyes. This was confirmed by radiolabeled precursor incorporation studies that demonstrated a 344% increase in 35S-sulfate uptake into glycosaminoglycans associated with the cells and a 39% increase in incorporation into glycosaminoglycans released into the media. Chromatographic analyses of these glycosaminoglycans from treated cells demonstrated that the newly formed chondroitin sulfate chains were not attached to protein core and were of shorter length, but of greater charge density than chondroitin sulfate produced by control cells. Thus, beta-D-xyloside appears to alter the protein linkage, chain length, and sulfation of chondroitin sulfate produced by HL-60 cells, and these changes are morphologically evident. These biochemically altered cells may provide important information concerning the role of these macromolecules in myeloid development.","['Luikart, S D', 'Sackrison, J L', 'Thomas, C V']","['Luikart SD', 'Sackrison JL', 'Thomas CV']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/drug effects', 'Glycosaminoglycans/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Hymecromone/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Sulfates/metabolism', 'Sulfur Radioisotopes', 'Umbelliferones/*pharmacology']",1985/10/01 00:00,1985/10/01 00:01,['1985/10/01 00:00'],"['1985/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85042-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1985 Oct;66(4):866-72.,"['0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (Sulfates)', '0 (Sulfur Radioisotopes)', '0 (Umbelliferones)', '3T5NG4Q468 (Hymecromone)', '6734-33-4 (methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-xyloside)']",,['CA-38972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,

Serum LDH levels ranged from 97 to 6,595 U/L, with a mean of 547 U/L. Higher LDH levels were associated with higher leukocyte counts, lower blast cell DNA indices, lower platelet counts, a larger spleen size, and nonwhite race. LDH levels were not related to the percentage of marrow S-phase cells, liver size, French-American-British (FAB) classification, hemoglobin levels, age, sex, or the presence of the common ALL antigen on marrow blasts. Patients with the highest LDH levels (greater than 1,000 U/L) were most likely to fail treatment, whereas those with the lowest levels (less than 300 U/L) had the lowest risk of failure (P less than .0001). The prognostic significance of serum LDH level was retained in a subset of patients that included only those with leukocyte counts less than 25 X 10(9)/L (P = .0018). When 11 presenting characteristics were subjected to multivariate analysis, serum LDH level was found to have independent prognostic strength, contributing clinically important information to that gained from leukocyte count.

The molecular forms of transferrin released from the cells were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 6 M urea. Endocytosis of diferric transferrin was efficient since greater than 10% of surface-bound protein escaped endocytosis and was released in the diferric form. Although transferrin exocytosed from control cells had been depleted of 80% of its iron and contained 65-70% apotransferrin, iron-bearing species were also released (15% C-terminal monoferric; 10% N-terminal; 10% diferric). The ratio of the two monoferric species (C/N) was 1.32 +/- 0.12 (mean +/- SD; n = 4), suggesting that iron in the N-terminal site was more accessible to cells. In the presence of methylamine there was a concentration-dependent increase in the proportion of diferric transferrin release (less than 80% at 25 mM) and a concomitant decrease in apotransferrin. Small amounts of the iron-depleted species, especially apotransferrin, appeared before diferric transferrin, suggesting that these were preferentially released from the cells. The discrepancy between the proportions of the monoferric transferrin species noted with control cells was enhanced at all concentrations of methylamine, most markedly at 10 mM when the C/N ratio was 2.4. The N-terminal site of transferrin loses its iron at a higher pH than the C-terminal site, and so by progressively perturbing the pH of the endocytic vesicle we have increased the difference between the two sites observed with control cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Bomford, A', 'Young, S P', 'Williams, R']","['Bomford A', 'Young SP', 'Williams R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Methylamines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Transferrin/*metabolism']",1985/07/02 00:00,1985/07/02 00:01,['1985/07/02 00:00'],"['1985/07/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/02 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00335a013 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1985 Jul 2;24(14):3472-8. doi: 10.1021/bi00335a013.,"['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Methylamines)', '0 (Transferrin)', 'BSF23SJ79E (methylamine)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",,,,,

Physicians should be aware of this rare but important association.","['Vail, J T Jr', 'Adler, K R', 'Rothenberg, J']","['Vail JT Jr', 'Adler KR', 'Rothenberg J']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Dermatol,Archives of dermatology,0372433,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/drug therapy/pathology', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Skin Diseases/*complications/pathology', 'Xanthomatosis/*complications/drug therapy/pathology']",1985/10/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1985/10/01 00:00'],"['1985/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1985/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Dermatol. 1985 Oct;121(10):1318-20.,"['VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,

Transgenic mice were generated that harbor a replication-competent recombinant retrovirus (delta Mo + Py M-MuLV) that lacks the Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV)-type enhancer sequence in the long terminal repeat (LTR).

Kpn I fragments 9 kilobases (kb) and 5.7 kb long were observed for each cell line. However, the number of copies of each fragment in the cell genome varied according to the cell type. As compared to the adherent epithelioid cell lines, the anchorage-independent erythroleukemic cell lines contained more copies of the 5.7-kb fragment than of the 9-kb fragment, suggesting that the former may be biologically significant and perhaps related to the growth of erythroid cells. The presence of Kpn I fragments of the same sizes, albeit in fewer copies, in normal mouse spleen DNA made it difficult to distinguish exogenous virus from endogenous viral sequences. Therefore, rat 3Y1 cells, which contained no murine endogenous viruses, were infected with FLV-A stock virus prepared directly from the spleens of leukemic mice. Only the 9-kb Kpn I fragment, representing replication-competent Friend virus component, was detected in the infected rat cell DNA. No hybridization was observed to a 0.6-kb fragment of the spleen focus-forming virus env gene that is specific for xenotropic and dual-tropic mink cell focus-forming viruses. Since the virus synthesized by the infected rat cells was leukemogenic in adult mice, these data suggest that the wild-type FLV-A is replicative and fully pathogenic in the absence of other competent virus components.","['Brown, E H', 'Zajac-Kaye, M', 'Pogo, B G', 'Friend, C']","['Brown EH', 'Zajac-Kaye M', 'Pogo BG', 'Friend C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/etiology/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Rats', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Species Specificity', 'Viral Proteins/genetics', 'Virus Replication']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.17.5925 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Sep;82(17):5925-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.17.5925.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",,"['CA10000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA13047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC390666,,

It has been suggested that this is due to gene conversion events, which would produce allelic variation but at the same time reduce intergenic differences. We compared the sequences of 11 class I genes in an attempt to elucidate the evolutionary history of this gene family. Our analysis shows that the intron sequences can be used to establish the order of divergence of various class I genes from each other. The results obtained agree with the order of divergence deduced from major insertion and deletion events. It appears that certain genes in the murine TL antigen-encoding region diverged very early from the H-2 and Qa-2,3 genes. The latter can be subgrouped as H-2 and Qa-2,3 genes by both sequence homology and insertion patterns. In contrast to the introns, exon sequences provide less information on evolutionary relationships. Thus, these analyses are consistent with the view that concerted evolution due to gene conversion occurs preferentially in exons.","['Ronne, H', 'Widmark, E', 'Rask, L', 'Peterson, P A']","['Ronne H', 'Widmark E', 'Rask L', 'Peterson PA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Antigens, Surface/genetics', 'Base Sequence', '*Biological Evolution', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Gene Conversion', 'Genes', 'H-2 Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA Antigens/*genetics', '*Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Humans', '*Major Histocompatibility Complex', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.17.5860 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Sep;82(17):5860-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.17.5860.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Q surface antigens)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']",,,PMC390653,,

Both genes map in band 22q11 to a region that is bounded on the distal side by the breakpoints for CML 9:22 translocations and on the proximal side by the breakpoint for an X:22 translocation. We have found no evidence for rearrangements or amplification of either V lambda gene in CML, in either the chronic or acute phases of the disease. In K562 cells which are derived from the pleural effusion of a patient with Ph1-positive CML, there appears to be no rearrangement of the V lambda genes, but they are both amplified about four times.

Consistent with earlier studies, we found that three distinct regions upstream from the RNA capping site are required for efficient beta-globin gene transcription in HeLa cells: the ATA box located 30 base pairs upstream from the mRNA capping site (-30), the CCAAT box located at -75, and the distal sequence element CCACACCC located at -90. In the ATA and CAAT box regions, the sequences necessary for efficient transcription extend beyond the limits of the canonical sequences. Mutations in the sequences located between the three transcriptional control elements do not significantly affect transcription in HeLa cells. Although the promoter defined in HeLa cell transfection experiments is also required for efficient transcription in mouse erythroleukemia cells, none of the mutations tested affects the regulation of beta-globin gene transcription during mouse erythroleukemia cell differentiation. Thus, DNA sequences downstream from the mRNA cap site appear to be sufficient for the regulation of beta-globin gene expression during the differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia cells in culture.","['Charnay, P', 'Mellon, P', 'Maniatis, T']","['Charnay P', 'Mellon P', 'Maniatis T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'Genes, Synthetic', 'Globins/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1985/06/01 00:00,1985/06/01 00:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.5.6.1498-1511.1985 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1985 Jun;5(6):1498-511. doi: 10.1128/mcb.5.6.1498-1511.1985.,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",,,PMC366883,,

We described our experience with one adolescent with ALL who developed multifocal AVNB presenting as bone pain after aggressive chemotherapy that included a high cumulative dose of corticosteroids as well as other antitumor agents, some of which also have been associated with AVNB. Four similar cases from the literature are reviewed. Because the bone pain of AVNB can mimic that of leukemic relapse, this is an important entity to be aware of, and one which may become more common with increasingly aggressive combination chemotherapy.","['Felix, C', 'Blatt, J', 'Goodman, M A', 'Medina, J']","['Felix C', 'Blatt J', 'Goodman MA', 'Medina J']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Femur Head Necrosis/diagnostic imaging', 'Humans', 'Knee', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Osteonecrosis/*chemically induced/diagnostic imaging', 'Radiography', 'Recurrence']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950130505 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1985;13(5):269-72. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950130505.,['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)'],,,,,

To investigate the effects of various diseases or drugs on degranulation, we studied the kinetics of beta-glucuronidase release from PMNs exposed to opsonized zymosan. PMNs of children with bacterial infections demonstrated increased degranulation. Within 5, 15, and 30 min the PMNs released 19 +/- 3%, 23 +/- 3%, and 26 +/- 3% of total beta-glucuronidase compared to 12 +/- 2%, 15 +/- 2%, and 16 +/- 2% of total beta-glucuronidase of control PMNs. Viral infections induced a significant delay of beta-glucuronidase release from PMNs. Maintenance therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate, as well as administration of vincristine, diminished the degranulation. After 5, 15, and 30 min the PMNs released 8 +/- 1%, 10 +/- 1%, and 11 +/- 1%, as well as 6 +/- 3%, 8 +/- 2%, and 9 +/- 2% of total beta-glucuronidase.

The persistently infected cultures were responsive to IFN as determined by their ability to induce 2-5A synthetase, to increase the intracellular levels of 2-5A, and to cause rRNA cleavage. While large deletions at the left terminus of vaccinia DNA occurred readily in the virus population from untreated cells, IFN completely suppressed the generation of these spontaneous deletions. Removal of IFN from these cultures led to the appearance of similar deletions at the left terminus of the viral genome. The regions deleted contain more than half of the left-end inverted terminal repetition of the vaccinia genome.

We describe the treatment of meningeal leukemia in 39 children with intrathecal remission induction followed by the placement of an Ommaya reservoir to facilitate the administration and distribution of chemotherapeutic agents into the CSF. Six hundred or 900 rad of craniospinal radiation and maintenance intraventricular and intrathecal chemotherapy was then administered. Systemic reinduction therapy was added in the later cases. Sixteen children (41%) experienced no further events, with 17+ months to 13+ years (median, 25 months) follow-up . Eleven patients (28%) had CNS recurrence, nine (23%) bone marrow (BM) relapse, and two (5%) testicular relapse as the next adverse event. The course of patients with first isolated CNS relapse differed from that of the others. Eleven (69%) of 16 patients treated for first isolated CNS relapse are alive and 9 are event free, while only 35% of patients whose CNS relapse occurred simultaneously or after recurrent disease at other sites are alive (P = .04). Seven of 23 in the later group are event free. The difference is due to the increased incidence of BM relapse in the later group (30% v 6%; P = .04). For patients with first isolated CNS relapse, the life-table median CNS remission duration is 42 months. The projected CNS relapse-free survival and event-free survival 8 to 10 years after CNS relapse are 40% and 32%, respectively. Headache, nausea, and emesis of short duration were frequent during therapy. In three patients, the reservoir had to be removed for infection. No patient suffered neurologic deficit related to the reservoir. The therapy described can reduce the CNS relapse rate with manageable toxicity. Systemic relapse is still a major problem after multiple CNS relapse and in those in whom the CNS relapse follows or is simultaneous with relapse at other sites.","['Steinherz, P', 'Jereb, B', 'Galicich, J']","['Steinherz P', 'Jereb B', 'Galicich J']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain/*radiation effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Combinations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Intraventricular', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Recurrence']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1985.3.9.1217 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1985 Sep;3(9):1217-26. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1985.3.9.1217.,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,

The increased sensitivity of CT at detecting small parenchymal pulmonary densities is accompanied by loss of specificity, creating uncertainty as to the significance of nodules detected at CT in any individual patient. During a 1 year period we reviewed all CT scans in our institution demonstrating three or more focal lung densities, noting these parameters: number of densities, maximum lesion size, presence of calcification as determined visually, and lesion morphology (linear or nodular). Of 137 patients with three or more focal lung densities at CT, nodule diagnosis was established on pathologic or clinical grounds in 114. Metastases accounted for 73%, with primary colon and lung malignancies and lymphoma the most common causes.

The cells were pulse-chase labeled with [35S] methionine, and either directly immune precipitated with anti-glycophorin A antiserum or detergent-solubilized extracts first passed through columns containing the N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectin from Helix pomatia or the glucose/mannose specific lectin from lentil beans. From the sugar-eluted fractions anti-glycophorin A antiserum was used to identify precursor molecules. After 5 min of labeling the first glycophorin A precursors were seen. The largest had an apparent molecular weight of 37,000, and bound to lentil lectin-Sepharose, but not to H. pomatia lectin-Sepharose. The lentil lectin-reactive glycophorin A molecules increased to Mr = 39,000 during chase and obtained sialic acids after 9 min of chase reflecting terminal N- and O-glycosylation. After 5-6 min of labeling two H. pomatia-interacting glycophorin A precursors with apparent molecular weights of 24,000 and 30,000 were obtained. These did not bind to lentil lectin-Sepharose. During chase also these molecules increased in size to Mr = 39,000. The immune precipitation of all antiglycophorin A-reactive precursor molecules was inhibited by purified red cell glycophorin A. The carboxylic ionophore, monensin, caused the accumulation of incompletely O-glycosylated glycophorin A molecules, which bound to H. pomatia lectin-Sepharose. These were degraded by treatment with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H reflecting incomplete processing of the N-glycosidic oligosaccharide.","['Jokinen, M', 'Andersson, L C', 'Gahmberg, C G']","['Jokinen M', 'Andersson LC', 'Gahmberg CG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/*metabolism', 'Glycophorins/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Glycoside Hydrolases', 'Glycosides/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Methionine/blood', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Sulfur Radioisotopes']",1985/09/15 00:00,1985/09/15 00:01,['1985/09/15 00:00'],"['1985/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)39182-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1985 Sep 15;260(20):11314-21.,"['0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Glycosides)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Sulfur Radioisotopes)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)']",,['5 R01 CA 26294-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,

It was also studied whether AML cells were induced to differentiate under a stromal influence. Ten patients with untreated AML were included in the study. In most cases, AML cells were maintained at higher levels when a normal stroma was present. Cell recoveries varied widely between patients. Net cell production was apparent in nine of ten stroma cultures. In most paired cultures without a preestablished stroma, cell numbers decreased. Leukemic colony-forming cells (L-CFU) (clonogenic cells) were also recovered in higher numbers from stroma cultures, but decreased rapidly. The peak of L-CFU preceded that of AML nucleated cells. Cytogenetic analysis (three cases) confirmed the AML karyotype of cultured cells. AML blasts were tested weekly with a number of monoclonal antibodies. During culture, the percentage of cells expressing mature monocytic and granulocytic surface antigens increased markedly, suggesting progressive maturation. Morphologic maturation at the same time was incomplete. Thus, AML cells proliferate and differentiate in vitro under the influence of a normal bone marrow stroma, a property which these cells share with normal bone marrow cells.","['Scholzel, C', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Scholzel C', 'Lowenberg B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/pathology']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1985 Aug;13(7):664-9.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",,,,,

This late leukemia development could not be essentially influenced by drug treatment, such as injection of hydroxyurea (2 X 500 mg/kg), actinomycin D (3 X 120 micrograms/kg), phenylhydrazine (3 X 60 mg/kg), or 30 micrograms endotoxin or by bone marrow transplantation following lethal irradiation. Endotoxin (30 micrograms) given prior to virus caused the loss of resistance to F-MuLV-P, but it had only a slight effect if applied one or three months after virus infection. Leukemia development has never been observed in C57BL/6 mice after splenectomy. In DBA/2 mice, highly susceptible to F-MuLV-P, leukemia development was markedly impaired if the mice were splenectomized. These results clearly indicate that the spleen plays a crucial role in the mechanism of susceptibility or resistance to the Friend virus.","['Kreja, L', 'Seidel, H J']","['Kreja L', 'Seidel HJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Animals', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Endotoxins/pharmacology', '*Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Hematocrit', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Phenylhydrazines/pharmacology', 'Reticulocytes/pathology', 'Salmonella', 'Spleen/physiopathology', 'Splenectomy']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1985 Aug;13(7):623-8.,"['0 (Endotoxins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Phenylhydrazines)', '064F424C9K (phenylhydrazine)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,

Several independent virus-induced erythroleukemic and myeloblastic cell lines were tested for epo production. Among six erythroleukemic cell lines induced by FMuLV, another (NN10) was shown to produce epo by biological and immunological assays. Four Friend-virus-induced erythroleukemias and four FMuLV-induced myeloblastic cells were negative. The amounts of epo produced were similar in IW32 and NN10 supernatants after 48 h in culture. The in vitro bioassay gave the highest levels (up to 1000 mU/ml), the in vivo bioassay the lowest, and the radioimmunoassay gave intermediate results. NN10 and IW32 cell lines have been induced by two different FMuLV and were shown to be independent by cytogenetic studies. The molecular weights of IW32 and NN10 epo were close to the molecular weight of mouse plasma epo but elution profiles suggested that some differences might exist between these epos. Cloned IW32 and NN10 cells were shown to retain both the ability for erythroid differentiation after incubation with chemical inducers and the ability to produce epo. This demonstrates that malignant erythroid cells were the source of epo production in these cell lines.","['Choppin, J', 'Casadevall, N', 'Lacombe, C', 'Wendling, F', 'Goldwasser, E', 'Berger, R', 'Tambourin, P', 'Varet, B']","['Choppin J', 'Casadevall N', 'Lacombe C', 'Wendling F', 'Goldwasser E', 'Berger R', 'Tambourin P', 'Varet B']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Molecular Weight', 'Radioimmunoassay']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1985 Aug;13(7):610-5.,['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)'],,"['CA 18375/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL21676/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,

For this, a procedure for rapid selection of cybrids was devised by sensitizing non-fused cells with oligomycin. We were able to demonstrate that cytoplasts derived from DMSO- (or HMBA)-treated cells trigger erythroid differentiation upon fusion with UV-irradiated cells. The activity in the cytoplasts remained only transiently and its induction was inhibited by biologically active phorbol esters or cycloheximide. The activity, however, was not induced in cytoplasts by directly treating them with DMSO (or HMBA). These results indicate that (1) the intracellular erythroid-inducing activity is located in cytoplasts, (2) it acts in trans and induces erythroid differentiation as a dominant factor and (3) its production requires de novo nuclear protein synthesis.

Individuals deficient in retinoids become anaemic; replacement therapy with retinoids corrects the anaemia. Retinoids enhance the clonal proliferation of erythroid and myeloid precursors in soft-gel culture; all-trans-retinoic acid and 13-cis-retinoic acid are the most potent. Retinoids also induce the differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytes to functional granulocytes and can induce cells from other relatively mature, myeloid cell lines to undergo partial differentiation. Cells from less mature myeloid leukaemic lines are often resistant to induction of differentiation by retinoids. Like cells from established lines, relatively mature leukaemic cells (promyelocytes, myelomonoblasts) harvested from patients can undergo differentiation in vitro in the presence of retinoids. A few reports suggests that a minority of patients with myeloid leukaemia or preleukaemia who receive 13-cis-retinoic acid will have improvement in their haemopoiesis.

On the other hand, PAF was released only from 2 of 10 acute myeloblastic leukemias; both of them were of the more mature monoblastic subtype or M5 according to the French-American-British classification. Cells from all three cases of chronic myeloid leukemia studied were also capable of producing PAF. In eight cases of acute lymphoid and myeloid leukemia, the in vivo release of PAF was assessed by testing the plasma levels of this mediator. Only in two cases (one ALL and one acute myeloblastic leukemia) could detectable levels of circulating PAF be demonstrated; it is of interest that both of these cases showed clinical and hematological features of disseminated intravascular coagulation. No PAF was documented in the plasma of the five chronic leukemias tested (four B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias and one chronic myeloid leukemia). These findings indicate that lymphoid and myeloid leukemic cells have a different capacity of releasing PAF, possibly related to the level of cell differentiation rather than to an intrinsic property of the neoplastic cells. Furthermore, in some cases, an intravascular release of PAF may occur.","['Foa, R', 'Bussolino, F', 'Ferrando, M L', 'Guarini, A', 'Tetta, C', 'Mazzone, R', 'Gugliotta, L', 'Camussi, G']","['Foa R', 'Bussolino F', 'Ferrando ML', 'Guarini A', 'Tetta C', 'Mazzone R', 'Gugliotta L', 'Camussi G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Platelet Activating Factor/*analysis', 'Rabbits']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Sep;45(9):4483-5.,['0 (Platelet Activating Factor)'],,,,,

The results indicated that PMA at 10(-7) M causes within 30 min after treatment the phosphorylation of at least ten different proteins in both the HL-60 and R-94 cells. Among these ten phosphorylated proteins, we identified a major cytoplasmic polypeptide (Mr approximately 64,000), a cytoskeletal protein (Mr approximately 56,000), a nonmuscle myosin light chain, and two proteins (Mr approximately 60,000 and 64,000) localized in or around the cell nucleus. Phosphoamino acid analysis of six of the ten phosphoproteins showed that they contain phosphoserine. None of these proteins contained phosphotyrosine or phosphothreonine. The R-94 cell variant was found to be capable of increased protein phosphorylation after PMA treatment; however, the level of phosphate incorporation reached only the level of the untreated HL-60 cells and thus fell far short of the level observed in the HL-60 cells after PMA treatment.

These results indicate that short-term (1 h) incubations with etoposide, vincristine, and Adriamycin yield different profiles of toxicities whether used alone or with chemosensitizing agents such as the calcium antagonists.

In order to mimic the conditions of remission bone marrow, normal buffy coat cells were mixed with cells from the HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line at a concentration that approximated the normal-leukemia cell ratio found in remission marrow.

PM-81 binds to the majority of cells from 90% of patients with AML yet does not react significantly with normal stem cell populations. Because of the potential use of PM-81 in ABMT, it seemed especially important to show that the antibody was capable of mediating cytotoxicity of HL-60 cells in the presence of an excess of antigen-positive cells. A clonogenic assay that permitted the growth of HL-60 cell colonies but not normal progenitor cells in methylcellulose cultures was used to measure the efficiency of HL-60 cell lysis.

The information from this study showing a decrease in growth rate before the start of treatment, could suggest that the disease causes the growth failure. Growth rate for height increased with time from the first year of treatment, which could be correlated to a positive effect of medical treatment of the disease. These results indicate a very stable regulation of growth between 18 months and 12 years of age. The children dropped temporarily in mean one standard deviation (SD) corresponding to about 4 cm, from one year before the start of treatment to the end of the three years of treatment.

We have been investigating changes in the expression of c-myc mRNA in mouse erythroleukemia cells during chemically induced terminal erythroid differentiation. In vitro induction of erythroleukemia cell differentiation results in a switch from cells with unlimited proliferative capacity to cells that undergo a small number of terminal cell divisions. The level of c-myc mRNA changes rapidly following treatment with inducing agents. After a very rapid decline the mRNA is restored to pretreatment levels and then declines again. We have now measured the level of c-myc mRNA with respect to position in the cell cycle. Prior to inducer treatment the level of c-myc mRNA is relatively constant throughout the cell cycle. However, when the mRNA is restored following treatment with hypoxanthine or hexamethylenebisacetamide, it is found primarily in cells in the G1 phase. Thus, treatment with inducers of differentiation leads to a change in the cell cycle regulation of c-myc mRNA. This change may be involved in the altered proliferative capacity of the cells that occurs during terminal differentiation.","['Lachman, H M', 'Hatton, K S', 'Skoultchi, A I', 'Schildkraut, C L']","['Lachman HM', 'Hatton KS', 'Skoultchi AI', 'Schildkraut CL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Histones/genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', '*Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.16.5323 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Aug;82(16):5323-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.16.5323.,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,"['CA 16368/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA13330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 22332/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC390560,,

A rapid (less than 2 hr) increase (step-up) in commitment to terminal cell division was observed if, after 60-70 hr in culture with inducer and steroid, MELC were transferred to medium with HMBA alone. This step-up commitment was not inhibited by actinomycin or cordycepin but was blocked by cycloheximide. In this study, we show that dexamethasone blocks HMBA-mediated activation of alpha 1- and beta maj-globin gene transcription but not the induced chromatin change characterized by appearance of DNase I-hypersensitive regions upstream from the 5' cap sites of the alpha 1- and beta maj-globin genes. A rapid (less than 2 hr) activation (step-up) of alpha 1-globin gene transcription was observed if, after 48-60 hr in culture with HMBA and dexamethasone, MELC were transferred to medium with HMBA alone. Activation of transcription of the beta maj-globin gene requires 12-24 hr of further culture. Cycloheximide inhibits step-up transcription of both globin genes. Thus, dexamethasone blocks HMBA-mediated modulation of transcription of several nonlinked genes whose expression is altered in a coordinated manner during induced MELC terminal differentiation. Further, the steroid blocks at a late step, a step after that which is rate-limiting to HMBA-mediated MELC differentiation.","['Kaneda, T', 'Murate, T', 'Sheffery, M', 'Brown, K', 'Rifkind, R A', 'Marks, P A']","['Kaneda T', 'Murate T', 'Sheffery M', 'Brown K', 'Rifkind RA', 'Marks PA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Acetamides/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.15.5020 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Aug;82(15):5020-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.15.5020.,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Chromatin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",,"['CA 08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P0 31768/PHS HHS/United States']",PMC390490,,

These occurred in 17 patients with lymphoreticular malignancy and nine patients with solid tumors. They were the presenting signs of malignancy in three patients and were the direct cause of death in six. Cerebrovascular accidents were directly related to disseminated intravascular coagulation in eight patients, to chemotherapy in eight patients, to metastatic tumor in three patients, to thrombocytopenia in three patients, and to fungal meningitis in one patient. All patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation had leukemia and at times, cerebrovascular thrombosis predated systemic or laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. This review indicates that four major syndromes are apparent in children with cancer: vascular thrombosis associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute arterial or sagittal sinus thrombosis secondary to L-asparaginase in children with leukemia, acute neurologic dysfunction in patients with osteogenic sarcoma treated with high-dose methotrexate, and obtundation, seizures, and focal neurologic deficits in patients with neuroblastoma metastatic to the torcular region. Although elevated WBC counts and thrombocytopenia occur frequently in children with cancer, in themselves they uncommonly result in strokes. It is concluded that cerebrovascular accidents are a relatively frequent cause of acute neurologic compromise in children with cancer and that certain types of malignancies and their treatment predispose patients to this complication.","['Packer, R J', 'Rorke, L B', 'Lange, B J', 'Siegel, K R', 'Evans, A E']","['Packer RJ', 'Rorke LB', 'Lange BJ', 'Siegel KR', 'Evans AE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Bone Neoplasms/complications', 'Brain Ischemia/pathology', 'Cerebral Arteries/pathology', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/pathology', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders/chemically induced/*pathology', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Intracranial Embolism and Thrombosis/pathology', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Neoplasms/*complications/pathology', 'Neuroblastoma/complications', 'Sinus Thrombosis, Intracranial/pathology']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pediatrics. 1985 Aug;76(2):194-201.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,"['CA14489/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26191/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,

Although morphologically and histochemically these cells appeared to be of the monocyte-macrophage phenotype, there was a decline in Fc receptors for IgGl and no induction of class II HLA antigens. There was, however, dramatic induction of the antigen detected by the myeloid-specific MoAb AML-2-23. These data suggest that the phenotypic changes induced by calcitriol in HL-60 cells are consistent with myelomonocytic differentiation in that the resultant cells possess characteristics of both monocytes (morphology, non-specific esterase staining, high levels of AML-2-23 reactivity) and granulocytes (PMN 29 binding, decreased Fc receptors for IgGl, absence of class II HLA antigens). Perhaps more important, the ability of calcitriol-treated cells to perform antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis was markedly augmented. Lysis of antibody-coated erythrocytes by HL-60 cells increased from 5% in controls to 30-35% with calcitriol treatment for 4 days. This enhanced effector cell function was seen despite a decline in Fc receptors measured by cytofluorography.

Continuous exposure of HL-60 cells to 0.1-3.3 microM NPC resulted in a progressive reduction in cell growth which was accompanied by an increase in differentiation to cells with a myelocyte and neutrophil morphology. The latter effect was expressed as an increase in the capacity of cells to reduce nitro blue tetrazolium and reached a level of 40% of the total cell population. Preceding the phenotypic changes was the preferential inhibition of RNA and DNA methylation in comparison to inhibition of their synthesis which coincided with the formation of a metabolite of NPC with the chromatographic characteristics of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet). In addition, c-myc mRNA expression, which is amplified in HL-60 cells, was markedly reduced following NPC treatment. These results indicate that NPC is an effective inhibitor of RNA and DNA methylation resulting from its conversion to an analog of AdoMet, and that these effects appear to be responsible for reduced c-myc RNA expression and the induction of myeloid differentiation in this cell line.","['Linevsky, J', 'Cohen, M B', 'Hartman, K D', 'Knode, M C', 'Glazer, R I']","['Linevsky J', 'Cohen MB', 'Hartman KD', 'Knode MC', 'Glazer RI']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['Adenosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Methylation', '*Oncogenes', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1985 Jul;28(1):45-50.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '72877-50-0 (neplanocin A)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",,,,,

AML and chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) were characterized by a markedly higher DNA-ligase activity.

Clustering of different risk factors resulted, e.g., in an excess risk of colon cancer among female breast cancer patients (risk factors in both cancers are prevalent particularly in higher-social classes). Differences in the distribution of the risk factors resulted in risk deficits, e.g., low relative risk of lung cancer among male colon cancer patients (the prevalence of smoking was highest in the lower-social classes and the prevalence of risk factors in colon cancer was highest in the higher-social classes).

Like human monocytes, U937, HL-60, and ML-1 cells bound monomeric human IgG Fc with high affinity and mildly reduced and alkylated human IgG and Fc with a somewhat diminished affinity. In contrast, K562 cells had a much lower affinity for monomeric human IgG or Fc. Concentrations of these proteins as high as 10(-5) M were needed to completely block EA rosette formation. There was no binding of reduced and alkylated IgG and Fc. We assessed the influence of various segments of IgG on FcR interactions by using human pFc', rabbit Facb, mouse IgG2b-IgG2a hybrid Ig, and also studied the effect of reduction of the interchain disulfide bonds. The FcR on all four cell types bound rabbit IgG but not rabbit Facb or human pFc', suggesting that rabbit C gamma 3 domains are required for FcR interaction and that isolated human C gamma 3 domains do not have a human FcR binding site. Murine IgG2a, but not IgG2b, was cytophilic for U937, HL-60, and ML-1 cells. Binding studies with the use of several mouse myeloma variant Ig molecules having hybrid gamma 2b-gamma 2a heavy chains showed that variants with a complete gamma 2a Fc region bound to these FcR-like IgG2a, whereas those having gamma 2a sequences only in the C gamma 3 region and in a short adjacent segment of the C gamma 2 region behaved like IgG2b and did not bind. These results suggested that additional murine gamma 2a sequences are required for FcR binding. Interestingly, the Fc fragments from murine proteins with a complete gamma 2a Fc region bound only to a limited extent. These fragments are shorter than the human IgG1 Fc fragments, and they lack that segment of the hinge region that includes the interchain disulfide bonds. Cleavage of the interchain disulfide bonds of murine Ig having a complete gamma 2a Fc region diminished binding to a similar extent as that observed with human IgG.

A technique is described in which the DNA denaturation step is facilitated by a) prior dissociation of histones from DNA and b) the use of low ionic strength buffer in which the cells are suspended during heating. Dissociation of histones is achieved by cell treatment with 0.08N HCl at 0 degree C, which a) increases accessibility of DNA to propidium iodide (and following the denaturation to the antibodies); b) lowers stability of DNA to thermal denaturation; c) decreases differences between various cell types due to variability in chromatin structure; and d) ensures more complete DNA denaturation. Cell heating (80-95 degrees C) at low ionic strength (1 mM Na+) eliminates the need for formamide and results in extensive and rapid DNA denaturation. The method was applied in Friend leukemia, L1210 and HL-60 cell lines, and to bone marrow, experimental animal tumor and primary human tumor cells.","['Moran, R', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z', 'Staiano-Coico, L', 'Melamed, M R']","['Moran R', 'Darzynkiewicz Z', 'Staiano-Coico L', 'Melamed MR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Histochem Cytochem,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,9815334,IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/33.8.3860561 [doi]'],ppublish,J Histochem Cytochem. 1985 Aug;33(8):821-7. doi: 10.1177/33.8.3860561.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Histones)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",,"['CA 23296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 34134/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,

Age-related prognostic implications.,319-24,"To determine the clinical and biologic relevance of cellular kinetics in leukemia, DNA flow cytometric analysis was performed on bone marrow biopsy specimens from 148 previously untreated adult patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. The proportion of cells in synthesis, second growth, and mitosis (S + G2M) ranged from 4% to 33% with a median of 14%. The overall incidence of complete remission was not affected by the pretreatment cell cycle distribution. As in earlier studies, there was a marked decline in remission rate with advancing age from 73% for patients age less than or equal to 50 yr to 50% for those greater than 50 (P less than 0.01). Although not affecting remission induction overall, an increasing proportion of cells in S + G2M phase was favorable in patients under the age of 50 yr, but was associated with a progressive decline in remission rate in older patients (P = 0.01). This age-related divergent effect of cell cycle kinetics on initial response to therapy was confined to the less favorable subgroup of patients with karyotypic abnormalities, whereas patients with normal diploid cytogenetics had a consistently higher response rate regardless of proliferative activity. A positive correlation was also observed between percent of S + G2M cells and the proportion of diploid metaphases in young patients, contrasting with a negative correlation in the older age group. Our observations strongly suggest that the well-recognized prognostic effect of age on remission induction is not entirely host-mediated, but is at least partly an expression of disease-intrinsic differences between young and older patients.","['Kantarjian, H M', 'Barlogie, B', 'Keating, M J', 'Hall, R R', 'Smith, T L', 'McCredie, K B', 'Freireich, E J']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Barlogie B', 'Keating MJ', 'Hall RR', 'Smith TL', 'McCredie KB', 'Freireich EJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Cell Cycle', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitosis', 'Prognosis']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI111964 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1985 Jul;76(1):319-24. doi: 10.1172/JCI111964.,,,"['CA-28153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC423776,,

By double immunofluorescence microscopy using VIC-C2 and polyclonal antibodies to vimentin, the VIC-C2 antigen was shown to be located on intermediate filaments of cultured fibroblasts and to follow these filaments during various drug-induced rearrangements. As demonstrated by immunoprecipitation, antibody gel overlay and immunoblotting of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels, VIC-C2 recognized two different antigens in extracts of THP-1 cells: one of Mr = 43 000 and pI = 7, the other of Mr = 57 000.

All could be isolated from cell nuclei, and all three could be detected in mouse and human tissue culture cell lines, but only RAP38 and RAP30 have so far been isolated from calf thymus. RAP38 stimulates nonspecific transcription of native DNA templates by RNA polymerase II in the presence of Mn2+; it appears to be similar or identical to SII, a previously identified RNA polymerase II stimulatory factor (Nakanishi, Y., Mitsuhashi, Y., Sekimizu, K., Yokoi, H., Tanaka, Y., Horikoshi, M., and Natori, S. (1981) FEBS Lett. 130, 69-72). Unlike RAP38, RAP72 and RAP30 do not affect nonspecific transcription by RNA polymerase II. However, RAP30 may have a role in regulating some alterations of transcription that accompany cellular differentiation; RAP30 is partially dephosphorylated when murine erythroleukemia cells are induced with dimethyl sulfoxide to undergo terminal erythroid differentiation. We suggest that phosphate groups in RNA polymerase II-binding proteins may regulate transcription by modulating the interaction of RNA polymerase II with other regulatory proteins that possess sequence recognition specificity.","['Sopta, M', 'Carthew, R W', 'Greenblatt, J']","['Sopta M', 'Carthew RW', 'Greenblatt J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphoproteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA Polymerase II/*metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thymus Gland/enzymology']",1985/08/25 00:00,1985/08/25 00:01,['1985/08/25 00:00'],"['1985/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)39255-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1985 Aug 25;260(18):10353-60.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA polymerase II-binding proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,

Effects of succinylacetone.",9630-5,"We have monitored, during the dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO)-induced differentiation of MEL cells, the accumulation of mRNAs encoding two enzymes of the heme biosynthetic pathway, namely porphobilinogen deaminase and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. Our results demonstrate that the induction of these two enzymes is accounted for by a coordinate increase in their corresponding mRNAs, as estimated by hybridization with specific cloned cDNA probes. These events occur early during the differentiation process and precede the accumulation of alpha- and beta-globin mRNAs. Blocking the heme biosynthetic pathway with succinylacetone does not appear to modify the Me2SO-mediated increase of porphobilinogen deaminase and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase mRNAs although succinylacetone has been shown to prevent the induction of immunoreactive porphobilinogen deaminase as well as its enzymatic activity (Beaumont, C., Deybach, J. C., Grandchamp, B., Da Silva, V., de Verneuil, H., and Nordmann, Y. (1984) Exp. Cell Res. 154, 474-484). Heme depletion resulting from the presence of succinylacetone in the culture medium reduces the extent of the Me2SO-mediated accumulation of alpha- and beta-globin mRNAs, and this effect is reversed by the addition of 10 microM exogenous hemin. Although the presence of succinylacetone prevents hemoglobinization of MEL cells, it does not prevent MEL cells from losing their proliferative capacity when treated with Me2SO.","['Grandchamp, B', 'Beaumont, C', 'de Verneuil, H', 'Nordmann, Y']","['Grandchamp B', 'Beaumont C', 'de Verneuil H', 'Nordmann Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Ammonia-Lyases/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Carboxy-Lyases/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Heme/metabolism', 'Heptanoates/*pharmacology', 'Heptanoic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Uroporphyrinogen Decarboxylase/*metabolism']",1985/08/15 00:00,1985/08/15 00:01,['1985/08/15 00:00'],"['1985/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)39284-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1985 Aug 15;260(17):9630-5.,"['0 (Heptanoates)', '0 (Heptanoic Acids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '51568-18-4 (succinylacetone)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.5.1.61 (Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase)', 'EC 4.1.1.- (Carboxy-Lyases)', 'EC 4.1.1.37 (Uroporphyrinogen Decarboxylase)', 'EC 4.3.1.- (Ammonia-Lyases)']",,,,,

The cytologic (n = 7) and histologic (n = 38) findings in bone marrow from a total of 45 patients with systemic mastocytosis were evaluated. Three distinct histologic patterns of marrow involvement were distinguished. In 21 cases a patchy or focal infiltration pattern was encountered. Mast cell aggregates were located predominantly in peritrabecular and perivascular areas. The adjacent trabeculae were thickened. A dense network of reticulin fibers and foci of lymphocytes accompanied the mast cell infiltrates. Increased numbers of eosinophils frequently demarcated the mast cell infiltrates from the surrounding tissue. In the noninfiltrated marrow areas hematopoiesis and the distribution of fat cells appeared to be normal. This histologic pattern, designated type 1, was observed exclusively in patients showing primary involvement of the skin, indistinguishable from urticaria pigmentosa. In 14 additional cases peritrabecular and perivascular sheets of mast cells, with concomitant fibrosis and osteosclerosis, were also present. Unlike the findings in type 1, however, the noninfiltrated marrow areas showed marked reductions in fat cell content and markedly increased granulocytopoiesis or increased numbers of blast cells (infiltration pattern type 2). On the basis of the hematologic and clinical findings, chronic myeloid leukemia was diagnosed in six of these cases, myelomonocytic leukemia in three cases, and acute myeloid leukemia in two cases. The bone marrow of three patients was diffusely infiltrated by atypical mast cells, leading to marked hypoplasia of fat cells and blood cell precursors. These histologic features were identified as infiltration pattern type 3. The diagnosis of mast cell leukemia was confirmed in all three cases by the presence of numerous mast cells in the blood. The prognosis for patients with the type 1 marrow infiltration pattern and primary skin involvement was favorable (actuarial survival rate five years after diagnosis, 0.75). This variant was called benign systemic mastocytosis. Primary skin involvement did not occur in the patients with type 2 or 3 infiltration patterns. The prognosis for these patients was poor (actuarial survival five years after diagnosis, 0.17 for type 2 and 0.00 for type 3). These two forms were accordingly designated malignant systemic mastocytosis.","['Horny, H P', 'Parwaresch, M R', 'Lennert, K']","['Horny HP', 'Parwaresch MR', 'Lennert K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Urticaria Pigmentosa/*pathology']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0046-8177(85)80252-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0046-8177(85)80252-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1985 Aug;16(8):808-14. doi: 10.1016/s0046-8177(85)80252-5.,,,,,,

After in vivo BW 301U therapy, bone marrow cells from five of the six patients exhibited significantly reduced inhibition by 1 microM methotrexate in vitro, whereas the response to 1 microM BW 301U remained unchanged. Megaloblastic marrow morphology and decreased myeloid progenitor cloning efficiency were also observed following five daily BW 301U infusions of 21 and 71 mg/sq m, respectively. A similar reduction in the ability of methotrexate to inhibit tritiated deoxyuridine incorporation was also seen in HL-60 cells, a human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line, after incubation in vitro with cytostatic concentrations of BW 301U for 3 days. Concomitant changes in the response to BW 301U did not occur.

The cell cycle status was ascertained by the incorporation of [3H]thymidine and autoradiography. Studies in which cell cycle block in the G1/S phase boundary region was produced by a partial inhibition of DNA synthesis with thymidine, or sodium butyrate, showed that the exposure of such semisynchronous cultures to 1,25(OH)2D3 resulted in an increased proportion of differentiated cells. Conversely, blocking the cell cycle with vinblastine (G2/M block) or theobromine (mid-G1 block) inhibited the initiation of differentiation by 1,25(OH)2D3. Experiments in which the differentiated cells were examined for the cell cycle position at the time of the exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3 by [3H]thymidine labeling and autoradiography confirmed that the late G1 and early S phase cells are those which predominate in the differentiated fraction of 1,25(OH)2D3-treated HL-60 cultures.

Benzidine-positive cells synthesizing hemoglobin appeared on day 4 after addition of 250 microM canavalmine. The canavalmine-induced cell differentiation was inhibited by the addition of agents which alter the structure of the cell membrane, such as local anesthetics (procainamide and lidocaine) or Ca2+ antagonists (nifedipine and verapamil) at dosages not toxic for the cell growth. Canavalmine did not significantly affect the levels of conjugated polyamines in the acid-insoluble fraction of the cells. In contrast, the level of free spermidine in the acid-soluble fraction greatly decreased during the 18 h after canavalmine treatment. Putrescine and spermidine, when added externally to the growth medium, showed dose-dependent inhibition of canavalmine-induced cell differentiation. Neither cadaverine nor spermine had any significant effect. These results suggest that not only structural change of cell membrane but alteration of the polyamine metabolism, especially a regulation of the cellular level of free spermidine, might have a key importance in erythroid differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells induced by canavalmine.","['Fujihara, S', 'Nakashima, T', 'Kurogochi, Y']","['Fujihara S', 'Nakashima T', 'Kurogochi Y']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Anesthetics, Local/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Calcium/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Polyamines/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1985/07/30 00:00,1985/07/30 00:01,['1985/07/30 00:00'],"['1985/07/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/30 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(85)90115-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(85)90115-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1985 Jul 30;846(1):101-8. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(85)90115-6.,"['0 (Anesthetics, Local)', '0 (Polyamines)', '70862-15-6 (canavalmine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,

Haematological findings in these 17 patients were compared to those in 50 randomly selected patients with Ph1-positive CML. Whereas an absolute basophilia in the peripheral blood was a nearly constant feature in the Ph1-positive group, it was lacking in all but one of the patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. Differences in the pattern and degree of dysplasia were also noted. Only one of the 25 cases studied was considered morphologically and clinically indistinguishable from Ph1-positive CML.

The dihydrofolate reductase activity from the resistant cells is characterized by marked heat instability and substantially higher Vmax and Km values for the dihydrofolic acid/NADPH combination. The enzyme from the resistant cells can be protected against heat inactivation by either dihydrofolic acid or NADPH, or both. A 50 fold higher concentration of methotrexate was required to totally inhibit the R4-29 dihydrofolate reductase activity as compared to the (S) activity when the enzymes were assayed using equivalent amounts of enzyme protein.

The clinical records of all patients with a new diagnosis of acute myelocytic leukemia and initial white blood cell count greater than 100,000 X 10(9)/liter admitted to the Mount Sinai Medical Center between the years 1974 and 1983 were examined. Forty-three patients were identified, 22 of whom had clinical and/or pathologic evidence of leukostasis of the central nervous system and/or lung. All patients received induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin and a continuous infusion of cytosine arabinoside. Thirty-five patients also underwent therapeutic leukapheresis prior to induction chemotherapy. The overall remission induction rate in these 43 patients was 51 percent. Fifteen patients had lung leukostasis; the remission rate for these patients was 27 percent (three complete remissions, one partial remission), as compared with a remission rate of 64 percent (18 of 28) for those without pulmonary leukostasis (chi 21 = 5.53; p = 0.02).

In contrast, the GTP-dependent casein kinase activity, CK2, which is almost undetectable in normal granulocytes, was markedly increased in highly proliferating myeloblastic cells from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic crisis (BC-CML). Levels of endogenous phosphotyrosine were not higher in leukemic cells than in normal peripheral lymphocytes or granulocytes. Finally, cAMP binding capacity was found to be increased in several types of proliferating leukemic cells, due to a higher amount of the R1-type regulatory subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinases. Specific patterns of cAMP binding proteins observed in the different types of normal blood cells were rather blurred in leukemic cells. In conclusion, modifications observed in human leukemic cells seem to be more related to proliferation or blockage in normal differentiation than to their cellular origin.","['Phan-Dinh-Tuy, F', 'Henry, J', 'Boucheix, C', 'Perrot, J Y', 'Rosenfeld, C', 'Kahn, A']","['Phan-Dinh-Tuy F', 'Henry J', 'Boucheix C', 'Perrot JY', 'Rosenfeld C', 'Kahn A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adenosine/analogs & derivatives', 'Azides', 'Carrier Proteins/blood', 'Casein Kinases', 'Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose', '*Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein', 'Granulocytes/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/*blood', 'Receptors, Cyclic AMP/analysis']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830190302 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1985 Jul;19(3):209-18. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830190302.,"['0 (Azides)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Cyclic AMP)', '4372-67-2 (8-azidoadenosine)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinases)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",,,,,

Information about possible exposures was collected by a postal questionnaire addressed to the parents. This report concerns the results of the analysis of parental occupations and occupational exposures for 519 children with acute lymphocytic leukemia and 507 controls. During pregnancy, more mothers of patients were working in ""hydrocarbon-related"" occupations; relative risk (RR) = 2.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.7-9.4). Likewise, greater occupational exposure to chemicals (paint, petroleum products, and unspecified chemicals) during pregnancy was found for mothers of patients (RR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.2-4.6). The kind of work being performed by the mothers one year before diagnosis did not differ between cases and controls. For the fathers, no relationship was found between a hydro-carbon-related occupation or occupational exposure to chemicals and leukemia in the offspring. Adjustment for birth order, social class, and degree of urbanization did not materially change the relative risks.","['van Steensel-Moll, H A', 'Valkenburg, H A', 'van Zanen, G E']","['van Steensel-Moll HA', 'Valkenburg HA', 'van Zanen GE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Chemical Industry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fathers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/chemically induced/*etiology', 'Male', 'Netherlands', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*etiology', '*Parents', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Random Allocation', 'Registries', 'Risk']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a113992 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 1985 Feb;121(2):216-24. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a113992.,,,,,,

Recognition of important patterns in age-specific mortality rates has suggested that events early in life, perhaps even prenatally, may have an influence on developing leukemia in childhood. The racial differences evident in mortality, incidence, and immunologic subtype of ALL suggest either differences in exposures to certain ""factors"" or differences in responses to those ""factors"" by white children. Hereditary factors appear to play a role. Familial and hereditary conditions exist that have high incidences of acute leukemia. Chromosomal anomalies are common in these conditions. Viral infections may play a role by contributing to alteration in genetic material through incorporation of the viral genome. How that virus is dealt with after primary infection seems important. The presence of immunodeficiency may allow wider dissemination or enhanced replication of such viruses, thereby increasing the likelihood of cellular transformation to an abnormal cell. Proliferation of that malignant cell to a clone may depend on other cofactors. Perhaps prolonged exposure to substances like benzene or alkylating agents may enhance these interactions between virus and genetic material. Does this change DNA repair mechanisms? Are viral infections handled differently? Is viral genomic information more easily integrated into host cells? Ionizing radiation has multiple effects. Alteration in genetic material occurs both at the molecular and chromosomal levels. DNA may be altered, lost, or added in the cell's attempt to recover from the injury. These changes may lead to altered susceptibility to other environmental agents, and host response may be altered. The past 40 years have seen dramatic progress in the treatment of ALL. We have just begun to unravel the complex interactions of genetic makeup, immune response, and the environment on the development of ALL. Whether factors can be identified that may allow prevention of acute leukemia remains to be seen.","['Pendergrass, T W']",['Pendergrass TW'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Africa, Northern', 'Aged', 'Carcinogens', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*epidemiology/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Middle East', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced', 'Parents', 'Racial Groups', 'Risk', 'Sex Factors', 'United States', 'Virus Physiological Phenomena']",1985/06/01 00:00,1985/06/01 00:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0093-7754(85)90002-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1985 Jun;12(2):80-91.,['0 (Carcinogens)'],,,,,

The monocyte cellular size increased and cell organellae became mature after a 72-h culture. Phagolysosome formation developed markedly- and the nucleus became circular--accompanied by chromatin deconcentration. The differentiation degree of the cell organellae was indexed and classified as mature by electron microscopy. The indexes of nuclear shape, chromatin deconcentration, cytoplasmonuclear ratio and vacuole formation increased with time. The total index increased linearly with time dependence. These results indicate that the ultrastructural parameters and indexes allowed a quantitative assessment of cell organellae and cellular differentiation of the monocyte. At the acute phase of ALL, the degrees of cell organnellae and cellular differentiation were significantly lower than the control.

The expression of p4F1 and p2F1 is clearly dependent on the cell cycle in peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated to proliferate with phytohemagglutinin; the p2A9 sequences cannot be clearly detected in human lymphocytes but are expressed in a cell-cycle-dependent manner in human diploid fibroblasts (WI-38).

These findings suggest that the activation of cell-division-cycle genes might contribute, like cellular oncogenes, to the phenotype of human malignancies and that, perhaps, new oncogenes could be found by identifying and isolating genes whose expression is dependent on the cell cycle.","['Calabretta, B', 'Kaczmarek, L', 'Mars, W', 'Ochoa, D', 'Gibson, C W', 'Hirschhorn, R R', 'Baserga, R']","['Calabretta B', 'Kaczmarek L', 'Mars W', 'Ochoa D', 'Gibson CW', 'Hirschhorn RR', 'Baserga R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['*Cell Cycle', 'Fibroblasts/analysis', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/analysis/cytology', '*Oncogenes', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.13.4463 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Jul;82(13):4463-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.13.4463.,['0 (Phytohemagglutinins)'],,['CA 25898/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC391121,,

Thirteen out of 164 children (7.9%) had acute hepatitis (AH) during treatment, while 8/90 (8.8%) showed an acute exacerbation of liver damage within 6 months after therapy withdrawal. Seven of the 13 children with AH while on therapy were HBsAg positive. In 12/13 cases, liver disease progressed to chronicity. Five of eight children who developed AH after completion of treatment were HBsAg positive. Eighty-nine patients (54.2%) developed biochemical evidence of chronic hepatitis during therapy; 48/89 were followed after cessation of treatment and 33 of them showed persisting evidence of liver cell necrosis. Thirty-three out of 133 children (24.8%) tested for serum HBsAg were found positive: 26 (78.7%) of them developed chronic hepatitis. Sixty-four out of 133 patients were evaluated after cessation of treatment: Chronic hepatitis persisted in 16/22 HBsAg-positive (72.7%) and in 17/42 HBsAg-negative (40.4%) children during follow-up. The outcome of these liver diseases after treatment withdrawal did not differ significantly in relation to HBV serology, suggesting that viral rather than toxic agents were responsible for liver damage also in most HBsAg-negative patients. The high incidence of chronic HBV infection in children with leukemia found in this multicentric study could suggest a need for active immunization with HBV vaccine, but the efficacy of such approach in this clinical setting is still to be validated.","['Locasciulli, A', 'Alberti, A', 'Rossetti, F', 'Santamaria, M', 'Santoro, N', 'Madon, E', 'Miniero, R', 'Lo Curto, M', 'Tamaro, P', 'Paolucci, P']","['Locasciulli A', 'Alberti A', 'Rossetti F', 'Santamaria M', 'Santoro N', 'Madon E', 'Miniero R', 'Lo Curto M', 'Tamaro P', 'Paolucci P', 'et al.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hepatitis/*etiology', 'Hepatitis B/etiology', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Italy', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Male']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950130409 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1985;13(4):203-6. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950130409.,['0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)'],,,,,

There was a significant relationship between remission duration and leukocyte doubling time (correlation coefficient 0.94). On multivariate analysis, the most important factor influencing remission duration (and doubling time) was the percentage of circulating blasts (p less than 0.001). The spleen size (p less than 0.02), Liver size (p less than 0.03) and WBC (p less than 0.03) also added significantly to model fit; however, once a second variable was entered into the model no other factor produced significant improvement in model fit. In univariate analyses, the remission duration, doubling time, percentage of circulating blasts, spleen and liver size correlated significantly with survival. Multivariate analysis indicated that the percentage of circulating blasts was the most important factor affecting survival (p less than 0.001), with the liver size adding significantly to model fit (p less than 0.05). Remission duration, leukocyte doubling time and spleen size did not significantly influence survival once the percentage of blasts was included in the model.

Within the ALL group a significantly higher rate of aneuploid DNA stemlines was observed for non-T/non-B ALL with 44,1% as compared to T-ALL with 14,3% (p less than 0,01). In AML the morphologic subgroups M 1/2 revealed a lower frequency of 21,7% DNA aneuploidies than M 4/5 leukemias with 44,4%. The rates of complete remissions were not different between patients with and without DNA aneuploidy neither in ALL nor in AML. In the study ALL 79/81, however, a tendency towards longer remissions for patients with DNA aneuploidy was found (p = 0.053) which could not be confirmed at present by the study ALL 81/83. In both ALL trials patients with the lowest pretherapeutic risk-score revealed the highest rate of aneuploid DNA stemlines.","['Hiddemann, W', 'Ritter, J', 'Wormann, B', 'Budde, M', 'Creutzig, U', 'Schellong, G', 'Buchner, T', 'Riehm, H']","['Hiddemann W', 'Ritter J', 'Wormann B', 'Budde M', 'Creutzig U', 'Schellong G', 'Buchner T', 'Riehm H']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,IM,"['*Aneuploidy', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Germany, West', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Risk']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1033971 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1985 May-Jun;197(3):215-20. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1033971.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",DNS-Aneuploidie bei Kindern mit akuten Leukamien: I.

The immunotoxins were at least as toxic as the plant toxin ricin to the Thy 1.1-expressing cell lines AKR-A and BW5147 in tissue culture. They reduced the rate at which the cells incorporated [3H]leucine into protein by 50% at cell concentrations of 1.5-3 X 10(-11) and 3 X 10(-12) M, respectively. The toxic effect was specific. No toxicity was seen when the immunotoxins were applied to Thy 1.2-expressing EL 4 lymphoma cells at 3 X 10(-8) M, and a control immunotoxin made from an antibody (R10) of irrelevant specificity was without effect on AKA-A cells. Further, the treatment of spleen cells from AKR mice with OX7-saporin at 10(-8) M abolished their response to the T-lymphocyte mitogen concanavalin A, without impairing their response to the B-lymphocyte mitogen lipopolysaccharide. A single iv injection of OX7-saporin into nu/nu randombred mice bearing peritoneal AKR-A lymphoma cells prolonged the survival time of the animals by an extent corresponding to that expected if 99.999% of the tumor cells had been eradicated by the immunotoxin. None of the control materials (unconjugated OX7, unconjugated saporin, OX7 plus saporin, or R10-saporin) delayed tumor growth. The OX7 F(ab')2-saporin conjugate was also highly effective as an antitumor agent, although significantly less so than the conjugate made with intact OX7. Unexpectedly, the acute toxicity of saporin to mice (median lethal dose = 6.8 mg/kg) was elevated eightfold to sixteenfold by conjugation to OX7, R10, or OX7 F(ab')2. Histologic examination of recipients of the immunotoxin revealed gross damage to hepatic parenchymal cells and to the white pulp of the spleen, neither of which was caused by unconjugated saporin. Ricin A-chain coupled to OX7 antibody was one hundredfold to one thousandfold less effective than OX7-saporin as an antitumor agent in vivo, although the two immunotoxins were equally cytotoxic to AKR-A cells in vitro.","['Thorpe, P E', 'Brown, A N', 'Bremner, J A Jr', 'Foxwell, B M', 'Stirpe, F']","['Thorpe PE', 'Brown AN', 'Bremner JA Jr', 'Foxwell BM', 'Stirpe F']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', '*Immunotoxins', 'Isoantibodies/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Nude', '*N-Glycosyl Hydrolases', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Plant Proteins/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1', 'Ribosomes/*drug effects', 'Ricin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Saporins', 'Spleen/drug effects']",1985/07/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1985 Jul;75(1):151-9.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Isoantibodies)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', '0 (anti-Thy antibody)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (Saporins)']",,,,,

Cytotoxicity occurred with normal adherent spleen cells as well as dextran-elicited peritoneal exudate (PE) cells but not with resident PE cells. Susceptibility of the leukemia cells to natural cytotoxicity increased to maximum levels upon treatment with 210 mM DMSO for 2-3 days. The natural cytotoxicity assayed by the 51Cr release procedure was first detectable after 9 hours of incubation and reached maximum levels by 24-30 hours. Although both DMSO and n-butyric acid induced rapid erythroid cell differentiation of the GM 979 cells, and both resulted in increased hemoglobin synthesis, only DMSO treatment enhanced the susceptibility of the cells to natural cytotoxicity by normal splenocytes. Cell-free supernatants from adherent spleen cells cocultured with DMSO-treated GM 979 cells for 6-15 hours were markedly cytotoxic for cultures of other chromium-labeled DMSO-treated leukemia cells. Supernatants from cultured adherent spleen cells alone, or lysates of DMSO-treated leukemia cells, did not possess cytotoxic activity. Resident peritoneal macrophages also had no cytotoxic activity against DMSO-treated cells, and culture supernatants from resident PE cells, even after incubation with DMSO-treated target cells, failed to show significant levels of cytotoxicity. These results indicate that normal splenic adherent cells as well as elicited PE cells have the ability to lyse DMSO-treated leukemia cells.","['Hsu, K H', 'Friedman, H']","['Hsu KH', 'Friedman H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Animals', 'Ascitic Fluid', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Histocompatibility', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C/immunology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL/immunology', 'Mice, Inbred DBA/immunology', 'Spleen/cytology']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1985 Jul;75(1):105-10.,"['1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,

The estimated average mean bone marrow dose for the spondylitics is more than twice that for atomic bomb survivors, and yet spondylitics experienced only half the risk of radiation-induced leukemia of atomic bomb survivors. For sites that were heavily irradiated in the spondylitics, provisional estimates indicate comparable doses in the two studies, and similar levels of cancer risk were observed. For these sites, when information from the studies was combined, there were statistically significant excesses for cancers of the esophagus, stomach, lung, and ovaries, multiple myeloma, other lymphomas, and tumors of the spinal cord and nerves. Very high relative risks (RR's) for tumors of the spinal cord and nerves were observed in both studies. For sites that were lightly irradiated in the spondylitics, in addition to previously documented sites, there was a statistically significant excess of cancers of the liver and gallbladder among atomic bomb survivors. A previous subdivision of cancer sites into radiosensitive and other tissues was not supported by the atomic bomb survivor data. Changes in the rates of radiation-induced cancers with age at exposure and time since exposure were studied and compared with the use of generalized linear modeling of the RR's and also by examination of the excess mortality rates. The level of agreement between the two studies was high; provided it is accepted that the reduced level of leukemia risk in the spondylitics is due to cell sterilization, no inconsistencies were found. For a group of solid tumors selected from heavily irradiated sites in the spondylitics, excess risk increased with both age at exposure and time since exposure and RR decreased with age at exposure, but it did not vary with time since exposure between about 5 and at least 30 years following exposure. The finding of a constant RR with time since exposure did not extend to all remaining neoplasms other than leukemia, because the RR for these neoplasms increased with time since exposure in atomic bomb survivors.","['Darby, S C', 'Nakashima, E', 'Kato, H']","['Darby SC', 'Nakashima E', 'Kato H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology/*mortality', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Risk', 'Spondylitis, Ankylosing/complications/*radiotherapy', 'United Kingdom']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1985 Jul;75(1):1-21.,,,,,,

In five patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) an unusual pattern of a slow and progressive decrease of immature blasts with a concomitant increase in mature cellular elements was observed following intensive combination chemotherapy. All patients eventually achieved complete remission, four of them without an intermediate phase of marrow hypoplasia. This morphologic pattern of response suggests that leukemic cellular differentiation rather than cytotoxicity was one mechanism involved in remission induction. Cytogenetic studies of remission revealed disappearance of the cytogenetic marker, the balanced translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 15 and 17. This remission induction process appears to be due to the cellular biologic characteristic rather than the therapy used as it occurs in a substantial proportion of patients with APL.

The intent was to assess the efficacy of VP-16 in an otherwise conventional reinduction plan, especially in patients who had previously received teniposide (VM-26), the close congener of VP-16. Among the 46 patients who received at least two courses of the therapy, 16 (0.34) achieved complete remission. Seven others showed improvement in their bone marrow status. Each child had been heavily pretreated with prednisone and vincristine, and 14 had received VM-26. That seven patients judged to be clinically resistant to VM-26 had complete responses to prednisone-vincristine-VP-16 indicates that prior treatment with one podophyllotoxin derivative does not preclude responses to the other.

Remission durations ranged from one to eight months (median, four months), emphasizing the need to devise more effective continuation therapy, including investigational agents such as the epipodophyllotoxins.","['Abromowitch, M', 'Bowman, W P', 'Ochs, J', 'Rivera, G']","['Abromowitch M', 'Bowman WP', 'Ochs J', 'Rivera G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1985/06/01 00:00,1985/06/01 00:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1985.3.6.789 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1985 Jun;3(6):789-92. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1985.3.6.789.,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,

Since this drug is used in the long term prophylaxis of fungal infections in patients with haematological malignancies, we have investigated whether such patients have evidence of adrenocortical suppression. Six patients on long term prophylaxis with ketoconazole were given tetracosactrin stimulation tests. All patients had high basal cortisol concentrations, which increased further after administration of 25 IU of tetracosactrin. It is concluded that leukaemic patients receiving long term ketoconazole treatment do not have adrenocortical suppression.

Both hormones were greater than 95% pure as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and had specific activities similar to or greater than standard samples of the same hormone as judged by several bioassays. Small single crystals of bovine growth hormone were obtained by vapor diffusion techniques. Examination of these crystals by x-ray diffraction, using the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source, showed that they were well ordered, and exhibited diffraction to 2.8-A resolution on still photographs. Precession and oscillation photographs showed that they belonged to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) (or P2(1)2(1)2) with unit cell dimensions a = 219 A, b = 51.9 A, c = 68.9 A. The density of the crystals was 1.19 +/- 0.02 g/ml from which the presence of eight 45,000-dalton dimers/unit cell was deduced. The protein content of the crystals was shown by isoelectric focusing to be identical to that of purified growth hormone in solution.

The binding molar ratio of the 38K-dimer protein to purified skeletal muscle actin was saturated at 1:3, and when the 38K-dimer/actin ratio exceeded 1:12, gelation occurred. This gelation was completely inhibited by the presence of either 10 mM KCl or 20 mM NaCl. The protein induced actin filament bundling, which required a higher 38K-dimer/actin ratio and was not affected by the presence of monovalent cations. During the differentiation of Ml cells, the sensitivity of the 38K protein to monovalent cations was decreased; that is 20 mM KCl or 50 mM NaCl was required to inhibit the gelation by the 38K protein isolated from differentiated cells. On the other hand, the intracellular K+ content of Ml cells decreased from 70 +/- 5 mM to 18 +/- 3 mM, and Na+ increased from 10 +/- 5 mM to 40 +/- 10 mM during the differentiation. These findings suggest that the differentiation brought about conditions favourable for the 38K protein to induce actin gelation, and in turn, the locomotive and phagocytic activities which were induced only after differentiation in this cell line.","['Takagi, K', 'Ichikawa, Y', 'Nagata, K']","['Takagi K', 'Ichikawa Y', 'Nagata K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microfilament Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Potassium/*metabolism', 'Sodium/*metabolism']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a135096 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem. 1985 Feb;97(2):605-16. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a135096.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (F-actin-binding proteins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",,,,,

Also, the plasma fibrinogen was found to be partially degraded to early, X-like, fibrinogen degradation products. These early fibrinogen fragments were isolated and showed a low anticoagulant activity in a thrombin time test. Early fibrinogen degradation products, produced with leukocyte elastase in vitro, have a similar low anticoagulant activity. In contrast, plasmic degradation products inhibit clotting of fibrinogen to a large extent. Although alpha 2-antiplasmin and plasminogen levels were low, antithrombin III levels were not decreased. The low anticoagulant activity of the isolated fibrinogen fragments, the presence of elastase activity in the plasma--both immunological and amidolytic--and the normal levels of antithrombin III suggest that granulocytic enzymes, whose release was enhanced by the cytostatic treatment, were responsible for degradation of fibrinogen in this patient.","['Sterrenberg, L', 'Haak, H L', 'Brommer, E J', 'Nieuwenhuizen, W']","['Sterrenberg L', 'Haak HL', 'Brommer EJ', 'Nieuwenhuizen W']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Haemostasis,Haemostasis,0371574,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antithrombin III/analysis', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders/diagnosis/etiology', 'Daunorubicin/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/diagnosis', 'Female', 'Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products/analysis', 'Fibrinogen/*metabolism', 'Granulocytes/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/complications/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancreatic Elastase/*blood', 'Thrombin Time']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000215133 [doi]'],ppublish,Haemostasis. 1985;15(2):126-33. doi: 10.1159/000215133.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products)', '9000-94-6 (Antithrombin III)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', 'EC 3.4.21.36 (Pancreatic Elastase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,

Furthermore, an example is given of describing the kinetics of growth of leukemia in the liver, based on serial determinations of leukemic cells with the MCA technique. The population doubling time (Td) in the liver calculated in this way did not significantly differ from that derived from time-consuming and expensive bioassays.

It could be demonstrated that the effect of the photoactivated HPD on cell viability was drug, dose, and light fluorescence dependent. Cellular protein synthesis and Friend virus complex release from the cells were equally inhibited by the photodynamic sensitization of the drug, indicating no specific effect on virus maturation. Since cholesterol affects the fluidity of cell membranes, it was important to study the effect of cholesterol enrichment on the photodynamic sensitization by HPD. It was found that, while a 50% reduction in protein synthesis was monitored following treatment with 20 micrograms of HPD per ml and illumination by a 6-milliwatt white light for 60 s, no inhibition was observed following preenrichment of the cells with 0.5, 1, or 2% of cholesterol hemisuccinate. The same trend of cholesterol protection was demonstrated with longer illumination periods up to 10 min. The protective effect of cholesterol hemisuccinate was also seen using scanning electron microscopy.

In these studies, cells were incubated with Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase to remove surface sialic acid. Reappearance of membrane sialic acid during drug treatment was followed (a) by measuring changes in radioactive surface labeling of viable cells with sodium metaperiodate-sodium[3H]-borohydride, (b) by measuring the decline in accessible surface galactosyl receptor sites which occurred coincident with membrane sialic acid replacement, and (c) by measuring the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into membrane-associated neuraminidase-labile sialic acid. We were especially interested in learning whether drugs that affect intracellular pools of cytidine triphosphate (CTP), an important nucleotide intermediate in sialylation reactions, could inhibit regeneration of membrane sialic acid. 3-Deazauridine, a competitive inhibitor of CTP synthetase, depleted CTP pools and curtailed surface membrane resialylation with little or no effect on synthesis of de novo sialic acid from precursor sugars. The addition of cytidine restored CTP pools and sialic acid regeneration. Acivicin, a glutamine antagonist, also depleted CTP pools and curtailed surface membrane resialylation. In addition, it retarded de novo synthesis of sialic acid. The addition of cytidine restored intracellular CTP pools and sialic acid regeneration. However, both cytidine and guanosine were required to restore sialic acid synthesis from precursor sugars. 1-beta-D-Arabinofuranosylcytosine, a competitive inhibitor of sialic acid synthetase and of sialyltransferase, inhibited both de novo sialic acid synthesis and membrane resialylation. Only the latter effect was reversed by the addition of exogenous cytidine. Hydroxyurea, an agent shown previously to inhibit glycoconjugate production in hamster fibroblasts, curtailed membrane resialylation and de novo synthesis of sialic acid without depleting CTP pools. Doxorubicin, at levels that caused marked arrest of cell proliferation, had no effect on sialic acid synthesis or expression on the membrane surface. These data suggest that antimetabolites, apart from their cytotoxic effects or effects on cellular growth, may directly inhibit the expression of membrane sialic acid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Hindenburg, A A', 'Taub, R N', 'Grant, S', 'Chang, G', 'Baker, M A']","['Hindenburg AA', 'Taub RN', 'Grant S', 'Chang G', 'Baker MA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['3-Deazauridine/pharmacology', 'Agglutination', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Cytidine Triphosphate/analysis', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Glucosamine/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoxazoles/pharmacology', 'Lectins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'N-Acetylneuraminic Acid', 'Pyrimidines/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sialic Acids/*metabolism']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Jul;45(7):3048-52.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '263CU738ZY (3-Deazauridine)', '65-47-4 (Cytidine Triphosphate)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'GZP2782OP0 (N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)', 'N08U5BOQ1K (Glucosamine)', 'O0X60K76I6 (acivicin)']",,"['CA-31761/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31762/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-35601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,

Acute leukemia with and without preceding myelodysplastic features did not differ in immunophenotype. Mean spontaneous release of 51Cr was 12.7% and complement alone caused an additional average release of 11.8%. Four single antibodies together with complement showed a mean 51Cr release of 0.7-32.4% above that found with complement alone. Combinations of Moabs resulted in 51Cr release at least 10% above the single most efficient Moab in 8 out of 12 patients. Not all blast cells showed antibody binding, nor were all antibody-binding cells susceptible to cytotoxicity. Normal bone marrow growth in vitro seemed to be stimulated by factors in complement and in the Moab. When this stimulation was compensated for by adding fetal calf serum, cytotoxicity tests prior to CFUc assays resulted in a mean decrease of 46% of colonies and 25% of clusters in normal bone marrow.

A Pediatric Oncology Group study.,81-7,"Eighty-seven children with central nervous system (CNS) leukemia were randomized to receive either induction intrathecal chemotherapy (ITC) and cranial irradiation (CRT) plus maintenance ITC, or induction ITC and craniospinal irradiation (CSpRT) with no maintenance ITC. ITC consisted of six weekly injections of methotrexate, hydrocortisone, and arabinosylcytosine. Also, intensification of systemic induction and maintenance chemotherapy was given. CRT + ITC was given as CRT, 2400 rad in 12 fractions followed by ITC maintenance bimonthly for 2 years. Craniospinal irradiation consisted of CRT + 1400 rad in ten fractions to the spine. Randomization was stratified according to whether CNS leukemia occurred at initial diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (Stratum I, 15 patients), during first bone marrow (BM) remission (Stratum II, 49 patients), simultaneous with first BM relapse (Stratum III, 12 patients), or during second BM remission (Stratum IV, 11 patients). The median follow-up for patients who remain at risk is 15 + months. Eight children (seven on CRT + ITC, one on CSpRT) developed presumed therapy related encephalopathy. In Stratum II, 16 of 29 (55%) patients receiving CRT + ITC experienced adverse events: 3 deaths during continuous complete remission (CCR) and 13 relapses (2 CNS, 1 CNS + BM, 1 BM + testes, and 2 testes) as compared with only 5 relapses in 20 (25%) patients on CSpRT (1 CNS, 1 CNS + BM, 1 BM, and 2 testes). The children on both regimens were comparable for sex, race, age at initial ALL diagnosis, time from ALL diagnosis to first episode of CNS leukemia, systemic therapy both before and after CNS relapse, and number of blasts in the spinal fluid at diagnosis of CNS leukemia. The conclusion is that children with isolated CNS leukemia can achieve prolonged survival with aggressive therapy, and that CSpRT is possibly less toxic and more likely than is CRT + ITC to prevent subsequent BM and testicular relapse (P less than 0.02), but not subsequent CNS relapse (P = 0.7).

The various techniques which have been applied to establish the phospholipid localization include the following: phospholipase A2, phospholipase C, and sphingomyelinase C treatment, fluorescamine labeling of phosphatidylethanolamine, and a phosphatidylcholine transfer protein mediated exchange procedure. The data obtained with these different techniques were found to be in good agreement with each other. Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol were found to be distributed symmetrically over both layers of the plasma membrane of Friend cells. In contrast, sphingomyelin was found to be enriched in the outer layer of the membrane (80-85%), and phosphatidylserine appeared to be present mainly in the inner layer (80-90%). From these results, it was calculated that the outer and inner layers accounted for 46% and 54%, respectively, of the total phospholipid complement of that membrane. Analogous studies on the plasma membrane of mature mouse erythrocytes showed that the transbilayer distribution of the total phospholipid mass appeared to be the same as in the plasma membrane of the Friend cell, namely, 46% and 54% in outer and inner layers, respectively. The outer layer of this membrane contains 57% of the phosphatidylcholine, 20% of the phosphatidylethanolamine, 85% of the sphingomyelin, and 42% of the phosphatidylinositol, and none of the phosphatidylserine was present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Rawyler, A', 'van der Schaft, P H', 'Roelofsen, B', 'Op den Kamp, J A']","['Rawyler A', 'van der Schaft PH', 'Roelofsen B', 'Op den Kamp JA']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Clone Cells/metabolism', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/*metabolism', 'Fluorescamine', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Phosphatidylcholines/metabolism', 'Phospholipases/pharmacology', 'Phospholipids/blood/*metabolism']",1985/03/26 00:00,1985/03/26 00:01,['1985/03/26 00:00'],"['1985/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00328a031 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1985 Mar 26;24(7):1777-83. doi: 10.1021/bi00328a031.,"['0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '38183-12-9 (Fluorescamine)', 'EC 3.1.- (Phospholipases)']",,,,,

Differentiation, as evidenced by cellular adherence, and morphological changes corresponded temporally to an increase in nonspecific esterase activity. The lysozyme concentration in the medium of uninduced HL-60 cells was 10 micrograms/10(7) cells, increasing to a maximum of 46 micrograms/10(7) cells after 48 h incubation with PMA (16 nM). At 72 h the lysozyme concentration decreased to 16 micrograms/10(7) cells. Intracellular lysozyme activity remained constant throughout differentiation. If HL-60 cells were exposed to PMA for 24 h, washed, then maintained in normal medium, they differentiated normally, confirming their irreversible commitment to differentiate. The increase in lysozyme secretion by these cells, however, is markedly blunted suggesting that continued PMA treatment of differentiated cells is required for their secretion of lysozyme. There is no change in the rate of extracellular degradation of lysozyme during differentiation. The level of lysozyme mRNA does not correlate directly with the amount of lysozyme secreted into the medium. Hybridization of uninduced HL-60 cell RNA with a chicken lysozyme cDNA probe demonstrates moderate hybridization. There is a modest (five-fold) increase in lysozyme mRNA between 0 and 36 h of exposure to PMA, corresponding to the burst of lysozyme secretion by these cells. The lysozyme mRNA decreases to a level which is lower than the original baseline by 72 h, when the cells are still secreting substantial amounts of lysozyme. These data suggest that both transcriptional and post-transcriptional controls are operative in the control of lysozyme gene expression during the differentiation of HL-60 cells. They also imply that lysozyme secretion is not a necessary component in the macrophage-monocyte differentiation of these cells.","['Polansky, D A', 'Yang, A', 'Brader, K', 'Miller, D M']","['Polansky DA', 'Yang A', 'Brader K', 'Miller DM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*genetics', 'Macrophages/enzymology', 'Muramidase/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1985.tb07380.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1985 May;60(1):7-17. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1985.tb07380.x.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,

The criteria for diagnosis of refractory anaemia (RA), acquired idiopathic sideroblastic anaemia (AISA) and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) were clearly defined, since the inclusion criteria provided by the FAB co-operative group are imprecise. None of these patients has received chemotherapy during the follow-up period. The median survival of the whole group was only 15 months, with less than 10% of the patients surviving after 5 years. Fifteen patients (17.6%) were still alive at time of analysis, 31 (36.5%) have developed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and only one of them is still alive; 30 (35.3%) died of infectious and/or haemorrhagic complications. Patients who developed AML had a shorter survival (median survival time 9.5 versus 15 months) but this difference was not significant (P = 0.10). Factors with prognostic value are in order of significance: abnormal localized immature myeloid precursors (= ALIP) in the trephine biopsy, circulating myeloblasts, excess of blasts in the bone marrow smears, age, FAB classification and granulocyte count. In comparison to refractory anaemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), CMML and RAEB in transformation (RAEBt), patients with RA and AISA had a lower incidence of evolution to AML (11% versus 56%), but a higher mortality rate from infections and/or bleeding (59.2% versus 29%). ALIP negative cases were only found among patients with RA and AISA, whereas ALIP positivity was observed in all cases of RAEB and RAEBt, in 10/11 patients with CMML and in almost half the cases of RA and AISA. In RA and AISA patients survival was significantly different between ALIP positive and ALIP negative cases (P = 0.009). Among MDS patients, ALIP negative cases developed significantly less AML than ALIP positive cases (5% versus 44%), but a similar percentage of mortality from infectious and/or haemorrhagic complications was seen in both groups (33% versus 36.5%). Chromosomal analysis proved to be of no significant prognostic value, although a trend for shorter survival was observed in patients with complex karyotype anomalies or without mitoses. Because of their prolonged survival, antileukaemic chemotherapy is contra-indicated in ALIP negative patients (median survival 50 months). Nevertheless they only constitute a minor subgroup of MDS cases. Prognosis in ALIP positive patients is poor (median survival 12.5 months); in these patients therapeutic trials with cytostatic drugs or with inducers of differentiation of myeloid precursor cells seem to be justified.","['Tricot, G', 'Vlietinck, R', 'Boogaerts, M A', 'Hendrickx, B', 'De Wolf-Peeters, C', 'Van den Berghe, H', 'Verwilghen, R L']","['Tricot G', 'Vlietinck R', 'Boogaerts MA', 'Hendrickx B', 'De Wolf-Peeters C', 'Van den Berghe H', 'Verwilghen RL']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/blood/complications/*mortality', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Syndrome', 'Time Factors']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1985.tb07381.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1985 May;60(1):19-32. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1985.tb07381.x.,,,,,,

However, growth inhibition alone was insufficient for induction of haemoglobin synthesis since other members of the series inhibited growth without substantially increasing the number of haemoglobin-producing cells.

This form of treatment appears to offer a useful alternative to intensive induction chemotherapy in those patients in whom such treatment is usually poorly tolerated, and has the advantage of being able to be given to an outpatient.","['Vincent, P C', 'Young, G A', 'Buck, M', 'Benson, W J']","['Vincent PC', 'Young GA', 'Buck M', 'Benson WJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Aust N Z J Med,Australian and New Zealand journal of medicine,1264322,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1445-5994.1985.tb02722.x [doi]'],ppublish,Aust N Z J Med. 1985 Feb;15(1):10-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.1985.tb02722.x.,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],,,,,

The homogenizate of the thymoma was always transplanted i.p. into the same mouse strain. When the cells taken from leukemic AKR mice were transplanted into adult C3H/He mice, these did not cause leukemia in the recipients. However, it turned out that the lymphoma cells were able to proliferate in the F3 hybrids of AKR male mouse crossed with C3H/He female. The question then arose, whether the donor cells originated from the AKR mouse grew and caused the lymphoma, or the transplanted cells would induce the cells of the recipient to develop lymphoma. On the basis of the results it was established that the AKR lymphoma cells themselves started developing in the recipients, when they were transplanted into hybrid mice and the cells of the recipient did not. The identification of the transplanted cells was done by the presence of the Rb [4.15] metacentric marker chromosome. These cells were found in the thymus, the lymph nodes and in the developing ascites of the hybrid mice. Two kinds of cell types were found in the lymph nodes, one of them contained the marker, while other did not. The spleen cells were free of the marker chromosome. These data suggest that the thymus manifestation of the AKR mouse lymphoma is heterogeneous--it consists at least of two major types of tumor cells. One of them has affinity to the thymus and the lymph nodes, while the other to the spleen and the lymph nodes too.","['Selypes, A', 'Berencsi, G']","['Selypes A', 'Berencsi G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Arch Geschwulstforsch,Archiv fur Geschwulstforschung,0372411,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hybridization, Genetic', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Trisomy']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Geschwulstforsch. 1985;55(2):111-6.,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],,,,,

Two out of three thymidine kinase-deficient P388 clones showed significantly enhanced sensitivity to killing by all three mutagens. This increased sensitivity to killing was also reflected in increased mutagenesis by the three mutagens. In the L5178Y cell line, wild-type cells showed little difference to two thymidine kinase-deficient clones in terms of mutagen sensitivity. This indicates that thymidine kinase may be significant for DNA repair processes in P388 but not in L5178Y cells. Unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) experiments were carried out on P388 and L5178Y wild-type cells and wild-type Friend leukemia cells (which are mutagen-sensitive when deficient in thymidine kinase). The UDS experiments showed the L5178Y cells were low in excision repair abilities relative to the P388 cells and the Friend cell clone. This indicates that the increased mutagen sensitivity in thymidine kinase-deficient P388 and clone 707 Friend cells may be due to thymidine kinase playing an indirect role in DNA excision repair, a process which is of little significance in the L5178Y cell line.","['McKenna, P G', 'Yasseen, A A', 'McKelvey, V J']","['McKenna PG', 'Yasseen AA', 'McKelvey VJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Somat Cell Mol Genet,Somatic cell and molecular genetics,8403568,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Clone Cells', '*DNA Repair/drug effects/radiation effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia L5178/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia P388/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagens/toxicity', 'Mutation', 'Thioguanine/pharmacology', 'Thymidine Kinase/deficiency/*genetics', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01534680 [doi]'],ppublish,Somat Cell Mol Genet. 1985 May;11(3):239-46. doi: 10.1007/BF01534680.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Mutagens)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",,,,,

This process is thought to require several days of exposure to the inducer, thus making it difficult to identify the early cellular changes which are fundamental to the differentiation program, and to relate the induction to phases of the cell cycle. In order to study the kinetics of leukemic cell differentiation we have developed a system for the induction of rapid monocytic maturation in a subpopulation of HL 60 cells. The cells are exposed to 10(-7) M 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol for 4 hr in serum-free medium. Subsequent incubation in a complete medium results in cellular differentiation recognizable by several criteria (phagocytosis, nonspecific esterase reaction, adherence to substratum, cell morphology) beginning at 10 hr from the exposure to the inducer. Approximately 20 hr later 30-40% of the cells in culture show the differentiated phenotype and are capable of phagocytosis. The proportion of differentiated cells in culture decreases thereafter.

To further our understanding of the IgE system, we have engaged in the molecular cloning of genes for some of these proteins. In studying the in vitro translation products of mRNA from rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells, we have identified a Mr 31,000 polypeptide that binds IgE and is also reactive with antibodies to proteins affinity-purified from RBL cells with IgE immunoadsorbent. For the molecular cloning, double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from sucrose gradient-fractionated RBL mRNA, inserted into plasmid pBR322, and used to transform Escherichia coli. By screening transformants with a hybridization-selection/in vitro translation procedure, we identified one clone containing cDNA that hybridized to mRNA coding for a Mr 31,000 IgE-binding protein. The DNA sequence of this cloned cDNA (571 base pairs) was determined and the amino acid sequence corresponding to part of the protein was deduced. In RNA blot analysis, the cDNA hybridized with a mRNA of 1100 nucleotides found in RBL cells but absent in cells not expressing IgE receptors. This cloned cDNA most likely codes for the Mr 31,000 IgE-binding protein identified in RBL cells, which appears to be related to the IgE-binding phenotype of the cells and which may have a significant role in the IgE-mediated activation of basophils and mast cells.","['Liu, F T', 'Albrandt, K', 'Mendel, E', 'Kulczycki, A Jr', 'Orida, N K']","['Liu FT', 'Albrandt K', 'Mendel E', 'Kulczycki A Jr', 'Orida NK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', '*Prostatic Secretory Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*genetics']",1985/06/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.12.4100 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Jun;82(12):4100-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.12.4100.,"['0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Prostatic Secretory Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (beta-microseminoprotein)', '0 (immunoglobulin-binding factors)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",,['AI19747/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],PMC397942,['GENBANK/M13697'],

EL4 mouse lymphoma cells are resistant to lysis by glucocorticoids due to mutant receptors that exhibit abnormal DNA binding. Hybrids between the two cell lines were prepared and analyzed with respect to glucocorticoid responsiveness and to receptor types by DNA-cellulose chromatrography. Sensitive hybrid cell clones contained the CEM-C7-specific receptor in addition to the EL4 type of receptor. Several sensitive hybrid cell clones were used for selection of resistant segregants by growth in the presence of high concentrations of glucocorticoid. These segregants had lost the wild-type CEM-C7 receptor, while the EL4-specific receptor was retained. To identify the human chromosome that was lost concordantly with the CEM-C7 receptor the chromosomes of hybrid cells were studied by alkaline Giemsa (G-11) staining and trypsin/Giemsa banding. All hybrids contained human chromosomes in addition to one to two sets of EL4 chromosomes. Human chromosome 5 was present in all hybrid cell clones that expressed the CEM-C7 receptor and it was absent from those that did not.

A cDNA clone of the messenger for the L subunit has been isolated from a human monocyte-like leukemia cell line. The clone contains an open reading frame of 522 nucleotides coding for an amino acid sequence matching 97% of the published sequence of human liver ferritin L subunit determined by sequenator, but it corresponds to only 55% of the reported amino acid sequence of a human liver H-subunit clone. Nevertheless, computer analysis of the subunit conformations predicted from the open reading frames of the L and H clones shows that most of the amino acid differences are conservative and would allow both subunits to form the five alpha-helices and beta-turns established by x-ray crystallography for horse spleen ferritin subunits. This suggests that L and H subunits are structurally interchangeable in forming an apoferritin shell. The 5' untranslated region of our human ferritin L clone has considerable homology with that of the rat liver ferritin L clone in the region immediately upstream from the initiator codon, notably showing an identical sequence of 10 nucleotides at the same position in both subunit clones that may participate in regulating the known activation of ferritin mRNA after iron administration. Extensive homology, including several blocks of nucleotides, was identified between the 3' untranslated regions of the human and rat L clones. The common structural features of the H and L subunits lead us to conclude that they have diverged from a single ancestral gene.","['Dorner, M H', 'Salfeld, J', 'Will, H', 'Leibold, E A', 'Vass, J K', 'Munro, H N']","['Dorner MH', 'Salfeld J', 'Will H', 'Leibold EA', 'Vass JK', 'Munro HN']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/genetics', 'Ferritins/*genetics', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Weight', 'Protein Conformation', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.10.3139 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 May;82(10):3139-43. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.10.3139.,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",,,PMC397730,['GENBANK/M10119'],

Screening programs focusing on its early detection in this age-group are needed to allow maximum opportunity for cure. Also important is convincing the older patients who smoke that stopping is still worthwhile. Compared with younger patients, the elderly have more intercurrent medical illnesses and are more likely to suffer from financial difficulties and loss of family support. These factors must be considered when managing these patients. Although age-imposed compromises in treatment are often made, available data suggest that a priori dose reduction of chemotherapy on the basis of age alone is not indicated in patients with solid tumors. Prospective clinical trials are needed to further address the issue of responsiveness to chemotherapy as a function of age. Such trials should include assessment of physiologic age and quality of life.","['Neilan, B A']",['Neilan BA'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Postgrad Med,Postgraduate medicine,0401147,IM,"['*Aged', 'Aging', 'Colonic Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology/etiology/*therapy', 'Rectal Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Semustine/therapeutic use', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis/epidemiology']",1985/06/01 00:00,1985/06/01 00:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/00325481.1985.11699033 [doi]'],ppublish,"Postgrad Med. 1985 Jun;77(8):143-5, 148-9. doi: 10.1080/00325481.1985.11699033.","['13909-09-6 (Semustine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,['CA 21358/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,

However, it is immunogenic in humans and may lead to hypersensitivity reactions. The immunological basis of these reactions is not clear. Since the presence of l-Asp specific IgG-antibodies seems to correlate better with clinical reactions than IgE-antibodies and IgG-antibodies are known to be able to fix and activate the complement system, we speculated that the mechanism of anaphylaxis may be complement- rather than IgE-mediated. We analyzed 24 children with ALL (age 2-15 yr) for changes in the complement system during l-Asp infusions. Chemotherapy was administered according to the CoALL 82 protocol which is derived from the CoALL 80 protocol recently published. The formation of specific antibodies of IgM and IgG classes against l-Asp was monitored by a solid phase ELISA. The immunological responsiveness of individual patients varied over a wide range but both types of antibodies were induced. Anaphylactic reactions were observed on eight occasions in eight children. The infusions in the remaining 16 patients were tolerated without clinical reactions. Significant activation of complement was demonstrated in seven of eight reaction occasions and in none of the occasions without reactions. The most important complement activation parameter monitored was the C3 split product C3d measured in EDTA-plasma. We conclude that anaphylaxis to l-Asp in patients with ALL can be explained in most instances on the basis of complement activation induced by the formation of immune complexes of l-Asp and specific antibodies of IgM and IgG classes.","['Fabry, U', 'Korholz, D', 'Jurgens, H', 'Gobel, U', 'Wahn, V']","['Fabry U', 'Korholz D', 'Jurgens H', 'Gobel U', 'Wahn V']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anaphylaxis/*chemically induced/immunology', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/immunology', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Complement Activation', 'Complement C3/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Male']",1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1203/00006450-198519040-00017 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Res. 1985 Apr;19(4):400-8. doi: 10.1203/00006450-198519040-00017.,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Complement C3)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,,

The present study extends these findings by demonstrating that ara-C treatment of K562 cells results in both increased heme synthesis and accumulation of alpha-, gamma-, epsilon-, and zeta-globin RNA. The results also demonstrate that ara-C enhances K562 cell surface expression of glycophorin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that phorbol ester (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; TPA) inhibits the effects of ara-C on heme production, accumulation of globin RNA, and glycophorin expression. The inhibitory effect occurs maximally when K562 cells are treated with TPA before undergoing ara-C-induced commitment to erythroid differentiation. These findings suggest that TPA inhibits an early step in the process required for ara-C to enhance expression of genes involved in the erythroid program.","['Watanabe, T', 'Mitchell, T', 'Sariban, E', 'Sabbath, K', 'Griffin, J', 'Kufe, D']","['Watanabe T', 'Mitchell T', 'Sariban E', 'Sabbath K', 'Griffin J', 'Kufe D']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Replication', 'Globins/genetics', 'Glycophorins/metabolism', 'Heme/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1985/06/01 00:00,1985/06/01 00:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1985 Jun;27(6):683-8.,"['0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,"['CA-29431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,

CPD was indeed found to have an inhibitory effect on growth of colonies of all types when added to serum-stimulated cultures.

An international collaboration among cancer registries.,955-75,"The numbers of second cancers among 182,040 women treated for cervical cancer that were reported to 15 cancer registries in 8 countries were compared to the numbers expected had the same risk prevailed as in the general population. A small 9% excess of second cancers (5,146 observed vs. 4,736 expected) occurred 1 or more years after treatment. Large radiation doses experienced by 82,616 women did not dramatically alter their risk of developing a second cancer; at most, about 162 of 3,324 second cancers (approximately equal to 5%) could be attributed to radiation. The relative risk (RR = 1.1) for developing cancer in organs close to the cervix that had received high radiation exposures--most notably, the bladder, rectum, uterine corpus, ovary, small intestine, bone, and connective tissue--and for developing multiple myeloma increased with time since treatment. No similar increase was seen for 99,424 women not treated with radiation. Only a slight excess of acute and non-lymphocytic leukemia was found among irradiated women (RR = 1.3), and substantially fewer cases were observed than expected on the basis of current radiation risk estimates. The small risk of leukemia may be associated with low doses of radiation absorbed by the bone marrow outside the pelvis, inasmuch as the marrow in the pelvis may have been destroyed or rendered inactive by very large radiotherapy exposures. There was little evidence of a radiation effect for cancers of the stomach, colon, liver, and gallbladder, for melanoma and other skin cancers, or for chronic lymphocytic leukemia despite substantial exposures. An excess of thyroid cancer possibly was related to the low dose received by this organ. Ovarian damage caused by radiation may have been responsible for a low breast cancer risk (RR = 0.7), which was evident even among postmenopausal women. A substantial excess of lung cancer (RR = 3.7) largely may be due to misclassification of metastases and the confounding influence of cigarette smoking. Women who were under 30 or over 50 years of age when irradiated were at greatest absolute risk for developing a second cancer. The RR, however, was higher among those under age 30 years at exposure (RR = 3.9) than among older women. The expression period for radiation-induced solid tumors appeared to continue to the end of life.","['Boice, J D Jr', 'Day, N E', 'Andersen, A', 'Brinton, L A', 'Brown, R', 'Choi, N W', 'Clarke, E A', 'Coleman, M P', 'Curtis, R E', 'Flannery, J T']","['Boice JD Jr', 'Day NE', 'Andersen A', 'Brinton LA', 'Brown R', 'Choi NW', 'Clarke EA', 'Coleman MP', 'Curtis RE', 'Flannery JT', 'et al.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Abdominal Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma in Situ/epidemiology/surgery', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'International Cooperation', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', '*Registries', 'Risk', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Thoracic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Time Factors', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology/*pathology/radiotherapy/surgery']",1985/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1985 May;74(5):955-75.,,,,,,

Accordingly, DBA/2J mice were given iv injections of 1 X 10(6) L1210 leukemia cells 3 days before histidinol-anticancer drug treatments.

Following various drug treatments, quantitative and selective survival assays were performed of normal femoral cells and of clonogenic L1210 leukemia cells isolated from the femurs of treated mice. These experiments demonstrated that L-histidinol not only protected the marrow cell population from both ara-C and FUra, but also increased significantly the toxicities of these agents for the intrafemoral tumor cells.

The remaining 28 patients (26%) have had no or one additional CNS relapse and have received therapy for a median of eight years. One half of this surviving group of patients have had major CNS toxicity, including seizures (9), major motor disability (2), and intracranial calcifications (12/19). When neuropsychologic evaluations were compared between the 28 survivors and 50 of their contemporaries who had been in initial continuous complete remission, the CNS survivors had significantly lower Full Scale IQ scores (83 +/- 16 v 99 +/- 14, P = less than .001) with similarly lower measures of academic performance. The relative contributions of meningeal leukemia itself and intrathecal or radiation therapy to these effects cannot be determined.

This decreased Na+/K+-pump activity has been proposed to be an essential step in differentiation which would cause a rise in intracellular Na+ concentration and then, by means of Na+/Ca2+ exchange, an increase in intracellular Ca2+. An increase in intracellular Ca2+ has been proposed to be essential for induction of differentiation. A critical prediction of this Na+-Ca2+ hypothesis is the rise in intracellular Na+. To test this prediction we have measured intracellular Na+ using a novel triple isotope method involving 3H2O, [14C]sucrose, and 22Na to measure total water, extracellular fluid, and Na+, respectively. 22Na equilibration occurred in less than 10 min. In uninduced cells, intracellular Na+ was 15.2 +/- 2.2 mM (S.D., n = 22); after induction for 14-16 h with dimethyl sulfoxide, intracellular Na+ decreased significantly (p less than 0.0001) to 8.4 +/- 1.4 mM (n = 21). The time course of the decline in intracellular Na+ paralleled that of the decrease in the Na+/K+-pump activity. These results are in direct contradiction to the Na+-Ca2+ hypothesis and suggest that observed changes in Na+/K+-pump activity can be explained solely on the basis of changes in intracellular Na+. The drop in intracellular Na+ is due to a decrease in Na+ influx. We suggest, however, that the decrease in the Na+ influx is not itself an essential event of differentiation, but may be induced by a change in the flux of another ion coupled to Na+.","['Lannigan, D A', 'Knauf, P A']","['Lannigan DA', 'Knauf PA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Sodium/*metabolism']",1985/06/25 00:00,1985/06/25 00:01,['1985/06/25 00:00'],"['1985/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)39610-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1985 Jun 25;260(12):7322-4.,['9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)'],,"['AM27495/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL18208/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,

This system exhibited a cation preference for manganese at an optimal concentration of 0.5 mM. Moderate activity was detectable with magnesium at an optimal concentration of 5.0 mM, but calcium was inactive. Activity was markedly stimulated by phospholipid, with phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol exhibiting greater activity than phosphatidylserine. In isolated plasma membranes, the major substrate of this system was a 73-kDa protein, while cytoplasmic extracts exhibited larger amounts of a 42-kDa substrate. 73-kDa phosphorylating activity of membranes was comparably active at 0 and 31 degrees C, although in cytosol activity was greater at 31 degrees C. No 73-kDa protein phosphorylation was observed in the presence of Ca2+, Mg2+, and phosphatidylserine. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the 73-kD band revealed phosphothreonine and phosphoserine. The 42-kDa substrate was distinguishable from actin by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, which disclosed that both major substrates were highly basic in the isoelectric focusing dimension. Protamine and histones (H2B greater than H1 greater than H3) exhibited phospholipid-stimulated phosphorylation in the presence of Mn2+, but phosvitin, casein, and vinculin were not substrates. High levels of phosphorylative activity involving the 73-kDa substrate were noted in nuclear extracts. Complex patterns of increase of this activity were noted in both cytosol and nuclear extracts following induction of differentiation with dimethyl sulfoxide, retinoic acid, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. This study thus demonstrated the presence of a previously undescribed type of protein kinase activity which exhibited alterations during leukemic cellular differentiation.","['Elias, L', 'Davis, A']","['Elias L', 'Davis A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Manganese/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phospholipids/*metabolism', 'Protamines/metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",1985/06/10 00:00,1985/06/10 00:01,['1985/06/10 00:00'],"['1985/06/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/10 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)88882-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1985 Jun 10;260(11):7023-8.,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Protamines)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",,,,,

An accelerated development of cells of the basophilic lineage was observed and resulted in the appearance of 85% mature basophils after 14 days of incubation. Transmission electron microscopy of developing basophils showed changes in the nucleus and active granule formation in the cytoplasm. By scanning electron microscopy, the immature cells were relatively smooth in comparison with the mature basophils which showed membranous microvilli. The chemical content of the cells at different days of culture was detected by X-ray microanalysis. Immature cells were characterized by a high level of phosphorus with a low level of sulphur. As maturation progressed, the amount of phosphorus decreased, while the level of the sulphur increased, reaching its highest peak in the mature basophils. The different amount of sulphur found in the cells during the maturational process most probably represents the amount of heparin located in the cell granules. This finding may be useful for studying the influence of growth factors on the development and differentiation of human basophils.","['Fishman, P', 'Djaldetti, M', 'Hart, J', 'Sredni, B']","['Fishman P', 'Djaldetti M', 'Hart J', 'Sredni B']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,IM,"['Basophils/analysis/*ultrastructure', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Electron Probe Microanalysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Phosphorus/analysis', 'Sulfur/analysis']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1985 May;55(1):105-13.,"['27YLU75U4W (Phosphorus)', '70FD1KFU70 (Sulfur)']",,,PMC1453597,,

This transition can be monitored by flow cytometry as a decrease in green fluorescence. The complexes of denatured DNA and AO undergo immediate condensation and aggregation; this step is manifested by appearance of red luminescence and formation of precipitates that can be detected by electron microscopy. The precipitates form preferentially in heterochromatin as well as in ribosomes and polysomes. Their formation and further aggregation affects cellular light scatter properties in both the forward and right-angle direction. The AO-induced DNA denaturation and condensation was studied in nuclei of Friend erythroleukemia cells from exponentially growing, differentiated or quiescent cells. The DNA in nuclei of quiescent cells, from plateau-phase cultures, was the most sensitive to denaturation; it denatured (measured by changes in luminescence) at an AO concentration between 50 and 80 microM with the midpoint of the transition (Cd) at 70 microM. DNA in nuclei of differentiated cells (dimethyl-sulfoxide-induced erythroid differentiation) was more resistant (Cd = 77-83 microM), whereas DNA in exponentially growing cells was the most resistant (Cd = 86 microM). Extraction of proteins with 0.1 M HCl at 0 degree C abolished the differences between the cells and shifted the transition to a lower AO concentration (Cd = 46 microM). For comparison, the midpoint transitions representing condensation of free, nucleic acids measured as light scatter changes occurred at 13, 22, 31 and 53 microM of AO, for rRNA, tRNA, and denatured and native-calf thymus DNA, respectively. Denaturation and condensation of DNA, which can be induced by AO either in isolated nuclei or viable permeabilized or fixed cells provides a new approach to discriminate cell subpopulations with different chromatin structure by flow cytometry. The molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon are discussed.","['Darzynkiewicz, Z', 'Traganos, F', 'Kapuscinski, J', 'Melamed, M R']","['Darzynkiewicz Z', 'Traganos F', 'Kapuscinski J', 'Melamed MR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Acridine Orange/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/ultrastructure', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Light', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation/drug effects', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation/*drug effects', 'Scattering, Radiation']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990060305 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1985 May;6(3):195-207. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990060305.,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'F30N4O6XVV (Acridine Orange)']",,"['CA 28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,

These children fall into five karyotypic groups: (a) normal chromosomes; (b) hyperdiploid I, with chromosome numbers greater than 50, frequently with multiple copies of the same chromosome, and often lacking a consistent abnormal clone; (c) hyperdiploid II, with karyotypes having 47-49 chromosomes and usually with all of the karyotypically abnormal cells identical; (d) pseudodiploids, with either translocations or deletions of specific chromosomes; and (e) hypodiploids. Because few of this series of children have expired or relapsed, patients in the karyotypic groups have been considered in relation to those clinical factors that have been found to be of prognostic significance by the Children's Cancer Study Group.

We report the localization by cytologic hybridization of amplified c-myc DNA to a marker chromosome, M3q+, in an early passage of HL-60. The localization of c-myc to an ABR on an 8q+ chromosome was confirmed in later passage clones. The most probable derivation of the M3q+ chromosome is t(5p;17q) with additional material associated with c-myc amplification inserted into 17q. This localization is of interest in light of the association between t(15:17) and promyelocytic leukemia.

The following results have been obtained: (a) The vast majority of induced cells shows a highly significant increase in the number of active rRNA gene clusters per cell. At this time, the number of benzidine-positive cells and the quantity of hemoglobin per cell are almost doubled. (b) Specific rRNA gene clusters are activated within single cells. Activation can be visualized at the single gene cluster level. (c) The increase in the average number of active ribosomal gene clusters per cell is not due to clonal selection, but rather to diffuse activation of several gene clusters.

The membrane-associated form of the p37 translation product has been analyzed in detail here. When detergent lysates prepared from biosynthetically labeled K562 cells were reacted with an antiserum containing anti-p37T antibodies, one of the proteins immunoprecipitated had a nominal mol wt of 36,000 to 37,000 (p37M). Several results suggest that this protein is homologous to the p37 translation product: (1) the protein, like the mRNA coding for the p37 translation product, was expressed in cell lines with diverse differentiated phenotypes; (2) the antigenic determinant(s) on p37M and p37T are oriented to the inner surface of the erythrocyte membrane while being oriented to the outer surface of erythroleukemic cells; and (3) one-dimensional peptide maps show homology between p37M and p37T. P37M does not appear to possess an N-terminal leader sequence that is proteolytically cleaved as the molecule is inserted into the membrane.

By infecting three embryonal carcinoma cell lines, PCC4.aza1R, F9tk-, and Nulli-SCC1, with this recombinant virus, we have isolated many transductant clones that stably express the integrated neomycin-resistance gene. These clonal transductant lines consist of undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma cells as judged by morphology, tumorigenicity in 129/Sv mice, and cell-surface antigenic markers. Analysis of the integrated recombinant viral genes by Southern blot hybridization revealed that some of the lines have single copies, whereas others have multiple copies, probably in multiple sites. Although these transductant lines contained many copies of helper Mo-MuLV integrated in the cellular genome, expression of these helper viruses was not detected either by reverse transcriptase activity or by X-C plaque assay. Two F9tk--derived, G418-resistant transductant lines were superinfected with a second recombinant transducing virus that contains the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene flanked by the Mo-MuLV LTR. The frequency of transduction to yield clones able to grow in hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium was similar to that of the parental F9tk- cells.

From the wide variety of these disturbances seen in acute leukemias in childhood, the excess of potassium is most dangerous. Further electrolyte changes, which are however less evident, are hyperphosphataemia, hyperphosphaturia, and hypocalcaemia. The destruction of a large amount of cells during aggressive induction therapy can boost the electrolyte imbalance and therefore lead to renal failure. Such situations are demonstrated in two cases. Following Vincristine and Cyclophosphamide administration, electrolyte changes such as acute or prolonged decrease of sodium in the serum and urinary loss of sodium are seen frequently. Based on the data from 20 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemias we describe the dynamics of this process. These changes are probably caused by the syndrome of inadequate ADH-secretion.

None of these 10 patients showed induction of differentiation by cytosine arabinoside, adriamycin, or daunomycin, but treatment with these compounds showed in some patients an increase in the ratio of differentiated myeloid cells to blasts. The results indicate that this ratio can be increased by differentiation and also in some patients by toxicity to blast cells. With dexamethasone or vinblastine there was no induction of differentiation and no increase in this ratio in any of the 10 patients tested. After in vivo chemotherapy with low dose cytosine arabinoside, cells from one patient showed a similar response in culture to actinomycin D as cells before chemotherapy, whereas in another patient the cells had acquired the ability to respond to actinomycin D. In contrast, after high-dose in vivo chemotherapy with cytosine arabinoside and daunomycin, cells from a third patient seemed to have lost the ability to differentiate in vitro by MGI-2 containing medium or actinomycin D. The results indicate that pre-screening for differentiation-inducing compounds and compounds that show toxicity to blast cells should be useful to select the appropriate compounds to be used for therapy, and that it is advisable to screen the cells both before and after initiation of therapy.","['Lotem, J', 'Berrebi, A', 'Sachs, L']","['Lotem J', 'Berrebi A', 'Sachs L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Time Factors']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(85)90087-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(85)90087-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1985;9(2):249-58. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(85)90087-6.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)']",,,,,

Moreover, the relative abundance of c-myc-related RNA sequences in uninduced cells of each subline is directly proportional to the gene copy number. It is concluded that, while high levels of the c-myc gene and its transcripts may have had a role in the establishment of HL60 cells, these are not required for maintenance of the HL60 phenotype.

Myeloid differentiation and cell cycle arrest of HL-60 promyelocytes preceded by nuclear structural changes.,51-71,"The time-dependent dynamics of nuclear structure, cell cycle transit and arrest, and cellular differentiation were studied using the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. Myeloid differentiation of HL-60 cells was induced by 10(-6) M beta, all trans, retinoic acid (RA). During exponential growth the cells had G1, S, G2 and M durations of 9, 11, 0.5 and 0.5 h respectively. Significant growth arrest in the G1/0 phase of the cell cycle was apparent after 48 h of RA exposure or after two division cycles. Thereafter, cells arrested in G1/0 with wide dispersion in times of arrest which extended over several cell cycle generation times. The kinetics of phenotypic differentiation, detected by phorbol myristate acetate inducible superoxide production, paralleled those of G1/0 growth arrest with similar lag and dispersion. These kinetics are consistent with a model hypothesizing the existence of an S-phase differentiation control (DC) point regulating both terminal proliferation and differentiation. Before any cell differentiation or termination of cell proliferation occurred, the nuclei of RA-treated cells underwent a structural change detected by narrow-angle light scatter measured with flow cytometry. Narrow-angle light scatter was transiently reduced, reaching a nadir at 24-48 h and returning to control values at 96 h. This change was independent of cell cycle phase or total nuclear protein content. It was associated with a morphological change of the nuclear membrane from a smooth to dimpled or pitted structure. These findings focus attention on the potential significance of nuclear structural reorganization as an early event during cell differentiation.","['Yen, A', 'Reece, S L', 'Albright, K L']","['Yen A', 'Reece SL', 'Albright KL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*pathology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Granulocytes/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(85)90021-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1985;9(1):51-71. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(85)90021-9.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,"['BRSG RR 05372/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 31591/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,

Furthermore, a significant increase was found in the morbidity OR for Burkitt-like lymphoma in the San Francisco metropolitan area (OR: 9.1; CI: 1.8-45.6). In San Francisco County (which includes the City of San Francisco), there was a 2,043-fold increase in the morbidity OR for KS and a fivefold increase for Burkitt-like lymphomas, but there were no significant changes for other cancers between 1973-79 and 1982. Similarly, no significant changes in morbidity OR's were observed for other cancers in the remaining SEER registries. These findings provided statistical support for the excess risk of Burkitt-like lymphoma in a group at risk of AIDS.","['Biggar, R J', 'Horm, J', 'Lubin, J H', 'Goedert, J J', 'Greene, M H', 'Fraumeni, J F Jr']","['Biggar RJ', 'Horm J', 'Lubin JH', 'Goedert JJ', 'Greene MH', 'Fraumeni JF Jr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*complications', 'Adult', 'California', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Marriage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/epidemiology']",1985/04/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1985 Apr;74(4):793-7.,,,,,,

Flow cytometric analysis of mixtures of cells differing in M,N type showed binding specificities of greater than 100-fold for most of the antibodies, and showed that three antibodies bind cell-bound GPA with an affinity of approximately 10(9) M(-1). These data also showed that the level of expression of GPA varies by less than 10% from cell to cell and from individual to individual. Flow measurements were also done on human erythrocytes with the following variant forms of glycophorin: Mc, Mg, Mk, En(F), En(UK), Mi-I, Mi-II, Mi-III, S-s-U-, Tn+, and St(a+). Other cell types analyzed included erythrocytes from chimpanzee, rhesus, African green, and capuchin monkeys, and cells from the human erythroleukemia cell line, K562. Flow analysis with our seven antibodies showed these cell types have distinctive labeling patterns consistent with the known or inferred altered glycophorins presented on these cells. In most cases, variant alleles were expressed at normal levels.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 77, 5948-5952). The simplest hypothesis supporting all the available data is that Me2SO and other inducers elevate the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. We have now measured cytosolic Ca2+ using the fluorescent indicator quin-2, and find, contrary to expectation, a small decrease upon treatment of cells with Me2SO. Cytosolic Ca2+ was increased by raising the Ca2+ in the medium, but was not dramatically altered by addition of ouabain or monensin or by incubation in Na+-free medium. Measurement of total cell Ca2+ by a triple-labeling technique using 3H2O and 125I-albumin to determine cell water and extracellular space, respectively, revealed no significant change upon treatment with Me2SO for up to 40 h. A decrease in the initial rate of 45Ca2+ influx was observed in Me2SO-treated cells, when measured at 4 degrees C. These data do not support the hypothesis that an increase in cell Ca2+ is necessary for the induction of Friend cell differentiation or that Na+/Ca2+ exchange is a significant regulator of cytosolic Ca2+ in Friend cells.","['Faletto, D L', 'Macara, I G']","['Faletto DL', 'Macara IG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Aminoquinolines/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Calcium/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cold Temperature', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice']",1985/04/25 00:00,1985/04/25 00:01,['1985/04/25 00:00'],"['1985/04/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/25 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)89154-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1985 Apr 25;260(8):4884-9.,"['0 (Aminoquinolines)', 'O448IDK23O (Quin2)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,['ES-01247/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,

Methotrexate exerted a profound but apparently short-term effect on these parameters as it is prescribed in current maintenance schedules for childhood acute lymphatic leukaemia. A significant drop in lymphocyte count, affecting all subpopulations, was observed 4 h after oral or intramuscular administration of methotrexate which had reverted to pre-methotrexate values one week after the drug was given. Lymphocyte function was markedly affected, with a major decrease in mitogen responsiveness 1 h after methotrexate and a reversion to pre-methotrexate values by 48 h. A selectivity of suppressor T cells to methotrexate is proposed as being responsible for early recovery.

Although only a few cases were included, the RAEB-T group has a very poor outcome and appears much closer to FAB M2 in biologic behaviour than RAEB. Both the criteria for the FAB subtypes and the scoring system can be applied easily in each case of myelodysplasia. Of the 56 patients only 9 were still alive as of April, 1984. Eight of these were in the RA-S and RA categories (or using the scoring system grouping 7 were group 1).

The cell line that developed consisted of myeloblasts and promyelocytes characterized by light and scanning electron microscopy, cytochemistry, and enzymatic activities. The cells expressed Fc receptors and WT1 antigens but did not exhibit HLA-DR, HMA1, Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen, and surface Ig. The M20 cells produced colonies when cultured in semisolid medium and secreted lysozyme, prostaglandin E2, and interleukin 1. An attempt was also made to analyse the position of the M20 cells in the scheme of differentiation of the myelomonocytic lineage using different approaches. Treatment of the cells with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate induced their adherence to plastic surfaces and partial maturation to macrophages as judged by morphological criteria, cytochemistry, and enzyme activities. However, comparison of the M20 cells to other well-established myelomonoblastic cell lines did not reveal any pattern suggesting a possible relationship between surface markers, cell function, and differentiation pathway of the various cell lines tested. Establishment of additional cell lines and identification of new markers may assist in defining the mechanisms involved in normal differentiation and malignant transformation of this cell lineage.

The investigations involved three independent adaptations. The karyotype was analyzed by the G-banding method. Chromosome analysis of the in vitro cell populations was carried out as soon as they could be analyzed, i.e. immediately after they obtained stable growth in the culture. By comparing the karyotype of the in vivo parental cell line with that of the derivative sublines in vitro, it was found that only some karyotypic variants present in the heterogeneous original population in vivo were able to produce cell lineages. In some cases rapid overgrowth of the cell populations by newly formed karyotypic variants was observed. In all independently obtained sublines changes in the karyotype involved the same chromosomes, thus suggesting that these changes were non-random for the process of cell line establishment in the system investigated. The observed changes in the number of copies of chromosomes 9 and 15 in the cells from the culture seem to indicate that the ratio of the genes localized in these chromosomes may be important for the growth in perpetuation of the cells.","['Dowjat, K']",['Dowjat K'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol,European journal of cancer & clinical oncology,8112045,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Chromosome Banding', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia L1210/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0277-5379(85)90178-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol. 1985 Feb;21(2):233-42. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(85)90178-6.,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],,,,,
